The Two "Comes"

   (No. 1331)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 31, 1876,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say,
   Come! And let him who thirsts come. And whoever will, let him take the
   water of life freely." Revelation 22:17.

   OUR text stands at the end of the Bible even as this day stands at the
   end of the year--and it is full of Gospel even as we would make our
   closing Sabbath discourse. It would seem as if the Holy Spirit were
   loath to put down the pen while so many remained unbelieving,
   notwithstanding the testimony of the Inspired Word and, therefore,,
   before He closes the canon of Holy Scripture and guards it against all
   addition or mutilation, with most solemn words He gives one more full,
   free, earnest, gracious invitation to thirsty souls to come to Christ
   and drink! So on this last page of the year I would gladly write
   another Gospel invitation that those who have not, up to now, believed
   our report, may, even on this last day of the feast, incline their ears
   and accept the message of salvation!

   Before yet the midnight bell proclaims the birth of a new year, may you
   be born to God! At any rate, once more shall the Truth of God, by which
   men are regenerated, be lovingly brought under your attention. I ask
   those of you who have the Master's ear to put up this request to Him
   just now, that if the arrows have missed the mark on the previous 52
   Sabbaths, they may strike the target this time, being directed by the
   Divine Spirit. Pray, also, that if some have kept the door of their
   hearts fast closed against the Lord Jesus till now, He may, Himself,
   come in the preaching of the Word, this morning, and put in His hand by
   the hole of the door, that their hearts may be moved for Him.

   In answer to that prayer we shall be sure to get a blessing! Let us
   expect it and act upon the expectation and we shall see men flying to
   Jesus as a cloud, and as doves to their windows! Are not the Words of
   our text the Words of the Lord Jesus? Can they be regarded as the words
   of John? I think not, for they follow so closely upon the undoubted
   language of Jesus in the former verse. Thus runs the passage--"I,
   Jesus, have sent My angel to testify unto you these things in the
   churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the Bright and
   Morning Star. And the Spirit and the bride say, Come!"

   We can hardly, I think, divide the paragraph, and we must, it seems to
   me, regard our text as the Words of the risen Jesus, that Morning Star
   whose cheering beams foretell the glorious day! The lover of men's
   souls was not quite done speaking to sinners--there was a little more
   to say and here He says it. The Divine Redeemer, leaning from His
   Throne where He sits as the reward of His accomplished work, and
   bending over sinners with the same love which led Him to die for them,
   says, "Let him who hears say, Come! And let him who thirsts come. And
   whoever will, let him take the water of life freely."

   Looking at the words, therefore, in that golden light as coming from
   the dear lips of the Well-Beloved, let us notice first, the heavenward
   cry of prayer--"The Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who
   hears say, Come!" These voices go upward to Christ. Then, secondly, let
   us hear the earthward cry of invitation--"Let him who thirsts come. And
   whoever will, let him take the water of life freely." That cry goes
   outward and downward towards needy and sorrowing spirits. Then,
   thirdly, we shall pause awhile to notice the relation between these two
   cries, for the coming of Christ is connected with the coming of
   sinners. And then, as best we can, we shall observe and expect the
   response to the two cries--both from Him who sits in the heavens and
   from souls thirsting here below.

   O Divine Spirit, bless the Word!

   I. First, then, our text begins with THE HEAVENWARD CRY OF PRAYER, 'The
   Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him that hears say, Come!''" I
   think it will be evident, if you read carefully, that this cannot be
   interpreted as being only the voice of the Spirit and the bride to the
   sinner. Surely the sense requires us to regard this cry of, "Come!" as
   addressed to our Lord Jesus, who in a previous verse had been saying,
   "Behold I come quickly, and My reward is with

   Me." We may see the second included in it, but it will never do to
   exclude the first. We shall not have dealt honestly with the words
   before us unless we regard them, first, as spoken upwards towards our
   Lord whose coming is our great hope.

   The matter of this cry is first to be noticed--it is the coming of
   Christ. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!" This is, and always has
   been, the universal cry of the Church of Jesus Christ! There is no one
   common theory about the exact meaning of that coming, but there is one
   common desire for it, in some form or other. Some of us are expecting
   the bodily coming because the angel said, when the cloud concealed the
   rising Christ, "This same Jesus who is taken up from you into Heaven
   shall so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into Heaven." We
   therefore look for His descent upon the earth in Person, to be here,
   literally, among us.

   Some expect that when He comes it will be to reign upon the earth,
   making all things new and bringing to His people a glorious period of a
   thousand years in which there shall be perpetual Sabbath rest. Others
   think that when He comes He will come to judge the world and that the
   day of His appearing is rather to be regarded as the end of all things
   and the conclusion of this dispensation than as the commencement of the
   age of gold. There are some who think the millennium a dream and the
   coming of Christ in Person to be a mere fancy--they believe that He
   will come spiritually-- and they are looking for a time when the Gospel
   shall spread very wonderfully and there will be an extraordinary power
   about the ministrations of the Word. They believe that nations shall
   run to Him and be converted to His Truth.

   Now it would be very interesting to take up these various statements
   and speculations, but we do not want to do so, because, after all, in
   whatever way men look at it, all the true people of God still desire
   the coming of Christ, and so long as He draws near they are content!
   They may have, more or less light about the manner of it, but still the
   coming of Christ has been always, since the time when He departed, the
   great wish and desire, yes, and the agonizing prayer of the Church of
   God. "Even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus," is the cry of the whole host
   of the Lord's elect!

   It is true that some have not always desired this coming from motives
   of the most commendable kind. Many become more than ever earnest in
   this prayer when they have been in a state of disappointment and
   sorrow, but still, that which they desire is a right thing and a
   promised blessing to be given in its time. I suppose the trial of
   sorrow will always give a keener edge to the desire of Christ's coming.
   Luther, on one occasion, when much discouraged, said, "May the Lord
   come at once! Let Him cut the whole matter short with the Day of
   Judgment, for there is no amendment to be expected." When we get into
   this state of mind, the desire, though right in appearance, may not be
   quite as pure as we think.

   Desires and prayers which grow out of unbelief and insolence can hardly
   be of the very best order! Perhaps when we more patiently wait and
   quietly hope, we may not be quite so feverishly anxious for the speedy
   coming. And yet our state of mind may be more sober and more truly
   watchful and acceptable than when we showed more apparent eagerness.
   Waiting must sit side by side with desiring--patience must blend with
   hope. The Lord's, "quickly," may not be my, "quickly," and if so, let
   Him do what seems good to Him!

   It may be a better thing, after all, for our Lord to tarry a little
   longer, so that by a more lengthened conflict He may the better
   manifest the patience of the saints and the power of the eternal
   Spirit! It may be the Lord may linger yet a while, and if so, while the
   Church desires His speedy advent, she will not quarrel with her Master,
   nor dictate to Him, nor even wish to know the times and the seasons.
   "Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly," is her heart's inmost wish, but as
   for the details of His coming, she leaves them in His hands.

   Having noted the matter of the cry, let us next observe the persons
   crying. The Spirit is first mentioned--"The Spirit and the bride say,
   Come!" And why does the Holy Spirit desire the coming of the Lord
   Jesus? At present the Spirit is, so to speak, the vicegerent of this
   dispensation upon earth. Our Lord Jesus is gone into the heavens, for
   it was expedient for Him to go, but the Comforter, whom the Father has
   sent in His name, has taken His place as our Teacher and abides on
   earth continually as the Witness to the Truth of God and the Worker for
   it in the minds of men. But the Spirit of God is daily grieved during
   this season of long-suffering and conflict. How much He is provoked all
   the world over is not possible for us to know.

   The 40 years in the wilderness must have become as nothing compared
   with 19 centuries of rebellious generations! The ungodly vex Him, they
   reject His Testimony and resist His operations. And, alas, the saints
   grieve Him, too. You and I have, I fear, grieved Him often during the
   past year and so He desires the end of this evil estate and says to our
   Lord Jesus, "Come!" Beside, the Spirit's great objective and desire is
   to glorify Christ, even as our Lord says, "He shall glorify Me, for He
   shall take of Mine and show them unto you."

   Now, as the coming of Christ will be the full manifestation of the
   Redeemer's Glory, the Spirit, therefore, desires that He may come and
   take to Himself His great power and reign. The Holy Spirit seals us
   "unto the day of redemption," having ever an eye to that great event.
   His work tends towards its completion in the day of the appearing of
   the sons of God. He "is the Earnest of our inheritance till the
   redemption of the purchased possession." Therefore does the Spirit have
   sympathy in the groans of His saints for the glorious appearing--and it
   is especially in this connection that He is described as helping our
   infirmities and making intercession for us with groans which cannot be
   uttered. In this sense the Spirit says, "Come!" Indeed, all such cries
   of, "Come!" in this world are of His prompting!

   Our text, next, tells us that "the bride says, Come!" We all know that
   the bride is the Church, but perhaps we have not noticed the
   peculiarity of her name. It is not, "the Spirit and the Church say,
   Come!" But, "the Spirit and the bride," for she says, "Come!" always
   more fervently when she realizes her near and dear relationship to her
   Lord and all that it involves. Now, a bride is one whose marriage is
   near, either as having just happened or as close at hand. She is far
   more than merely engaged--either she is married or about to
   be--although the actual marriage feast may not have been celebrated
   yet. So is the Church very nearly arrived at the grand hour when it
   shall be said, "The marriage of the Lamb is come and His bride has made
   herself ready." And because of that, she is full of joy at the prospect
   of hearing the cry, "Behold, the Bridegroom comes!"

   Who marvels that it is so? It would be unnatural if there were no
   desire on the part of the Church to see her Beloved Lord and Head. Is
   it not as it should be, when the bride says, "Come!"? I wish to call
   your attention to the fact that while I have made two of the persons
   mentioned in the text for the purpose of discoursing upon them in due
   order, yet they are not divided in the passage before us. It does not
   say the Spirit says, "Come!" and the bride says, "Come!" but, "the
   Spirit and the bride say, Come!" That is to say, the Spirit of God
   speaks by the Church when He cries, "Come!" And the Church cries unto
   Christ for His coming because she is moved of the Holy Spirit!

   True prayer is always a joint work--the Holy Spirit within us writes
   acceptable desires upon our hearts and then we present them! The Holy
   Spirit does not plead apart from our desiring and believing--we must,
   ourselves, desire and will and plead and agonize because the Spirit of
   God works in us so to will and to do. We plead with God because we are
   prompted and guided by His Holy Spirit! Our pleadings, which go up to
   Heaven for the advent of Jesus, are the Holy Spirit crying in the
   hearts of the blood-bought! The Church, herself, prays in the Holy
   Spirit, instantly crying day and night for the fulfillment of the
   greatest of all the Covenant promises--

   Come, Lord, and tarry not! Bring the long looked-for day! Oh, why these
   years of waiting here, These ages of delay? Come, for Your saints still
   wait! Daily ascends their sigh. The Spirit and the bride say, Come! Do
   You not hear the cry?"

   The next clause of the text indicates that each separate Believer
   should breathe the same desire, "Let Him that hears say, Come!"
   Brethren, this will be the index of your belonging to the bride! This
   is the token of your sharing in the one Spirit and being joined unto
   the one body--if you unite with the Spirit and the bride in saying,
   "Come!" No ungodly man truly desires Christ's coming. On the contrary,
   he desires to get away from Him and forget His very existence! To
   delight in drawing near unto the Lord Jesus Christ is an evidence of
   our election and calling. To wish more and more fully to know Him and
   to dwell more near to Him is the token of our having been reconciled
   unto God by His death and of our having a new nature implanted in us!

   To long to see Jesus Christ manifested in fullness of His Glory is the
   ensign of a true soldier of the Cross. Do you feel this? Do you desire
   to be better acquainted with the Lord Jesus? You have heard the
   Gospel--do you say, as the Church does, "Come, Lord Jesus"? Alas, to
   many, the Day of the Lord will be darkness and not light! They cannot
   desire it, for it will be a day of terror and confusion to them! But
   unto such as have heard and believed in the precious name of the Son of
   God, it will be joy and peace and, therefore,, the cry of their heart
   is, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus!" This utterance of "Come!" by him that
   hears it, is the mark of his joyful consent to the fact that Christ
   shall come!

   It is well, my Friend, if when you hear that Christ will come, you say,
   "Let Him come." If He comes to reign, let Him, for, blessed be His
   name, who should reign but He? If He descends to judge the earth, let
   Him come, for we shall be justified at His bar! His ends and objectives
   in coming cannot but be loaded with infinite benefit to us and Glory to
   our God and, therefore,, we would not delay His chariot wheels by so
   much as an hour--

   "Hasten Lord, the promised hour! Come in Glory and in power! Still Your
   foes are not subdued-- Nature sighs to be renewed. Time has nearly
   reached its sum, All things with Your bride, say, 'Come!' Jesus, whom
   all worlds adore, Come and reign forevermore!"

   The saying of, "Come!" by each true hearer is the sign that his heart
   responds to the doctrine which he has been taught. We have received it
   by Revelation that Christ is to come and our souls say, "Even so, Come
   Lord Jesus! It is our happiness that it should be so."

   Thus have we mentioned the persons by whom this cry is uttered and now
   let us add a word upon the tense in which the cry is put. It is in the
   present tense. "The Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who
   hears say, Come!" The Spirit and the bride are anxious that Christ
   should come at once. And he that knows Christ and loves Him desires,
   also, that He should not tarry. Look, my Brothers and Sisters, is it
   not time, as far as our poor judgments go, that Jesus should come? See
   how iniquity abounds! Behold our very streets, how foul they are with
   sin! See how errors are multiplied--do they not swarm in the Church of
   God, itself? Have not heresies come down like birds of prey upon the
   sacrifice, to pollute even the altars of the Most High?

   See at this present time how skeptics defy the living God! They hiss
   out from between their teeth the question, "Where is the promise of His
   coming, for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they
   were?" Behold how Antichrist stalks boldly through the land!
   Superstitions which your fathers could not bear are, again, set up
   among you! The graven images, crosses, crucifixes and sacraments--many
   gods and many lords of old Rome have come back to England--and they are
   worshipped in her national Church! In England, stained with the blood
   of martyrs, once again the mark of the Beast is to be seen on the
   foreheads of those whom she feeds to teach her people! Is it not time
   that the Lord should come?

   O hoary systems of superstition, what else can shake you from your
   thrones! O gods that have long ruled over superstitious minds, who else
   can hurl you to the moles and to the bats? You know Him who made you
   quiver on your thrones on that night when He was born in Bethlehem's
   manger and you may well tremble, for when He comes it will be with an
   iron rod to dash you into shivers! "Even so," we cry, "Come, Lord
   Jesus! Come quickly! Amen."

   II. Now, secondly, let us listen to THE EARTHWARD CRY OF INVITATION TO
   MEN. I must confess I cannot

   quite tell you how it is that the sense in my text glides away from the
   coming of Christ to the earth into the coming of sinners to Christ, but
   it does! Like colors which blend, or strains of music which melt into
   each other, so the first sense slides into the second. This almost
   insensible transition seems, to me, to have been occasioned by the
   memory of the fact that the coming of Christ is not desirable to all
   mankind.

   There are the unbelievers who have not obeyed Him and when they hear
   the Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" straightway they begin to tremble
   and they say within themselves, "What if He should come! Alas, we
   rejected Him and His coming will be our destruction." I think I hear
   some such sinners weeping and wailing at the very thought of the Lord's
   coming, for they know that they, also, who have pierced Him must behold
   Him and weep because of Him! It seems almost cruel on the part of the
   bride and the Spirit to be saying, "Come!" when that coming must be for
   the overthrow of all the adversaries of the Lord!

   And so Jesus, Himself, seems gently to turn aside the prayer of His
   people while He pleads with the needy ones. He lets the prayer flow
   towards Himself, but yet directs its flow towards you sinners, also.
   He, Himself, seems to say, "You bid Me come, but I, as the Savior of
   men, look at your brothers and your sisters who are yet in the far
   country, the other sheep which are not yet of the fold, whom I, also,
   must bring in. And in answer to your cry to Me to come I speak to those

   wandering ones, and say, 'Let him who thirsts come. And whoever will,
   let him take the water of life freely.'" Is not that the way in which
   the sense glides from its first direction?

   Now, from whom does this cry arise? It first comes from Jesus. It is He
   who says, "Let him who thirsts come." The passage so stands, as I have
   already said, that we cannot but believe this verse to have been the
   utterance of Him who is the Root and Offspring of David, and the Bright
   and Morning Star. He, out of Heaven, cries to the unconverted, "Let him
   who thirsts come." Will they refuse Him that speaks? Shall Jesus,
   Himself, invite them and will they turn a deaf ear? But next, it is the
   call of the Spirit of God. The Spirit says, "Come!" This Book which He
   has written, on every page says to men, "Come! Come to Jesus!" This is
   the cry of the Spirit in the preaching of the Word.

   What do sermons and discourses mean but, "Come Sinner, come!"? And
   those secret motions of power upon the conscience. Those times when the
   heart grows calm, even amid dissipation, and thought is forced upon the
   mind--those are the movements of the Spirit of God by which He is
   showing man his danger and revealing to him his Refuge--and so is
   saying, "Come!" All over the world, wherever there is a Bible and a
   preacher, the Spirit is saying, "Come!" And this is the speech of the
   Church, too, in conjunction with the Spirit, for the Spirit speaks with
   the bride and the bride speaks by the Spirit.

   The Church is always saying, "Come!" This is, indeed, the meaning of
   her Sabbath gatherings, of her testimony in the pulpit, of her teaching
   in the schools, of her prayers and her exhortations. Everywhere, poor
   wandering Hearts, the Church of God is saying to you, "Come!" Or if she
   does not do so, she is not acting in her true character as the bride of
   Christ. For this purpose is there a Church in the world! If it were not
   for this, our Lord might take His people Home as soon as they have
   believed, but they are kept here to be a seed to keep the Truth of God
   alive in the world. And their daily earnest cry to you is, "Come, come
   to Jesus!" "The Spirit and the bride say, Come!"

   The next giver of the invitation is spoken of as, "Him that hears." If
   you have had an ear to hear and have heard the Gospel to your own
   salvation, the very next thing you have to do is to say to those around
   you, "Come!" Go and speak to anybody that you meet! Speak to everybody
   that you meet according as opportunity and occasion shall be given you!
   And say what all the Church says and what the Spirit is saying--namely,
   "Come!" Give your Master's invitation! Distribute the testimony of His
   loving will and bid poor sinners come to Jesus! Your children and your
   servants--bid them come! Your neighbors and your Friends--bid them
   come! The strangers and the far-off ones--bid them come! The harlot and
   the thief--bid such come! Those that are in the highways and the
   hedges! Those who are far off from God by abominable works--say unto
   all these--"Come!"

   Because you have heard the message and proved its truth, go and call in
   others to the feast of love! Oh, if there were more of these individual
   proclaimers, what blessings would descend upon London! I do not know
   how many Believers in Christ there are present here, but I do know that
   there are 5,000 of us associated in Church fellowship at this
   Tabernacle. And if the whole of these 5,000 would but begin to bear
   witness for Christ with all their might, there would be salt enough
   even within this one Tabernacle to season all London, with God's
   blessing upon our efforts! My Brothers and Sisters, let us not be slow
   to address ourselves to those to whom the Spirit of God within us, the
   voice of Jesus from above and the cry of the whole Church is addressed!
   Let each individual member take up the note of invitation till all
   around, the trembling Sinner hears the encouraging cry of, "Come!"

   Now, notice the remarkably encouraging character of this, "Come!" which
   is given by the Spirit of the bride. One part of it is directed to the
   thirsty--"Let him who thirsts come." By thirst is meant necessity and
   an appetite for its supply. Do you feel yourself guilty, and do you
   desire pardon?--you are a thirsty one! Are you disquieted and filled
   with unrest, and do you long to be pacified in heart?--you are a
   thirsty one! Is there a something, you know not, perhaps, what it is,
   for which you are sighing, and crying and pining? You are a thirsty one
   and to you is the invitation most positively and distinctly given, "Let
   him who thirsts come."

   But how much I rejoice that the second half of the invitation does not
   contain even an apparent limit, as this first sentence has been thought
   to do! I regard the thirst here mentioned as by no means requiring of
   any man that he should have gone through a process of horror on account
   of guilt, or should have been overwhelmed with conviction and driven to
   despair of salvation. I believe that any desire and any longing will
   come under the description of, "thirst." But since some have stumbled
   at it and have said again and again, "I feel I do not thirst enough,"
   see how sweetly the second clause of our text puts it--"Whoever will,
   let him take the water of life freely."

   Whether you are thirsty or not, yet have you a will to drink? Have you
   a will to be saved? Have you a will to be cleansed from sin? A will to
   be made a new creature in Christ Jesus? Do you will to have eternal
   life? Then thus says the Spirit to you, "Whoever will, let him take the
   water of life freely." Now, notice three vast doors through which the
   biggest and most elephantine sinner that ever made the earth shake
   beneath the weight of his guilt may go. Here are the

   three doors. "Whoever"--"Will"--"Freely."

   "Whoever" is the first door. "Whoever"--then what man dares have the
   impudence to say that he is shut out? If you say that you cannot come
   in under, "whoever," I ask you how you dare narrow a word which is, in
   itself, so broad, so infinite? "Whoever"--that must mean every man that
   ever lived or ever shall live while yet he is here and wills to come!
   Well, then, the word, "will." There is nothing about past character,
   nor present character. There is nothing about knowledge, or feeling,
   nor anything else but the will--"Whoever will." Speak of the gate
   standing ajar! This looks to me like taking the door right off the
   hinges and carrying it away!

   "Whoever will." There is no hindrance whatever in your way. And then,
   "freely." God's gifts are given without any expectation or recompense,
   or any requirements and conditions--"Let him take the water of life
   freely." You have not to bring your good feelings, or good desires, or
   good works--just come and take freely what God gives you for nothing!
   You are not even to bring repentance and faith in order to obtain
   Divine Grace--you are to come and accept repentance and faith as the
   gifts of God and the work of the Holy Spirit. What broad gates of mercy
   these are! How wide the entrance which Love has prepared for coming
   souls! "Whoever!" "Will!" "Freely!"

   Observe how the invitation sums up the work the sinner is called upon
   to do. First, he is bid to come. "Whoever will, let him come." Now, to
   come to Christ means simply for the soul to draw near to Him by
   trusting Him. You are not asked to bring a load with you, nor to work
   for Christ in order to earn salvation, but just to come to Him. Nothing
   is said about the style of coming--come running or creeping, come
   boldly or timidly--for if you do but come to Jesus, He will in no wise
   cast you out. A simple reliance upon the Lord Jesus is the one
   essential for eternal life!

   Then the next direction is, "take." "Whoever will, let him take." That
   is all. That word, "take," is a grand word to express the Gospel. The
   world's gospel is, "bring." Christ's Gospel is, "take." Nature's gospel
   is, "make." Just change the letter and you have the Gospel of Divine
   Grace which is, "take." There is the water, dear Friends! You have not
   to dig a well to find it--you have only to take it. There is the bread
   of Heaven, you have not to grind the flour or bake the loaf, you have
   only to take it. There is a garment woven from the top throughout and
   without a seam--you have not to add a fringe to it--you have only to
   take it!

   The way of salvation may be summed up in the four letters of the word,
   "take." Do you desire Christ? Take Him. Do you need pardon? Take it. Do
   you need a new heart? Take it. Do you want peace on earth? Take it. Do
   you want Heaven hereafter? Take it--that is all. "Whoever will, let him
   take the water of life freely." And there is one other word which I
   love to dwell on, and it comes twice over, "Let him who thirsts come,
   and whoever will let him take." It is graciously said, let him. It
   seems to me as if the Lord Jesus Christ saw a poor soul standing
   thirsty at the flowing crystal fountain of His Love and the devil,
   standing there, whispered to him, "You see the sacred stream, but it
   flows for others. It is what you need, but you must not have it, it is
   not for you."

   Listen! There is a voice from beyond the clouds which cries aloud, "Let
   him take it!" Stand back, Satan, let the willing one come! He is
   putting down his lips to drink--he understands, now--but there comes
   rushing upon him hosts of his old sins, like so many winged bats, and
   they scream out to him, "Go back! You must not draw near! This fountain
   is not for you--this pure crystal stream must not be defiled by such
   leprous lips as yours!" Again there comes from the Throne of Love this
   blessed password, "Let him come and let him take."

   It is as when a man is in court and is called to go into the witness
   box. He is standing in the crowd and his name is called. What happens?
   As soon as he hears his name he begins to push through the throng to
   reach his place. "What are you doing?" asks one. "I am called," he
   says. "Stand back! Why do you push so?" asks another. "I am called by
   the Judge," he says. A big policeman demands, "Why are you making such
   confusion in court?" "But," says the man, "I am called. My name was
   called out and I must come."

   If he cannot come. If it is not possible for him to get through the
   throng, one of the authorities calls out, "Make way for that man--he is
   summoned by the court. Officers, clear a passage and let him come." Now
   the Lord Jesus calls the thirsty one and He says, "Whoever will, let
   him come!" Make way, doubts! Make way, sins! Make way, fears! Make way,

   devils! Make way, all of you, for Jesus Christ, the great King and
   Judge of all has said, "Let him come!" Who shall hinder when Jesus
   permits? He who is divinely called shall surely come to Jesus! Come he
   shall, regardless of whomever may stand in his way!

   This morning I feel as if I could come to Jesus all over again and I
   will do so! Do you not feel the same, my Beloved Brothers and Sisters?
   Well then, dear Brothers and Sisters, after you have done so, turn
   round and proclaim this precious Gospel invitation to all around you!
   Say to them, "Come and take the water of life freely!"

   III. The third point is THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO COMINGS. Is
   there any relation between the coming of Christ from Heaven to earth,
   and the coming of poor sinful creatures to Christ and trusting Him?
   There is this relation, first, that they are both suggested in this
   passage by the closing of the Scriptural Canon. John is about to write,
   by the voice of the Lord, that none are to add to or take from the
   completed Book of God. The Church says, "If there are no more Prophets
   to proclaim the mind of God, no more Apostles to write with infallible
   authority and no more instructors to give forth new revelations, or
   bring new promises, then it only remains that the Lord should come.

   "Then," she says, "Come, Lord Jesus!" And here are the sinners standing
   round and they hear that no other Gospel is to be expected, no more
   revelations are to be added to those which are in this Bible. They hear
   there will be no other Atonement, no other way of salvation. Therefore
   it is their wisdom to come at once to Jesus! It is because the Book was
   about to receive its finis that the Spirit and the bride unitedly cried
   to the sinners to come at once! No fresh Gospel is to be expected,
   therefore let them come at once! Why should they tarry any longer? The
   oxen and fatlings are killed, come to the supper! All things are ready,
   there is nothing more to be done or to be revealed! Upon us the ends of
   the earth have come. "It is finished" has rung through earth and
   Heaven, therefore--

   "Come and welcome, Sinner, come!"

   I think I perceive another connection, namely, that those people who,
   in very truth love Christ enough to cry to Him continually to come, are
   sure to love sinners, also, and to say to them, "Come!" Not that there
   are not some who talk a great deal about Christ's coming and yet
   manifest but small care for other men's souls. Well, it is talk--the
   profession of looking for the Second Advent is nothing but talk when it
   does not lead people to cry to perishing men, "Come to Christ!" He who
   loves Christ so very much that he is quite wrapped up in himself and
   forgets the dying millions around him. He who stands star-gazing into
   Heaven, expecting to see a sudden Glory to take himself away does not
   understand what he says! For if he really loved his Lord, he would set
   to work for Him and would show that he expected the King to come by
   endeavoring to extend His kingdom!

   There is this connection, also, that before Christ comes a certain
   number of His elect must be gathered in. He shall not come until an
   appointed company shall have been brought to eternal life by the
   preaching of the Word. Oh then, Brothers and Sisters, it is ours to
   labor that the wanderers may come home, for so we are, as far as lies
   in us, hastening the time when our Beloved, Himself, shall come! Once
   more, there is a sort of coming of Christ which, though it is not the
   first meaning here, may be included in it, for it touches the center of
   the sinner's coming to Christ. Because, Brethren, when we cry, "Come,
   Lord Jesus!" if He shall answer us by giving us of His Spirit more
   fully, so that He comes to us spiritually, then penitent souls will
   assuredly be brought to His feet.

   We know this, that wherever the Lord, Himself, is in a meeting, hearts
   are sure to be broken and repentance is certain to be manifested!
   Wherever Jesus Christ is in power, there must be a revival, for dead
   souls must come to life in Him. The great thing we need above all
   others is a grip of that glorious promise, "Lo, I am with you always,
   even to the end of the world," and as we, in this sense, obtain the
   coming of the Lord, we shall see sinners come and take of the water of
   life freely!

   IV. Well then, lastly, WHAT ARE THE RESPONSES? We sent up a cry to
   Heaven and said, "Come!" The response is, "Behold, I come quickly."
   That is eminently satisfactory. You may have to wait awhile, but the
   cry is heard and if the Lord should not come in your lifetime, the same
   preparation of heart which made you look for His coming will be
   blessedly useful to you if He sends His messenger to take you Home by
   death. The same waiting and watching will answer in either case, so you
   need not be under any distress about which of the two shall happen!

   Christ will descend to earth as surely as He ascended to Heaven! And
   when He comes there will be victory to the right and to the true--and
   His saints shall reign with Him! And now concerning this other cry of,
   "Come!"--we ask sinners to come. We have asked them in a fourfold
   voice--Jesus, the Spirit, the bride, and him that hears--they have all
   said,

   "Come!" Will they come? Brothers and Sisters, it is a question which I
   cannot answer. You must not ask me, for I do not know! You had better
   ask the persons, themselves! They are of age, ask them. Take care that
   you ask them before they get out of the Tabernacle this morning! They
   know and, therefore,, they can tell you whether they mean to come or
   not.

   This I will say to them--my dear Friends, I trust that this last day of
   the year may be, to you, a day of mercy! The Jews had a Feast of
   Ingatherings at the end of the year and I earnestly pray that we may
   have a gathering in of precious souls to Christ before the year quite
   runs out--that would be a grand finish to this year of Grace and a
   sweet encouragement for the future! But suppose you do not come. Well,
   you have been invited. If a Christmas feast is provided for the poor
   and a number of beggars are standing shivering outside in the sleet and
   snow, but will not come in, though earnestly bid, we say, "Well, you
   have been invited. What more do you need?"

   Remember, also, that you have been invited very earnestly. The Spirit,
   the bride and him that hears--and Jesus, Himself--they have all said to
   you, "Come!" I am as the man that hears and I have said, "Come!" I do
   not know how to say it more earnestly than I have said it. Oh, how
   would my soul delight if everyone here came to Christ at this moment! I
   would ask no greater joy out of Heaven to crown this year with! You are
   invited and you are earnestly invited--what more do you need? If you
   never come, you will have this thought to haunt you forever--"I was
   invited and pressed again and again, but I would not come."

   I want you to remember, too, that you are called to come now, at once!
   You may not be bid to come tomorrow for several reasons. You may not be
   alive, or there may be no earnest person near to invite you. Can there
   be a better day than today? You have always said, "Tomorrow," yet where
   are you now? Not a bit closer, some of you, than you were 10 years ago!
   Do you remember that sermon when you were made to tremble so and you
   said, "Please God, if I get out of this, I will seek Your face"? But
   you postponed it and are you any closer now?

   You remember the story of the country man who would not cross the river
   just yet, but sat down and said he would wait until all the water had
   gone by? He waited a long time in vain and he might have waited
   forever, for rivers are always flowing. You, too, are waiting till a
   more convenient season shall come and all the difficulties shall have
   gone by. Forget about such supreme folly! There will always be
   difficulty! The river will always flow! O man, be wise! Plunge into it
   and swim across! Now is the accepted time and now is the day of
   salvation!

   Oh that you would believe in Jesus Christ! May His Spirit lead you to
   do so now!--

   Only trust Him! Only trust Him! Only trust Him now! He will save you!
   He will save you! He will save you now!" Cast yourselves upon the blood
   and merits of the Lord Jesus and the great work is done! The Lord help
   you to do so. Amen.

Our Urgent Need of the Holy Spirit

   (No. 1332)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S DAY MORNING, JANUARY 7, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Through the po wer of the Holy Spirit." Romans 15:13.

   "By the power of the Spirit of God." Romans 15:19.

   I DESIRE to draw your attention, at this time, to the great necessity
   which exists for the continual manifestation of the power of the Holy
   Spirit in the Church of God if by her means the multitudes are to be
   gathered to the Lord Jesus. I did not know how I could much better do
   so than by first showing that the Spirit of God is necessary to the
   Church of God for its own internal growth in Grace. Hence my text in
   the 13th verse, "Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
   believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy
   Spirit"--where it is evident that the Apostle attributes the power to
   be filled with joy and peace in believing, and the power to abound in
   hope, to the Holy Spirit.

   But then, I also wanted to show you that the power of the Church
   outside, that with which she is to be aggressive and work upon the
   world for the gathering out of God's elect from among men, is also this
   same energy of the Holy Spirit. Hence I have taken the 19th verse, for
   the Apostle there says that God had through him made "the Gentiles
   obedient by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the
   power of the Spirit of God." So you see, dear Friends, that first of
   all, to keep the Church happy and holy within herself there must be a
   manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit. And secondly, that the
   Church may invade the territories of the enemy and may conquer the
   world for Christ, but she must be clothed with the same sacred energy.

   We may, then, go further and say that the power of the Church for
   external work will be proportionate to the power which dwells within
   her. Gauge the energy of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of Believers and
   you may fairly calculate their influence upon unbelievers. Only let the
   Church be illuminated by the Holy Spirit and she will reflect the light
   and become to onlookers "fair as the moon, clear as the sun and
   terrible as an army with banners." Let us, by two or three
   illustrations, show that the outward work must always depend upon the
   inward force.

   On a cold winter's day when the snow has fallen and lies deep upon the
   ground, you go through a village. There is a row of cottages and you
   will notice that from one of the roofs the snow has nearly disappeared,
   while another cottage still bears a coating of snow. You do not stay to
   make enquiries as to the reason of the difference, for you know very
   well what is the cause. There is a fire burning inside the one cottage
   and the warmth glows through its roof, and so the snow speedily melts.
   In the other there is no tenant--it is a house to let and no fire burns
   on its hearth and no warm smoke ascends the chimney--therefore there
   lies the snow. Just as the warmth is inside so the melting will be
   outside.

   I look at a number of Churches and where I see worldliness and
   formalism lying thick upon them, I am absolutely certain that there is
   not the warmth of Christian life within. But where the hearts of
   Believers are warm with Divine Love through the Spirit of God, we are
   sure to see evils vanish and beneficial consequences following. We need
   not look within--in such a case the exterior is sufficient index. Take
   an illustration from political life. Here is a trouble arising between
   different nations. There are angry spirits stirring and it seems very
   likely that the Gordian knot of difficulty will never be untied by
   diplomacy, but will need to be cut with the sword.

   Everybody knows that one of the hopes of peace lies in the bankrupt
   condition of the nation which is likely to go to war, for if it is
   short of supplies, if it cannot pay its debts, if it cannot furnish the
   material for war, then it will not be likely to court a conflict. A
   country must be strong in internal resources before it can wisely
   venture upon foreign wars. Thus is it in the great battle of the Truth
   of God--a poor starving Church cannot combat the devil and his armies.

   Unless the Church is, herself, rich in the things of God and strong
   with Divine energy, she will generally cease to be aggressive and will
   content herself with going on with the regular routine of Christian
   work, crying, "Peace! Peace!" where peace should not be.

   She will not dare to defy the world, or to send forth her legions to
   conquer its provinces for Christ when her own condition is pitiably
   weak. The strength or weakness of a nation's money supply affects its
   army in its every march. And in like manner, its measure of Grace
   influences the Church of God in all its actions. Suffer yet another
   illustration. If you lived in Egypt you would notice, once each year,
   the Nile rising. And you would watch its increase with anxiety, because
   the extent of the overflow of the Nile is very much the measure of the
   fertility of Egypt. Now the rising of the Nile must depend upon those
   far-off lakes in the center of Africa--whether they shall be well
   filled with the melting of the snows or not. If there is a scanty
   supply in the higher reservoirs, there cannot be much overflow into the
   Nile in its after-course through Egypt.

   Let us translate the figure and say that, if the upper lakes of
   fellowship with God in the Christian Church are not well filled--if the
   soul's spiritual strength is not sustained by private prayer and
   communion with God--the Nile of practical Christian service will never
   rise to the flood. The one thing I want to say is this--you cannot get
   out of the Church what is not in it. The reservoir must be filled
   before it can pour forth a stream. We must, ourselves, drink of the
   living water till we are full--and then out of the midst of us shall
   flow rivers of living water--but not till then. Out of an empty basket
   you cannot distribute loaves and fishes, however hungry the crowd may
   be. Out of an empty heart you cannot speak full things, nor from a lean
   soul bring forth fat things full of marrow which shall feed the people
   of God.

   Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks, when it speaks to
   edification at all. So the first thing is to look well to home affairs
   and pray that God would bless us and cause His face to shine upon us,
   that His way may be known upon earth and His saving health among all
   people--

   "To bless Your chosen race, In mercy, Lord, incline, And cause the
   brightness of Your face On all Your saints to shine. That so Your
   wondrous way May through the world be known; While distant lands their
   tribute pay, And Your salvation own."

   This morning, in trying to speak of the great necessity of the Church,
   namely, her being moved vigorously by the power of the Holy Spirit, I
   earnestly pray that we may enter upon this subject with the deepest
   conceivable reverence. Let us adore while we are meditating! Let us
   feel the condescension of this blessed Person of the Godhead in
   deigning to dwell in His people and to work in the human heart! Let us
   remember that this Divine Person is very sensitive. He is a jealous

   God.

   We read of His being grieved and vexed and, therefore,, let us ask His
   forgiveness of the many provocations which He must have received from
   our hands. With lowly awe let us bow before Him, remembering that if
   there is a sin which is unpardonable, it has a reference to Him--the
   sin against the Holy Spirit which shall never be forgiven--neither in
   this world nor in that which is to come. In reference to the Holy
   Spirit we stand on very tender ground, indeed. And if ever we should
   veil our faces and rejoice with trembling, it is while we speak of the
   Spirit and of those mysterious works with which He blesses us.

   In that lowly spirit and under the Divine overshadowing, follow me
   while I set before you seven works of the Holy Spirit which are most
   necessary to the Church--for its own good and equally necessary to her
   in her office of missionary from Christ to the outside world.

   I. To begin, then, the power of the Holy Spirit is manifested in the
   QUICKENING of souls to spiritual life. All the spiritual life which
   exists in this world is the creation of the Holy Spirit, by whom the
   Lord Jesus quickens whomever He wills. You and I had not life enough to
   know our death till He visited us! We had not light enough to perceive
   that we were in darkness, nor sense enough to feel our misery! We were
   so utterly abandoned to our own folly that, though we were naked, poor
   and miserable, we dreamed that we were rich and increased in goods! We
   were under sentence of death as condemned criminals and yet we talked
   about merit and reward!

   Yes, we were dead and yet we boasted that we were alive--counting our
   very death to be our life! The Spirit of God, in infinite mercy, came
   to us with His mysterious power and made us live. The first token of
   life was a consciousness of our being in the realm of death and an
   agony to escape from it. We began to perceive our insensibility and, if
   I may be pardoned such an expression, we saw our blindness. Every
   growth of spiritual life, from the first tender shoot until now, has
   also been the work of the Holy Spirit.

   As the green blade was His production, so is the ripening corn! The
   increase of life, as much life as there is at the beginning, must still
   come by the operation of the Spirit of God who raised up Christ from
   the dead. You will never have more life, Brothers and Sisters, unless
   the Holy Spirit bestows it upon you. Yes, you will not even know that
   you need more, nor groan after more, unless He works in you to desire
   and to agonize according to His own good pleasure. See, then, our
   absolute dependence upon the Holy Spirit! If He were gone, we should
   relapse into spiritual death and the Church would become a morgue!

   The Holy Spirit is absolutely necessary to make everything that we do
   to be alive. We are sowers, Brothers and Sisters, but if we take dead
   seed in our seed baskets there will never be a harvest! The preacher
   must preach living Truths of God in a living manner if he expects to
   obtain a hundred-fold harvest. Too much of Church work is nothing
   better than the movement of a galvanized corpse! Too much of religion
   is done as if it were performed by a robot, or ground off by machinery.
   Nowadays men care little about heart and soul--they only look at
   outward performances. Why, I hear they have now invented a machine
   which talks, though surely there was talk enough without this Parisian
   addition to the band of prattlers!

   We can preach as machines, we can pray as machines and we can teach
   Sunday school as machines. Men can give mechanically and come to the
   Lord's Table mechanically--yes, and we, ourselves, shall do so unless
   the Spirit of God is with us! Most hearers know what it is to hear a
   live sermon which quivers all over with fullness of energy. You also
   know what it is to sing a hymn in a lively manner and you know what it
   is to unite in a live Prayer Meeting! But, ah, if the Spirit of God is
   absent, all that the Church does will be lifeless! It will be as the
   rustle of leaves above a tomb, the gliding of specters, the
   congregation of the dead turning over in their graves!

   As the Spirit of God is the Quickener to make us alive and our work
   alive, so must He specially be with us to make those alive with whom we
   have to deal for Jesus. Imagine a dead preacher preaching a dead sermon
   to dead sinners-- what can possibly come of it? Here is a beautiful
   essay which has been admirably elaborated and it is coldly read to the
   cold-hearted sinner. It smells of the midnight oil but it has no
   heavenly unction, no Divine power resting upon it, nor, perhaps, is
   that power even looked for! What good can come of such a production? As
   well may you try to calm the tempest with poetry or stay the hurricane
   with rhetoric as to bless a soul by mere learning and eloquence!

   It is only as the Spirit of God shall come upon God's servant and shall
   make the Word which He preaches to drop as a living seed into the
   heart, that any result can follow his ministry! And it is only as the
   Spirit of God shall then follow that seed and keep it alive in the soul
   of the listener that we can expect those who profess to be converted to
   take root and grow to maturity of Grace and become our sheaves at the
   last! We are utterly dependent here and, for my part, I rejoice in this
   absolute dependence!

   If I could have a stock of power to save souls which would be all my
   own, apart from the Spirit of God, I cannot suppose greater temptation
   to pride and to living at a distance from God! It is well to be weak in
   self and better, still, to be nothing--to simply be the pen in the hand
   of the Spirit of God--unable to write a single letter upon the tablets
   of the human heart except as the hand of the Holy Spirit shall use us
   for that propose. That is really our position and we ought practically
   to take it up! And doing so, we shall continually cry to the Spirit of
   God to quicken us in all things and quicken all that we do--and quicken
   the Word as it drops into the sinner's ears.

   I am quite certain that a Church which is devoid of life cannot be the
   means of life-giving to the dead sinners around it. No! Everything acts
   after its kind and we must have a living Church for living work! O that
   God would quicken every member of this Church! "What," you ask, "do you
   think some of us are not alive unto God?" Brothers and Sisters, there
   are some of you, concerning whom I am certain, as far as one can judge
   of another, that you have life, for we can see it in all that you do!
   But there are some others of you, concerning whose spiritual life one
   has to exercise a good deal of faith and a great deal more charity, for
   we do not perceive in you much activity in God's cause, nor care for
   the souls of others,

   nor zeal for the Divine Glory! If we do not see any fruits, what can we
   do but earnestly pray that you may not turn out to be barren trees?

   That is the first point and we think it is as clear as possible that we
   must have the quickening power of the Spirit for ourselves if we are to
   be the means in the hand of God of awakening dead souls.

   II. Next, it is one of the peculiar offices of the Holy Spirit to
   ENLIGHTEN His people. He has done so by giving us His Word which He has
   inspired. But the Bible, inspired though it is, is never spiritually
   understood by any man apart from the personal teaching of its great
   Author. You may read it as much as you will and never discover the
   inner and vital sense unless your soul shall be led into it by the Holy
   Spirit Himself!

   "What?" says one, "I have learned the Shorter Catechism and I have got
   the creed memorized by heart, and yet do I know nothing?" I answer, you
   have done well to learn the letter of the Truth of God, but you still
   need the Spirit of God to make it the light and power of God to your
   soul! The letter you may know, and know it better than some who know,
   also, the spirit, and I do not, for a moment, depreciate a knowledge of
   the letter--unless you suppose that there is something saving in mere
   head knowledge! But the Spirit of God must come and make the letter
   alive to you. He must transfer it to your heart, set it on fire and
   make it burn within you, or else its Divine force and majesty will be
   hid from your eyes.

   No man knows the things of God save he to whom the Spirit of God has
   revealed them. No carnal mind can understand spiritual things. We may
   use language as plain as a pikestaff, but the man who has no spiritual
   understanding is a blind man and the clearest light will not enable him
   to see. You must be taught of the Lord, or you will die in ignorance!
   Now, my Brothers and Sisters, suppose that in a Church there should be
   many who have never been thus instructed--can you not see that evil
   must and will come of it? Error is sure to arise where the Truth of God
   is not experimentally known. If professors are not taught of the
   Spirit, their ignorance will breed conceit, pride, unbelief and a
   thousand other evils!

   Oh, had you known more of the Truth of God, my Brother, you had not
   boasted so! Oh, had you seen that Truth of God which, as yet, has not
   been revealed to you because of your prejudice, you had not so fiercely
   condemned those who are better than yourself! With much zeal to do
   good, men have done a world of mischief through lack of instruction in
   Divine things! Sorrow, too, comes of ignorance. O, my Brother, had you
   known the Doctrines of Grace you had not been so long a time in
   bondage! Half of the heresy in the Church of God is not willful error,
   but error which springs of not knowing the Truth of God, not searching
   the Scriptures with a teachable heart, not submitting the mind to the
   light of the Holy Spirit!

   We should, as a rule, treat heresy rather as ignorance to be
   enlightened than as a crime to be condemned. Unless, alas, that
   sometimes it becomes willful perversity when the mind is greedy after
   novelty, or puffed up with self-confidence! Then other treatment may
   become painfully necessary. Beloved, if the Spirit of God will but
   enlighten the Church thoroughly, there will be an end to divisions!
   Schisms are generally occasioned by ignorance and the proud spirit
   which will not accept correction. On the other hand, real, lasting,
   practical unity within exists in proportion to the unity of men's minds
   in the Truth of God. Hence the necessity for the Spirit of God to
   conduct us into the whole Truth of God.

   My dear Brother, if you think you know a doctrine, ask the Lord to make
   you sure that you know it, for much that we think we know turns out to
   be unknown when times of trial put us to the test. We really know
   nothing unless it is burnt into our souls as with a hot iron by an
   experience which only the Spirit of God can give! I think you will now
   see that the Spirit of God, being necessary for our instruction, we
   pre-eminently find, in His gracious operation, our strength for the
   instruction of others--for how shall those teach who have never been
   taught? How shall men declare a message which they have never learned?

   "Son of man, eat this roll," for until you have eaten it yourself, your
   lips can never tell it to others. "The farmer that labors must first be
   a partaker of the fruits." It is the law of Christ's vineyard that none
   shall work there till, first of all, they know the flavor of the fruits
   which grow in the sacred enclosure. You must know Christ, Grace, love
   and the Truth of God, yourself, before you can ever be an instructor of
   babes for Christ. When we come to deal with others, earnestly longing
   to instruct them for Jesus, we perceive even more clearly our need of
   the Spirit of God.

   Ah, my Brother, you think you will put the Gospel so clearly that they
   must see it--but their blind eyes overcome you. Ah, you think you will
   put it so zealously that they must feel it--but their clay-cold hearts
   defeat you! Old Adam is

   too strong for young Melancthon, depend upon it! You may think you are
   going to win souls by your pleading, but you might as well stand on the
   top of a mountain and whistle to the wind, unless the Holy Spirit is
   with you! After all your talking, your hearers will, perhaps, have
   caught your idea, but the mind of the Spirit, the real soul of the
   Gospel, you cannot impart to them--this remains, like creation itself,
   a work which only God can accomplish.

   Daily, then, let us pray for the power of the Spirit as the
   Illuminator. Come, O blessed Light of God! You, alone, can break our
   personal darkness and only when You have enlightened us can we lead
   others in Your light! An ignorant Christian is disqualified for great
   usefulness, but he who is taught of God will teach transgressors God's
   ways and sinners shall be converted unto Christ! Both to burn within
   and shine without you must have the illuminating Spirit!

   III. One work of the Spirit of God is to create in Believers the spirit
   of ADOPTION. "Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of
   His Son into your hearts, whereby you cry, Abba, Father!" "For you have
   not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received
   the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father!" We are
   regenerated by the Holy Spirit and so receive the nature of
   children--and that nature, which is given by Him, He continually
   prompts, excites, develops and matures--so that we receive day by day
   more and more of the childlike spirit.

   Now, Beloved, this may not seem to you to be of very great importance
   at first sight, but it is, for the Church is never happy except all her
   members walk as dear children towards God. Sometimes the spirit of
   slaves creeps over us--we begin to talk of the service of God as though
   it were heavy and burdensome--and are discontent if we do not receive
   present wages and visible success, just as servants do when they are
   not happy. But the spirit of adoption works for love, without any hope
   of reward, and it is satisfied with the sweet fact of being in the
   Father's house and doing the Father's will.

   This spirit gives peace, rest, joy, boldness and holy familiarity with
   God. A man who never received the spirit of a child towards God does
   not know the bliss of the Christian life! He misses its flower, its
   savor, its excellence and I should not wonder if the service of Christ
   should be a weariness to him because he has never, yet, got to the
   sweet things and does not enjoy the green pastures where the Good
   Shepherd makes His sheep to feed and to lie down. But when the Spirit
   of God makes us feel that we are sons and daughters, and we live in the
   House of God to go no more out forever, then the service of God is
   sweet and easy and we accept the delay of apparent success as a part of
   the trial we are called to bear.

   Now, mark you, this will have a great effect upon the outside world! A
   body of professors performing religion as a task, groaning along the
   ways of godliness with faces full of misery, like slaves who dread the
   lash, can have but small effect upon the sinners around them. They say,
   "Those people serve, no doubt, a hard master, and they are denying
   themselves this and that. Why should we be like they?" But bring me a
   Church made up of children of God--a company of men and women whose
   faces shine with their heavenly Father's smile! Who are accustomed to
   take their cares and cast them on their Father as children should! Who
   know they are accepted and loved, and are perfectly content with the
   great Father's will! Put them down in the midst of a company of ungodly
   ones and I will guarantee you they will begin to envy them their peace
   and joy. Thus happy saints become most efficient operators upon the
   minds of the unsaved!

   O blessed Spirit of God! Let us all, now, feel that we are the children
   of the great Father and let our childlike love be warm this morning!
   And so shall we be fit to go forth and proclaim the Lord's love to the
   prodigals who are in the far-off land among the swine! These three
   points are self-evident, I think. Now we pass to the fourth.

   IV. The Holy Spirit is especially called the Spirit of HOLINESS. He
   never suggested sin nor approved of it, nor has He ever done otherwise
   than grieve over it--holiness is the Spirit's delight! The Church of
   God wears upon her brow the words, "Holiness to the Lord." Only in
   proportion as she is holy may she claim to be the Church of God at all.
   An unholy Church? Surely this cannot be her of whom we read, "Christ
   also loved the Church and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify
   and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word, that He might
   present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle,
   or any such thing."

   Holiness is not mere morality, not the outward keeping of Divine
   precepts out of a hard sense of duty while those Commandments, in
   themselves, are not delightful to us. Holiness is the entirety of our
   manhood fully consecrated to the Lord and molded to His will! This is
   the thing which the Church of God must have, but it can never have it
   apart from the Sanctifier, for there is not a grain of holiness beneath
   the sky but what is of the operation of the Holy Spirit! And, Brothers
   and Sisters, if a Church is destitute of holiness, what effect can it
   have upon the world? Scoffers utterly condemn and despise professors
   whose inconsistent lives contradict their verbal testimonies!

   An unholy Church may pant and struggle after dominion and make what
   noise she can in pretense of work for Christ, but the kingdom comes not
   to the unholy, neither have they, themselves, entered it. The testimony
   of unholy men is no more acceptable to Christ than was the homage which
   the evil spirit gave to Him in the days of His flesh, to which He
   answered, "Hold your peace." "Unto the wicked," God says, "What have
   you to do to declare My statutes?" The dew is withheld and the rain
   comes not in its season to the tillage of those who profess to be the
   servants of God and yet sow iniquity.

   After all, the acts of the Church preach more to the world than the
   words of the Church! Put an anointed man to preach the Gospel in the
   midst of a really godly people and his testimony will be marvelously
   supported by the Church with which he labors. But place the most
   faithful minister over an ungodly Church and he has such a weight upon
   him that he must first clear himself of it or he cannot succeed. He may
   preach his heart out! He may pray till his knees are weary, but
   conversions will be sorely hindered if, indeed, they occur at all.
   There is no likelihood of victory to Israel while Achan's curse is on
   the camp! An unholy Church makes Christ to say that He cannot do many
   mighty works there because of its iniquity.

   Brethren, do you not see in this point our need of the Spirit of God?
   And when you get to grappling terms with sinners and have to talk to
   them about the necessity of holiness--a renewed heart and a godly life
   coming out of that renewed heart--do you expect ungodly men to be
   charmed with what you say? What does the unregenerate mind care for
   righteousness? Was a carnal man ever eager after holiness? Such a thing
   was never seen! As well expect the devil to be in love with God, as an
   unredeemed heart to be in love with holiness! But the sinner must love
   that which is pure and right, or he cannot enter Heaven! You cannot
   make him do so. Who can do it but that Holy Spirit who has made you to
   love what once you despised?

   Go not out, therefore, to battle with sin until you have taken weapons
   out of the armory of the Eternal Spirit! Mountains of sin will not turn
   to plains at your bidding unless the Holy Spirit is pleased to make the
   Word effectual. So then, we see that as the Spirit of holiness we need
   the Holy Spirit.

   V. Fifthly, the Church needs much PRAYER and the Holy Spirit is the
   Spirit of Grace and of supplications. The strength of a Church may
   pretty accurately be gauged by her prayerfulness. We cannot expect God
   to put forth His power unless we entreat Him to do so. But all
   acceptable supplication is worked in the soul by the Holy Spirit. The
   first desire which God accepts must be excited in the heart by the
   secret operations of the Holy One of Israel. And every subsequent
   pleading of every sort which contains in it a grain of living faith
   and, therefore,, comes up as a memorial before the Lord, must have been
   effectually worked in the soul by Him who makes intercession in the
   saints according to the will of God.

   Our great High Priest will put into His censer no incense but that
   which the Spirit has compounded! Prayer is the creation of the Holy
   Spirit! We cannot do without prayer and we cannot pray without the Holy
   Spirit! And, therefore, our dependence on Him. Furthermore, when we
   come to deal with sinners, we know that they must pray. "Behold he
   prays," is one of the earliest signs of the new birth! But can we make
   the sinner pray? Can any persuasion of ours lead him to his knees to
   breathe the penitential sigh and look to Christ for mercy? If you have
   attempted the conversion of a soul in your own strength you know you
   have failed! And so you would have failed if you had attempted the
   creation of one single acceptable prayer in the heart of even a little
   child.

   Oh then, dear Brothers and Sisters, let us cry to our heavenly Father
   to give the Holy Spirit to us! Let us ask Him to be in us more and more
   mightily as the Spirit of prayer, making intercession in us with groans
   that cannot be uttered, that the Church may not miss the Divine
   blessing for lack of asking for it! I do verily believe this to be her
   present weakness and one great cause why the kingdom of Christ does not
   more mightily spread--prayer is too much restrained-- and, therefore,,
   the blessing is kept back! And it will always be restrained unless the
   Holy Spirit shall stimulate the desires of His people. O blessed
   Spirit, we pray You will make us pray, for Jesus' sake!

   VI. Sixthly, the Spirit of God is in a very remarkable manner the giver
   of FELLOWSHIP. So often, as we pronounce the Apostolic benediction, we
   pray that we may receive the communion of the Holy Spirit. The Holy
   Spirit enables us to have communion with spiritual things. He, alone,
   can take the key and open up the secret mystery that we may know the
   things which are of God. He gives us fellowship with God, Himself,
   through Jesus Christ. By the Spirit we have access to

   the Father. Our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus
   Christ, but it is the Spirit of God who brings us into communion with
   the Most High.

   So, too, my dear Brothers and Sisters, our fellowship with one another,
   so far as it is Christian fellowship, is always produced by the Spirit
   of God. If we have continued together in peace and love these many
   years, I cannot attribute it to our constitutional good tempers, nor to
   wise management, nor to any natural causes, but only to the love into
   which the Spirit has baptized us so that rebellious natures have been
   still. If a dozen Christian people live together for 12 months in true
   spiritual union and unbroken affection, trace it to the love of the
   Spirit! And if 1,200, or four times that number shall be able to
   persevere in united service and find themselves loving each other
   better after many years than they did at the first, let it be regarded
   as a blessing from the Comforter, for which He is to be devoutly
   adored!

   Fellowship can only come to us by the Spirit, but a Church without
   fellowship would be a disorderly mob, a kingdom divided against itself
   and, consequently, it could not prosper. You need fellowship for mutual
   strength, guidance, help and encouragement--without it your Church is a
   mere human society. If you are to make a good impression on the world,
   you must be united as one living body. A divided Church has long been
   the scorn of Antichrist. No sneer which comes from the Vatican has a
   greater sting in it than that which taunts Protestants with their
   divisions! And as it is with the great outward Church so it is with any
   one particular Church of Christ!

   Divisions are our disgrace, our weakness, our hindrance! And as the
   gentle Spirit, alone, can prevent or heal these divisions by us, we are
   dependent upon Him for real loving fellowship with God and with one
   another. Let us daily cry to Him to work in us brotherly love and all
   the sweet Graces which make us one with Christ, that we all may be one
   even as the Father is One with the Son--and that the world may know
   that God has, indeed, sent Jesus and that we are His people.

   VII. Seventhly, we need the Holy Spirit in that renowned office which
   is described by our Lord as THE PARACLETE or COMFORTER. The word bears
   another rendering, which our translators have given to it in that
   passage where we read, "If any man sins, we have an Advocate (or
   Paraclete) with the Father." The Holy Spirit is both Comforter and
   Advocate. The Holy Spirit, at this present moment, is our Friend and
   Comforter, sustaining the sinking spirits of Believers, applying the
   precious promises, revealing the love of Jesus Christ to the heart.
   Many a heart would break if the Spirit of God had not comforted it.
   Many of God's dear children would have utterly died by the way if He
   had not bestowed upon them His Divine consolations to cheer their
   pilgrimage.

   That is His work and a very necessary work, for if Believers become
   unhappy they became weak in many points of service. I am certain that
   the joy of the Lord is our strength, for I have proved it so and proved
   also the opposite truth! There are on earth certain Christians who
   inculcate gloom as a Christian's proper state. I will not judge them,
   but this I will say, that in evangelistic work they do nothing and I do
   not wonder at it! Till snow in harvest ripens wheat. Till darkness
   makes flowers bloom. Till the salt sea yields clusters bursting with
   new wine, you will never find an unhappy religion promotive of the
   growth of the kingdom of Christ! You must have joy in the Lord,
   Brothers and Sisters, if you are to be strong in the Lord and strong
   for the Lord!

   Now, as the Comforter, alone, can bear you up amid the floods of
   tribulation which you are sure to meet with, you see your great need of
   His consoling Presence. We have said that the Spirit of God is the
   Advocate of the Church--not with God, for there, Christ is our sole
   Advocate--but with man! What is the grandest plea that the Church has
   against the world? I answer, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, the
   standing miracle of the Church! External evidences are very excellent.
   You young men who are worried by skeptics, will do well to study those
   valuable works which learned and devout men have, with much labor,
   produced for us. But, mark you, all the evidences of the truth of
   Christianity which can be gathered from analogy, from history and from
   external facts are nothing whatever compared with the operations of the
   Spirit of God! These are the arguments which convince!

   A man says to me, "I do not believe in sin, in righteousness, or in
   judgment." Well, Brothers and Sisters, the Holy Spirit can soon
   convince him! If he asks me for signs and evidences of the Truth of the
   Gospel, I reply, "Do you see this woman? She was a great sinner in the
   very worst sense and led others into sin. But now you cannot find more
   sweetness and light anywhere than in her. Do you hear this profane
   swearer, persecutor and blasphemer? He is speaking with purity, truth
   and humbleness of mind. Observe yon man who was, before, a miser, and
   see how he consecrates his

   substance! Notice that envious, malicious spirit and see how it becomes
   gentle, forgiving and amiable through conversion.

   How do you account for these great changes? They are happening here
   everyday! Why? Is it a lie which produces truth, honesty and love? Does
   not every tree bear fruit after its kind? What, then, must that Grace
   be which produces such blessed transformations? The wonderful phenomena
   of ravens turned to doves and lions into lambs--the marvelous
   transformations of moral character which the minister of Christ
   rejoices to see worked by the Gospel--these are our witnesses and they
   are unanswerable!

   Peter and John have gone up to the Temple and they have healed a lame
   man. They are soon seized and brought before the Sanhedrim. This is the
   charge against them--"You have been preaching in the name of Jesus and
   this Jesus is an impostor." What do Peter and John say? They need say
   nothing, for there stands the man that was healed! He has brought his
   crutch with him and he waves it in triumph! And he runs and leaps! He
   was their volume of evidences, their apology and proof. "When they saw
   the man that was healed standing with Peter and John, they could say
   nothing against them." If we have the Spirit of God among us and
   conversions are constantly being worked, the Holy Spirit is thus
   fulfilling His advocacy and refuting all accusers!

   If the Spirit works in your own mind, it will always be to you the best
   evidence of the Gospel. I meet, sometimes, one piece of infidelity and
   then another, for there are new doubts and fresh infidelities spawned
   every hour--and unstable men expect us to read all the books they
   choose to produce. But the effect produced on our mind is less and
   less. This is our answer. "It is of no use your trying to stagger us,
   for we are already familiar with everything you suggest. Our own native
   unbelief has outstripped you! We have had doubts of a kind which even
   you would not dare to utter if you knew them! There is enough
   infidelity and devilry in our own nature to make us no strangers to
   Satan's devices.

   "We have fought most of your suggested battles over and over again in
   the secret chamber of our meditation and have conquered, for we have
   been in personal contact with God! You sneer, but there is no argument
   in sneering. We are as honest as you are and our witness is as good as
   yours in any court of law--and we solemnly declare that we have felt
   the power of the Holy Spirit over our soul as much as any old ocean has
   felt the force of the north wind! We have been stirred to agony under a
   sense of sin and we have been lifted to ecstasy of delight by faith in
   the righteousness of Christ. We find that in the little world within
   our soul the Lord Jesus manifests Himself so that we know Him!

   "There is a potency about the doctrines we have learned which could not
   belong to lies, for the Truths of God which we believe, we have tested
   in actual experience. Tell us there is no meat? Why, we have just been
   feasting! Tell us there is no water in the fountain? We have been
   quenching our thirst! Tell us there is no such thing as light? We do
   not know how we can prove its existence to you, for you are probably
   blind, but we can see! That is enough argument for us and our witness
   is true! Tell us there is no spiritual life! We feel it in our inmost
   souls. These are the answers with which the Spirit of God furnishes us
   and they are a part of His advocacy."

   See, again, how entirely dependent we are on the Spirit of God for
   meeting all the various forms of unbelief which arise around us. You
   may have your societies for collecting evidence and you may enlist all
   your bishops and doctors of divinity and professors of apologetics--and
   they may write rolls of evidence long enough to girdle the globe--but
   the only Person who can savingly convince the world is the Advocate
   whom the Father has sent in the name of Jesus! When He reveals a man's
   sin and the sure result of it, the unbeliever takes to his knees! When
   He takes away the scales and sets forth the crucified Redeemer and the
   merit of the precious blood, all carnal reasonings are nailed to the
   Cross!

   One blow of real conviction of sin will stagger the most obstinate
   unbeliever and afterwards, if his unbelief returns, the Holy Spirit's
   consolations will soon comfort it out of him. Therefore, as at the
   first, I say at the last--all this depends upon the Holy Spirit and
   upon Him let us wait in the name of Jesus, beseeching Him to manifest
   His power among us! Amen.

"Rest in the Lord"

   (No. 1333)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 14, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Rest in the Lord." Psalm 37:7.

   THE occurrence of our text in the Psalm before us is an instance of the
   great rule that the Lord does nothing by halves. In this priceless
   Psalm, the Lord found His servant, in the first verse, liable to
   fretfulness and envy--and He exhorted him to cease from fretting. Then,
   in verse three, He taught him to trust. In verse four He led him on to
   delight. In verses five and six He conducted him into a peaceful
   committing of his way unto God and He did not stay the operation of His
   Grace till He had perfected that which concerned him and brought him up
   to the elevated point of our text, "Rest in the Lord, and wait
   patiently for Him." God does not merely cure the evil in us, but He
   confers unspeakable good! He takes away the disfiguring wound, but He
   imparts, also, comeliness and beauty.

   If any of you, this morning, are in a low state of Grace, so that you
   have even fallen into fretfulness at the prosperity of the ungodly, do
   not cast away all hope, for the Grace of God abounds toward us in all
   wisdom and prudence, and He will restore your soul! Remember how David
   said, in the 73rd Psalm--"I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the
   prosperity of the wicked." "So foolish was I, and ignorant, I was as a
   beast before You. Nevertheless I am continually with You: you have held
   me by my right hand."

   The Lord knows how to bring His people, again, from Bashan, yes, and to
   lift them up like Jonah from the depths of the sea! And He can bring
   you, this day, by the operation of His Grace, upward from doubt to
   assurance, from fretfulness to rest! Rest is a blessing which properly
   belongs to the people of God, although they do not enjoy it one tenth
   as much as they might. Under the Old Testament dispensation there was
   considerable provision made for rest. Typically the chosen nation was
   shown that one great end of the visitation of the Lord was to give His
   people rest, for on the seventh day they rested and did no manner of
   work.

   Yes more, in the seventh year they rested according to the Divine
   precept. "Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall
   prune your vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; but in the
   seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land, a Sabbath for
   the Lord: you shall neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard."
   When they were obedient to the Lord's commands, they thus enjoyed a
   whole year of rest, and were no losers by it, for, no doubt, the
   seventh fallow year so benefited the land that it brought forth all the
   more fruit during the other six, so that there was none the less store
   in their barns.

   Over and above this, once in 50 years, when the seventh year came
   round, they carried out, still further, the Sabbatic idea and the
   Jubilee Year was a time of peculiar and emphatic rest and festival. For
   thus had the Lord commanded. "A Jubilee shall that 50th year be unto
   you: you shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it,
   nor gather the grapes in it of your vine undressed. For it is the
   Jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: you shall eat the increase thereof
   out of the field." So very prominently, even in that somewhat servile
   and yoke-bearing dispensation, there was brought before the mind of the
   Israelite the privilege of rest. And those who possessed the inner
   sight, as Moses did, realized the promise, "My Spirit shall go with you
   and I will give you rest."

   Indeed, Canaan, itself, was intended to be the type of rest--the land
   that flows with milk and honey, the land of brooks and valleys, the
   land that the Lord Your God thinks about, the land upon which the eyes
   of the Lord rest from the beginning of the year even to the end of the
   year, was meant to be a place where every man should rest under his own
   vine and fig tree, and look for a yet deeper rest in God. Had they
   known it, in giving them Canaan, Joshua had given them a fair picture
   of rest. They did not see through the type so fully as to understand
   its significance, but, nevertheless, there it was.

   O Christian men and women, you, also, miss much of your rest! You have
   too much of fretfulness, too much of care, too much that is servile.
   The land does not keep her Sabbaths as she should, neither does your
   soul rest as it might! And as for jubilees, how very scarce they are!
   If Christians lived near to God and enjoyed the peace which Jesus
   gives, they might keep Jubilee every year and Sabbath every day! The
   Lord grant that we may have power to enjoy His rest and that it may
   never be said of us, "They could not enter in because of unbelief."

   Brothers and Sisters, the Lord, as if to show us that He would have us
   rest, has been pleased to speak of resting, Himself! It is
   inconceivable that He should be fatigued! It were profanity to suppose
   that He who faints not, neither is weary, and of whose understanding
   there is no searching, can ever be in a condition to need rest! And yet
   He did rest, for when He had finished all the works of His hands in the
   six days of creation, the Lord, "rested on the seventh day and
   sanctified it." When afterwards that rest was broken because His works
   were marred, we find Him further on smelling a "sweet savor of rest" in
   the sacrifice which was offered unto Him by Noah, whose very name was
   rest.

   These two facts are highly instructive and teach us that God rests in a
   perfect work and that when that work is marred the Lord rests in a
   perfect Sacrifice, even in the Lord Jesus Christ! He has a rest there
   and He speaks of our "entering His rest" as it is written, "they shall
   not enter into My rest." There is a rest of God, then, and there
   remains a rest unto the people of God. And of that rest, not in its
   highest development in Heaven, but in its present enjoyment on earth,
   we are about to speak. "Rest in the Lord."

   First, dear Brothers and Sisters, let us consider the steps to this
   royal chamber of repose. Secondly, let us meditate upon the rest which
   is enjoyed in that quiet chamber. And then, thirdly, let us look at
   that sumptuous chamber, itself. As the result and issue of it all, may
   the Holy Spirit sweetly lead us into quietness and peace, even as of
   old it was written, "The Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest."

   I. First, then, let us consider certain STEPS TO THIS ROYAL CHAMBER OF
   REST. How are we to reach this

   place of sacred repose? The steps are in the Psalm before us. The first
   is, "Fret not yourself." You are out in the fields among the wild
   beasts--cease hunting them. You are among those who toil in bondage,
   suffering all the brunt of ill weathers and hard seasons--get away from
   them. Come within doors, into your Father's house. By the help of the
   Divine Spirit leave the green bay trees which have cast their shadow
   upon you and enter into the sanctuary. No longer be as the carnal who
   envy one another.

   So long as you are out there among those who lust after evil things and
   fret against the Lord's Providence, you cannot rest. While you are
   agitating yourself to gain what other men lust after and to enjoy what
   other men take pleasure in, you are missing the peculiar privileges of
   the children of God! While your spirit is running with worldlings in
   the race and wrestling with them in the battle, you cannot enjoy the
   peace which Jesus left as a legacy to His disciples. Get away from
   them, then, for the first step to rest is, "fret not yourself." The
   griefs which make the ungodly pine are not for you, for the objects
   which they seek are not your objects! The losses which make them
   despond must not make you disconsolate, for their treasure is not your
   treasure.

   Get away from them and stop admiring their transient felicity and
   lamenting your present distress. Have you been envying transgressors?
   Count yourself to have been foolish and ignorant in so doing, for they
   shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb!
   Rise above the things which are seen, for they are temporal! Spurn the
   things which make the flesh smart, for this light affliction is but for
   a moment. Let not the world weigh you down, for you are bound, as an
   heir of Heaven, to tread the world beneath your feet--and all its
   honors you are called upon to despise! And in order that your soul
   should not lust after its dainties, come away unto your God and no
   longer fret yourself.

   When you have thus come out of the field and have arrived at the palace
   of Love, the first staircase is described as trust and do. Read the
   third verse, "Trust in the Lord and do good." You believe in the Lord's
   love? Prove your confidence by committing yourself to the keeping of
   Him who loves you. You believe in the Atonement of Jesus? Fly for
   cleansing to the blood which was shed for you! You believe in the Glory
   of your risen Lord? Commit all your future to Him with whom you are one
   day to sit upon the Throne!

   As for all your trials, come, now, and believe in God concerning them.
   Do not let anything make you mistrust or distrust your God. Know that
   He is God and "His mercy endures forever," and trust in Him forever!
   But let this faith be practical--"Trust in the Lord and do good." A
   dead faith will bring you but poor comfort. Yours must be a faith which

   can do as well as receive. It is through the exercise of faith that
   comfort comes to the heart, even as the exercise of our limbs warms our
   bodily frame. Do good even if you suffer for it and you shall partake
   in the joy of your Lord--

   "Commit your way to God,

   The weight which makes you faint.

   World's are to Him no load.

   To Him breathe your complaint.

   He who for winds and clouds

   Makes a pathway free,

   Through wastes, or hostile crowds

   Will make a way for thee."

   When you have learned to trust and to do, you will have ascended a
   noble staircase of the royal Palace--and where does it land you? It
   lands you in the king's dining room, where it is written--"Verily you
   shall be fed." Observe the promise--if you have a living, active faith
   you shall be provided for! Your bodily needs, as they come, shall be
   relieved. Your mental needs, also, shall be satisfied. And as for the
   vast demands of your spirit, God All-Sufficient shall supply them
   all--"So shall you dwell in the land and verily you shall be fed." It
   will be a happy circumstance, dear Brothers and Sisters, if you can
   come up the first staircase this morning, leaving the fields, leaving
   the elder brother who complains concerning the many years of service in
   which his Father has never given him a kid, that he might make merry
   with his friends--if you, I say, can come up rejoicing to do the will
   of the Lord out of motives of love!

   Leave the sinner and the grumbler alone, and go up those stairs of
   active faith! Then sit down where a feast is spread, even a feast of
   fat things full of marrow and of wines on the lees well-refined! We
   must ascend somewhat higher and climb the next staircase which is
   marked, Delight and Desire. "Delight yourself, also, in the Lord; and
   He shall give you the desires of your heart." Think what a good God you
   have, yes, what a blessed God He is! Remember how good He has been to
   you in the past. Think of the richness of His Word, the sureness of His
   promises, the tenderness of His love and the power of His arm till your
   soul shall say, "Whatever I have not, I have my God! Whatever is
   unsatisfactory, He satisfies me! And whatever grieves me to think it is
   so unfit for me, nothing grieves me in my God. I would not have Him
   changed, nor have Him change in any respect. He is a sea of blessedness
   in which my soul does swim."

   When you have delighted, begin to desire. Open your mouth wide and the
   Lord will fill it! Enlarge your petitions and He will grant them to
   you. Desire more Grace, more holiness, more love, more knowledge of
   Christ, more Heaven below and all these shall come at your call. Ask
   what you will and it shall be done unto you! See, now, we have ascended
   beyond the dining room and mounted to the royal treasury! We have
   entered the king's armory! Yes, we have came into the king's
   withdrawing room where He listens to the desires of His suitors and
   enters into fellowship with them and bids them delight in Him.

   Here He bids you open your heart and pour forth your secret longings,
   for He will lavish upon you the gifts of His love and fill you with all
   His fullness! It will be a great joy for you, today, if you have now
   climbed from the low marshy lands of fretting into the upper chamber of
   delighting in the Lord! But you are not up to the royal chamber of rest
   yet! You must now climb another stair, marked, Commit your way and
   Trust. "Commit your way unto the Lord, trust also in Him." Concerning
   that part of your way which you understand and have under your control,
   labor to walk according to the Lord's mind.

   But all that portion of your way which you understand not, and have no
   power over, leave entirely to the absolute will of God! What have you
   to do in ordering your own way? "All the steps of a good man are
   ordered of the Lord." If you must have the arrangement of your own
   march through the wilderness--if you will advance without the guidance
   of the pillar of cloud and fire--who is to provide for you and where
   will you go? Your fallible judgment and feeble strength will soon fail
   you! Leave to your Lord's will to ordain every step which you shall
   take and ask only to know so much of His mind as to be able to follow
   His guidance. Do not wish to pry into the secrets of the future, but
   "commit your way unto the Lord."

   Do not worry about the troubles or the present, but leave your way
   where you have left your soul. Say unto the Lord, "My Father, since
   this road is all too rough for my infant feet, be pleased to carry me,
   even as You did Your people all the days of old." And His strong hands
   shall lift you up! And in His bosom you shall ride over the miry places
   of the earth, rejoicing in almighty love! Commit and trust! Now this
   brings us into the undressing room which stands side by

   side with the royal bedchamber. Take off the dusty garments of your
   cares and commit them to the Lord. Strip yourself of one anxiety after
   another! Unrobe yourself of all that reminds you of this miry, weary
   pilgrimage and leave your worn and travel-stained raiment.

   Then you need a candle to light so you can see your way to your
   bed--here it is for you in verse six, "He shall bring forth your
   righteousness as the light, and your judgment as the noonday." You feel
   convinced that what is left with God is safe. You have an assured
   confidence that if you commit a matter to Him you have left it in the
   hands of a faithful Creator--these gracious confidences will light you
   to your couch of rest! Like Paul, you will be at peace as to the future
   whether it bring you life or death, for you will say, "I know in whom I
   have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I
   have committed unto Him until that day." There is your candle! Enter
   the quiet chamber and take your rest. "Rest in the Lord."

   These are the steps which I have tried, briefly, to describe. There is
   a coming out from the fretfulness generated by the world and its cares
   and troubles--a pulling off the shoes, as it were--before you enter the
   Palace, saying to your soul, "Fret not because of evildoers." Then
   there is a sitting down to a feast of love by a simple but active
   faith. Next there is, after the feast, the sweet dessert of communion
   with Christ--a leaning of the head upon the bosom of the Lord as John
   did at the supper--delighting oneself in the Lord and getting the
   desires of your inmost soul.

   After this comes a disrobing of everything like care--and the laying
   aside of all that is earth-born and gross which tends to distract us.
   And, last of all, there is the resigning of the soul to the peace which
   the Holy Spirit brings--which is comparable to reclining upon a soft
   couch, provided by Him who says to us, "My child, you are very weary;
   rest in the

   Lord."--

   "Long did I toil and knew no earthly rest! Far did I roam and found no
   certain home! At last I sought them in His sheltering breast Who
   spreads His arms and bids the weary come. With Him I found a home, a
   rest Divine! And I since then, am His and He is mine."

   II. Now, let us try and form some idea of THE REST, ITSELF, WHICH IS
   BESTOWED UPON US IN THIS ROYAL CHAMBER. First, it is a rest of mind of
   which the prominent ingredient is a sense of security and calm--a fixed
   belief in the teachings of the Divine Spirit and in the Gospel which we
   have received. It is a sense of having grasped the blessings which that
   Gospel holds out to us and, therefore,, a sense of the certainty of our
   acceptance with God and of our eternal security in Christ Jesus.

   Beloved, if you are of the school which shifts its creed every week. If
   you belong to the modern-culture gentlemen who cannot tell us what they
   believe because they do not know, themselves--who are so eminently
   receptive that it appears to me that they are mainly occupied in
   turning out what lumber they have warehoused in order to be able to
   stow away more--then you will never know any rest! This hallowed state
   of mind cannot come to the unsettled doubter. The sacred, dove-like
   Spirit quits the regions of uncertainty and dwells with those who know
   whom they have believed! Where He dwells there is rest, but nowhere
   else!

   Look at John--the blessed, loving John--how, all through his three
   Epistles, he continually uses that word, "know." He is a terrible
   Dogmatist! He is sure of everything! He dogmatizes gloriously and he
   rests! There is no rest till you are sure. A little, "if," is like a
   stone in your shoe--you cannot travel comfortably--it blisters the foot
   and prevents restful progress. "Ah, but," says one, "I do not know how
   to interpret such-and-such a text." Well, then, Brother, cease from
   interpreting it and believe it as it stands! It is infinitely better to
   believe God's Word than to interpret it! In fact, much that passes for
   interpretation, nowadays, is simply the drying of all sap and soul out
   of the Inspired Words and making them retain only a very dry and husky
   sense.

   Be more earnest to believe than to interpret! Ask, "What does the text
   say?" Believe that and if you do not comprehend all its meaning, do not
   be any the less believing. How shall God be comprehensible by finite
   creatures, or His glorious Truths be seen in all points by such poor
   mortals as we are? Believe so you shall be established. And then, being
   established in the Truth of God, grasp the blessings which that Truth
   brings to you and rejoice! You believe in justification by faith--be
   sure that you are justified! You believe in the election of God--make
   your calling and election sure! You believe in the final perseverance
   of the saints--persevere even to the end!

   Grip the blessings and then understand that having believed that Jesus
   is the Christ, you are born of God! Having put your trust in Him, there
   is, therefore, no condemnation to you, for you are in Christ Jesus! As
   you realize these doctrines and the positive security--the indisputable
   security--which comes to every Believer who is relying upon Jesus, you
   will feel that perfect rest which is indescribable in sweetness! The
   rest "which only he that feels it knows." Our rest is a sense of
   security.

   Next, this rest is, in another aspect, contentment--perfect
   satisfaction with our earthly lot. Ambition spoils rest. The constant
   greed of avarice puts rest out of the question. The worry, the fret,
   the fume of accumulating, of desiring more, of impatiently coveting
   more than God is pleased to give--all this ruins rest. Oh, to say, "The
   Lord's will be done! Having food and clothing, I am content." "I have
   learned, in whatever state I am, to be content," and to let ambition,
   lofty desires, fretfulness and complaining all go and just say, "God
   has appointed my portion and ordained all my ways. So let it be." This
   is rest! Put this together with security as to the eternal future and
   you have gained two very sweet ingredients with which to compose a rest
   worthy of the sons of God--

   "Rest, weary heart,

   From all your silent griefs and secret pain, Your profitless regrets
   and longings vain. Wisdom and lo ve ha ve ordered all the past, All
   shall be blessedness and light at last! Cast off the cares that have so
   long oppressed. Rest sweetly, rest!"

   Next, there is in this rest the idea of immovable confidence--perfect
   confidence in God so that when severe trail comes, the soul says, "It
   is right--I am sure it is right. I cannot see the reason, but I know
   that the trial is sent in love. I am certain of that." When another
   trial befalls, child-like confidence in God still says, "It could not
   be better if God sends two troubles, they are better than one. And if
   He sends six, they are six times better than one, though they seem six
   times worse." That confidence says, also, "He will bring me out of it.
   He never sent me out, yet, upon the sea of tribulation but what He
   brought me home again! He never sent me to a battle at my own charges
   yet. He never bade me do a work but what He gave me strength for it! He
   never called me to suffer but what He sustained me under the pain."

   Oh, but this is a blessed thing, to be quite confident that God cannot
   err, cannot forsake, cannot change, cannot cease to love and that,
   therefore, everything that comes from Him comes in the right way, at
   the right time, in the right measure--and that all is well and will end
   well! Though all the tempests come forth from their caverns to howl at
   once across the tremendous seas. Though every cyclone and hurricane
   that ever blew should come back, again, and my poor ship should be
   almost a wreck by reason of their fury--it is well, it is well! If only
   on a board or a broken piece of the ship I shall come safely to land,
   for so has God decreed, so glory be to His name! I will leave all to
   Him. This is rest-- thorough rest, security, contentment, confidence!

   Then, perhaps, mainly, according to the Hebrew, this rest consists in
   submission, for the Hebrew is, "Be silent to God." That is the word.
   One of the old versions reads it, "Hold you still before God." This
   holy silence is illustrated by what we read of Aaron, when his sons
   died. Before the Lord--"Aaron held his peace." Let your tongue be
   quiet. Do not murmur. Do not argue--leave all to God and bow in
   silence. "My soul is even as a weaned child," said David. He would no
   longer cry after the warm breasts of comfort--he was weaned at last!

   Now, O Lord, Your will is my will. It has been a sharp lesson, but You
   have taught it to me at last! Before I struggled, but now I acquiesce.
   Once I quarreled, but now sweetly yield. Let it be as You please. Your
   will is mine. This, also, is rest--

   "This is a holiei, sweeter rest, Than the lulling rest from pain, And a
   deeper calm than that which sleep Sheds over heart and brain. It is the
   soul's surrendered choice, The settling of the will, Lying down gently
   at the Cross, God's purpose to fulfill."

   There comes, next, the rest of patient waiting, for that is in the
   text. What does it say? "Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him."
   This is to have desires, but to feel that you can waive them and tarry
   at the Lord's leisure. This is to have wishes, but always to keep them
   tethered so that they do not go too far. This is to have a will only in
   subserviency to the wiser and kinder will which rules above, always
   saying, "Lord, that is what I think I should wish for, but I do not
   know, for sure, whether it would be good for me or not. Therefore I ask
   You to deny me if my wishes are wrong. Do not hear my most earnest
   prayers, my Father, if they should not please You, for I would ask You
   rather not to hear me than to hear me if I ask amiss.

   "I have wishes and a will, Lord which You have permitted me to have,
   for You have said You will grant me the desires of my heart. But Lord,
   if my heart should not be delighting herself in You when she feels her
   desires, they shall not be my desires, I will disown them! My most
   supreme will shall be not to will anything except Your will--and if I
   do will it, I repent of so willing and discard the evil will and the
   undesirable desire. I will turn all willfulness out of doors, by Your
   Grace, that You may have Your will." This is a blessed spirit, dear
   Friends, and he that has attained it has entered the royal bedchamber
   where he shall rest in peace, for, "so He gives His Beloved sleep."

   This rest means, also, peace--peace of soul with yourself, with your
   fellow men, with God. It takes two to make an enemy and if you will not
   be one of the two, you will not have an enemy seriously to distress
   you. Men may dislike you, but they shall be held in check, for, "when a
   man's ways please the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace
   with him." "He makes the wrath of man to praise him and the remainder
   does He restrain." At any rate, the assured Believer possesses that
   peace which Christ had, who, when His foes gathered round about Him and
   sought to catch Him in His words, baffled them all by His calm
   self-possession.

   This rest means quiet happiness, inward calm. The soul has mounted
   where it desires to be and does not intend to move from its position.
   Noah's dove has been round the earth and seen nothing but waste of
   waters. But at last she has flown home--she is in Noah's hand and she
   means to stay in the ark until better times shall come and the waters
   are endurable. Oh, if any of you have wandered and lost the peace which
   Christ gives, even that which He gives not to the world--if you are
   troubled and fretful, envious and weary--commune with your own heart
   this morning and say, "Return unto your rest, O my Soul, for the Lord
   has dealt bountifully with you." Say to your heart as I have said to
   mine, "Why are you cast down, O my Soul? And why are you disquieted
   within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him who is the health of
   my countenance, and my God." "Rest in the Lord."

   To close our description of rest, I think we must add one other term to
   it. It is the rest of expectation, especially in regard to the kingdom
   of the Lord Jesus Christ. The greatest fret that some of us ever have
   concerns the cause of God. Personal troubles and domestic troubles sit
   very lightly on some of us, but Church trouble perplexes us. Not in my
   case, because none of you who love the Lord ever intentionally cause me
   distress of mind. But there are some who walk, of whom we would tell
   you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ--and
   yet they have entered into the Church to her dishonor and injury!

   And outside this Church, outside in the great Church of Christ, you can
   see, everywhere, looming heavily over us, the black clouds of Romanism!
   And amidst the gloom, the specters of skepticism are fitting to and
   fro. Everything in these times seems to be loose and out of joint! The
   men of "thought" have pulled up the old landmarks. They have broken
   down the hedges and laid the Lord's enclosures common to all that pass
   by the way. Behold, they go about to break down the carved work of the
   sanctuary with their axes! They defile the temple of the Lord! Nothing
   is sacred for these wise men of modern times! No Truth of God that was
   taught by their sires can be taught by them.

   The Doctrines of Grace to these men are platitudes and the doctrine of
   the Cross, itself, is denied! Or, when not denied, so obscured that we
   know not what it is! Scarcely do they, themselves, know what it is they
   affirm! They are great at questions and negations. Novelties of
   doctrine are poured out upon the earth in countless numbers as the
   frogs which came up in the apocalyptic vision! And what shall the end
   be? "Go your way," says God to His beloved, "for you shall rest and
   stand in your lot in the end of the days." Christ will take care of His
   own Church! The gates ofHell shall not prevail against her. Leave all
   this to Him who sees the end as well as the beginning and to whom the
   victory shall surely come! Your strength is to sit still. Rest in the
   Lord with expectation that He will overrule the evil and will, Himself,
   surely come to end it all and reign gloriously among His ancients.

   III. Lastly, and here I needed time, but with my usual improvidence I
   have squandered it--our third point is, let us enter and examine THE
   ROYAL CHAMBER ITSELF. "Rest in the Lord." Now the text does not say
   rest in anything about the Lord, but rest in the Lord Himself! Oh that
   the Spirit might bring us into such union and communion with God that
   we might, to the fullest, know the meaning of this text! "Rest in the
   Lord!" The Lord has revealed Himself to us in these days in the Person
   of His only-begotten Son! Jesus, akin to us by nature! Jesus, our
   Substitute and Surety! Jesus, our All in All!

   Now, Beloved, come near to Jesus by a living faith! Hide yourselves in
   Jesus! Enter into His wounds! Feel your safety in Him, your union to
   Him! Live to Him, live with Him, live for Him, live in Him and as you
   do, so you must rest! Only in the Lord is there any rest for you! Only
   as you are a man in Christ Jesus and lose yourself in Him, your life,
   being hidden with Christ in God, in that way, in that way only, shall
   you find perfect rest! What a resting place do saints find in the
   finished work of Jesus! Let but the Holy Spirit lead them to see the
   Glory of His atoning blood and they are sure to rest!

   Let me tenderly entreat the tempted Believer to tell Jesus all his case
   and look to Him for that rest which He Himself promised when He said,
   "Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, and you shall find rest unto
   your souls."--

   "Rest, weary soul!

   The penalty is borne, the ransom paid, For all your sins full
   satisfaction made! Strive not to do yourself what Christ has done,
   Claim the free gift and make the joy your own. No more by pangs of
   guilt and fear distress, Rest, sweetly rest!"

   Although this is obviously the main meaning, we may add that, "Rest in
   the Lord," means rest in Him as your Covenant God. You have not to deal
   with an abstract Deity who stands afar off as your offended Creator.
   Behold, Beloved, if you believe in Jesus, the Lord has entered into an
   everlasting Covenant with you, ordered in all things and sure! He has
   said concerning you, "I will not turn away from you to do you good." He
   has promised to keep you and preserve you and bring you into His
   eternal Glory by a Covenant signed and sealed with the precious blood
   of Christ!

   "Rest in the Lord." He will keep His Covenant even to its jots and
   tittles, therefore be not disquieted. The eternal shalls and wills
   shall never fail! "This is as the waters of Noah unto Me: for as I have
   sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have
   I sworn that I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you. In a little
   wrath I hid My face from you for a moment; but with everlasting
   kindness will I have mercy on you, says the Lord your Redeemer. The
   mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My kindness shall
   not depart from you." Glory be unto our Covenant God! Come and rest in
   Him, Beloved!

   Then rest in all the relationships into which the Lord has been pleased
   to bring Himself. Know that this God of yours is your shield and your
   exceedingly great reward! He is your rock, your dwelling place! He is
   your Shepherd and your Preserver. Best of all, He is your Father! Oh,
   Brothers and Sisters, one cannot talk about this! One needs to drink it
   in by quiet meditation! It is a bliss too great for words to be,
   indeed, a child of the heavenly Father! Jehovah is Creator of Heaven
   and earth, Maker and Destroyer! And yet I am His child! And as surely
   as a child may trust its parent and rest in its mother's bosom, so
   surely and safely may I trust my Father and rest in Him!

   Do you not know, too, that to set forth the nearness and tenderness of
   His relationship to us, the Lord is pleased to describe Himself as the
   Husband of our souls? For, "Your Maker is your Husband, the Lord of
   Hosts is His name." "I will even betroth you unto Me in faithfulness,
   and you shall know the Lord." Shall not the spouse trust her husband? I
   hope we will, each of us, say to Him this morning, "Lord, I trust You,
   for I love You since You have made me one with You in blessed union.
   And I say to You, today, as the Church did of old, 'Tell me, O You whom
   my soul loves, where You feed, where You make Your flock to rest at
   noon: for why should I be as one that turns aside by the flocks of Your
   companions?'" Rest in your Friend, your Savior, your All in All! I
   leave the full list of Divine relationships for you to think of at your
   leisure. They are all full of rest.

   Rest, next, in each one of the attributes of God. Are you conscious of
   sin? Come and rest in the mercy which blots it out! Poor Sinner, I
   would gladly invite you with the burden of your guilt upon you, to
   remember that He delights in mercy! It is God's joy to pass by
   transgression! You will never escape from the bondage of your sin
   except as you come to the mercy of God in Jesus Christ, His Son. Rest
   in boundless mercy! Beloved child of God, are you troubled about inward

   sin?--then rest in His power to break the neck of corruption! Perhaps
   your affliction concerns your worldly affairs-- then rest in the power
   of God to help you! He is great at a dead lift and when none can help
   us but God, then is God most ready to come to the rescue.

   Rest, Beloved Brothers and Sisters, in God's wisdom. You cannot see
   your way, but He can--leave it to Him, for there is no possibility of
   error in His counsels. Rest, also, in His immutability--that sure
   anchor amid the troubled sea of life. You have changes every day--He
   never changes! Come back to Him whose constancy of love is a mountain
   of strength! He has set His mind upon saving you and He is of one
   mind--who shall turn Him? This is His mind--that He that believes and
   is baptized shall be saved--and He will perform that salvation! Not
   death nor Hell shall thwart the sacred purpose of an unchanging God! He
   will carry out His gracious work and glorify Himself!

   Rest, also, in His faithfulness. What He has promised He will perform.
   He is not a man that He should lie, nor the son of man that He should
   repent. Has He said and shall He not do it? Take His promise and
   believe it to be as good as fulfilled, for so it is. Rest also in His
   Word which He has written for your consolation. The Holy Spirit has, in
   a thousand ways, declared the Divine goodwill towards you--meditate
   upon what He has dictated. As full as the skies are of stars so full
   are the Scriptures with promises! Take these precious promises, one by
   one. Believe them and pray to the Lord, saying, "Fulfill this Word unto
   Your servant whereon You have caused me to hope. O Lord, do as You have
   said."

   Then sweetly rest in the eternal truthfulness, for the Lord will keep
   every one of His promises to you. What a subject I have before me! I
   seem to be like those bold explorers in the northern seas, before whom
   a passage opens up to the left and then another channel on the right.
   They sail into the center of a great bay and then further on enter upon
   another sea and know not how wide the ocean may yet become still
   further on! My text is an ocean to which I see no boundary! It is full
   of wondrous Grace but I have neither time nor ability to sail over its
   shoreless surface! I must leave you to spread the sails of meditation!
   And favored by the gales of the Spirit's influences, I trust you will
   be borne along--not to an ocean of primeval ice--but to the condition
   of unbroken rest in the Lord!

   Next, let us rest in the will of God. It is a high point to arrive at
   to feel that my Father's will is such that I can entirely rest in it,
   be it whatever it may. Yet it would not be so difficult if we were not
   so depraved. O for conquering Grace to crush down self! I would be as a
   grain of dust blown in the summer's gale without power to change my
   course, carried on by the Irresistible Spirit of the Lord--forever made
   willingly unwilling to will anything but the will of my Lord! I would
   be as a tiny straw borne along by the Gulf Stream, carried wherever the
   warm love of God shall bear me, delighting to lie low and see the Lord,
   alone, exalted!

   The Buddhists talk about being absorbed into Buddha and ceasing to be.
   And they make it their heaven to be, at last, swallowed up in their
   god. I know the falsehood of this teaching, but I know that there is a
   truth which is very like it in outward aspect. Oh, to be nothing! To be
   less than nothing! To have no will and no desire about life or death,
   about sickness or health, about poverty or wealth--no will about
   anything--and yet to have a strong resolved will to deny self and say,
   "Not as I will, but as You will." This is to rest in the Lord!

   Beloved, may the Lord, by His Holy Spirit, grant you abundantly, from
   this day forward, to enter into this which is man's first, man's last,
   man's sweetest, truest rest--the rest of the sinner coming to
   Christ--the rest of the saint abiding in Heaven! This is the only real
   rest that can be found on earth or Heaven--rest in the Lord! God grant
   it to us by faith, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

Coming--Always Coming

   (No. 1334)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "To whom coming." 1 Peter 2:4.

   THE Apostle is speaking of the Lord Jesus, of whom he had previously
   said, "If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious," and He
   follows that sentence up with this, "To whom coming as unto a living
   stone." Now, I want to call your special attention to this present
   participle--this act of coming--for there is much to counsel and to
   comfort us in the fact and the reflections it suggests. The Christian
   life is begun, continued and perfected altogether in connection with
   the Lord Jesus Christ! This is a very great blessing for us. Sometimes
   when you go on a journey, you travel so far under the protection of a
   certain Company--but then you have to change and the rest of your
   journey may be performed under very different circumstances--upon quite
   another kind of line.

   Now we have not to go just so far to Heaven in the guardian care of
   Jesus Christ and then at a certain point to change, so as to have
   somebody else to be our leader, or some other method of salvation. No,
   He is the Author and He is the Finisher of our faith. If we begin
   aright, we go on aright--we go on with "Christ is All." And if we
   finish aright we finish with "Christ is All." It was a great delusion
   of some, in Paul's day, that after they had begun in the Spirit, they
   hoped to be made perfect in the flesh. And there are some, nowadays,
   who begin as sinners resting upon Christ--but they want to go on as
   independent saints, resting on themselves.

   That will never do, Brothers and Sisters. It is not, "Christ and
   Company." The sinner knows that it must be Christ only, because he has
   nothing of his own. And the saint ought to know that it must be only
   Christ because he has less than nothing apart from Christ! I believe
   that if we grow out of Christ we grow in an unhealthy mushroom fashion.
   What we need is to grow up into Christ in all things, knowing Him more
   and more and being more and more satisfied that He is what we need.
   This is really a healthy growth and may God send more and more of it to
   us as long as we live!

   Blessed be His holy name! With us it is Christ in the morning, when we
   are young and full of strength. It is Christ at noon, when we are
   bearing the burden and heat of the day. And it is Christ at eventide,
   when we lean on the staff for very age and the shadows lengthen and the
   light is dim. Yes, and it shall be only Christ when the night settles
   down and shades of death curtain our last bed. In all circumstances and
   conditions we look only to Jesus! Are we wealthy? Christ crowns it. Are
   we in poverty? Christ cheers it. Are we in honor? Christ calms us. Are
   we in shame? Christ consoles us. Are we in health? He sanctifies it.
   Are we in sickness? He relieves it.

   As He is at all times the same in Himself so He is the same to us. To
   the same Christ we must come and cling under every new circumstance.
   Our heart must abide faithful to her one only Lord and lovingly sing--

   "I'll turn to You in days of light As well as nights of care. You are
   brightest amid all that's bright, You are fairest of the fair!"

   We have not to seek a fresh physician, to find a new friend, or to
   discover a novel hope, but we are to look for everything to Jesus
   Christ, "the same yesterday, and today, and forever." "You are complete
   in Him." Stand to this, my Brothers and Sisters! Never think that you
   need anything beyond the provision which is stored up in Him for
   sanctification, for satisfaction, or for safety! Cast not your eyes
   around you to find a supplement to the Lord Jesus, or you will deceive
   yourselves and dishonor Him.

   It is not with our Lord as it was with Moses. Moses led the people
   through the wilderness, but he could not bring them into the promised
   land--that was reserved for Joshua. Brothers and Sisters, the Lord
   Jesus has led you so far through the wilderness and He will lead you
   over the Jordan and secure your heritage for you! He will see you
   safely landed in it--look not, therefore, for any other leader or
   lawgiver! It is not with Christ as it was with David. David

   collected the materials for the temple, but though he could gather
   together vast stores of great value, he could not build them up, for
   the Lord said that this honor should be reserved for his son that
   should be after Him and, therefore,, the construction of the temple was
   left for Solomon.

   But our Lord Jesus Christ, blessed be His name, has not only gathered
   together His people and the precious treasures with which He is to
   build a living temple unto God, but He will also build it, stone upon
   stone, and bring forth the top stone with shouting! He shall build the
   temple of the Lord and He shall bear the Glory! Christ in the
   Christian's alphabet is A, B, C right down to Z--and all the words of
   the pure language of Canaan are only compounds of Himself! Has He not
   said it, "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end"?

   Our text speaks about coming to Him and I shall endeavor to expound it
   to you thus. This is a full picture of Christian life. I consider it to
   be a complete picture of a saint drawn with one stroke. It is not easy
   to make a portrait with one line, yet I remember seeing a somewhat
   famous portrait of our Lord in which the artist never lifted his pencil
   from the paper from beginning to end. He drew the whole of it with one
   continuous series of circles. So here I may say the whole Christian
   life is drawn in one line--coming unto Christ. "To whom coming."

   When we have spoken upon that, I shall answer two questions. The
   first--what is the best way of coming to Him at first? The other--what
   is the best way of coming to Him afterwards? May the Holy Spirit bless
   the whole discourse to our souls.

   I. First, then, HERE IS A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE.
   It is a continuous "coming" to Jesus. If you have your Bibles open at
   the text, I want you to notice that the expression occurs in connection
   with two figures. There is one which precedes it in the second verse,
   namely, the figure of a little child fed upon milk. "As newborn babes,
   desire the sincere milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby. If
   indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming."
   Children come to their parents and they frequently come rather longer
   than their parents like--it is the general habit of children to come to
   their parents for what they need.

   They begin with coming to the mothers when they are newborn babes. Look
   at the little child. It cannot provide for itself. If it were left to
   shift for itself, it must die. But having tasted the unadulterated
   milk, it thirsts for more of it. When the time comes round for it to be
   fed, and it comes very often, it gives unmistakable signs even before
   it can speak that it needs its food! It knows where to come and it will
   not rest till it reaches its place and nestles down. As the child grows
   up it knows the breakfast hour, the dinner hour and knows where to come
   for the grateful meal and the hearty welcome. You do not need, in most
   of your houses, I suspect, to ring a bell to call your children
   together to the family table! They all carry little interior bells
   which let them know pretty accurately when mealtimes are and they come
   freely, without persuading or forcing.

   Some of them are now getting to be 15 or 16 years of age and they still
   keep on coming! They come to your table just as they used to come. When
   first you had to lift them into their little chairs, they were coming.
   And now they take their big chairs as if they quite belonged to
   them--and they still keep on coming! Yes, and they come to you not only
   for bread and for meat, but they come for a great many things besides.
   In fact, the older they grow, the more they come! They used to come for
   little shoes and little garments, but now they need them cut of a
   larger size and of more expensive material--and they come accordingly.
   Though they cost you more, they come with greater freedom, for habit
   has made them very bold in their coming!

   They do not require any entreaty or encouragement to come for what they
   need--they look for many things as a matter of course--and for the rest
   they come with all the readiness imaginable. Perhaps they let you know
   their desires a little sooner than you need them to, and when you think
   that they might manage a little longer with what they have, they press
   their claims with earnestness and vote them urgent! They very soon find
   out their requirements--you never have to call them together and say,
   "Now girls, I need you to earnestly consider whether you really need
   more dresses. Now boys, I need you to lay it to heart whether you
   really require new clothes."

   Oh, nothing of the sort! Your children do not need to be called in such
   a way. They come without calling! They are always coming for something,
   as you very well know! Sometimes they constrain you to put your hands
   into your pockets so frequently and for such a variety of expenses that
   you wonder how long the purse will hold out and when your resources
   will be exhausted! Of one thing you feel quite sure--it will be easier
   to drain your purse than to stop your

   children from coming for one thing or another! They come to you, now,
   for a great many things they did not come for at first. It seems that
   there is no end to the things they come for, and I believe there is no
   end at all.

   Some of them, I know, continue to come after they have got beyond their
   boyish years. Though you have a notion, I suppose, that they might
   shift for themselves, they are still coming for sovereigns where
   shillings used to suffice! There was a time when you could put them to
   bed at night with the reflection that you had found them food and
   raiment and house and home. You knew your expenses--but now the big
   fellows come to you with such heavy demands that you can hardly see the
   end of it! So it is. They are always coming!

   Now, in all this long talk I have been showing you how to understand
   the figure of coming to Christ. Just what your children began to do
   from the first moment you fixed your eyes on them--and what they have
   continued to do ever since--that is just what you are to do with the
   Lord Jesus Christ! You are to be always coming to Him--coming to Him
   for spiritual food! Coming to Him for spiritual garments! Coming to Him
   for washing, guiding, help and health! Coming, in fact, for everything!
   You will be wise if, the older you grow, the more you come--and He will
   be all the better pleased with you.

   If you discover other needs, come for more than you used to come for!
   You will prove, thereby, that you better understand and appreciate what
   manner of love it is that you should be called the sons of God. "He
   that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall
   He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Has He not said to
   you, "Open your mouth wide and I will fill it"? It is rather strange
   that you never have to tell your children to do that! They do it
   without any telling--but you have been told to do it and yet you do not
   do it! Our Lord complains, "you have not called upon Me, O Jacob."

   The infinite liberality of your heavenly Father has urged you to make
   great requests of Him and yet you have stuttered and stammered and been
   afraid to ask! He now tells you that "you have not because you ask
   not." Beloved, let us learn from our children, and let it be the habit
   of our lives to be incessantly coming to the heavenly Father--coming
   more often, coming for more reasons, coming for larger blessings,
   coming with greater expectations, coming in one lifelong perpetual
   coming--and all because He bids us come!

   If you will look again at your Bibles, you will get a second
   illustration from the fourth and fifth verses, "To whom coming as unto
   a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and
   precious. You also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house,
   an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God
   by Jesus Christ." Here we have the figure of a building. A building
   comprises, first, a foundation, and then the stones which are brought
   to the foundation and are built upon it.

   This furnishes a very beautiful picture of Christian life. I have read
   that there has been discovered beneath Jerusalem an immense cavern or
   quarry near the Damascus gate. Travelers who have been into this quarry
   say that there are niches in the live rock out of which the magnificent
   stones were cut with which Solomon's temple was built. The temple is up
   there on the top of the rock, and then far down in the quarry can
   distinctly be seen where the huge stones used to be. Now there was a
   process of coming by which each stone came to the foundation. Some
   stones that were expected to form part of the building never reached
   it--there is one huge stone of that sort in the Bezetha cavern right
   now.

   It is still there for this reason--though it is squared and chiseled on
   the front and two sides and also on the top and the bottom--yet it has
   never been cut away at the back. And so it cleaves to the rock of which
   it is naturally a part and remains in its original darkness. Now, the
   passage that I would like you to think of is that in the 51st chapter
   of Isaiah-- "Look unto the rock from which you were hewn, and to the
   hole of the pit from which you were dug." There are many here present
   who have been cut off from the rock and lifted up out of the horrible
   pit! And since the early operation of Divine Grace they have been
   coming and coming till they have reached the Foundation--and are built
   up as living stones in the temple which is established upon Christ!

   But there are others of you who need further excavating. God has begun
   His work upon you. He has used sharp tools and begun to separate you
   from the world--it has taken a long time to get you cut away from the
   rock, even in part. You used to be altogether sinful and earth-bound.
   You lived in worldliness, just as the stone formed a part of the rock.
   God has been using His great chisel upon you. He has cut you away and
   separated you, to a great extent, from your fellow men. But still, at
   the back, in secret, your heart cleaves to sin! You have not given up
   the darling lust of your heart

   and, therefore,, you are not quarried yet. And you cannot come to
   Christ, for that is impossible till you are separated from the rock of
   which you naturally form a part!

   Oh, how I wish that almighty Grace would take the saw of the Word of
   God, tonight, and make clean cuts right across your stony heart until
   you are sawn right off from the hard rock of sin that you may
   afterwards be made to come to Christ to be built upon Him as your
   Foundation! That is how the work of Grace begins--by cutting loose the
   soul from the evil world of which it has been a component part! This is
   part of the process by which the living stones are brought to rest on
   the Foundation, for it is clear that they cannot come to the Foundation
   till first they are removed from their native bed in the pit of sin.
   Oh, may God's Grace continue to take out many of this congregation like
   stones divided from the quarry, that so by Grace they may come to
   Jesus!

   Well, after they had cut out those stones in the quarry, which, with a
   little imagination, you can see lying there, detached and distinct, the
   next operation was to pull them up to the top of Mount Zion. It was a
   long drag up to the summit of the hill. How Solomon managed to remove
   such enormous masses we do not know. If he had no machinery or motive
   force that could supersede manual labor, and the force on which he
   relied was in the sinews of men, the matter is all the more amazing!
   They must have pulled away, perhaps, many thousands of them at one
   single stone, hauling it out of the pit, dragging it up the zigzag
   roads till, at last, the gigantic mass reached its place.

   Now, there is a lifting, a drawing of the soul to Christ after this
   fashion and I see among you some who have recently been drawn. You have
   not been dragged by men. All the men in the world could not draw a
   sinner to Christ! No machinery is known or will ever be invented that
   can ever draw a proud, stubborn will to Christ! We may tug and pull
   till we break the ropes, but we shall never make a soul stir one inch
   toward Christ! But there is another power which can accomplish the work
   impossible to us. "I, if I am lifted up," says Christ, "will draw all
   men unto Me." He has such attractive power that He draws the stones out
   of the quarry of nature, right up to the Foundation which His free
   Grace has laid in Zion and they are built upon Him. This is the second
   part of the work of Grace in the soul--first it separates us from the
   rock, and then it draws us up to the Foundation. And in both it is
   working out our coming to Christ.

   Well, we have watched the stone as it has been carried up. What is the
   next process? Why, the next work is to let it down so that it lies in
   due order upon the foundation. The foundation of the temple very likely
   was far below the adjacent soil and so this mass of stone had to be let
   down to the foundation steadily and wisely, that it might rest in its
   proper bed. What a task it is sometimes--to let a huge stone down upon
   the foundation--and to get it to lie square and true so that every bit
   of it is in its proper position with the rest of the structure!

   Picture the process in your mind's eye. We have got the stone upon the
   base, but half of it projects beyond the foundation and, so far, it has
   nothing to lean upon. That will never do. It must be moved till it lies
   plumb with the foundation, exactly square with the other stones--and
   till every portion of it rests firmly on its proper bed. Oh, dear
   Hearts, this is one work which the Grace of God has to do with you--to
   bring you to lie upon Christ, to recline upon Christ, and that wholly,
   rightly, and squarely!

   It takes a long time to bring some sinners to this. They want to be
   propped up with a little bit of self-righteousness! They cannot be
   induced to lie right square upon Christ--they want to tilt a little,
   have a little shoring up with their own doings and a little dependence
   on themselves--but this will never do! "To whom coming," says the text,
   "coming as to a living stone." Oh, that almighty Grace would constrain
   you all to be coming till you lie flat and square on Christ! Till you
   have Christ at one corner and Christ at the other corner--and Christ at
   all the four corners where your soul lies-- till you are resting on the
   Lord Jesus Christ at all times, in all respects, under all
   circumstances, for everything! Other Foundation can no man lay! You
   must be sure that you rest wholly upon Jesus!

   "Bless the Lord," says one, "I know I have come as far as that! Can I
   get any farther?" Well, look, Brother, as long as ever that huge stone
   lies on the foundation it is always coming to the foundation! Its own
   weight is always pressing it down upon the foundation and the heavier
   it is, the more closely and compactly it lies. I feel myself, now, to
   be more close to Christ than ever I was! My weight of sin helps to
   press me down on Him. My weight of trouble, my weight of care, my
   weight of anxiety about the souls of my hearers and even my weight of
   joy all help me to press more on my Lord! The way to be coming to
   Christ, Brothers and Sisters, as long as you live, is to lean more on
   Christ, press more heavily on Christ, and depend more upon Christ than
   ever before!

   In this way, you know, some stones seem, by long abiding and pressing,
   to cleave to one another and unite together till they appear to be no
   longer distinct, but one mass. Have you not often noticed in an old
   Roman wall that you cannot distinguish the mortar from the stone? You
   cannot tell where the stones were joined--they have grown to be one
   piece. And blessed is that Christian who, like a living stone, has
   continued so to come to the Foundation till Christ and he have become
   one, as it were! Yes, one in conscious fact, so that nothing can divide
   them!

   Thus we continue to come to Jesus and draw nearer to Him--nearer and
   yet nearer, still, built up into Him-- perfectly joined in one spirit.
   Then, only then, shall Christian life be perfected! These two figures
   of the babe and the stone have shown you, I trust, what the text means.
   I have not gone far afield to find them--they lie, as you have seen, in
   the immediate context. "To whom coming" is an apt description of the
   whole of Christian life--mind that you make it the rule of yours.

   II. But now, secondly, I have to ANSWER THE QUESTION, what is the best
   way of coming to Christ at first? There are some poor hearts among you
   longing to be saved. "Ah," you say, "I hear that if I come to Christ I
   shall be saved. But how can I come to Him? What do you mean by coming
   to Jesus?" Well, our reply is plain and clear--it is to trust Christ,
   to depend upon Him, to believe Him, to rely upon Him. Then they
   enquire, "But how can I come to Christ? In what way would you recommend
   me to come?" The answer is, the very best way to come to Christ is to
   come with all your needs about you. If you could get rid of half your
   needs apart from Christ, you would not come to Jesus half so well as
   you can with the whole of them pressing upon you, for your need
   furnishes you with motives for coming and gives you pleas to urge.

   Suppose a physician should come into a town with motives of pure
   benevolence to exercise the healing art? What he needs is not to make
   money, but to bless the town. He does not intend to charge any or take
   any fees, but he lets it be known that he has come into the town to
   display his skills. He has a love to his fellow men and he wants to
   cure them and, therefore,, he gives notice that as he only wishes for
   opportunities of displaying his kindness and skill, the poorest will be
   welcome and the most diseased will be best received.

   Now, then, who is the man that can come to the doctor's door with
   confidence and give a good rat-tat-tat and feel that he will be
   welcome? Well, there is a person who has cut his finger--will the
   doctor rush into the surgery to attend to him? No doubt he will look at
   the cut, but he will not grow very enthusiastic over it, for doctors do
   not get much credit out of curing cut fingers! Here is another gratis
   patient who has a wart on his hand. Well, there is nothing very famous
   about curing warts and the physician is by no means excited over this
   work! But here is a poor forlorn body who has been given up by all the
   other doctors--a patient who is so bad that he lies at Death's door! He
   has such a complication of diseases that he could hardly tell what
   diseases he has not suffered from--and certainly his condition is
   terrible enough to make it appear hopeless.

   He seems to be a living wonder of disease. That is the man who may come
   boldly to the physician and expect his immediate attention and his best
   consideration! Now, Doctor, if you can cure this man, he will be a
   credit to you! This man exactly answers to your advertisement. You say
   that you only wish for patients who will give you an opportunity of
   displaying your skills. Here is a fine object for your pity! He has bad
   lungs, bad heart, bad feet, bad eyes, bad ears, bad head, bad all over!
   If you desire an opportunity of showing your skill, here is the man!
   Jesus, my Lord and Master, is the Great Physician of souls and He heals
   them on just such terms as I have mentioned. Is there a far gone sinner
   here tonight? Is there a deeply sin-sick soul anywhere within the range
   of my voice? Is there man or woman who is altogether bad? Come along,
   my Friends, you are just in a right condition to come to Jesus Christ!
   Come just as you are, that is the best style of "coming."

   Another illustration may be furnished by the common Scriptural figure
   of a feast. A king determines to act with generosity and, to show how
   liberal his disposition is, he desires to make a banquet for those who
   need it most. He says, "If I make a great feast for my lords and dukes,
   they will think little of my hospitality, for they fare sumptuously
   everyday. Therefore I will seek out guests who will be more likely to
   be grateful. Where shall I find guests who will most enjoy my dainties?
   Men who will eat with the greatest gusto and drink with the greatest
   delight?" Having considered the matter, he cries to his heralds, "Go
   into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in."

   From among the tramps by the roadside the heralds soon gather starving
   wretches who exactly meet the king's wishes. Here is a poor man who has
   had nothing to eat for the last 48 hours. Look at his eager delight at
   the sight of the

   food! If you want somebody to eat largely and joyfully, is not he the
   man? Look how he takes it in! It is wonderful how the provisions
   disappear before him! Here, again, is a poor woman who has been picked
   up by the wayside, faint for lack of bread. She has scarcely any life
   in her, but look how she begins to open her eyes at the first morsel
   that is placed before her, and what delight there is in her every
   expression as she finds herself placed at a table so richly loaded!

   Yes, the poorer, the more hungry, the more destitute the guests, the
   more honor is accorded to the king who feeds such mendicants and
   receives such vagrants to his table. Hear how they shout the king's
   praises when they are filled with his meat! They will never have done
   thanking him! Now, if I address a soul tonight that is very needy, very
   faint, very desponding, you are a fit guest for my Master because you
   have such a fine appetite for His generous repast of love! The
   greatness of your need is your fitness for coming to Christ--and if you
   want to know how to come--come just as you are! Tarry not to improve
   yourself one single atom--come as you are, with all your sin and
   filthiness and need about you--for that is the best way to come!

   If you want to know how to come aright the first time, I should answer,
   come to find everything you need in Christ. Do not come with a load of
   your own wealth. Remember what Pharaoh said to Joseph--"Also regard not
   your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours." Do not
   bring your old rubbish with you. "I thought I was to bring repentance."
   Do not attempt to do so, but look to Jesus for it! COMINGTO
   JESUS--ALWAYS COMING. Christ is exalted on high to give repentance and
   remission of sins. Come and receive a heart of flesh, for you cannot
   make one for yourself!

   "Oh, but I thought I was to bring faith." Faith, also, is the gift of
   Christ. It comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. Draw near,
   then, to that Word to find faith. Come for everything. "Oh, but I want
   to feel." And then, I suppose, after you have found a nice lot of
   feelings you will come to Christ, and say, "Lord, You are now able to
   save me, for my feelings are right"? What conceit! Come to Christ for
   feelings! Come to Christ for everything!

   "What?" says one, "Can you mean it, that I, an unfeeling, impenitent
   wretch, am bid to come at once and believe in Jesus Christ for
   everlasting life?" I mean just that! I do not mean to send you round to
   that shop for repentance and to the other shop for feeling--and to a
   third store for a tender heart--and then direct you to call on Christ,
   at last, for a few odds and ends. No, no, but come to Christ for
   everything!--

   "Come, you needy, come and welcome,

   God's free bounty glorify!

   True belief and true repentance,

   Every Grace that brings you near,

   Withoutmoney

   Come to Jesus Christ and buy." I heard of a shop, some time ago, in a
   country town where they sold everything, and the man said that he did
   not believe that there was anything a human being needed but what he
   could rig him out from top to toe. Well, I do not know whether that
   promise would have been carried out to the letter if it had been tried,
   but I know it is so with Jesus Christ! He can supply you with all you
   need, for, "Christ is All." There is not a need your soul can possibly
   have but the Lord Jesus Christ can supply it and the very best way to
   come, is to come to Him for everything! The best way to come to Christ
   is to come meaning to get everything and to obtain all the plenitude of
   Grace which He has laid up in store--and promised freely to give.

   Some poor souls who come to Jesus Christ seem as if they need a little
   relief from fear, a hope that they may just get saved and a fair chance
   of going to Heaven when they die. Pray do not come in that way, my dear
   Friend! Come intending to obtain the fullness of love, the uttermost of
   Grace! Some time ago, when there was a dinner given to poor people,
   they were told to come and they should have all they could eat. Do you
   know what they did, some of them? There was not to be any dinner till
   six o'clock. Well, that they might have a noble appetite, they did not
   eat any breakfast--not they! They meant to get all they could, now they
   had an opportunity, and so they came as hungry as possible.

   Many years ago, I am told, it used to be the custom of the lord of the
   manor, in certain villages, on Christmas Day to give the poor people a
   basin of food. The rule was that whatever basin was brought, his
   lordship always filled it. It was perfectly marvelous how the basins
   grew, till at last, when some of the women came with their basins, the
   lord of the manor looked at the huge bowls and wondered how they could
   dare to bring such huge vessels! But he was a man of a

   generous heart--all he would say to his steward would be, "These people
   believe in my generosity. Go and fill their bowls. Fill and fill on
   till you have filled them all. As long as they bring their bowls none
   shall say that I denied them."

   And now, when you go to Christ, take a spacious vessel of large prayer
   and great expectation! Enlarge your desire and make up your mind to
   this--"I am not going in to be a miserable Christian, with barely
   enough Grace to keep me from open profanity, to whitewash me with a
   respectable profession and ensure me against the peril of everlasting
   perdition. I mean to take a higher aim and to seek a better portion!
   Gladly would I vie with saints and angels and be the most happy, the
   most useful, the most joyous, the most holy Christian that ever lived,
   if God will help me to be so."

   I wish we had some of the old Methodist fire back among us again. Some
   of those dear old people, if they did not know much, used to enjoy much
   and when they went to hear a sermon they listened with a zest, for they
   received the Word of God as a fresh inspiration--it was a lively oracle
   to them. The Gospel, as it was preached to them, awoke an echo in their
   hearts! They were all alive to its good cheer and they shouted, "Amen,
   hallelujah, bless the Lord," as they heard it, for it went home to
   their souls!

   Nowadays we are very proper and decorous in our behavior, all of us,
   and we are not a little critical in our tastes. As we pick up a crumb
   of the Gospel we like to know whether it is the real aerated bread
   baked in a tin, or whether it is the common household bread of the
   shops. The preacher is a "little odd" and he does not cut the bread
   exactly into dice pieces, and so we do not like the manner of service,
   for we are rather fastidious and we air our own conceits by
   faultfinding. Because the Lord's servant does not very daintily bring
   us our portion on a silver platter and hold it out to us, we curl our
   lips and say, "No, thank you."

   Oh, may God deliver us from the fashionable stiffness and artificial
   nonsense! May He revive in us the reality both of nature and Divine
   Grace so that we may come to His table of love with a good appetite!
   Modern Christians remind me of our boyish days, when we went to bathe
   in the sea and used to dip our toes in the waves instead of taking a
   plunge head first. I am sure that to plunge right in is the best way
   with religion! Throw your whole soul into it and allow the glorious
   waves of everlasting love to go right over your head! And then dive and
   swim in that sea which is bottomless and rejoice in the Lord with all
   your heart!

   But this mere dabbling about with goody-goody goodliness, instead of
   the grand old godliness, makes professors all of a shiver and they
   stand in doubt, as though they hardly liked it, and would rather get
   back to the world and put on their old clothes again--only they are
   half afraid to do so. Oh, may the Lord grant us Divine Grace to come
   with all our needs to Him--to come to Him for everything and to come
   determined to have everything that is to be had, and to go in for it
   thoroughly! That is the way to come to Christ!

   III. There remains one other question--WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO COME
   AFTERWARDS? The answer is--

   Come just as you used to come! Brothers and Sisters, the text does not
   say that you have come to Christ, though that is true, but that you are
   coming--and you are to be always coming. The way to continue coming is
   to come in the same way as you came at first. I have many things to say
   about this, but my time has gone and, therefore, I will not enlarge,
   but I will only put them in brief.

   I am persuaded that the only happy--the only safe way for a Christian
   to live is to live in daily dependence upon the mercy of God in Jesus
   Christ--just as he did when he was a babe in Grace and a stone newly
   drawn from the quarry of nature. I know what it is to build up a nice
   structure of my own experience on the Foundation of Christ and to climb
   upon it instead of standing on my own foundation. If you were ever on
   the top of Snowdon, or some other high mountain, you will have noticed
   that to make the standing a little higher they put up some wooden
   scaffold or other-- some 10 or 12 feet of platform to increase the
   elevation--and then everybody wants to get up on that platform.

   Well, now, I have built my little platform on Christ. My own experience
   has made a very handsome edifice, I can tell you. I have felt, "Well, I
   know this and that and the other by experience," and I have been quite
   exalted. Sometimes, too, I have built a platform of good works--"I have
   done something for Christ, after all." The proud flesh says, "Oh yes,
   you really have performed something you might talk about if you liked."
   Self-confidence has piled my platform up and it has been a very
   respectable looking concern and I have even asked a few friends up.

   But, do you know what has occurred? Why, I have felt my platform shake!
   It began to tremble! Stress of weather has rotted the beams and the
   supports have begun to give way. And I have seen all my building tumble
   down--and I have gone down with it! And as I have gone down with it, I
   have thought, "It is all over with me now. I am going to crash

   down, I do not know how far, but perhaps I shall fall to the bottom of
   the mountain." Instead of that I alighted on the top of the mountain. I
   did not fall very far, but came right down where it had been most
   sensible of me if I had always kept, namely, on terra firma, down on
   the solid earth!

   I have noticed, lately, that a great many have been building some very
   pretty little wooden structures on the top of Jesus Christ. I think
   they call them, "the higher life," if I rightly remember the name. I do
   not know of any life that is higher than that of simple faith in Jesus
   Christ! As far as I am concerned, the highest life for me out of Heaven
   is the life of a poor publican saying, "God be merciful to me a
   sinner." My very good friends are not content with this position,
   though he who keeps it goes to his house justified more than boasters!
   Some friends built very high a little while ago--I thought they would
   soon reach the moon! But certain of them went down in a very ugly way,
   I have heard, and I am afraid some more will go down if they do not
   mind what they are doing.

   Give up building these artificial elevations! Give up resting on them
   and just stand on the level of Christ's finished work, the blood of
   Christ shed for sinners--the righteousness of Christ imputed to
   sinners! Be yours the humble plea--

   "I am the chief of sinners, But Jesus died for me."

   He that is down there will never fall--and he who stays there is really
   as high up as the man who thinks he is all aloft! All above living by
   faith in Christ is mere dream and moonshine! There is nothing higher,
   after all, than just being nobody, and Christ being everybody, and
   singing with poor Jack, the huckster--

   "I'm a poor sinner, and nothing at all, But Jesus Christ is my All in
   All." If you grow till you are less than nothing, you are full grown,
   but few have reached that stage! And if you grow till Christ is
   everything to you, you are in your prime! But, alas, how far short of
   this do most men fall! The Lord bring you to that highest of all
   growths--to be daily coming to Christ--always empty in yourself, but
   full in Him! Always weak in yourself, but strong in Him! Always nothing
   in self, but Christ your perpetual All in All! The Lord keep you there,
   Brothers and Sisters, and He will have praise and glory of you, both
   now and forever. Amen.

A Cheery Word in Troublous Times

   (No. 1335)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Therefore, Sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be
   even as it was told me." Acts 27:25.

   THE presence of a brave man in the hour of danger is a very great
   comfort to his companions. It is a grand thing to observe Paul so bold,
   so calm in the midst of all the hurly-burly of the storm. He was
   talking so cheerfully and so encouragingly to the crew and to the
   soldiers and to the prisoners. You must have seen, in many events in
   history, that it is the one man, after all, that wins the battle. All
   the rest play their parts well when the one heroic spirit lifts the
   standard. Every now and then we hear some simpleton or other talking
   against a "one-man ministry," when it has been a one-man ministry from
   the commencement of the world to the present day! And whenever you try
   to have any other form of ministry, except that of each individual
   saint discharging his own ministry, and doing it thoroughly and
   heartily and independently and bravely in the sight of God, you very
   soon run upon quicksand.

   Remember, Christian man, that wherever you are placed, you are to be
   the one man. You are to have courage and independence of spirit and
   strength of mind received from God, that with it you may comfort those
   around you who are of the weaker sort. So act that your confidence in
   God shall strengthen the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees-- and,
   by God's Grace, your calm, quiet look shall say to them that are of a
   faint heart, "Be strong! Fear not." If you are to do this, and I trust
   you will do it, in the sick chamber, in the midst of the troubles of
   life, in the Church and everywhere else, you must be strong!

   Take it as a good rule that nothing can come out of you that is not in
   you. You cannot render real encouragement to others unless you have
   courage within yourself. Now, the reason why Paul was able to embolden
   his companions was that he had encouraged himself in his God. He was
   calm, or else he could not have calmed those around him. Imagine him
   excited and all in a tremble, and yet saying, "Sirs, be of good cheer."
   Why they would have thought that he mocked them and they would have
   replied, "Be of good cheer yourself, Sir, before you encourage us." So
   my dear Brothers and Sisters, you must trust God and be calm and
   strong, or else you will not be of much service in the world and in the
   Church as you ought to be. Get full, and then you will run over, but
   you can never fill others till you become full yourselves.

   Be yourselves, "strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might," and
   then you will be, as a standard, lifted up to which the timid will
   rally. At this time we are going to speak very little about Paul, but a
   great deal to ourselves. May God speak to us! May the Holy Spirit cheer
   our hearts and lead us into the way of peace and power! If Paul was
   strong it was because he believed God! Let us speak about that faith.
   Paul, being strong, spoke words of good cheer to others. Let us, in the
   second place, see whether we cannot speak words of encouragement to our
   comrades in distress. We will finish up with such words as God may give
   us.

   I. First, then, PAUL WAS STRONG BECAUSE HE BELIEVED. Faith makes men
   strong--not in the head, but in the heart. Doubting people are
   generally headstrong--the Thomas sort of people who obstinately declare
   that they will not believe unless they can have proofs of their own
   choosing. If you read certain newspapers, journals, quarterly reviews
   and so on, you will see that the doubting people who are always
   extolling skepticism and making out that there is more faith in their
   doubt than in half the creeds, and so on, are particularly strong in
   the upper region, namely, in the head-- only it is that sort of
   head-strength which implies real weakness, for obstinacy seldom goes
   with wisdom!

   They are always sneering at Believers as a feeble folk, which is a
   clear sign that they are not very strong, themselves. This has been a
   rule without exception forever, that when a man despises his opponent,
   he is, himself, the party who ought to be despised. When certain
   writers rave about "evangelical platitudes," as they commonly do, they
   only see in others a fault with which they are largely chargeable
   themselves. Anybody who glances at the skeptical literature of the
   present day will bear me out that the platitudes have gone over to the
   doubting side of the house. No people can write such fluent nonsense
   and talk such absurdity as the school of modem doubt and "culture!"

   They think themselves the wisest of the wise, but, professing to be
   wise, they have become fools! And I know what I say. It is true that
   the evangelical party has become flat and stale, but the other party
   has beaten us at that. They are more dull, more stale and more
   unprofitable by far! When a man leaves faith, he leaves strength. When
   he takes up with "liberal" views in religion and does not believe
   anything in particular, he has lost the bone and sinew of his soul. It
   is true all round, in all things, that he who firmly believes has an
   element of power which the doubter knows nothing of. Even if a man is
   somewhat mistaken in what he believes, there is a power in his faith,
   though it may be, in part, power for mischief.

   There is, however, in a Believer, a world of power for good if the
   right thing is believed. Paul was a believer in God, and so became
   strong in heart. He was, on board the foundering vessel, the center of
   hope, the mainstay of courage. But notice that Paul's faith was faith
   in God. "I believe God," he said. Nobody else in the ship could see any
   hope in God. With the exception of one or two like-minded with Paul,
   they thought that God had forsaken them, if, indeed, they thought of
   God at all! But there had, that night, stood by Paul's side, an angel
   fresh from Heaven, bright with the Divine Presence and, strengthened by
   his message, Paul said, "I believe God."

   That was something more than saying, "I believe in God." This many do
   and derive but slender comfort from the belief. But, "I believe God,
   believe Him, believe His truthfulness, believe the Word that He has
   spoken, believe His mercy and His power. I believe God." This made Paul
   calm, peaceful, strong! Would to God that all professing Christians did
   really believe God! Believing God, he believed the message that God had
   sent him! He drank in every word and was revived by it. God had said,
   "Fear not Paul, I have given you all them that sail with you." He
   believed it! He felt certain that God, having promised it, was able to
   perform it, and amidst the howling of the winds Paul clung to that
   promise!

   He was sure that no hair of any man's head would be harmed. The Lord
   had said the preserving Word and it was enough for His servant! Has He
   said it and shall He not do it? Has He spoken it and shall it not come
   to pass? He believed God that it should be even as it was told him. And
   he did that--mark, dear Friends--when there was nothing else to believe
   in. "I believe God," he said. He might have said to the centurion, if
   he had pleased, "I do not believe in the sailors. They are evidently
   nonplussed and do not know what to do. We are driven before the wind
   and their sails and tackle are useless. I do not believe in the men,
   themselves, for they are plotting to get into the boat and leave the
   ship and all in it to go to the bottom. We must have them on board, but
   still, I have no trust in them, their help is of small account compared
   with the Divine aid."

   He did not say "I believe in you, the centurion, that you can maintain
   military discipline and so we shall have a better opportunity of
   escaping." No, the ship was breaking up! They had put ropes all round
   her, undergirding her, but he could clearly perceive that all this
   would not matter. The fierce hurricane was sweeping the vessel here and
   there, and driving her towards the shore. But Paul calmly said, "I
   believe God." Ah, that is a grand thing--to believe God when the winds
   are out--to believe God when the waves howl like so many wild beasts,
   and follow, one upon another like a pack of wolves all seeking to
   devour you. "I believe God." This is the genuine breed of faith--this
   which can brave a tempest!

   The common run of men's faith is fair-weather faith--faith which loves
   to see its beautiful image mirrored in the glassy waves--but is far
   away when the storm clouds are marshalling the battle! The faith of
   God's elect is the faith that can see in the dark! The faith that is
   calm in the tumult! The faith that can sing in the midst of sorrow! The
   faith that is brightest when everything around her is black as
   midnight. "I believe God," Paul said, when he had nothing else to
   believe in. "My Soul, wait only upon God, for my expectation is from
   Him." Say, O my Soul, "Though the earth is removed, and though the
   mountains are carried into the midst of the sea, will we not fear, for
   God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble."--

   "God lives still! Trust, my Soul, and fear no iil!

   Hea ven's huge vault may clea ve asunder,

   Earth's round globe in ruins burst.

   Devil's fullest rage may thunder,

   Death and Hell may spend their worst.

   Then will God keep safe and surely

   Those who trust in Him securely!

   Therefore then, my Soul, despair?

   Mid the shipwreck, God is there."

   Since the Apostle Paul believed God thus truly and really, he was not
   ashamed to say so. He said openly to all those around him, "There shall
   not a hair of your heads perish, for I believe God." Now, it is not so
   easy to thrust out your faith and expose it to rough weathers and to
   the hearing of rough men! Many a man has believed the promise but has
   not quite liked to say so, for there has been the whisper in his soul,
   "Suppose it should not come true, then how the enemy will rejoice! How
   those that listened to me will be saddened when they find that I was
   mistaken." Thus does the devil cause faith to be dumb and God is robbed
   of His honor.

   Under the name of prudence there lurks an unbelieving selfishness.
   Brothers and Sisters, lend me your ears that I may whisper in
   them--"You do not believe at all." That is not the legitimate sort of
   believing! Genuine faith in God speaks out and says, "God is true and I
   will stake everything on His Word." It does not swallow its own words
   and keep its thoughts to itself. But when the time comes and others are
   in difficulty and doubt, it cheers them by crying out, "I believe God."
   It is not ashamed to say, "The Lord Jesus, whose I am and whom I serve,
   stood by me this night and spoke with me, and I swear it."

   I would to God all Christians were prepared to throw down the gauntlet
   and to come out straight! For if God is not true, let us not pretend to
   trust Him! And if the Gospel is a lie, let us be honest enough to
   confess it! But if it is true, why should we doubt it and speak with
   bated breath? If God's promise is true, why should we distrust it? What
   excuse is there for this hesitancy? "Oh," says one, "but that might be
   running great risks." Risks with God, Sir? Risks about God's keeping
   His Word? It cannot be! "Let God be true and every man a liar." Let
   Heaven and earth return to chaos and old night, but the Most High
   cannot break His Word or run back from His promise! Therefore, O you
   Pauls, if you receive a message from the Most High, publish it abroad
   and let your faith be known!

   I should like that little word to drop into the ears of some of you who
   think you love Christ but have never told of your love--you that are
   hiding in the background. Come out and show yourselves! As for you who
   have long proclaimed your Savior, do it more and more and, "Speak His
   Word, though kings should hear, or yield to sinful shame."

   II. Now, if we have any measure of the faith of Paul, let us try
   whether we CANNOT CHEER OTHERS AS PAUL DID. Let the language of the
   text be on our tongues, "Therefore, Sirs, be of good cheer: for I
   believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me." First, you will
   meet with seeking souls. They have not found Christ, yet, but they are
   hungering and thirsting after Him. They are saying, "Oh that I knew
   where I might find Him!" You that believe God are bound to speak
   comfortably to them, and say, "Sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe
   God, that it shall be even as it was told me."

   There is one that is sorrowing for sin. Go and tell him that sorrow for
   sin is sweet sorrow and that no man should ever regret that he mourns
   his faults, but should be glad that God has enabled him to feel a holy
   grief, a penitential pain. Gotthold tells us that he was called, one
   day, to see a man who, when he entered his chamber, burst into many
   tears. It was a long time before the good Divine could discover what
   made him so unhappy. At last the man broke out, saying, "Oh, my sin,
   how I hate it! My sin, how I sorrow over it!" Whereupon Gotthold, who
   had been sad at the sight of his sadness, smiled and said, "Friend,
   your sadness is my gladness! I never behold a happier sight than when I
   see a man sorrowing for his sin!"

   "Oh," said the other, "really?" "Yes, indeed," he said, "there are many
   mourners who mourn for others, but blessed are they that mourn for
   themselves! There are many who are sorry because they cannot have their
   own will, but," he said, "there are few enough that sorrow because they
   have had their own will and have disregarded the will of the Lord. I
   rejoice," he said, "for such as you are those for whom Jesus died! Come
   and trust Him, for when there is sorrow for sin there will soon be joy
   for pardon!" Now, whisper in the ears of those who are penitent. Tell
   the mourner that God has promised to turn his night into day and his
   sackcloth into beauty!

   Perhaps you will meet with another whose condition is that he is
   pleading, daily, for mercy. "Oh," he says, "I have been praying and
   praying and praying! I cannot let a day pass without asking for
   forgiveness but somehow my prayers seem to come back to me. I get no
   favorable replies." Brother, to a man in this plight you should speak
   up and say, "Be of good cheer, Friend, for I believe God, that it shall
   be even as He told me, and He told me this--'Ask, and it shall be given
   you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened.'" Tell
   the praying soul that praying breath was never spent in vain and that,
   in due time, "He that asks, receives." To withhold your testimony will
   be cruelty to the seeking one and a robbery of God, to whose honor you
   are bound to speak!

   Possibly you will meet with another who is saying, "I am beginning,
   now, to venture myself upon Christ. I am desiring to believe, but oh,
   mine is such a feeble confidence. I think I trust Him, but I am afraid
   I do not. I know there is no other Savior and I give myself to Him,
   but, still, I am jealous of my heart, lest mine is not true faith."
   Tell that soul that Jesus has plainly said, "Him that comes to Me I
   will in nowise cast out," and then say, "Be of good cheer: for I
   believe God, that it shall be even as He has told me." Tell the
   trembling heart that Jesus never did yet reject one Believer, however
   trembling might be his trust! Whoever believes in Him is not condemned!
   Let the comfort you feel in coming to Christ, yourself, thus be handed
   on to other seekers, even as the disciples passed the loaves and fishes
   among the hungry multitudes.

   Perhaps you will find one who says, "I desire the renewal of my nature.
   I am so sinful! I can believe in Christ for pardon, but my heart is
   terribly deceitful and I feel such strong passions and evil habits
   binding me that I am sorely afraid." Go and say to that soul, "His name
   is called Jesus, for He shall save His people from their sins." Tell
   that anxious one that the Lord can take away a heart of stone and give
   a heart of flesh. Say that Christ has come to bring liberty to the
   captives and to set men free from the bonds of sin! And tell them that
   you believe God, that it will be even as He has told you--and He has
   told you and you know it is true--that He will purge you from sin and
   sanctify you wholly! Any soul and every soul that comes trustingly to
   Jesus and rests in Him shall find sanctification in Him so that sin
   shall be hated, avoided, and conquered!

   I do not know how I shall manage it, but I wish that I could, in two or
   three words, say something that would make every Christian here look
   out after poor seeking souls with tenfold eagerness! I do not know what
   to say, except this. There is a Brother in this house tonight. There
   was one here two Sabbaths ago who never needed me to tell him to
   sympathize with anxious souls. He was always up here in the great
   congregation looking out, and then down in the Prayer Meeting below on
   the same errand. Many persons have been invited from this upper service
   to go down below and have there been spoken with by him concerning the
   Lord Jesus. It was our dear Brother, Verdon, who was a mighty
   soul-hunter before the Lord and he lived to seek after souls.

   He is gone, and my heart mourns him. Alas, my Brother, when shall I
   ever, again, see such an one as you were? Now, I want each one of you
   to try to fill up his place. Keep your eyes on any who seem to feel the
   power of the Word, and then step up with an encouraging word, somewhat
   like that of the Apostle, "Sirs, I believe God, that it shall be even
   as it was told me." Now, there is another set of people who are saved,
   but they are Little-Faiths, and I want you Strong-Faith people to
   encourage them by telling them that you believe God that it shall be
   even as it was told you. Some of these Little-Faiths are conscious of
   very great inward sin. They thought, when they believed in Christ, that
   they would never feel any more conflicts--their notion was that they
   should be saved from the assaults of sin the moment they were born unto
   God.

   But now they discover that the old viper within is not dead! He has had
   a blow on the head, but he is not dead! They see lusts and corruptions
   moving within their hearts and they cannot understand it. Go and tell
   them that you feel the same, but that, thanks be to God, He gives you
   the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! The poor young soul that is
   just struggling out of darkness into light, and beginning to contend
   with inward corruption, will be greatly comforted if you thus state
   your experience and declare your faith in the ultimate issue. In the
   case of some others of these Feeble-Faiths, the trouble is that they
   are vexed with outward temptation.

   Many a young man says, "It is hard to be a Christian where I work."
   Many a young woman has to say, "Father and Mother are against me."
   Others have to complain that all their associations in business tempt
   them to that which is evil and that they have few to help them. Go and
   tell them of the Lord All-Sufficient! Remind them, "He keeps the feet
   of His saints." Tell them to pray, day by day, "Lead us not into
   temptation, but deliver us from evil." Tell them that there is strength
   enough in Christ to preserve His own. Bid them hide under the shadow of
   His wings! You have done so and found a happy shelter and, therefore,
   you may confidently say to them, "Sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe
   God, that it shall be even as it was told me."

   You will find others whose lamentation is, "I am so weak! If I am a
   Christian, yet I am good for nothing! I have little liberty in prayer,
   or power to edify anybody. I think I am the most useless of all the
   family." Tell them, "He gives power to the weak and to him that has no
   strength He increases might." Tell them the Lord does not cast away the
   little ones, but He, "carries the lambs in His bosom and gently leads
   those that are with young." Tell them of the faithfulness and

   tenderness of the Good Shepherd and say, "Sirs, be of good cheer: weak
   as you are, the Lord's strength will sustain you! And as He has
   promised to preserve His own and has evermore preserved me, do not
   doubt, for it shall be to you even as the Lord has told me."

   Perhaps they will say, "Ah, but I am beset by Satan! Blasphemous
   thoughts are injected into my soul! I am driven to my wits' end." Then
   tell them that the Lord enables His people to cry, " Rejoice not over
   me, O my enemy, for though I fall yet shall I rise again." Tell them
   that when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will
   lift up a standard against him! As they feel their danger, point them
   to their great Protector, the Lord Jesus, who has come to destroy the
   works of the devil! And say, "You will conquer him, you will conquer
   him yet. The Lord will bruise Satan under our feet shortly. Sirs, be of
   good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as He has told
   me." There is much work for happy Christians among the Feeble-Minds,
   and the Miss Much-Afraids, and the Mr. Despondencies and the like. I
   earnestly hope that they will set about it.

   Now, if you have performed these tasks, I commend to your attention a
   third class of persons, namely, those who are greatly tried. God has a
   very tried people abroad in the world. I learned a lesson the other day
   which, I think, I never can forget. I was asked, after preaching a
   sermon, to go and see a lady who suffered from rheumatism. Now, I know
   by bitter experience what rheumatism is. But when I saw one whose
   fingers and hands had all lost their form through pain, so that she was
   incapable of any motion beyond the mere lifting up of her hand and the
   letting it fall again--when I saw the pain marked on her countenance
   and knew that for 22 years she had suffered in agony, then I said, "You
   have preached me a sermon upon patience and I hope I shall profit by
   it. How dare I be impatient if you have to suffer so?"

   Now, if you go and see sick folk--and I suppose you do, and if no
   sickness comes to your own house--say to them, "Sirs, be of good cheer,
   for it shall be even as God has told me." And what has He told you?
   Why, that He will support His people in the most severe afflictions.
   "In six troubles I will be with you, and in seven there shall no evil
   touch you!" Tell them that the Lord will bless His people's troubles,
   for, "all things work together for good to them that love God." Tell
   them that God will bring His people out of the trouble some way or
   other, for He has said, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but
   the Lord delivers him out of them all."

   And if you will tell them these precious things, believing them
   yourself--for that is the main point--having experienced the truth of
   them, yourself, your testimony will comfort them. You will meet with
   some that have been bereaved, who have lost the light of their house
   and have seen the desire of their eyes taken away with a stroke. Cheer
   them and tell them of the sweet things that God has said concerning the
   bereaved. He is "the Judge of the widow and the Father of the
   fatherless," and make a point of declaring your belief that He is so.
   You will meet with godly folks who are under testing trials. Many young
   people have to go through severe tests.

   I mean trials like this--"Will you take this employment, young man? The
   wages are sufficient, are they not?" "Yes, Sir, I should be well
   content. I do not think I shall get a better situation as far as money
   goes." "You understand that you will not have the Sabbath to yourself
   and that we want no religion here. Now, young man, what do you say to
   that? Do not think twice about it, my Friend, but say, "No, 'what shall
   it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?'"
   Speak right straight out and do not be afraid to give up the tempting
   offer. Many Christians can tell you, "be of good cheer," for if you do
   this, God will bless you. You shall have, even in this life, your
   recompense, as well as in the life to come if you can be decided and
   steadfast to stand for God and keep His way!

   I could mention many Christians who would tell you that when they were
   tested the Lord helped them to stand fast and that they have to bless
   Him for it every day of their lives. Whereas certain others have
   temporized and given way a little--and they have got out of God's ways
   and have had to run from pillar to post all their lives long--and
   though they are still Christians, yet they never enter into the joy of
   their Lord. O Sirs, be of good cheer when you have to suffer for
   Christ's sake, for He is able to give you much more than you will ever
   lose by Him! And above all He will give you peace of conscience which
   is worth all the mines of California!

   Should you come under persecution, any of you, I hope you will be met
   by your fellow Christians who will tell you not to be afraid, for the
   Lord can make you increasingly to rejoice the more you are despised and
   persecuted. Believe that and you shall find it true. And, O you tried
   people of God, you that have lost the light of His countenance--those
   of us who rejoice in God would come to you and bear witness that He has
   only forsaken you for a little while--He will return to you in the
   fullness of His mercy! We believe God that whether the season is dark
   or light, and whether the road is

   rough or smooth, His heart is still the same and He will not turn aside
   from the salvation of one of His chosen people! Thus, dear Friends, you
   have good scope for your faith to exercise itself in comforting others.
   Lay yourselves out in this delightful service!

   I have yet another set of good folks to speak to. We have some
   Christian people about who tremble greatly for the ark of the Lord. I
   occasionally meet with good Brothers and Sisters, very good Brethren,
   who are tempted to commit the sin of Uzzah--to put forth their hand to
   steady the ark because the oxen shake it--as if God could not protect
   His own cause! Some say that the good men are all dying--I have even
   heard that they are all dead! But I am not quite sure of it. And they
   ask, as the fathers fall asleep and one after another of the pillars of
   the House of God are taken away, what will become of the Church? What
   will become of the Church? "My Father! My Father! The chariot of Israel
   and the horsemen thereof!" What will become of the truth, the cause,
   and the Church?

   You know the good Methodist woman's outcry at the funeral sermon when
   the minister said, "Now that this eminent servant of the Lord is
   departed, we know of no one to fill his place. The standard-bearers are
   removed and we have none left at all to be compared with them. It seems
   as if the glory were departing and the faithful failing from among
   men." The worthy mother in Israel called out from the aisle. "Glory be
   to God, that's a lie!" Well, I have often felt inclined to say the same
   when I have heard a wailing over the absence of good and great men--and
   melancholy prophecies of the awful times to come! "Glory be to God, He
   will never let His Church die out for lack of leaders! He has a grand
   reserve somewhere!"

   If all the men who preach the Gospel, today, were struck down in the
   pulpit with apoplectic fits tomorrow, the Holy Spirit would still
   qualify men to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ! We are, none of us,
   necessary to Him, nor is any mere man necessary to God! Do not get into
   that state of mind which makes you attach undue value to men or means.
   The salvation of souls is God's work--and if it is God's work it will
   go on! Be quite sure of that. There is no fear of any work falling to
   the ground which has Jehovah for its Builder! In this Church of ours at
   the Tabernacle, we gradually lose our leaders and I have heard it said,
   and I must confess that I have almost thought, "If So-and-So were gone,
   nobody would ever fill her place or his place."

   Such earnest and holy individuals seem to be essential and we feel that
   their removal would be fatal. Yet it is not so, dear Friends! It is not
   so! Others arise and God's work still goes on. Christians ought to be
   as confident as the heroic Spartans. The old men advanced in procession
   and they said, "We have been brave," and they showed their scars. And
   then the strong men, in the prime of their days, followed and said, "We
   are brave," and they bared their arms for war! Then if anyone wondered
   what would happen when the old men were gone and when the strong men
   were slain in battle, there came the boys and the striplings behind,
   and they said, "We will be brave, for we are Spartans!" I see my
   gray-headed Brothers and Sisters going off the stage and I bless God
   that, though they do not say it, I can say it of them-- "They have been
   brave."

   Blessed be God, we have, also, a good staff of active workers of whom I
   may say, though they must not say it, "They are brave." And yonder are
   the young soldiers coming on--the young men and the young women! I see
   in their very faces that they are smiling at the thought of being
   numbered with the hosts of Christ and I am persuaded they mean to be
   brave and to stand up for the good old cause--and for the blood-stained
   banner of Christ--even as their fathers have done! Instead of the
   fathers shall be the children--God make them far better soldiers than
   we have been! Brethren, do not let us be discouraged, for I believe
   God, that it shall be even as it was told me--"The Lord has been
   mindful of us, He will bless

   us."

   Many minds are in a state of great distress about the spread of error.
   I do not know what is going to happen to England according to the
   weeping prophets. The signs of the times are very bad and the would-be
   prophets say that a dreadful storm is coming on. My barometer does not
   indicate anything of the kind! But theirs stand at, "much rain," or
   "stormy." Not long ago I walked with a very excellent man, whose name I
   will not mention because I think he must have been ill that morning. He
   told me that he believed that he should live to see the streets of
   London run with blood on account of the unbridled democracy, the
   atheism and the radicalism of the times. In fact, he thought that
   everything was out of joint, and we were going--I do not know where!

   It is not long ago and I remember that I pulled him by the sleeve and
   said, "But, my dear Friend, God is not dead." Now, that is my comfort!
   God is not dead and He will beat the devil, yet! As surely as Jesus
   Christ won the victory on the

   Cross, He will win the victory over the world's sin! It is true it is a
   hard time for Christianity. Infidels are fighting us with new
   arguments--but when I think of them I feel inclined to say what the
   Duke of Wellington said at Waterloo to the generals--"Hard pounding,
   Gentlemen! Hard pounding! But we will see which will pound the
   longest." And so we say--it may be "hard pounding" for the Christian
   Church, but we shall see who can pound the longest!

   Up to now--these 1,800 hundred years or more--the Gospel gun has gone
   on pounding and has neither been spiked nor worn out! As for our
   opponents, they have changed their guns a good many times! Our Gospel
   cannon has blown their guns and gun carriages and gunners all to
   pieces--and they have had to set up new batteries every year or two.
   They change their modes, their arguments, their tactics--but we glory
   in the same Cross as Paul did, and preach the same Gospel as Augustine,
   and Calvin, and Whitefield and the like! All along, the testimony of
   Jesus Christ has still been the same! The precious blood has been
   exalted and men have been bid to believe in Jesus! Pound away,
   Gentlemen! We shall pound the longest and we shall win the day! If we
   believe God in that fashion, let us turn round to our discomfited
   Brethren and say to them, "Sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God,
   that it shall be even as it was told me."

   The last class that I shall notice will be our Brothers and Sisters who
   are laboring for Christ. Sometimes workers for the Lord get cast down.
   "I have taught a class for years," says one, "and have seen no fruit."
   "I have been preaching at the corner of the street for months but have
   never heard of a conversion," says another. "I have been visiting the
   lodging-houses, but I have never met with a convert." Well, dear
   Brother, do you think that you have preached Jesus Christ and nothing
   has come of it? If you do, you must be a very unbelieving Brother! I do
   not believe it for a moment! I believe God, that it shall be even as He
   has told me, and He has said, "My Word shall not return unto Me void,
   but it shall prosper in the thing where I sent it."

   Perhaps you preach unbelievingly. Now, an unbelieving word is not God's
   Word! If you preach confidently and teach trustfully, believing in the
   power of the Spirit of God and so exhibiting Jesus Christ to your
   children and to your hearers, there are sure to be results. The
   raindrops return not to Heaven and the snow flakes climb not back to
   the treasure house, but water the earth and make it bring forth and
   bud! And even so shall God's Word be. It must prosper in the thing
   where He has sent it! Beloved Brother, do not give up! Dear Sister, do
   not be discouraged! Go on! Go on! If you do not see results today, you
   must wait and work on, for the harvest will come. "He that goes forth
   and weeps, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again rejoicing,
   bringing his sheaves with him."

   Be not so cowardly as to say, "I will leave the work." You are not to
   win a battle in a moment, or reap a harvest as soon as you sow the
   seed! Keep on! "Be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work
   of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in
   the Lord." We say this to you because we are confident, ourselves, and
   would have you confident also. Sirs, be of good cheer. God has been
   true to us and given us success. And we believe that it shall be to you
   even as He has told us.

   III. Now, I have done the sermon, but I had intended, if time had held
   out, to give ONE OR TWO WORDS OF

   PERSONAL TESTIMONY TO THE FAITHFULNESS OF GOD by declaring that the
   Lord has always acted to me as

   He has promised me. I will give one or two. When I was converted to
   God, as I read the Scriptures I found that Believers ought to be
   baptized. Now, nobody around me saw things in that light--but it did
   not matter to me what they thought, for I looked at it carefully for
   myself. Parents, friends--all differed--but Believers' Baptism, seemed
   to me, to be Scriptural, and, though I was a lad, God gave me Grace to
   be honest to my conscience and to follow the Lord in that respect as
   fully as I could.

   Have I had any cause to regret it? It seemed, then, that I might soon
   have grave cause for doing so, but I have had none. It has, on the
   other hand, often been a great comfort to my soul to feel that I did
   not trifle with my convictions. And I should like to urge you, young
   people, whether on that matter or any other, if you have received light
   from God, never to trifle with it. Follow the Lord fully and I can say,
   as the result of actual experience, "Sirs, be of good cheer. No harm
   will come to you if you are faithful to God and to your consciences."

   Again, when I came to London as a young minister, I knew very well that
   the doctrines which I preached were by no means popular, but I, for
   that very reason, brought them out with all the more emphasis. What a
   storm was raised! I was reading, the other day, a tirade of abuse which
   was poured upon me about 20 years ago. I must have been a horribly bad
   fellow, according to that description, but I was pleased to observe
   that it was not I that was bad1 Now, 24 years or so

   later, what can I say of the results? Why, that no man loses anything
   by bringing the Truth of God right straight out! If he believes a
   doctrine, let him speak it boldly!

   Mr. Slapdash, as Rowland Hill called the bold preacher, will, after
   all, succeed! Let no minister say, "That is too Calvinistic and
   Calvinism is at a discount. That is too nonconforming, and if you dare
   to speak against the Church of England somebody will be very vexed.
   Trim your sails! Preach smoothly! Whenever you have anything to say,
   polish it and put it in such a neat way that nobody can object. As the
   great goddess Diana, nowadays, is unsectarian, try and be unsectarian.
   And preach and teach all that is sweet and soothing and velvety and
   teachy--and you will succeed."

   Now, how has it turned out with me? I wish to bear this witness, not
   about myself, mark, but about the Truth of God which I have preached.
   Nothing has succeeded better than preaching out boldly what I have
   believed and standing to it in defiance of all opposition and never
   caring a snap of the fingers whether it offended or whether it pleased!
   Young man, if you are beginning life now, I charge you begin so that
   you can keep on, with a straightforward, honest reliance in God, for be
   sure of this--the Truth of God will reward those who love it--and all
   who lose for its sake are great gainers!

   Be steadfast in following your convictions. I cannot help saying it,
   because some of you, perhaps, are beginning to temporize a little. I
   would say to you, "Stand up straight and proclaim the Truth of God and
   then be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it shall be even as He
   has told me!" May God grant that this little personal testimony may
   tend to put backbone into certain Christians, for we have a molluscous
   company of professors about who do not believe anything! They shape
   their creed according to the mind of the last person they meet!

   Go, dear Brethren, and pray God to cleanse your hearts of that evil if
   you have ever indulged in it! Believe God! Take every letter of His
   Book and hang to it as for dear life! And in little, as well as in
   great things, keep to the statutes and precepts and ordinances and
   doctrines of the Lord as they are committed to you! As surely as you do
   this, the Lord of Hosts will bless you! First rest in Jesus by a simple
   faith in Him and then treasure up His every Word and keep His every
   command. So shall the blessing of God be with you from now on and
   forever. May His Holy Spirit work this in you! Amen.

A Family Sermon

   (No. 1336)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And the Lord said unto Noah, Come you and all your house into the
   ark...And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood." Genesis
   7:1, 7.

   GOD in infinite Grace had entered into Covenant with Noah that He would
   preserve him and his family alive. The tenor of that Covenant you will
   find in the 18th verse of the 6th chapter. "With you will I establish
   My Covenant; and you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and
   your wife, and your sons' wives with you." There was a positive
   foretelling of Noah's coming into the ark and finding safety. The thing
   was fixed and ordained so to be, and yet, when the time came, Noah was
   not carried into the ark by force, nor lifted into it against his will
   by a benevolent violence. He was bid to come into the ark in the most
   natural manner possible and he entered it voluntarily and cheerfully.
   He and his family left their houses to find a home in the ark, and so
   they were saved.

   The Covenant promise and purpose were fulfilled, but Noah acted in
   perfect freedom, as much choosing to go into the ark as others chose to
   keep out. Now, Beloved, there is a decree in Heaven ordaining the
   salvation of the Lord's chosen people. It is useless to deny that
   decree, for even if it were not so, yet no difficulty would be
   withdrawn, it would only be shifted to another place. Some of us,
   instead of denying predestination, like to think upon it and find
   rivers of consolation springing from the everlasting purpose of the
   living God.

   But, albeit that God has purposed and decreed the salvation of His
   elect, yet this by no means prevents our speaking, in the Lord's name,
   to all men. Nor does it set aside the necessity that those men should
   cheerfully accept the Gospel of God and awaken themselves to obey its
   command, by the power of Grace. My Hearer, I cannot tell whether your
   name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation
   of the world, but I can assure you that to you is the word of this
   salvation sent and that it bids you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ
   with this assurance--that if you do so you shall be saved, for so has
   the Lord most solemnly declared!

   The method of the Divine arrangement involves an active consent on our
   part and a willing obedience to the Gospel command. The purpose is
   sure, but it is unknown and unrevealed till the Gospel is made known
   and brought home with effectual power so that the heart accepts it, the
   spirit obeys it and the man is saved--saved as a free agent. He is
   saved as a voluntary being, yet not saved apart from the secret,
   almighty purpose of the Most High--nor without the effectual working of
   His Grace. And so we come here, at this time, believing that there are
   some in this house concerning whom the Lord has purposed that they
   shall be Christ's in the day of His appearing.

   We address you all hoping that the Spirit of God will apply the Word
   with special power to the chosen, that they may see that they,
   themselves, must believe in Jesus--that they must be actively awakened
   to repentance, to prayer, to a change of life, to confidence in Christ.
   When this shall happen, then shall the Covenant purpose be known to
   them and fulfilled in them, for they shall be saved from the wrath to
   come! Not knowing, therefore, who is to come into this net, we cast it
   into the sea, believing that Christ knows every fish in the sea and
   what fish will come to the net. We do not wish to know this, ourselves,
   for it is quite enough for us to know how to cast in the net and to be
   fishers of men.

   The practical work belongs to us, but the result we leave with the
   Lord. There are two things in the two texts. The first is the
   call--"The Lord said unto Noah, Come you and all your house into the
   ark." The second is the obedience to the call--"And Noah went in, and
   his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark."

   I. First, then, THE CALL. We remark, at the outset, that it was a call
   from the Lord. "The Lord said unto Noah." You see, Noah was familiar
   with other forms of calls, for he had been the instrument of many. For
   many years he was a preacher of righteousness, and the principal office
   of a preacher is to herald his Master, to make proclamations and to

   call upon men in the name of the Lord to obey the Lord's Word. "To you,
   O men, do I call, and My voice is to the sons of men."

   But it was not by such calls as Noah could give that men were to be
   brought into the ark. For albeit we cannot doubt that he was a faithful
   minister and an earnest preacher. And, no doubt, he pleaded with the
   people day and night, yet, sad to say, not one beside his own family
   entered into the ark through Noah's labors. Perhaps his preaching may
   have been useful to his wife and to his sons' wives. If so, he had no
   mean reward for his pains. But to all outside of his family his word
   seems to have been powerless as to delivering them from death by the
   devouring flood. But now he was to know something of another call,
   differing in many respects--a call from the Lord of Heaven and earth
   whose Word is with power.

   The preacher can only give the general call and it is his duty to give
   it to all around him. He is to stand in the streets and lanes of the
   city and bid men come to the feast of Grace. Yes, he is to go into the
   highways and hedges and, as far as he can, to compel them to come in.
   But men do not come upon our compulsion or upon our call unless a
   secret something goes with our pleadings--a mysterious power, quiet,
   silent, omnipotent--making the voice of man to be the voice of the Holy
   Spirit and hiding within the shell of the outward call the kernel of
   the inner call! When the Lord said to Noah, "Come you," he did come.

   He did not put it off and say that surely it was meant for others. He
   felt it to be a personal call. It was "Come you." He knew that it was
   for himself. God the Holy Spirit speaks home to the inmost soul when He
   speaks to save--there is no putting off His voice as though directed to
   another. Noah did not feel inclined to controvert, or plead for delay,
   or object, or make excuses, or say he could not. When the Lord said to
   Noah, "Come you," Noah came. The call was effectual, and resistance was
   out of the question!

   It is true the Lord had, in a measure, spoken to the rest of mankind by
   Noah's ministry, but that form of the Lord's speaking in common
   pleadings and invitations can be resisted to men's destruction. They
   could close their ears against the common, or general call, and they
   did, for it was true then, as it is now, "many are called, but few are
   chosen." Myriads go to destruction with the honest call of God ringing
   in their ears which they willfully reject--

   "The worldlings willfully went on Rebellious till their day was past.
   They forced the lingering deluge down And perished in their sins at
   last." When that silent call comes, which we are accustomed to speak of
   as "effectual calling," then, if there is resistance, it is sweetly
   overcome. The will finds itself no longer headstrong and obstinate. The
   judgment, darkened before, becomes light, and the soul, before
   motionless, cries, "Draw me, I will run after You."

   Happy are the men to whom such a call comes from God Himself! I ask
   you, my dear Hearers now present, whether you have ever had God dealing
   with you in this powerful, this inward, this spiritual manner? If not,
   I am sure you have never come to Christ. If you have received no call
   but such as I can give you, such as my Brothers who aid me can give
   you, such as the most earnest evangelist can give you, you have been
   called in vain and are yet in your sins. If you are, indeed, the people
   of God, you must know that a voice in your souls, mysteriously
   persuasive and overpowering, has spoken to you and said, "Come to
   Jesus," and you have yielded to it.

   Happy are you, tonight, if you have been so called, for it is written,
   "Whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He justified, them He
   also glorified." Now, note that this call from God was of such a tenor
   that Noah was bound, personally, to come. It was a call to personal
   action. Noah must come. "Come you." It was not a call of this kind--
   "Now, Noah, sit where you are and you will be right. Wait, Noah.
   Patiently, quietly wait, and see what God will do." But, no! It said to
   Noah, "Come you." Noah must come and he must come to the ark, too. For
   him there was only one way of salvation--no more than for anybody else!

   He must come to the ark which God had bid him prepare as the instrument
   of safety--and he must come into it. It was of no use his coming near
   it, but he must come into it. Within its wooden walls he must hide
   himself. Within its vast chambers he must find a dwelling. And so, dear
   Soul, when God calls you, He will make you feel that you must come to
   Jesus--not wait and delay, but come by a distinct act of the soul to be
   immediately performed! And you must come to Christ, too, for believing
   in anything else will destroy, rather than save you! Your faith must
   come and place her whole reliance upon the great Sacrifice of Christ!

   You must come into Christ, too--so near to Him as to be in Him, to make
   Him your hiding place and your refuge from the storm. You must have an
   inward faith which takes you into the very inwards of Christ, hides you
   in His wounds, conceals you within Himself. When God calls Noah it is,
   "Come into the ark." And when God calls any sinner to Himself it is,
   "Come to Christ; be hidden in Christ that you may be preserved as the
   Lord's choice treasure." Come, make the Lord Jesus your refuge, your
   deliverance and your habitation!

   Now, it would have been of no use for Noah to have gone on making
   preparations for his dwelling in the ark. That he had done long enough.
   He had gathered all sorts of food for all the creatures that were to be
   lodged in that marvelous menagerie and now that he is bid to enter the
   ark, he does not say, "I must gather more hay and store up more corn
   and fruits." No, "Come you into the ark" finished all his labors. He
   must have done with preparing and actually enter the refuge. I know
   some of you have been thinking about your souls and praying, and
   reading good books, and attending meetings, and trying to get
   instruction.

   Well, so far, so good. But that is not the way by which you will find
   salvation. The call of God to your soul is, "Come into the ark," or, in
   other words, "Come now to Jesus and distinctly and finally commit
   yourself to Him. Just as Noah put himself in the ark, to sink in the
   ark or swim in the ark--to live in the ark or die in the ark. He
   committed his whole future to the ark and that is what you have to
   do--commit yourself and all that is about you entirely to the Lord
   Jesus Christ. Considerations, resolutions and preparations must come to
   an end and you must in very deed "come into the

   ark."--

   "O Jesus, Sa vior of the lost, Our ark and hiding place, By storms of
   sin and sorrow tossed We seek Your sheltering Grace. Forgive our
   wandering and our sin, We wish no more to roam; Open the ark and take
   us in, Our soul's eternal home."

   Neither would it have done for Noah to go round the ark to survey it
   again. No doubt he had examined, before, that ark of wood and been
   pleased to think its timbers were so sound. No insect could eat that
   bitter wood. It was a tree that would not rot. No doubt he was pleased
   with the architecture of the vessel, for he had built it with no
   surveyor there but his God and, it was, therefore, well built. God was
   the great Master of Noah's naval yard and had given him plans and
   specifications. It was quite right that Noah should inspect the huge
   vessel up and down and see to the caulking and make sure that it was
   well pitched inside and out, and so on.

   But now he must give up surveying and come to inhabiting. He must come
   into the ark to remain in it. And so must I, like you, my dear Hearers,
   to take an interest in the Person of Christ and in the way of
   salvation! It is a very hopeful sign when you survey the Ark of
   salvation and say, "How stoutly built, and how thoroughly well caulked
   it is. Never were timbers better put together, there is no fear of a
   leakage here! She will live out every storm that will ever beat upon
   her. She is a true lifeboat upon a stupendous scale."

   I like to hear a sinner say, "Christ is a great Savior! I perceive that
   He is able to save to the uttermost and I wonder at the wisdom and the
   goodness of God that He has devised such a way of salvation." So far,
   so good, dear Friend, but all your admiration of Jesus will not save
   you! You must come inside His ark! By a simple faith you must, at once,
   give yourselves up to Jesus to be saved in Him. No longer look at
   Christ externally, nor survey Him even with a grateful eye for what He
   has done for others. But come, now, and commit yourself to Him. There
   stands the door and you have to go through it, and enter into the inner
   chambers, or you will find no safety.

   Neither would it have been of any use for Noah to go up to the ark and
   stand against the door and say, "I do not say that I am not going in
   and I do not even say that I am not in already. I have got one foot in,
   but I am a moderate man and like to be friendly with both sides. I am
   in and yet not in. If the door was shut I do not know but that it would
   cut me in halves. But, anyway, I do not want to be altogether out and I
   do not want to be quite in. I should like to stand where I could hurry
   in as soon as I saw the water coming up, but, still, while there is
   another opportunity of taking a walk on the dry land, I may as well
   avail myself of it. There is no hurry about it, is there?

   "You see, if a man keeps his finger on the latch of the door, he can
   pop in as soon as ever he sees the first drop of rain descending, or
   the water coming up anywhere near him. But is there any reason for
   being so decided all at once? Everybody likes his liberty, you know,
   and does not want to be shut in before he needs to be, at any rate."
   No, that would not do for Noah. God said to Him, "Come into the ark,"
   and he went in at once. Noah must not hesitate, or linger, or halt, but
   in he must go--right in.

   And, O dear Souls, you that linger, you that are of two opinions. If
   you were wise and did but know the danger of being outside, and the
   bliss of being inside, instead of hesitating you would want to
   penetrate into the ark's inmost recesses and to take your place in the
   very center just as I desire to go right to the heart of Christ, into
   the very center of His inmost love, for there, only there, shall I be
   perfectly at rest! Do not hesitate! Decide! Decide at once! May the
   Spirit of God lead you to do so. I know you will not delay if the
   effectual call is now being given--you will be obedient to the heavenly
   vision at once.

   Now, go a little further. It is God that calls and Noah must, in very
   deed, personally and actually come. It is said, "Come into the ark."
   Now, notice that word, for it teaches us that in entering the ark, Noah
   would be coming close to His God. "Come you"--Why did it not say, "Go
   you?" Why, because God was inside and meant to be inside, in the ark,
   along with Noah and, therefore, He said, "Come you." Oh that blessed,
   "come"! We had it the other night, you know, when we preached from,
   "Come unto Me all you that labor and are heavy laden." "Come"--that is
   the Grace word! But, oh, it is the Glory word, too, for Christ will say
   at the last, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom
   prepared for you from before the foundation of the world."

   "Come." "God is in Christ Jesus, reconciling the world unto Himself,
   not imputing their trespasses unto them." And he that comes to Christ
   comes to God! If you find rest in Christ you will only do what the
   great God has done before you, for He rests in Christ Jesus! He smells
   a sweet savor of rest in the Redeemer's Sacrifice. If you delight in
   Christ you will only do what God has always been doing, for He delights
   in His Son--"This is my Beloved Son," He said, "in whom I am well
   pleased." There is no coming to the Father but by Christ--and he that
   comes to Christ has come to the Father--and he has seen and known the
   Father. Coming to Christ is coming to God!

   Now observe that what is meant here is this--dwellers in Christ are
   dwellers with God. To live in the ark was to live with God. Dwellers in
   Christ are under the protection of God, for to dwell in the ark was to
   have God for a guardian. Noah did as much as say, when he passed into
   the ark, "God is here and I have come to live with Him. God is Master
   and Protector, here, and I am come to be protected by Him." O Soul,
   when you can say, "I trust in Christ," then you may go on to say,
   "Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations." You may
   "joy in God through Jesus Christ, by whom, also, we have received the
   Atonement." Ah, how near to God that man is who dwells in Christ! When
   Christ is All in All to you, the Father Himself loves you and you may
   rejoice in a consciousness of communion and fellowship with

   Him.

   Now, notice that when Noah came to the ark, he must come there to find
   his all in it. All the food he needs he must find in the ark. Mistress
   Noah cannot go out to market any more. Her daughters can no longer go
   to the shops and the stores. Noah's sons cannot farm or trade, or hunt
   or dig for gold. Houses, lands, treasures will soon lie deep at the
   bottom of the flood. All Noah has is in the ark. It is his sole
   possession, his all, for which he has suffered the loss of all things
   and rejoices to have done so. From the time of his entrance he is to
   find all his pleasure in the ark. There are no outdoor amusements for
   himself or his family.

   He cannot even find pleasure in the scenery, for that is blotted out by
   the deluges of rain. The valleys have vanished and even the hills have
   disappeared as the deluge has increased. If he is to find any pleasure,
   he must find it inside the ark. It was a melancholy prospect, indeed,
   if he could look out the window--but his joy and delight lay within the
   chambers of the ark, for there was he saved--and there he dwelt with
   God! All his food, also, to supply his necessities he must find inside
   the ark. He had no barn nor warehouse to look to, and there was no port
   at which he could touch to take in cargo. Whatever need might arise, it
   must be met by the stores within the ark, for there was nothing outside
   but death.

   All his work was inside the ark, too. He had nothing to do, now, except
   within that vessel, no fields to plow, no shops to keep, nothing to do
   but what was inside the ark. Now, when a soul comes to Christ, it
   commits itself to Him for everything. Christ must feed it--you must eat
   no longer for your soul anything but the Bread of Heaven. Jesus must
   become meat and drink to you, for, "His flesh is meat, indeed, and His
   blood is drink, indeed." Now you are to find your

   pleasure in Him--your choicest delights, your sweetest joys--all in
   Christ Jesus who is our hope, our crown, our delight, our Heaven.

   And now, from now on, your service must be to Him only. "You are not
   your own, you are bought with a price," and all that you have to do in
   this world now lies within the circumference of Christ's will. The most
   common duties of life are now to be brought within the sacred circle.
   You have nothing to do outside in the waters of sin and self and Satan.
   You need neither fish in the waters of sin, nor go boating upon the
   waves of worldliness--you are in danger if you do. You are inside the
   ark, shut in with God, dead to the world and only alive in Christ
   Jesus, that you may be floated in Him out of the old world into "the
   new heavens and the new earth wherein dwells righteousness."

   Thus, you see, Noah, in coming into the ark, left everything and found
   everything--even as by us the world is forsaken and Jesus becomes our
   All in All--

   "Jesus, I my cross have taken, All to leave, and follow You. Destitute,
   despised, forsaken, You, from now on, my All shall be. Let the world
   despise and leave me,

   They have left my Savior, too: But my Lord will not deceive me, And in
   Him my all I view."

   Again, Noah must come into the ark never to go out again. "Come you,"
   says God, "into the ark." He is not to make a visit, but he is to be
   shut in. As far as that world was concerned, Noah was to be in the ark
   as long as it lasted. When the new world came, then he walked out in
   joyful liberty. But you and I, dear Brothers and Sisters, are in
   Christ, not to be there for a time, but to abide in Him forever and
   ever!

   If any man thinks to get any good by a transient profession of Christ,
   that man is grossly mistaken! If you imagine that you can take up
   religion and put it down again--that you can be Believers today and
   unbelievers tomorrow, you know nothing of the Grace of God, for the
   Grace of God begets a life and that life is incorruptible and lives
   forever-- nothing can destroy it or remove it. He that is really in
   Christ is like Noah in the ark--he is shut in by God's own hand. "None
   shall pluck them out of My hand," says Christ, and, truly, none shall
   ever take a soul out of the grip of Jesus Christ who is once within it.

   You come to Christ to be married to Him! You take Him to have Him and
   hold Him from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for
   poorer, in sickness and in health--and death, itself, shall not part
   you. "Who shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
   Jesus our Lord?" Noah, according to the Lord's command, must come in at
   once. "And the Lord said unto Noah, Come you into the ark"--come at
   once, "for yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
   40 days and 40 nights. And every living substance that I have made will
   I destroy from off the face of the earth."

   There was a door to the ark and that door was open. Indeed, we are not
   told that it had ever been shut since it had been made. There it stood,
   wide open. We never hear of anybody that ever went in and was driven
   out. We never hear of a single beast or bird, or even a creeping thing
   that there was but ever went in was cast out. So long as the door was
   open whoever came was welcome, but long-suffering was drawing to an
   end. The time was now come for Noah to go in and the time was also near
   when the door must be shut. And so, when the Spirit of God comes to
   persuade men sweetly in effectual calling, it is always in the present
   tense.

   The Lord never called any man by effectual Grace to believe in Christ
   next week. He calls them to believe in Christ directly, and one of the
   ways by which the effectual call may be judged is its presentness and
   its pressing character. It is "now, now, NOW!" Oh, may the Divine
   Spirit be pleading in some heart at this hour, saying, "Come to Jesus
   now, before the next word has left the speaker's mouth. Put your trust
   in Jesus before this service ends and you shall go your way to your
   chamber and to your bed justified and saved." The Spirit of God sweetly
   puts it, "Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation." Even
   as He did with Noah, who never dreamed of delays, but, when bid to
   come, came then and there--

   "Come to the ark, the waters rise The seas their billows fear!

   While darkness gathers over the skies,

   Behold a refuge near.

   Come to the ark, all, all that weep

   Beneath the sense of sin.

   Without, deep calls unto deep

   But all is peace within.

   Come to the ark, before yet the flood

   Your lingering steps oppose!

   Come, for the door which open stood

   Is now about to close."

   And now notice, once more--and that is a sweet part of it--that the
   Lord said, "Come you and all your house into the ark." How good it is
   of the Lord to think of our children! That He should save us, oh, we
   must always bless Him for that! But that He should have a word for our
   wife, a word for our son and a word for our daughter--this is
   overflowing mercy! I have heard of a man who was unkind enough to say
   that he married his wife, but he did not intend to marry all her
   family. And it sometimes happens that your love to a person is a good
   deal tried by that person's relatives and friends--but when the Lord
   Jesus Christ takes to His heart the master or the mistress of a house,
   He is willing to take all the household!

   He came to the jailor's house at Philippi and He looked on him with
   love, but He did not stay with Him only, He blessed all his
   household--so blessed them that they were all brought to believe in the
   Lord--and they were all baptized then and there! There have been other
   households upon which the Lord has looked in the same way. "Come you
   and your house," is it not? Am I reading correctly? Look at the
   passage! Look at it! It is not merely, "Come you and your house." We
   will read it again. "The Lord said to Noah, come you and all your house
   into the ark." "ALL." Oh, that blessed comprehensive word, "ALL!"

   Then Ham was not left out! Japheth the elder, as he is called in
   Genesis 10:21--I know not much for him or against him, but he had faith
   enough to enter the ark and he was saved like the rest. Shem, the
   second of the household, if I may judge from his descendants, was
   always a religious young man, devout and attached to the worship of the
   true God. He also entered the ark and was saved. As for Ham, the
   scoundrel of the family, it might have been feared that he would not
   come in--but notwithstanding all that the Scripture tells us against
   him, he was assuredly saved in the ark.

   And here was the mercy--that to Japheth, the elder, and to Shem and to
   Ham, the promise extended! "Come you and all your house into the ark."
   My dear Brother, when you are converted, yourself, it is a blessing
   that you have so far a hold of the Gospel, but go on to grasp more of
   it! "What must I do to be saved?" asked the jailor. And Paul replied,
   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your
   house." Many cannot get to the second part of the promise. They seem
   satisfied if they, themselves, are saved. But oh, for that faith which
   takes all that the Gospel is prepared to give and pleads with God that
   not only I may be saved, but my house, yes, and ALL my house, without
   exception!

   II. Here is the call, then. The Lord called effectually Shem, Ham,
   Japheth and their wives, so that they all came into the ark. Of that we
   are going to speak for a few minutes on the second head, which is THE
   OBEDIENCE. Noah came into the ark and his wife, and his sons and their
   wives. Their obedience was unquestioning. We do not find them asking
   anything at all about the reason for the command--they came as they
   were bid. They passed through the doorway and they were all in the ark.

   Fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and their wives,
   daughters and their husbands, and all of you, oh that the blessed
   Spirit would put you, now, into such a frame of mind that you should at
   once yield to the Divine precept which says, "Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and you shall be saved!" Have you not asked enough questions?
   You have had some of them answered, but every answer has only helped
   you to invent another dozen! Oh, those questions! Those quibbles! Those
   debates! Those doubts! They are ruining thousands! Have you ever heard
   of the man who sat at the table and could not eat till he knew the
   pedigree of the bullock from which the joint was cut? And then he must
   know how it was cooked and comprehend the influence which fire has over
   flesh to make it eatable!

   Next he must understand anatomy and know how the stomach acts upon the
   food and what the gastric juice is made of, and how food is
   assimilated. Unless he could get plain answers to every enquiry, he
   would not eat. He said, "Plain

   answers, mind, plain answers to all my questions, or I will never put a
   mouthful between these lips again." Now, there was a poor countryman
   who came out of the field and saw the meat and potatoes, and he ate
   them all up while the man was asking the questions! And very wise he
   was, too. I suppose it was his hunger that made him so sensible. May
   the Lord give you a hunger after the Gospel! And when you have it, may
   He grant you Grace to feed upon it and receive it into your soul. May
   you take what is set before you by infinite love and leave quibblers to
   their own folly.

   I, myself, have a lot of questions, for the questions I have been asked
   by skeptics I have put away along with a lot more of my own which are
   far more difficult than theirs. I mean to bring them out one day, but
   not until I get to Heaven and carry all I can with me! We shall have
   light enough there to see! It is like reading in the dark down here. We
   will leave these questions till we get into the blaze of Glory and,
   perhaps, they will then answer themselves! Noah and his wife and his
   sons and their wives did not worry themselves about mysteries, but
   obeyed the plain command and went into the ark and were saved. They
   went in at once, but I will not dwell upon that. The whole eight of
   them passed in at once!

   To get eight people to agree to go anywhere is a difficult thing. But
   here they were, all agreed and all ready to start. And they all went
   into the ark then and there. It is wondrous that Mistress Shem did not
   say that she could not leave all her acquaintances and forsake her
   father and all her relations at once. How could she tear herself away?
   Good Mistress Japheth might have felt bonds which hold her to her bosom
   friends. But so it was--the effectual call went through all the
   family--men and women, and they took up their separated position,
   coming out of the world at once when the command came. O, blessed
   Spirit, give such a call as that to whole families! All these eight
   people came away once and for all. They could each say--

   "Farewell, vain world, I must be gone!

   You are no home, no rest for me.

   From now on my heart must dwell alone,

   And have no fellowship with thee.

   Farewell, poor world, for you must die!

   Even now the floods begin to rise.

   I die to you without a sigh,

   Save that I mourn your blinded eyes." There was a closed door between
   the family of Noah and all the rest of the world. They went in to be
   the minority and turned out, before long, to be the majority! Oh, that
   men would be willing to be the minority in a wicked world and to be
   counted fools! People say, "If you join that Church, you just shut
   yourself out from all society. Nobody will ever know you anymore. You
   might as well be dead and buried." But, truly, when a soul gives itself
   to Christ, it feels itself to be dead and buried to the world and says
   to it, "Adieu, we are, from now on, strangers." The regenerate pass
   straight away from communion with this world to hold all their
   communion inside the ark--to have all their fellowship in connection
   with the Lord Jesus Christ!

   Now to Noah and to his wife and to all the family, this was the most
   important event that ever happened to them. When all of them passed out
   of the world together to find their refuge where God had provided
   it--it was a great day with Noah's household! What a glorious day it is
   with men and women when they come to Christ! Their birthday is
   noteworthy, but this is better! They were only born to sorrow and death
   at first--now are they born to Heaven and eternal life! Their wedding
   day? This is better! They were but joined to a mortal in bonds that
   death will sever, but now they are married to Christ in everlasting
   wedlock!

   Moreover, simple as the act of going into the ark may seem, it was one
   of the most remarkable events in human history. When Noah and his
   family entered into the ark, it was a more important day than when
   empires rise or fall, for there would have been an utter end of the
   human race if it had not been for their decided action on that
   memorable day! So, when men give themselves to Christ, they do not know
   what mighty things they are doing for their posterity and for those
   immediately around them. Time and eternity quiver with the force of
   their deed! These converts will be a blessing to the town in which they
   live, a blessing to the society in which they move! The salvation of
   that woman will be the salvation of her grandchildren and of their
   children and so forth!

   Who knows, when a man is born to God, but that there shall spring from
   him in future years a godly seed that shall become ministers of Christ
   and missionaries of the Cross? It is a grand event when a family is
   saved! I heard some music in the street just now and it seemed to me to
   be playing in good time to keep tune with the joy we ought to feel when
   father,

   mother, sons and daughters enter the ark of Christ and find salvation
   there! Oh, if households enter into Christ, the very bells of Heaven
   may ring again and again and again with a joy that has many joys within
   it!

   Now let us go into details. The first fact is that Noah went in. This
   was right! Noah was the leader. The husband is the head of the
   household, or ought to be, and he should go to Christ first. Whether
   his wife comes in, or Shem, or Ham comes in, whoever will come in, or
   stay out, Noah goes in first, for he would obey the Lord. Head of the
   house, are you in the ark? Are you in Christ? You are a father. You
   have sons grown up around you, are you decided? You wish your family to
   grow up in the fear of God--I hope you do! But how can you expect it if
   you are not saved? If Noah had not gone into the ark, I should not
   expect to read that Shem and Ham and Japheth went in.

   you that are heads of households, your position is very responsible!
   You will have to bear much blame if your children go astray. Unless
   your example is decided for the Lord, they will be able to say at the
   Last Great Day, "Our father was half-hearted and how could we be
   expected to give our hearts to God?" Next, his sons are mentioned.
   "Noah went in and his sons"--three fine fellows. A happy father is he
   who has sons that will go with him in the things of God. Sons are
   called in Hebrew, "builders," because they build up a man's house. May
   the Holy Spirit build them into the Church! I would to God there were
   more young men joining the Church--that more sons were decided!

   You cannot expect, can you, to see the sons' wives brought unless the
   sons are on the Lord's side? But, I am sorry to say, they are often
   opposers and, when the women are brought to Christ, there are the
   husbands standing back and even acting as a hindrance to the religion
   of their wives! God grant it may not be so in any case here! O son of
   Noah, go into the ark with your father! O child of a godly parent,
   follow your father to Christ, that you may follow him to Heaven! Let
   Abraham's son be an Isaac and Isaac's son be a Jacob, and Jacob's son
   be a Joseph--and so may it go on from generation to generation!

   The next person who is mentioned is the old lady--namely, Noah's wife.
   I give her that name because she was, no doubt, somewhere about 600
   years old and she was assuredly an eminent woman. We usually describe
   persons who have grown sons by that name in our family circles. The
   wife of the father of three sons comes into the ark. I think of her as
   of a queenly dame with her sons and their wives. I see her coming
   boldly forward with a quiet grace and firmness to go with her beloved
   husband--to sink or swim with him. She is casting in her lot with him
   not only because he is her husband, but because he had cast in his lot
   with God. Oh, beloved woman, advancing into years, with a grown family
   about you-- if you have not come to Christ, I trust you may--that in
   your family the saved ones may be as Noah and his sons and his wife.

   Last came the son's wives and what a happy circumstance for them! I was
   thinking, as I turned over the subject, how painful it would have been
   if one of the boys had not come in. And then how grievous it would have
   been if one of the wives had not come. If Noah had been obliged to know
   that one of them should be left out and he had to have the dreadful
   selection, whom do you suppose he would have left out? I cannot
   imagine! I have heard of the Irishman with his seven or eight children,
   and someone was willing to adopt one. But the question was--which was
   it to be? One is to be taken out of the family and they are not to see
   it again. It is to be brought up and taken care of by a stranger--the
   father and mother could never agree which it should be.

   1 hope, dear fathers and mothers, you will never agree to have one of
   your children lost. Make it your daily and nightly prayer, your
   incessant effort, your hourly desire that not only Shem and Ham and
   Japheth may be brought, but their wives, too--till not one shall be
   left behind--but the whole family shall be saved in Christ Jesus!

   Now, all this was done by the sweet, effectual calling of the Divine
   Spirit. And let us pray tonight, each one, that the same call may be
   given to all our friends, kinsfolk and all assembled here--that we may
   be all in Christ, both now and on the Last Great Day! Amen.

Love's Medicines and Miracles

   (No. 1337)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JANUARY 21, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but You have, in love to my
   soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption: for You have cast all my
   sins behind Your back" Isaiah 38:17.

   HEZEKIAH'S recovery is a notable encouragement to prayer. If ever there
   was a case in the world where it seemed impossible that prayer could be
   of any use, it was that of Hezekiah. It was perceivable by everybody
   around him that he was sick unto death. Why, then, think of prayer? The
   case was fatal. Would it not expose prayer to derision if such a matter
   were taken before the Mercy Seat? Moreover, God's own Word, spoken by
   His servant the Prophet, had been given--"Set your house in order, for
   you shall die, and not live." What could be the use of prayer after
   that? Might it not be regarded as an impertinent interference with the
   known will of the Lord?

   Yet, Brothers and Sisters, the proverb says that hunger breaks through
   stone walls--and so the desire to live, on the king's part--drove him
   to pray! Through all arguments and reasonings did Hezekiah's prayer
   break its way to the Throne of God. He turned his face to the wall in
   more than one sense on that occasion, for it seemed as if a wall stood
   in the front of him and shut out all hope of life. Yet he turned his
   face to it and prayed his way through it! Mark well his success.
   Fifteen years longer did he live in answer to his entreaties!

   Brothers and Sisters, pray if you are between the jaws of death and
   Hell! Pray, Brothers and Sisters, if all hope seems to be utterly
   slain! Yes, and if you can put your finger on passages of God's own
   Word which apparently condemn you, still pray! Whether your fears have
   contorted those threatening passages or not, though many of them frown
   upon you, still pray! Perish with your hands on the horn of the altar
   even if you must perish! Never believe your case to be utterly hopeless
   so long as you can plead with God! There can be no hurt come of your
   supplication, but good must come of it in some form or other.

   If God does not prolong life in answer to prayer, as He often may not
   or nobody would ever die, yet still He may give a greater blessing than
   continued earthly existence! And if it is a greater blessing, in God's
   judgment, it is better for us to receive it than to have the precise
   thing we have craved! In all cases, "pray without ceasing." The Mercy
   Seat once stood within the veil where none could approach it except at
   one set season in the year--but now the veil is torn from top to bottom
   and you may come to it when you will! Therefore I charge you come
   boldly unto the Throne of the heavenly Grace in every time of need!

   Yes, draw near in the darkest night and in the most wintry season! Draw
   near when God seems to have forgotten to be gracious and when you think
   He will no more be favorable. "Men ought always to pray and not to
   faint." Pray in the teeth of difficulty. Pray though impossibility
   seems to stand in the way. Pray against death and the devil. Pray like
   Manasseh in the low dungeon and like Jonah out of the belly of the
   whale! Pray against conscience and carnal reason--I was going to say
   even pray against your terrifying interpretation of God's Word,
   itself--for you must surely have misread it if you have thought that it
   forbids you to pray!

   It cannot be so, since Jehovah's glorious memorial is that He is the
   God that hears prayer! He has never said to the seed of Jacob, "Seek
   you My face in vain." He may say and He knows His own meaning when He
   says it, "You shall die, and not live," and yet He may afterwards
   declare, "I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears: behold, I
   will add unto your days 15 years." He will be favorable unto the voice
   of your supplication! That lesson having been learned, we shall now
   proceed to consider Hezekiah's prayer in detail. God grant that from
   his experience we may derive instruction and, if in its bitterness we
   have already had fellowship with the royal supplicant, may the Lord
   grant unto us to have communion with him in the sweeter part of it, so
   that we, also, may feel our souls brought up from the pit of corruption
   to celebrate the praises of our pardoning God!

   I see in the text three things to think about at this time--the first
   is a healthy bitterness--"Behold, for peace I had great bitterness."
   The second is delivering love--"But You have in love to my soul,
   delivered it from the pit of corruption." And the third is absolute
   pardon--"You have cast all my sins behind Your back."

   Before, however, I divided my text, I ought to have given you another
   translation of it. Not that I would readily find fault with our version
   at any time, for it is, as a rule, marvelously correct and singularly
   forcible. But I am afraid when the new translation of the Bible comes
   out, it will be better to light our fires with it than to give up the
   old version, which is so dear to us and so interwoven into all our
   religious life. I trust our grandfather's Bible will maintain its hold
   on the mind of the English public against all comers, for it is so
   simple and yet so sublime, so homely and yet so heavenly in style.

   The translation which I shall now submit to you is, however, more
   exactly literal according to the Hebrew-- "Behold, to peace my bitter
   bitterness," or, "Marah, Marah," "and You have loved my soul from the
   pit of destruction, because You have cast all my sins behind Your
   back."

   I. Our first head is HEALTHFUL BITTERNESS and you have it in the first
   sentence, which runs in Hebrew very nearly as follows--"Behold, to
   peace (or to health) my bitter bitterness." Our translators have given
   us, as it were, an interpretation of it rather than a translation. I do
   not dispute their interpretation, but yet it does not embrace all the
   meaning which the words convey to the instructed reader. The Hebrew is
   abrupt, sententious, and full of teaching-- "Behold, to peace my bitter
   bitterness."

   This means, first, that he underwent a great, sad and unexpected
   change. His peace, according to our version, was taken away and for it
   he had great bitterness. The city of Jerusalem had been surrounded by
   Rabshakeh's armies. Sennacherib had sent his lieutenant to demand
   immediate surrender and that commander had written a letter full of
   blasphemy and contempt. Hezekiah, having but little faith, was terribly
   cast down. But though he had not sufficient Grace to be at ease in his
   mind, he had wisdom enough to go to his God in prayer. He spread the
   letter of Rabshakeh before the Lord and, in due season, he obtained an
   answer which more than satisfied him!

   "The king of Assyria shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow
   there, nor come before it with shields, nor build a siege mound against
   it." The angel of the Lord smote the armed men of the king of Assyria
   in their thousands! And the tyrant, hearing a rumor, fled to his own
   capital, where his sons killed him with the sword. That was the end of
   Sennacherib--and one would have said, and doubtless Hezekiah did
   say--"Now I shall have a long season of quiet. I shall reign in power
   over my country, watch over its interests, promote the happiness of my
   people, discharge justice, build up an empire and then, by-and-by, when
   I grow gray in years, in the fullness of time, I shall be gathered to
   my fathers in peace, as a shock of corn comes in its season."

   Instead of this, while he was in the meridian of his age and had, as
   yet, no heir to his crown, he finds himself smitten with a painful,
   debilitating and depressing disease--and he understands that he must
   die! Hear him as, to the music of sighs and groans, he sings a mournful
   song--"I shall go to the gates of the grave, I am deprived of the
   residue of my years." Ah, Brothers and Sisters, let us never boast
   ourselves of tomorrow, for we know not what a day may bring forth! The
   promises of the opening morning are not often fulfilled--clouds gather
   and the sun which rose in splendor sets in showers. We reckon that now
   we have made our nest as downy as it can be and we who ought to know
   better, yet we say, "Soul, take your ease: my mountain stands firm, I
   shall never be moved."

   But ah, how soon the mountain shakes, the nest is filled with thorns
   and the joy vanishes! The great Master of the feast comes in, clears
   the tables, takes away the fat things full of marrow and the wines on
   the lees well-refined! And instead, thereof, bids His servitors bring
   forth the wine of astonishment and the bread of sorrow! Ah, what
   changes may come! What changes have come to some here present! You have
   gained the object of your life and then have been disappointed in it!
   You have, after many a struggle, reached the position you sought for so
   eagerly, but now you find it a hard, uncomfortable ledge of rock
   overhung with thorns and briars!

   You thought that when a certain trial was surmounted--the one which had
   so long been the "hill difficulty" of your way--you would come to a
   level plain where your willing feet should joyfully trip towards
   Heaven. But now fresh mountains rise before you! Unexpected Alps lift
   up their frowning battlements and your spirit is filled with heaviness
   at the dreary prospect--for peace you have great bitterness. Now, if
   this is so with you, count it no strange thing and do

   not imagine that an uncommon experience has happened to you. It was so
   with Hezekiah and has been so with tens of thousands of others whom the
   Lord has loved!

   Notice, further, that Hezekiah's condition was one of emphatic sorrow,
   for he says, "Behold to peace, Marah Marah--bitter bitter," or "bitter
   bitterness." We read that when the children of Israel came to Marah
   they could not drink of the waters, for they were bitter. Nobody knows,
   unless they have experienced it, what parching thirst is and how cruel
   is the disappointment when, seeing water before you, you discover it to
   be so brackish that you cannot drink it. It tantalizes a man when he is
   least able to exhibit patience and so it intensifies the previous pain
   of the thirst. Marah was a notable spot in the journeys of the children
   of Israel and Hezekiah had come spiritually to a double Marah, a Marah
   Marah.

   Have you, dear Friends, ever passed that way and drank of double
   bitterness--the wormwood and the gall? Beloved, some of us know what it
   means, for we have had, at the same time, a body racked with pain and a
   soul full of heaviness. "The spirit of a man will sustain his
   infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can bear?" Perhaps the double Marah
   has come in another form--it is a time of severe trouble and just then
   the friend in whom you trusted has forsaken you--this is sorrow upon
   sorrow. Or perhaps you are in temporal difficulties and, at the same
   time, in great spiritual straits. Here, also, is Marah, Marah! The
   flying fish is pursued by a fierce enemy in the sea and when it flies
   into the air, birds of prey are eager after it. In like manner both in
   temporal and spiritual things we are assailed.

   Paul notes in his famous voyage that he came to a place where two seas
   met--have you ever sailed through such a dangerous part of the sea? I
   doubt not that you have and have, at the same time, found both trouble
   and sorrow. Well, then, again I say unto you, count it not strange
   concerning the fiery trial, as though some strange thing had happened
   to you--for the like affliction has happened to many of your
   Brethren--yes, it has so often happened as to become a proverb that,
   "ill things seldom come alone."

   Lo, on the heels of the first of Job's messengers there hastens
   another! If the Sabeans have taken away the oxen and the asses, we may
   be sure that the fire of God will be upon the sheep and the Chaldeans
   are already after the camels! No, do not wonder if the wind from the
   wilderness has smitten the four corners of the house and buried the
   children in the ruins, for adversities usually hunt in packs! Deep
   calls unto deep! Like countless birds which fly over our heads,
   migrating to distant lands, so do trials pass over us in clouds and we
   are startled as we hear strange and mysterious voices threatening
   grievous ills.

   Now, notice, that the meaning of our verse is not at all exhausted by
   this explanation. We find in it a better meaning by far. "Behold to
   peace bitter bitterness," that is to say, the king's double bitterness
   worked his peace and health. Take the word in the sense of health,
   first. The illustration of the text is well known. Many a time, when a
   man has been exceedingly ill, the medicine which has met his case has
   been intensely disagreeable to the taste. It has been as gall to his
   palate, but it has operated as a strengthening tonic--it has chased out
   the fever and purged away the cause of the malady--and the man has
   recovered. Hezekiah bore witness that God had sanctified his bodily
   sickness and his mental sorrow to his spiritual health.

   Is it not often so with us? "Before I was afflicted I went astray, but
   now have I kept Your Word." Hezekiah had time, during his sickness, to
   consider his disorderly house. While he lay with his face to the wall,
   he read a great deal upon that wall which he had seen nowhere else. A
   handwriting flamed forth in burning letters before his conscience and
   this was the interpretation--"Set your house in order." This writing
   would remain before his eyes even after he was respited. The death
   warrant was cancelled, but the mandate was not retracted--"Set your
   house in order." It needed setting in order and his first order of
   business was to look into home affairs, uncover family abuses and
   search into personal errors.

   In his quiet chamber, the king would look over the administration of
   his kingdom and note the many mistakes he had made, the wrong acts
   which he had permitted in his subordinates, and all the abuses of the
   times. Among the rest, his own personal unbelief would rise before him.
   He would remember his fear and distrust and he would mourn over them.
   He had evidently been far more daunted by Rabshakeh, at the first, than
   he ought to have been, for Isaiah, to comfort him, said, "Be not afraid
   of the words which you have heard." He would think his whole life over
   and, beginning with himself, would search out all errors of the State
   and of the Church.

   Self-examination is a great benefit to us, Brothers and Sisters, and
   anything which brings us to it does us real service. Brother, go over
   the whole of your spiritual farm, be diligent to know the state of your
   flocks and look well to your

   herds. Break up the fallow ground and clear out the thorns. Take the
   little foxes which spoil the vines and chase away the birds which
   devour the seed. Let all things be in the best condition--thus will
   your sickness work your health by discovering the secret source of your
   malady. The king's bitterness of soul then led him to repent of his
   wrongdoing, as he saw where he had sinned. He mourned His folly before
   God and humbled himself because of the inward sinfulness of nature out
   of which the outward transgression had come.

   I am sure that very often sickness reveals a man to himself. We seldom
   see ourselves till sorrow holds up the glass before our eyes. Self is
   an unpleasant subject for study! Anatomy is nothing to it--to dissect a
   corpse is not half so disagreeable as to examine your own character!
   Have you ever laid yourself upon the table, cut deep with the
   dissecting knife, laid bare the inward parts and opened up the hidden
   things of the heart? Have you taken yourself to pieces, bone by bone?
   When you have got as far as your heart, have you not earnestly wished
   that you could avoid making any pre-mortem examination of that
   desperately diseased organ?

   Ah, me! What a humiliating piece of business is the anatomizing of the
   natural heart--that heart which is deceitful above all things and out
   of which come envy and murder! We flinch from this till sickness and
   despondency strap us down and work away with the surgical knife. And
   yet this is one of the most beneficial of operations, for, "by these
   things men live, and in all these things is the life of our spirit."
   Ah, this bitter bitterness which makes us look within and see ourselves
   in our true colors is of far more use to us than those dainty repasts
   which make us like the Israelites with the quails, full of meat but
   also near to cursing!

   I can well imagine that this bitter bitterness made Hezekiah see the
   need of his God more than ever he had seen it before. He knew in whose
   hands his breath was and felt his entire dependence upon the Divine
   will. He saw himself to be absolutely in God's power as much as the
   thread is under the hand of the weaver who breaks it whenever he
   pleases! Or as the prey is under the power of the lion who can break
   all its bones! Now he learned to cling to the Lord his God and to cry,
   "O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me." Now he knew that the Lord
   was ready to save him and, while his heart was filled with joy because
   of the promise of prolonged life, he was also full of shame that he had
   ever doubted the power and Grace of God in his hour of trouble!

   He would, from now on, feel that the Almighty Lord who could bring back
   the shadow upon the sundial ten degrees could as readily check the
   wrath and power of the most terrible invader! He who could deliver him
   from the gates of the grave could assuredly save him from the rage of
   mortal man! And He who used a poor lump of figs to disappoint death of
   its prey could also employ the weakest means to overthrow the most
   potent foe of Israel! From now on he would lean upon the Eternal and
   bid the virgin daughter of Zion despise her adversary and laugh him to
   scorn! After that schooling, Hezekiah would exhibit greater spiritual
   strength, more confidence in the promises, more power with God, more
   zeal in the Divine service and his peace would come back to him and
   would be even deeper than at the first.

   That joy which had fled because of sin and God's visitation on account
   of it, returned to him once more! He felt himself happier because he
   was holier. He felt himself strengthened because the blessed purgative,
   though bitter, had removed a constant source of weakness. And he rose
   from his bed, not merely a new man in bodily health, but a renewed man
   as to his entire spiritual nature! How sweet are the uses of adversity
   when the Holy Spirit uses His sacred art upon the soul and turns the
   brine of tears into a sacred salt to season the spirit!

   Before I leave this point I would express my prayerful desire that this
   may be the result of every drop of bitter which any of you may ever
   taste throughout your future lives. If you are not the Lord's people,
   your bitterness has no blessing in it. On the contrary, you may look
   upon it as a foretaste of that endless Marah by whose brackish fountain
   the impenitent must sit and weep forever! But if you are the Lord's
   child, believing in Christ Jesus, all is well, "for we know that all
   things work together for good to them that love God, to them that are
   the called according to His purpose."

   II. Now we come to the second part of our text, which is peculiarly
   sweet to our souls, for it sets forth LOVING DELIVERANCE. The original
   runs thus--"And You have loved my soul from the pit of destruction."
   Taken in its first sense, the king ascribes to the love of God his
   deliverance from death and the grave. And he praises God for his
   restoration to the land of the living. But the words of inspired men
   frequently have a deeper significance than appears upon the surface
   and, indeed, they often conceal an inner sense which, perhaps, they
   themselves did not perceive and, therefore, the king's words are as
   dark sayings upon a harp full of meaning within meaning.

   At any rate, taking the language out of the mouth of Hezekiah, we will
   use it for expressing our own emotions and give it a wider sense if
   such is not the original range of its meaning. Let us notice three
   things. First the deed of Grace, "You have brought my soul from the pit
   of corruption." Secondly, the power by which it was performed, "You
   have loved my soul out of the pit of corruption." And thirdly, the
   modus operandi, which is indicated by another and equally good
   translation, "You have embraced my soul from the pit of corruption."

   First, then, the deed of Grace of which you and I can sing. "The Lord
   delivered us from the pit of corruption." First, from the pit of Hell.
   Ah, there I should have gone long, long ago if mercy had not
   interposed. "A platitude," says one. Ah, Brother, God save you from
   thinking the acknowledgment of God's choicest mercies to be a
   platitude! I reckon that those in Hell would think it no platitude for
   us to bless God that we are not in their torments! Our sins, like
   millstones about our neck, might have sunk us in the sea of Divine
   wrath 20 years ago. And is it not a thing to be spoken of again and
   again, a mercy to bless God for, that we are not in the abode of
   condemned souls? Is it not even more a reason for gratitude that we
   shall never be there?

   Believing in Jesus Christ and resting in the atoning blood, "there is
   therefore now no damnation," as the older version used to run, "to them
   that are in Christ Jesus." "Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that
   died, yes rather, that has risen again." The dreadful gates of Hell
   shall never be passed by a soul that believes in Christ Jesus! For us
   there is no undying worm! For us no unquenchable fire! For us no wrath
   to come! Glory be to God for this amazing Grace! But next, He has also
   delivered us from the pit of sinfulness which is, to my mind, as
   horrible a pit as Hell, itself! Indeed, under some aspects it is the
   same thing, for sinfulness is Hell--and to live under the power of sin
   is to be condemned.

   Well, Brothers and Sisters, years ago sinfulness was our master and we
   loved it! We hated the ways of God and loved the wages of
   unrighteousness. But at this present moment, although we mourn because
   we are not perfectly rid of sin, yet sin shall not have dominion over
   us! We see sin in our nature, but we loathe it. It is no more a
   home-born citizen of our soul, but an alien to be expelled, an outlaw
   to be hunted down! No more do we consent to sin--"It is no more I that
   do it, but sin that dwells in me." Blessed be God, although we are,
   sometimes, brought into captivity to the body of this death, yet He
   gives us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. We are driving out
   the Canaanites of sin, little by little, by force of arms and by the
   might of Grace. And soon, by God's Grace, shall every Jericho fall flat
   to the ground and every Amorite be slain! Let us rejoice in being
   delivered from this pit of corruption!

   Equally has the Lord delivered us, at this time, from the awful
   consciousness of wrath under which we once groaned. Brothers and
   Sisters, you have not forgotten, have you, the time when you felt the
   hand of God heavy upon you under conviction of sin? I do not know what
   the pangs of damned souls may be, but I think I have been almost able
   to guess their horror in my hours of deep distress, when my soul chose
   strangling rather than life because of my misery, for I was drunk with
   wormwood and filled with sore anguish! This I know, that if my horror
   could have been greater, my life must have expired!

   It is not always that awakened souls suffer so much, but any man who
   has felt his own sinfulness has seen that which might make every
   individual hair upon His head stand upright with horror, since to be a
   sinner is the most dreadful thing conceivable. To have God's wrath
   revealed in the spirit is to have a seething Hell within one's
   conscience! But, blessed be His name, He has loved us out of that pit
   of despair! No longer are we burdened with a sense of sin, for we are
   pardoned! Our conscience is purged from dead works. The precious blood
   has made us happy in God. We are reconciled to Him by the death of His
   Son and all our trespasses are forgiven forever! Therefore our heart is
   glad in the Lord and to Him will we sing our songs upon our stringed
   instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord--

   "In a dungeon deep He found me,

   Without water, without light,

   Bound in chains of horrid darkness,

   Gloomy, thick, Egyptian night!

   He reco vered there my soul with price immense.

   And for this let men and angels,

   All the heavenly hosts above,

   Choirs of seraphim elected,

   With their golden harps of love,

   Praise and worship,

   My Redeemer without end."

   Since that first dark hour of conviction, I dare say you have passed
   through other fearful depressions of spirit, very similar to this which
   is recorded of Hezekiah. You have not descended quite so deep into the
   pit as you did at first, but yet you have known bitter sorrows and have
   been delivered from them. Are you, this morning happy in the Lord? Are
   you again rejoicing? Then say with the king--"You have in love to my
   soul delivered it from the pit of corruption. The Lord was ready to
   save me, therefore we will sing my songs on the stringed instruments in
   the house of the Lord." There comes speedily a time when we shall sing
   this song more sweetly in a better land than this, where there shall be
   none of these mists to hang about us, but changeless, everlasting
   noonday without a cloud!

   In Heaven how sweetly shall we sing this song upon our stringed
   instruments--when there shall be no corruption left in us--but we shall
   be pure as the soul of God, Himself, perfect as Christ our Redeemer!
   What hymns of gratitude shall we chant before the Throne of God when,
   standing on the heights of Heaven, we gaze into the deeps of Hell! How
   grateful we will be, when, from our perfection, we remember the Fall
   and all the ruin of it from which almighty Grace lifted us up! Glory be
   unto the Lord forever, for, "In love to my soul You have delivered it
   from the pit of corruption." Hallelujah! This is the deed which Grace
   has done!

   Now, we have to notice the power which performed it. To my mind the
   Truth of God herein set forth is the delicious food for meditation, but
   it is not readily to be brought forth in preaching. Listen to the
   words--"You have loved my soul out of the pit of corruption." Love
   worked the rescue. Love did it all! Let Love wear the crown! I was
   asleep in my sin, but you, O Love, did awaken me with a kiss. Only when
   I began to hear that Jesus loved poor souls unto the death and,
   therefore, came to seek and save sinners, did I begin to wake from my
   deadly lethargy. Do you, my Brothers and Sisters, remember when the
   first thought entered into your minds that, after all, there was hope,
   for God was full of love?

   Did not that thought bestir you? Did not the Lord love you out of the
   sleep of sin? Moreover, you loved sin and the wages of it--and the
   world looked very pleasantly upon you while it enthralled you. At last
   you came to know that the love of God was far sweeter than the love of
   sin. You had a glimpse of Jesus' dear marred visage, all bedewed with
   spit and with blood--and He appeared so much more fair and lovely than
   your sin, that you began to feel that sin and you must part. Thus the
   Lord loved you out of your love of sin! His sweet love made sin
   nauseous to you! You were weary of it and would have no more of it.

   Do you remember that when you fell into despair and said, " I have been
   such a sinner that I must die in my sin," you were lifted up from the
   pit of unbelief? I know that I was borne out of it upon the eagle wings
   of Love! The Lord loved me out of it! He shed abroad such love in my
   soul that I could not be an unbeliever any longer. Just as an iceberg
   must surely melt when once it is borne along by the Gulf Stream, so my
   unbelief was compelled to dissolve in the warm stream of His dear love!
   Believe Him? How could I disbelieve Him when I saw His love to sinners
   and heard of His death for the very chief of them, even for such as I
   was! He loved me out of my unbelief!

   But then I felt so weak I could do nothing. I was afraid to unite with
   His people and afraid to make confession of my faith for fear I should
   dishonor Him. Then He came and loved me out of my anxiety! He shed His
   love abroad in my heart so powerfully that I became strong with
   strength of His giving and knew myself to be safe because I was in His
   keeping. Then did I come forward and confess His name and unite with
   His saints, for I felt that I could trust my Lord to keep me even unto
   the end, for His love had loved me out of my weakness. I am telling the
   story as though it were about myself, but, Brothers and Sisters, I mean
   it about you, as well.

   You have wandered, sometimes, since then. You have gone away from your
   Lord into worldliness and much that you unfeignedly deplore. And who is
   it that has led you back to peace and holiness? Who has been the Good
   Shepherd and restored your soul? My loving Lord has driven me back,
   sometimes, with sharp words of rebuke, but more often He has loved me
   back with attractive tenderness. What a wonderful magnet love is! It
   draws our iron hearts to itself. Its sway is kindly but irresistible!
   We wander here and there, in the instability of our minds, till a
   memory of the days of love comes over our spirit, and straightway we
   can rest no longer in the things of earth after which we have so
   wickedly gone astray, but we say, "I will return unto my first husband,
   for it was better with me then than now."

   A moment's memory of the days of our espousals makes the heart sick
   with longings to return to her home in the bosom of Jesus. He loves us
   out of our backslidings! Perhaps you have fallen into lukewarmness and
   are chilly and lifeless. And what is the way to raise you out of that
   horrible state? Is it not a way of love? When the Laodicean Church was

   neither cold nor hot, and even her Beloved was ready to spew her out of
   His mouth, how was she bid to rise out of her condition? Did not the
   Lord say, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." Christ's coming to
   commune with the Church was the cure of her indifference!

   When the love of God is shed abroad in the soul you feel no longer
   sleepy and indifferent, but your spirit girds herself with zeal as with
   a cloak and your heart glows with vehement flames of affection. How
   truly does our poet sing--

   "O Jesus, King most wonderful,

   You Conqueror renowned,

   You sweetness most ineffable,

   In whom all joys are found!

   When once You visit the heart,

   Then truth begins to shine,

   Then earthly vanities depart,

   Then kindles love Divine."

   The ever-gracious Lord means to perfect that which concerns you by the
   action of this same love. His gentleness has made you great and His
   love will make you glorious! Divine love is the most sanctifying agency
   in the world--it is that which checked us before we knew the Lord when
   we ran so greedily after sin. And it is that which constrains us now
   that we live unto His name, for, "the love of Christ constrains us ."
   Behold, then, the love of the Spirit! Is not this most blessed
   medicine?

   We spoke of bitter draughts under our first head, and truly these have
   their virtue, but here the Lord's love uses medicine like itself! Yes,
   it becomes, itself, the medicine and the Lord seems to say, "Here is My
   dear child, sick, and I will restore him by giving him more love."
   Divine love is a catholicon, a universal medicine. No spiritual disease
   can resist its healing power. The love and blood of Jesus, applied by
   the Holy Spirit, will raise up the saints from pining sickness and
   restore them from the gates of the grave. No heart, however like
   granite it becomes, can long resist almighty love. The rebel may stand
   up in bold defiance and stand out in daring obstinacy, but when he
   begins to feel God loves him he cries--

   "Lord, You have won. At last I yield!

   My heart, by mighty Grace compelled

   Surrenders all to You!

   Against Your terrors long I strove,

   But who can stand against Your love?

   Love conquers even me!

   If You had bid Your thunders roll,

   And lightnings flash, to blast my soul,

   I still had stubborn been.

   But mercy has my heart subdued,

   A bleeding Savior I have viewed,

   And now I hate my sin."

   We must briefly notice the modus operandi of this love. "You have
   embraced my soul out of the pit of corruption." Yonder is the child in
   the pit and the father, wishing to save it, goes down into the pit and
   embraces his beloved one and so brings him up to life and safety. After
   this manner did Jesus save us! He embraced us by taking our nature and
   so becoming one with us. It is by embraces that He regenerates converts
   and sanctifies us, for He comes into union with us by the indwelling of
   the Holy Spirit! All our lives He communes with us and embraces us with
   arms of mighty love and so lifts us up from the pit of corruption.

   In this way, also, He will bring us right up out of our fallen state
   into perfection of holiness, by continuing the Divine embrace, pressing
   us nearer and nearer, and nearer, still, to His dear, loving heart till
   all sin shall be pressed out of us! He will by one eternal embrace of
   unchanging love lift us out of the pit of corruption into a state of
   absolute perfection where we shall dwell with Him forever! Glory be
   unto God for all this! He who has tasted of this cannot but sing as
   Hezekiah did upon his stringed instruments all the days of his life in
   the house of the Lord!

   III. We have now, with much delight, to consider the promise of
   ABSOLUTE PARDON. "For you have cast all my sins behind Your back."
   This, King Hezekiah mentions as the cause of his restored peace and
   health. He could not be

   healed and cheered till the cause of disease was gone--and that was
   sin. Sin was the foreign element in his spiritual constitution and as
   long as it was there it caused fret and worry and spiritual disease.
   But when the sin was gone, health and peace came back. Now let me take
   the words before us and set them forth in a few brief sentences and bid
   you notice, first, the burden--sin. A heavy load, a weighty curse.

   Observe the owner of this burden--Hezekiah says not sin, only, but my
   sin. If any sins in the world are heavier than others they are mine.
   Brothers and Sisters, you feel yours to be so, do you not? Then take
   the next word, which is a word of multitude and note the
   comprehensiveness of that burden. All my sins! "You have cast all my
   sins." Let us spell that word, ALL my sins. What a row of figures it
   would take to number them all! As to the record of them, surely it
   would reach round the sky--all my sins! In what balance shall they be
   weighed? What must the wrath be which is due to me on account of them?
   Think long and humbly of the words--all my sins.

   Now, see the Lord comes to deal with them! He takes them all and what
   does He do? He casts them. "You have cast all my sins." What a deed of
   Omnipotence! What a Divine cast! None but Jehovah Jesus, Himself, could
   ever have lifted all my sins, but He did lift them and, like another
   Atlas, He bore them upon His shoulders! And having done that, even till
   He sweat great drops of blood and bled to death, He then took the whole
   mass of my sins and cast them as far as the east is from the west! No,
   more! He cast them behind Jehovah's back. Where is that? Behind God's
   back? Where can that

   be?

   Men throw things behind their back when they cannot bear the sight of
   them. Our sin is loathsome and abominable to God. He will not look upon
   it and so He casts it behind His back! But then He is a just God and He
   must punish iniquity! It must come before the eyes of His Holiness to
   be avenged. We have not, therefore, seen, as yet, the full meaning of
   the passage. No, it means that the Lord becomes oblivious of His
   people's sins. Somebody said, the other day, concerning a certain piece
   of business, "I shall never think of it again. It is gone as though it
   had never been." The Lord means all that concerning His people's
   sins--"I shall never think of them again. They are quite gone as far as
   I am concerned, I have thrown them where I shall never see them again.
   Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more."

   What a gracious mode of pardoning sin! God Himself passes an act of
   oblivion and declares, "I will not remember their sins." He looks upon
   His people who have been so provoking and are still so prone to sin,
   and yet He beholds no iniquity in Jacob, nor perverseness in Israel! He
   sees His people washed in the blood of the Lamb, robed in the
   righteousness which is in God by faith--and He beholds in them neither
   spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing--for He has cast their sins so far
   away that they are out of sight of Omniscience and out of mind of
   Omnipresence!

   Again, I would remind you of the words, "behind Your back." Where is
   that? All things are before God's face--He looks on all the works of
   His hands and He sees all things that exist. Behind His back! It must
   mean annihilation, non-existence and non-entity! O my Soul, your God
   has flung your sins into non-entity and effectually made an end of
   them! He treats you as though they never existed and, as far as His
   justice is concerned, through the vicarious sacrifice of Christ, they
   are to the Lord as though we had never transgressed at all! "You have
   cast all my sins behind Your back." I do not think I need preach any
   longer upon this subject. Go home and turn it over in quiet meditation
   under the overshadowing of the Divine Spirit. Dear child of God,
   endeavor to get a grip of this great privilege of perfect pardon and
   never let it go! May the Holy Spirit seal it home to you.

   You are right in bringing your sins before your own face and mourning
   over them. That is where they should be, but do not, at the same time,
   forget that they are forgiven. When a man casts his sins behind his
   back, God will put them before His face--but when, in penitence, a
   Believer sets his sins before his own face to mourn over them, then the
   Lord, in mercy, declares that He will cast them behind His back. Oh
   Believer in Jesus, Your sins are gone forever! Be restful, happy,
   secure, for you are accepted in the Beloved! Your sin has ceased to be!
   The longest lines can never reach the bottom of that sea into whose
   depths Jehovah has cast them!

   The utmost industry of the devil can never travel into that land which
   does not exist, even the land which lies behind Jehovah's back into
   which He has cast Your sins! Who would not be a Believer in Jesus? Even
   if he were sorely sick and had to lie like Hezekiah, on the bed of
   death, who would not be a Believer? Even though he had to cry out,
   "Marah, Marah, bitterness twice over," who would not be a Believer and
   be embraced out of his misery by that mighty Love which abolishes the
   sin of the penitent?

   Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, O Sinner, and this shall be your
   portion, also, by God's abundant mercy. Amen.

Work For Jesus

   (No. 1338)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Son, go work today in My vineyard." Matthew 21:28.

   I AM not going to confine myself to the connection of these words, nor
   to use them strictly after the manner in which they were first spoken.
   I may, perhaps, explain the parable very briefly at the close, but I
   take leave to withdraw these words from their immediate context and use
   them as a voice which, I believe, sounds often in the ears of God's
   people, and sometimes sounds in vain--"Son, go work today in My
   vineyard." It is certain that God still speaks to us. He has spoken to
   us in His Word. There are His precepts and promises, His statutes and
   testimonies. He that has ears to hear let him hear these sacred
   oracles!

   But beside this open Revelation there are counsels and rebukes more
   closely and personally addressed to the conscience. Voices--as soft,
   sometimes, as whispers--at other times loud as the thunders that pealed
   from Sinai. The Lord has a way of speaking to men when, "He opens the
   ears of men and seals their instruction," as Elihu said. Thus He speaks
   when He calls them effectually by His Grace in conversion. So He once
   called, "Samuel, Samuel!" till the child answered. So He said,
   "Matthew, follow Me." So He called out, "Zacchaeus, come down!" So He
   cried out, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" So He bid some of us
   till the Divine accents were clear and irresistible.

   In like manner we have, many of us, heard Him say, "Son, give Me Your
   heart," and we have given Him our hearts--we could not do otherwise.
   That voice exerted such a charming spell and swayed us with such a
   Divine power that we were subdued by it and we yielded our hearts to
   the God of Love. Since then, you who know the Lord, must often have
   heard a voice speaking to you and bidding you seek His face in prayer.
   Perhaps you have been busy with the world, but you found an impulse of
   a mysterious kind coming over you and you have been glad to withdraw
   yourself for a few minutes to the closet that you might speak with God.

   You know how it has been when you have been meditating alone and yet
   not alone. One whose Presence you knew, whose face you could not see,
   was with you! You felt as if you must pray. It has not been any effort
   on your part. The exercise has been as easy as to breathe and as
   pleasant as to partake of your daily bread. You felt the Lord drawing
   you to the Mercy Seat and saying in your soul, "My Son, ask what you
   will and it shall be done unto you." You must have been conscious of
   such a voice as that. And have you not, at times, in the silence of
   your mind, heard the Lord call you to a closer communion with Himself?
   Has not the sense, if not the words, of the spouse in the canticle been
   heard in your soul--"Come, My Beloved, let us see if the vines
   flourish. Come with Me from Lebanon, My Spouse, with Me from

   Lebanon"?

   You have been up and away! You have gone into the secret places where
   Christ has shown you His love till you sat under His shadow with great
   delight--and His fruit has been sweet to your taste. Our experience
   makes us know that there are heavenly voices that invite prayer and
   call us to communion. And probably some of you have also been conscious
   of another voice which I earnestly desire we may all hear tonight,
   namely, the more martial and stirring call to service for the Lord
   Jesus Christ! Some of you have been obedient to the call these many
   years, but it calls louder and louder and louder still! You have been
   reaping and bearing the heat and burden of the day, but you cannot
   throw down your sickle, your hands cleave to it. Yes, rather do you
   take more gigantic strides and sweep down more of the precious corn at
   every stroke you take! You feel that you can never cease from it till
   you do--

   "Your body with your charge lay down, And cease at once to work and
   live."

   A voice Divine seems to be calling you and saying, "Follow Me, and I
   will make you a fisher of men. Behold I have made you a chosen vessel
   to bear My name unto the Gentiles." You have heard that voice and you
   are striving to obey it more and more. Others either have never heard
   it, or hearing it, have forgotten it. There are none so deaf as those
   who

   will not hear! And there are some who have a very deaf ear to any
   admonitions of this kind. They are like Issachar--a strong donkey
   crouching down between two burdens, but yet lifting neither. I fear
   lest upon them should come the curse of Meroz, because they come not,
   "to the help of the Lord--to the help of the Lord against the mighty."

   Now, perhaps this evening there are some Christian men or women here
   that shall feel as if the hand of the Crucified were laid upon them and
   they will hear Him say to them," You are not your own. You are bought
   with a price. Why don't you glorify God in your bodies and in your
   spirits, which are His? Awake, you that sleep, and arise from the dead,
   and Christ shall give you light." The text, I hope, may be blessed of
   God to be such a voice as that! Listening to it, we notice four things.
   First, the character under which it calls us, "Son." Secondly, the
   service to which it calls us, "go work." Thirdly, the time for which it
   calls us, "go work today." And fourthly, the place to which it directs
   us, "go work today in My vineyard."

   I. First, then, THE CHARACTER UNDER WHICH IT CALLS US. It appears to me
   to be a very powerful selection of terms. "Son, go work today in My
   vineyard." It puts work on a very gracious footing, when we are bid to
   work for the Lord, not as slaves, nor as mere servants, but as sons!
   Moses speaks to us, and he says, "Servant, go and work for your wages."
   But the Father in Christ speaks to us, and He says, "Son, go work today
   in My vineyard." No more as a servant, but as a son, shall you serve
   the Lord! The returning prodigal said, "Make me as one of your hired
   servants." That was not an evangelical prayer and was not answered. The
   father said, "This, my son, was dead, and is alive again," and so he
   received him, not as a hired servant at all, but as a son.

   Oh, dear people of God, I trust you always draw the distinction very
   clearly between the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace. When
   you work for God you do not work for life but from life. You do not try
   to serve Christ in order that you may be saved, but because you are
   saved! You do not obey His commands that you may become His children,
   but because you are His children and, therefore, are imitators of God
   as dear children! You say, "Abba, Father," because you feel the spirit
   of adoption within you and you endeavor to obey the commands of your
   Father for the same reason. I do not, therefore, say to anyone here,
   "Go and work for God that you may be saved." I would not venture to put
   it on that footing!

   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved." But turning
   to those who are saved, the Gospel exhortation is put after a Gospel
   sort--"Son, go work today in My vineyard." And it has all the more
   strength on this account, because, in addressing us as sons, it reminds
   us of the great love which has made us what we are. We were by nature
   heirs of wrath even as others, but, Beloved, "Behold, what manner of
   love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons
   of God." Think of the love which chose us when we were still aliens and
   enemies! Think of the love which adopted us and put us into the
   family--itself wondering while it did it--for the Lord is represented
   as saying, "How shall I put you among the children?" as if it were a
   strange thing that such as we are should ever be numbered among the
   children of God!

   The love which adopted us did not stay there, but having given us the
   rights of children, it gave us the nature of children! We were
   regenerated--"Begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of
   Jesus Christ from the dead; born not of corruptible seed, but of
   incorruptible, by the Word of God which lives and abides forever." Now,
   just think of election, adoption, regeneration and when the Lord
   addresses you by that term of, "Son," think of all that and say, "I owe
   to God an immeasurable debt of gratitude for having enabled me to
   become His son! He, by His Grace, has given me power and privilege to
   become a child of God! Therefore do I feel the claims of obligation and
   I would endeavor to work in the vineyard because I am His child, His
   son, His daughter, made so by His Grace."

   This you see, dear Friends, engages us to work in the vineyard all the
   more convincingly, because we may reflect not only on the Grace which
   has made us sons, but on the privileges which that same Grace bestowed
   upon us in making us sons, for, if children of God, the Lord will
   provide for us, will clothe us, will heal us, will protect us, will
   guide us, will educate us, will make us meet to be partakers of the
   inheritance of the saints in light! Remember, too, that precious
   passage, "If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with
   Christ, if, indeed, we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified
   together."

   If heirs of God, how large is our inheritance! And if joint-heirs with
   Christ, how sure that inheritance is! And we have been brought now,
   Beloved, to such an estate as this that the angels, themselves, might
   envy us, for I venture to apply a passage of Scripture to this case--I
   hope without wresting it--"Unto which of the angels said He at any
   time,

   You are My son?" But He speaks, thus, to us poor worms of the dust! And
   when He is bidding us serve Him, He comes to us under this character
   and addresses us in this relationship! He says, "Son, Daughter, go work
   today in My vineyard. I have given you boundless privileges in making
   you My child. I have given you this world and world to come. Earth is
   your lodge and Heaven your home. And therefore, because I have done all
   this for you--and what could I have done more for you than have made
   you My child?--therefore I say, Go, work today in My vineyard."

   In appealing, thus, to us under the name of Son, it is supposed that we
   have some feelings within us correspondent to the condition to which
   our heavenly Father has called us. He says, "Son." If any of you, being
   a son, has a father, and if that father wished you to do something for
   him, and he addressed you as, "my Son," you would feel, at once, that
   whatever you could do you were bound to do because you were a son! It
   would awaken in you the filial feeling which is swift at once to yield
   obedience and love.

   And when the Lord looks upon you, my Brothers and Sisters, and says to
   you "Son," or, "Daughter," it is supposed that there is, in your heart,
   a child's nature given, by His Grace, and that this filial instinct
   prompts the quick response, "My Father, what do You say to me? Speak,
   Lord, speak, Father, for Your son or daughter hears You. I long to do
   Your will. I delight in it, for to me it is the greatest joy I know
   that you are my Father and my God. Therefore, Lord, my heart stands
   ready now to listen to whatever You have to say, and my hand is ready
   to do it, as Your Grace shall enable me, only strengthen me in Your
   ways." "Son, Daughter, go work today in My vineyard."

   By the use of that term "son," it is supposed, also, that you have
   something of the qualification that will fit you to do what He bids
   you. A man who has a vineyard naturally supposes that his son knows
   something about vineyards. The boy will have learned something through
   his sire and you that know the Lord are the only people who can serve
   Him in His vineyard--that is to say, in winning souls for Christ none
   can do this but those who are won, themselves. If there is a lost child
   to be reclaimed, he shall be brought in by one of the children who has,
   himself, been found. Unto the wicked God says, "What have you to do to
   declare My statutes?" but to you who are His sons and daughters He
   entrusts the Gospel, putting you in trust with it that you may bear it
   to others and bring others to know and love His name.

   Oh, dear Friends, it must be a dreadful thing to be trying to save the
   souls of others while you, yourselves, are lost! And what an unhappy
   mortal must he be who has to preach the Gospel that he never knew--to
   tell of promises that he has never believed, and to preach a Christ in
   whom his soul has never trusted! But when the Lord speaks to you as His
   son and His daughter, the very fact that you stand in that relationship
   to Him proves that you have some qualification for the service and,
   therefore, dear Brother or Sister, you must not back out of it. You
   must not wrap your talent in a napkin, for you have got some talent in
   the very fact of being a child of God--a son or daughter of the Most
   High!

   Thus have I tried to open up the character to whom the Lord speaks, but
   I cannot do it so as to interest those who are not His people. But I do
   say this to those of you who are a people near to Him, to whom He
   stands as a Father, that this fact has strong claims upon you. If I am
   a father, where is my honor? If you are my children, where is your
   fear? If, indeed, the Lord has put you into His family, do you not owe
   to Him the obedience and the love of children? And what can be more
   natural that if there is household work to do--vineyard work to
   do--your Father should look to you to do it, and turn to you whom He
   has loved so long and loved so well, and say, "Son, Daughter, go work
   today in My vineyard"?

   II. Well, now, secondly, let us turn to the next point, and that is,
   THE SERVICE TO WHICH THE LORD CALLS US--"Go work." I know some
   Christians who do not like the word, "work," and they look very black
   in the face if you say anything about duty. As for the matter of that,
   I do not mind how black they look, because there are some people who
   very much expose their own disposition by black looks and sullen moods.
   And when they turn sour they only manifest what is in their own nature.
   He that quarrels with the precept, quarrels with God! Let him remember
   that. And he that does not like the practical part of Christianity may
   do what he likes with the doctrinal part of it, for he has neither part
   nor lot in this matter.

   The language of the true child of God is, "I delight myself in Your
   precepts." And, as David put it, "Your precepts have been my song in
   the house of my pilgrimage." He would even sing about the precepts of
   the Gospel! And now the text says, "Go work." That is something
   practical, something real! Go work. He does not say, "My Son, go and
   think and speculate, and make curious experiments, and fetch out some
   new doctrines and astonish all your fellow creatures with whims and
   oddities of your own." "My Son, go work." And He does not, here, say,
   "My Son, go and attend

   conferences, one after another all the year round and live in a
   perpetual maze of hearing different opinions and going from one public
   meeting and one religious engagement to another--and so feed yourself
   on the fat things full of marrow."

   All this is to be attended to in its proper proportion, but here it is,
   "Go work! Go work!" How many Christians there are that seem to read,
   "Go plan." And they always figure in a way with some wonderful plan for
   the conversion of all the world, but they are never found laboring to
   convert a baby--never having a good word to say to the tiniest child in
   the Sunday school! They are always scheming and yet never effecting
   anything. But the text says, "My Son, go work." Oh, yes, but those who
   do not like to work, themselves, display the greatness of their talents
   in finding fault with those who do work, and a very clear perception
   they have of the mistakes and the crotchets of the very best of
   workers, whose zeal and industry are, alike, unflagging.

   However, the text does not say, "My Son, go and criticize." What it
   distinctly says, is, "Go and work." I remember that when Andrew Fuller
   had a very severe lecture from some Scottish Baptist Brethren about the
   discipline of the Church, he made the reply, "You say that your
   discipline is so much better than ours. Very well, but discipline is
   meant to make good soldiers. Now, my soldiers fight better than yours
   and I think, therefore, you ought not to say much about my discipline."
   So the real thing is not to be forever calculating about modes of
   Church government and methods of management and plans to be adopted and
   rules to be laid down which it shall be accounted a serious breach to
   violate.

   All well in their place, for order is good in its way. But come, now,
   let us go to work! Let us get something done! I believe the very best
   working for God is often done in a very irregular manner. I get more
   and more to feel like the old soldier of Waterloo when he was examined
   about the best garment that could be worn by a soldier. The Duke of
   Wellington said to him, "If you had to fight Waterloo over again how
   would you like to be dressed?" The answer was, "Please, Sir, I should
   like to be in my shirtsleeves." I think that is about the best! Get rid
   of everything superfluous and get at it and hack away!

   I would to God that some Christians could do that, just strip to it,
   get rid of the superfluities of orderliness and propriety--and
   everything else which hampers them in trying to get back poor souls.
   There they are, going down to Hell! And we are stickling about this
   mode, and that, and considering the best way not to do it--and
   appointing committees to consider and debate to adjourn and to
   postpone--and to leave the work in abeyance! The best way is to arise
   and do it! Let the committee sit afterwards. God grant we may. My son,
   go work today. Let it be something practical, something real, something
   actually done! And by good work is meant something that will involve
   effort, toil, earnestness, self-denial--perhaps something that will
   need perseverance.

   In right earnest you will need to stick to it. You will have heartily
   to yield yourself up to it and give up a good deal else that might
   hinder you in doing it. Oh, Christian men and women, you will not
   glorify God much unless you really put your strength into the ways of
   the Lord and throw your body, soul, and spirit--your entire manhood and
   womanhood--into the work of the Lord Jesus Christ! To do this you need
   not leave your families, or your shops, or your secular engagements.
   You can serve God in these things! They will often be vantage grounds
   of opportunity for you, but you must throw yourself into it!

   No one wins souls to Christ while they are half asleep! The battle that
   is to be fought for the Lord Jesus must be fought by men and women who
   are wide awake and quickened by the Spirit of God. "My Son, My
   Daughter, go work today." Do not go and play at teaching in Sunday
   schools. Do not go and play the preacher! Do not go and play at
   exhorting people at the corners of streets, or even play at giving away
   tracts. "My Son, go work." Throw your soul into it! If it is worth
   doing, it is worth doing well! And if it is worth doing well, it is
   worth doing better than you have ever done before! And even then it
   will be worth doing better, still, for when you have done your best you
   have still to reach forward to a something far beyond--for the best of
   the best is all too little for such a God and for such a service! "My
   Son, go work."

   Well, now, such a claim as this may, perhaps, you think, sound rather
   hard. But I could tell you of many who would be very glad, indeed, if
   the Lord would say that to them! I might tell you of some who seldom
   leave their couches! Some who can seldom sit upright through their
   weakness. Some to whom the nights are often full of pain and the days
   are spent in weariness. They have learned, by God's teaching, to be
   content to suffer--but sometimes they cannot stifle an ardent
   wish--they wish the Lord would let them serve Him! They do not envy,
   but yet there sometimes crosses over their

   mind the shadow of something like envy when they remember what
   opportunities some of you have, who are full of health and strength.

   I have seen my Brother minister laid aside, the voice, perhaps, gone,
   the lungs feeble, the heart prone to palpitate, and, oh, how he has
   wished that he could preach again! With what fervor has he said, "Oh,
   if I had but those opportunities over again, how I would try to use
   them better than when I was favored with them!" I tell you there are
   thousands of God's servants who would kiss the dust of His feet if He
   would only say to them, "Go work." I remember reading of a minister who
   had been laboring in America till he had fairly broken down. He had to
   take a tour for his health. He had not been away many days before he
   wrote in his diary, "There may be some ministers who count it a
   pleasure to be relieved from the duty of preaching, but I count it a
   misery. I would sooner preach as I have done in my own pulpit
   continually than I would see all the kingdoms of the world."

   And, indeed, there is no pleasure in the world like that of serving
   God! You will soon get tired if you have a vacation, but you will never
   get tired of a Divine vocation, though you may sometimes grow tired in
   it. Now, think that the Lord might have said to you, "Now, go and lie
   on that bed for 10 years. Go and pine away in consumption. I have
   nothing much for you to do. You have got to bear My will." Are you not
   glad that you are full of strength, or that you have some share of it,
   and that now your heavenly Father says, "Son, go work. I have given you
   strength. Go work"? Lord, we thank You for so kind and gentle a
   command!

   Besides, there is a great deal of honor in this work. You know how much
   your little boy wants to be a man. All boys do. When he first wears
   stick-up collars he congratulates himself upon the sign of anything
   like being a man. How proud he is of it! And if you, being a father,
   were to say to your boy, "My Son, you are now of such an age that I can
   trust you to do some work for me," see how the little man would begin
   to lift himself up! He is glad of it! And I am sure that if we look at
   it rightly, we who are the children of God ought to feel honored by our
   heavenly Father saying to us, "You may do something for Me."

   We must be very humble, for, after all, we cannot do anything except as
   He works in us to will and to do! But it is really very gratifying and
   ennobling to a poor mortal spirit to be allowed to do anything for God,
   yes, and to do what perfect saints above and holy angels cannot do, for
   oh, dear Brothers and Sisters, there is no glorified spirit that can go
   down that back street and up that blind alley, and up those staircases
   that seem as if they would tumble down under your feet! Go and talk to
   that dying woman about Christ! You have a privilege which honored
   Gabriel has not! Be thankful that you have it! There is no angel that
   can take that little child in the Sunday school class and tell it of
   "Gentle Jesus, meek and mild," and carry the little lamb for the Good
   Shepherd!

   The Lord sends you to do it. And it should be a point of thankfulness
   with us all that He has counted us worthy and put us into the
   ministry--into any part or parcel of that ministry--to do something for
   His name's sake. Well, we are always receiving--always receiving and it
   is very blessed--but still, in this, as in other things, it is more
   blessed to give than to receive! And when we can give back to God some
   little trifle of service, stained with our tears because it is no
   better than it is, oh, it is a happy and a blessed thing! How grateful
   you ought to be that the Lord says to you, "Son, go work today."

   And remember, once more, on this point, that the work to which the Lord
   calls us is very varied, therefore there is a great deal of change in
   it. And, besides that, it suits the different temperaments,
   constitutions, dispositions and abilities of His people. He says, "My
   Son, go work today in My vineyard." But He does not give you to do my
   work, and He does not give me to do your work. Dear Sister, you would
   like to do the work of such-and-such an excellent Christian woman,
   would you not? Yes, but that is naughty of you. Be satisfied to do your
   own! Suppose your housemaid always wanted to do the cook's work--the
   house would soon be in a mess! Better keep to your own place, dear
   Sister.

   Ah, there is a Brother here who says, "I think I could preach if I only
   had such-and-such a congregation." Very likely, Brother, but you had
   better preach to your own and do what good you can, there. Very likely
   I should do better with my own congregation and you will do better with
   yours than I could. Every man had better keep to his own work in his
   own place. And how thankful we ought to be that if one can preach a
   sermon, yet another can offer a prayer--that if one can go and speak to
   thousands--yet another can speak to ones and twos! There is work in the
   school. There is work in the family. There is work in the street. There
   is work in the workshop. There is work everywhere for Jesus if you will

   but stretch out your hands to find it and follow Solomon's good advice,
   "Whatever your hands find to do, do it with all your might."

   III. Now, THE TIME is the next thing. "My Son, go work today." That
   means directly--now. Brother, Sister, I will not say a word about what
   is your duty to do tomorrow. Let the morrow take care of itself. I will
   have nothing to say about what it will be right for you to do in 10
   years. If you are alive, Grace will be given to you for that. But what
   I have to say to you, in God's name is, "Go work today," and as the sun
   has gone down, let it be, "Go work tonight in My vineyard," if there is
   opportunity, even tonight, before another day's sun has dawned upon the
   world. "And why today?" Because, Brothers and Sisters, Your Father
   wants you to be at it at once.

   "Why do you stand here, all the day, idle?" If you have done nothing
   for Christ, you have wasted enough time. Do not rest today, but be at
   it now. He wants you to do it now because the vines are in a certain
   condition that require, just now, work. There is somebody in the world
   who is in a tender state of mind--to whom you may speak successfully.
   There is a mourner here who wants comfort tonight. There is one
   struggling against his conscience who needs urging on tonight in the
   right way. If the case is neglected, tonight, it will be like
   neglecting to trim the vines just at the proper time for taking away
   the superfluous wood.

   Now you can do it. You cannot do it on any other day. Therefore, "go
   work today." "Today," because there are certain dangers to which those
   whom you are about to bless are just now exposed. The devil is tempting
   them--it is necessary that you go and help them against that
   temptation. They are just now in despair. It is necessary that you step
   in with the Word of comfort from your Master's mouth. They are,
   perhaps, this very night, before they go to their rest, about to commit
   a great sin. Perhaps the Lord means you to interpose just now, before
   that sin is done. Son, Daughter, go work today--you are needed. There
   are very few laborers just now--many of them have gone. Son, Daughter,
   go today, while the others have gone out for their recreation--while
   the others are asleep and grown idle.

   There is a gap just now. It is at this very moment. Many a brave deed
   of valor owed its success to being done at once. If Horatius had not
   kept the bridge just in that same moment when the enemy endeavored to
   pass over, we should never have heard of him, nor of the brave deeds of
   old. There is a time of dearth--of need--there is an urgency. Son, God
   says to you, "Hasten, even now, and go work today in My vineyard."
   "Today." Mark that. It means work all day--work as long as you live!

   Son, if once you get into that vineyard, do not come home, again, until
   the day is done. I am always sorry when I hear of Christian people
   beginning to give up some of their work before the infirmities of old
   age come on. Although I think that many a minister, when he gets old,
   had better give up a charge for which he is not equal and take one
   smaller for which his strength would prevail. But I know that some give
   up this work and that, and they say, "Let the young people come and
   take their turn." Yes, yes, but suppose the sun were to stop shining
   and say, "There is a star over there. Let him have a turn and shine
   instead of me"?

   Suppose the moon were forever to give up shining in the night watches,
   and say that she has had enough of being out at night? And suppose the
   earth were to say it has had enough of yielding harvests? "Why should I
   yield any more? Let the sea take its turn and grow corn." And so, dear
   Christian Friends, keep on as long as you can! Who can blame dear old
   John Newton? When he got too feeble to get up the pulpit stairs of St.
   Mary Woolnoth, he was helped up and then, leaning on his pulpit Bible
   he poured out his soul. A friend of his said to him, "Dear Mr. Newton,
   don't you think you ought to give up preaching?" "What?" he asked,
   "shall the old African blasphemer ever give up praising the Grace of
   God as long as there is breath in his body? Never!"

   And so he went to his work again. Oh, for more of that spirit to
   persevere in the Master's service! Only there is this thought--it is
   only a day. "Son, go work today." It will only be a day. The longest
   life is no more and then the shadows of death will gather. But there
   will be no night, for instead, the day shall break and the shadows
   shall flee away--and then life's service, here below, will all be over.
   There will be no troublesome children to teach, no hard-hearted sinners
   to rebuke, no backsliding, lukewarm Christians to reprove, no deceivers
   to encounter, no skeptics to answer with the testimony that cannot be
   shaken, no scoffers to put up with, patiently bearing their contumely.

   It will be all over, then! And then shall those who have served their
   Master behold Him gird Himself and sit down and serve them--and they
   shall feast at His table and enter into His joy! "My Son, Daughter, go
   work today," for you

   shall rest tomorrow. Work on, for there is rest enough in Heaven! Work
   on, for eternity shall well repay you for the toils of time!

   IV. Then, as to THE PLACE WHERE THE LORD CALLS US TO THE WORK. "My Son,
   go work today in My vineyard." I like to think of this special sphere
   of labor because it must be a pleasure to work in our Father's
   vineyard. For everything that we do there will be done for Him! I trim
   this vine--it is my Father's vine. I dig this trench--it is my Father's
   ground I turn. I gather out these stones--it is my Father's vineyard
   that I am engaged in clearing. I repair this fence--it is my Father's
   soil that I am thus hedging about. It is all done for Him! Who would
   not do all that he could for the dear Redeemer, dying Lamb and for the
   blessed Father of our spirits? "Go work today in My vineyard."

   Then what interesting work it is, for it is our own vineyard because it
   is our Father's vineyard! All that belongs to Him belongs to us. We are
   sons working in our Father's vineyard, so we can say, "This vine? Why,
   I have an interest in it, for I am the heir of my Father's property.
   This ground that I endeavor to dig about and fertilize? It is my
   ground, it is my Father's. And this wall that I try to mend? It is
   mine, it is my Father's." It is always pleasant to work for ourselves,
   you know. And, in a blessed sense, when we are working for God we are
   working for ourselves. You are laborers, you are God's farmers, you are
   God's people--and when you are working for the Lord you are really
   taking shares with Him.

   And what a work it is, too! "Go work today in My vineyard." One likes
   working in a vineyard because it pays. Working in a desert may be
   thankless toil, but working in a vineyard where there will be clusters
   is very different. One can already think of those juicy grapes that
   will be ready for the winepress! And for the festival, when the ruddy
   juice comes freely forth--when they make merry and joy in the vintage.
   And you will have the new wine and the wine on the lees well-refined.
   All sorts of pleasures await the man who serves the Lord!

   "Go work in My vineyard." Does it not mean that the work is plentiful?
   There is always something to be done in a vineyard. If you ask those
   who keep vines, they will tell you that there is much labor required.
   From one part of the year, right on to the end, there is something to
   be done, many dangers to be averted, and many enemies to be kept off
   the vines. So there is plenty to do, Brothers and Sisters. Go work in
   the vineyard where there will be need of all your hands. It is close at
   hand, hard by you, for the heavenly Father did not say, "Son, take a
   ship and go to Tarshish, or to Ophir." He said, "My Son, go work in My
   vineyard," and the vineyard was just out the back door there.

   Now, your heavenly Father's vineyard is close to you. Those streets
   where you live--the very house in which you dwell, perhaps the very
   chamber in which you sleep--is God's vineyard where you are to work for
   Him. It is your heavenly Father's own work to be done by you in your
   heavenly Father's own strength! Oh, if I might, tonight, by God's
   Grace, set one young man on fire with love to Christ I would be glad!
   If I could but be, by His Grace, the humble means of inspiring some
   Christian woman with the high mission of being useful in her day and
   generation, how much would my soul rejoice!

   There came into this Tabernacle one evening a young gentleman who was
   well known as being a great hand with his cricket bat. He was a
   Christian and full of earnestness in laying hold upon the great truths
   of Revelation! But he had never served his God. He thought it right to
   spend his leisure time in manly exercises and, in such pursuits, he
   sought recreation. But while I spoke, a fire kindled within him and he
   went home to begin to preach the Gospel in the streets of the city
   where he lived! And now he is the pastor of a large and influential
   Church which he has gathered together. Since then he has preached more
   than once, in this place, the Gospel of Jesus Christ! Oh, that some
   other Believer who may happen to be in that condition--some young man
   of ability who is spending all his strength on the world without going
   into anything grossly wrong, but simply wasting his talent--might hear
   a voice saying to him tonight, as he goes down that aisle, "My Son, go
   work today in My vineyard"!

   After dwelling so long upon the practical admonition, I have but little
   time left for that brief explanation of the parable, or more properly
   the parables of the vineyard with which, on the outset, I promised to
   close. The occasion on which they were spoken is memorable. Assailed
   "while He was teaching"--rudely interrupted by the legal Sanhedrim of
   the Jews with the High Priest in the forefront--they confronted our
   Lord, as it were, with a warrant and propounded to Him two questions.
   One as to the authority or title by which He acted--the other as to the
   source from which His authority was derived.

   You all know how skillfully He evaded His unscrupulous antagonists. "I,
   also, will ask you one thing," He said. And He asked them a question
   that left them in a ridiculous parley, for, "they reasoned among
   themselves," went aside to

   whisper, and then drew back in sheer timidity declining an answer, for,
   "they feared the people." Or, as you may read it, "They were afraid of
   the mob!" The advantage our Lord thus gained, He quickly followed up
   with a parable--in fact, with the parable we have been talking about.
   He opened it thus--"What do you think"--putting a query about two sons.
   The one forward in profession, yet utterly disobedient. The other
   sullen in appearance though afterwards penitent in spirit and diligent
   in labor. The thing was so obvious that they answer without hesitation
   with a reply that nailed the censure to their own breasts!

   "Which of these two did the will of his father?" They said unto Him,
   "the first." Read it, read the parable for yourselves. Realize the
   force of it if you can! The penitent harlot and the obdurate High
   Priest are put in the scales. "In the way of righteousness"--according
   to the truthful caricature--the chief priests and elders, themselves,
   admit that "the first" of these two did the will of our heavenly
   Father! Digest this parable, I pray you! Almost without a break the
   vineyard supplied Him yet, again, with another parable which He
   insisted on their hearing--a parable that brought out the character of
   the dispensation and "the signs of the times" so distinctly that they
   could not fail to read it in the light of their own Prophets--and at
   the same time exposed the treachery of their counsel and conspiracy
   that they recognized their own portrait at once and perceived that He
   spoke of them!

   "The vineyard," you are all aware, was the constant symbol of the
   Jewish nation as a theocracy. The men that sat in Moses' seat were the
   stewards in charge of that vineyard which was Jehovah's special
   property. They, like the perverse rulers of every age, sought to
   shelter their evil designs under cover of syndicates and conferences.
   But the words and warning's of Jesus, His proverbs and parables, were
   keen enough to probe all their subtleties and leave them to stand
   abashed without an excuse for the guile of their hearts or the guilt of
   their conduct!

   Now remember that the kingdom of God was taken from them and given to a
   nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. To what nation is it given?
   Is it not to the Church which is called "a chosen generation, a royal
   priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show
   forth the praises of Him who has called you out of darkness into His
   marvelous light"? The vine is the express symbol of our Christian life,
   as all Believers are incorporated with Christ. Well then, there is a
   vineyard of God's own planting--you believe that. He has let it out to
   farmers--you believe that. He will come seeking fruit of this
   vineyard--you believe that. You are, dear Brothers and Sisters, the
   children of the farmers-- you believe that, or else you would not
   presume to sit at His table and drink of His cup. He says, therefore,
   to you, "Son, go work in My vineyard." What answer do you give with
   your lips? What answer do you give with your life?

   Thus far I have not been speaking to unconverted people. I have not
   said a word to them. To them, however, I have this word to say, and I
   have done. I shall not ask you to work for Christ. I cannot exhort you
   to do anything for Him. You are not in a state of mind to do it! You
   must, first, believe in Him. Oh, let it be a sorrow to you, tonight,
   that you are incapable of serving Christ! Till you get a new heart and
   a right spirit you have no capacity to serve Him! You have first, to
   trust Christ and to prove in your own souls that this Gospel is the
   power of God to your salvation. Your eyes must be opened! Before you
   can do anything for Him, you must be turned from darkness to light and
   from the power of Satan to God that you may receive forgiveness of sins
   and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith in Jesus.

   Then, not till then, will you be meet to be made witnesses both of
   those things which you shall have seen and of those things in which He
   will hereafter reveal to you. You must be born again, yourselves,
   before you can travail in birth for others, till Christ is formed in
   them. You cannot testify, those of you by whom the testimony of Christ
   has not been received and in whom it is not confirmed. Your unskilled
   labor would be mischievous. Hands off such holy work till those hands
   have been washed clean by Jesus Christ! Come to Him and trust Him! Come
   to Him and believe in Him, and when He has saved you, then He will say
   to you, "Son, go work today in My vineyard."

Idols Abolished

   (No. 1339)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Ephraim shallsay, Whathave I to do anymore with idols?" Hosea 14:8.

   IDOLATRY was the great sin of the 10 tribes represented by Ephraim.
   Indeed, it is the sin of the entire human race! When we speak of
   idolatry we need not think of blocks of wood and stone and men bowing
   down before them, for our native land swarms with idolaters. Neither
   need you go into the streets to find them. Stay where you are and look
   into your own hearts--you will find idols there. This is the one easily
   besetting sin of our nature--to turn aside from the living God and to
   make unto ourselves idols in some fashion or another. The essence of
   idolatry is this--to love anything better than God, to trust anything
   more than God, to wish to have a god other than we have, or to have
   some signs and wonders by which we may see Him, some outward symbol or
   manifestation that can be seen with the eyes or heard with the ears
   rather than to rest in an invisible God and believe the faithful
   promise of Him whom eye has not seen nor ear heard.

   In some form or other this great sin is the main mischief in the heart
   of man. And even in saved men this is one of the developments of
   remaining corruption. We may very easily make an idol of anything and
   in many different ways. No doubt many mothers and fathers make idols of
   their children. And so many husbands and wives idolize each other and
   we may even make idols of ministers, even as there were idol shepherds
   of old. Equally is it certain that many a thoughtful man makes an idol
   of his intellect. Many another makes an idol of his gold, or even of
   that little home wherein he enjoys so much content. The ignorant papist
   holds up his crucifix and worships that--and that is one of his idols.

   But men who are better instructed often take the Bible and read it and,
   failing to get through the letter into the spirit, they trust in the
   mere act of Scripture reading and make even the Word of God, itself, to
   become an idol to them through their resting in a mere creed, or in
   Bible reading--not pressing through it to spiritual hearty worship of
   God, Himself. Anything, however holy, which comes between us and the
   personal dealing of our soul with God, as He is revealed in Christ
   Jesus by faith and love and hope, becomes an idol to us!

   There are idols of all sorts, more or less intrinsically valuable. Just
   as in material substances one idol is made of wood, another of stone,
   another of silver and another of gold so that these idols differ in
   value and yet they are all idols, so may men, according to their
   different grades of mind, make an idol of this or of that or of the
   other, every man according to his own fancy. Many of these idols may,
   in themselves, be considered good enough--but when they are made into
   idols they are none the better for that--a golden idol is just as
   obnoxious to God as a wooden one! And so the dearest and best thing on
   earth, if it is allowed to come between us and God, as an idol, becomes
   an abomination in the sight of the Most High.

   O Brothers and Sisters, when you cannot trust the Providence of God,
   but feel as if you must have something of visible substance to lean
   upon, you idolize your savings, or the money you covet! When you cannot
   take the bare promise of God and dare not risk everything for God, but
   need something over and above the Word of God to rest in, you idolize
   your own selfishness! When you must have marks and signs and evidences
   of the things which God has plainly declared-- and will not believe God
   unless you have corroborative proof--you are playing the idolater's
   part! Yet human nature continually craves for more than God
   All-Sufficient because it is so carnal that it will not trust the
   Invisible One. It is, therefore, a supreme work of Grace when God
   brings any man to say, "What have I to do any more with idols?" I ask
   your attention to four points.

   I. And the first is this--I want you to notice THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THIS
   PREDICTION. "Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?"
   God speaks of Ephraim as if Ephraim would do and must do what He
   declared it should do. "Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more
   with idols?" But who was this Ephraim? If we look at him as an
   individual, he represents the 10 tribes of Israel at the time when they
   were wedded to strange gods. Ephraim is a man

   and, therefore, he has a will of his own. He is a depraved man and,
   therefore, he has an obstinate will. And yet God speaks about Ephraim
   as positively as if he had no will, and states that he shall say, "What
   have I to do any more with idols?"

   It would be very difficult to say what the wind will do--very hard to
   say what the waves will do. But man's will is more changeable and
   uncontrollable than the winds and the waves! Yet God speaks as if
   Ephraim were absolutely in His hands and He tells us what Ephraim shall
   say, and, in fact, what Ephraim shall feel. It is wonderful--is it
   not?--that God, who knows the inconstancy and willfulness of humans,
   thus speaks about the mind of man and declares what he shall say and
   what he shall feel?

   Now, in all this it is to be observed that there is no violation of the
   human will. Men are not blocks of wood, nor lumps of unconscious clay!
   God has made man a creature that wills and determines and judges for
   himself and He deals with him as such. There are persons who seem to
   fancy that whenever we speak of God as being Omnipotent in the realm of
   mind and speak of His declaring what men shall do and feel, that we,
   therefore, deny free agency. By no manner of means! We are never
   prepared, for the sake of one Truth of God, to deny another! And we do
   as heartily believe in free agency as we do in predestination!

   It has never been our custom to murder one Truth of God in order to
   make room for another! There is room enough for two Truths of God in
   the mind of the man who is willing to become as a little child. Yes,
   there is room in a teachable heart for 50 Truths of God to live without
   contention! God treats men as men and as intelligent creatures. Having
   granted them power of judgment and will, He treats them as such, and He
   does not use that force upon the soul which it would be legitimate to
   use upon a piece of metal if it had to be bored or to be melted! Nor
   does He even use such force as it is legitimate to use upon "an ox and
   an ass which have no understanding, whose mouth must be held in with
   bit and bridle, lest they come near unto you."

   No, no! Under Heaven there is no man whose will God has ever violated!
   He has made the saved man's will all the freer by the constraints which
   Grace has put upon it! Grace does not enchain the will, but frees the
   will! And when a man sincerely says, "What have I to do any more with
   idols?" though that speech is totally contrary to all the intent of his
   former life, yet he says it with the full consent of his heart! No, he
   never said anything more willingly than he says this, when God, by
   Divine power has, "made him willing in the day of His power!" I wonder
   whether you are able to grasp, dear Brothers and Sisters, and lay hold
   of these two great Truths of God--first, that man is made a creature
   responsible for all his actions, and a free agent so constituted that
   God, Himself, will not violate that free agency!

   And yet this other Truth of God which we will maintain with all
   boldness--that God is as Omnipotent in the region of mind and free
   agency as He is in the realm of mere matter! He looks upon the hills
   and they smoke. He touches the earth and it trembles. The sea obeys Him
   and pauses where He bids it stay. Yes, earthquake and tempest are
   entirely under His control! Nobody who believes in an Omnipotent God
   doubts these things. But it is equally true that God enlightens the
   dark understanding with a flash of His Spirit. It is true that God
   removes the iron sinew of the obstinate will. As to the
   affections--when the heart is like stone, cold, dead, heavy,
   immovable--He has a way of turning the stone to flesh. He can do what
   He wills with men and when His Spirit puts forth all His power, though
   men may resist, yet there is a point beyond which resistance absolutely
   ceases and the soul is led in joyful captivity to the conquering Spirit
   of the blessed God!

   Now, somebody will again say, "But how do you make this consistent? You
   now talk contrary to the statements you made before." No, my dear
   Brother, I do not. They are both true--man is free, yet God is a
   Sovereign in the world of free minds--working His own way and speaking,
   thus, positively, without if or but or an. Don't you know that He will
   have His will and man's will shall willingly bow to His will, for He
   alone is Lord? Let me read you God's wills, God's wonderful wills, as
   they stand in this chapter, "I will heal their backsliding. I will love
   them freely for My anger is turned away from him. I will be as the dew
   unto Israel. He shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as
   Lebanon. His branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive
   tree, and his smell as Lebanon. Ephraim shall say, What have I to do
   any more with idols?"

   God speaks about men as if they were absolutely puppets in His hands
   and yet, at the same time, in other places He puts them upon their
   personal responsibility--both the doctrines are true! It is not yours
   or mine to ask how they are to be reconciled, much less to cast either
   of the Truths of God away! But let us hold them both fast, for these
   two shall be a clue through many a mystery of intricate doctrine and
   lead us into the light of God on many a dark saying. I rejoice to

   hear the almighty Lord speak thus divinely of what man shall do! And I
   adore the amazing wisdom and power which can rule over free agents!

   II. But now, secondly, in our text we see A MARVELLOUS CHANGE. "Ephraim
   shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?" Who is this Ephraim?
   Why, if you read the book of Hosea through you will find him turning up
   continually. Ephraim--Who was he? Who is this that says, "What have I
   to do any more with idols?" I will tell you. It is that same Ephraim of
   whom the Lord had said, "Leave him alone: he is given unto idols." This
   is different talk, is it not? At one time he is "glued" to his idols,
   for that is the word used in the original--glued to them as if he was
   stuck to them and could not get away at all.

   But here he is saying, "What have I to do any more with them?" What a
   change it is! Is that the same man? Yes, the same man. But mark what
   the Grace of God has done for him. See, also, how resolute he is. He
   speaks plainly and positively, "What have I to do any more with idols?"
   Is this the same man that we read of in a former chapter, "Ephraim is a
   silly dove without heart"? Yes, he was "a silly dove without heart,"
   but now, this same Ephraim, is saying, "What have I to do any more with
   idols?" He is speaking as if he had received a new, enlightened, bold
   and decided heart! This is a change, is it not?

   The man who was glued to his idols and full of vacillation whenever
   better things came before him, is now clean separated from his former
   trusts and made to hate them! He no longer vacillates and hesitates,
   but takes his stand and asks with glorious promptitude, "What have I to
   do any more with idols?" It is a great change! And it is such a great
   change as many of us have undergone! And it is such a change as
   everybody here must undergo or else they shall never see the face of
   God with acceptance! Conversion, which is the first fruit of
   regeneration, makes such a difference in a man that it is as though he
   had been dead and buried and were now raised from the dead into newness
   of life! It is as much a change as if the man were destroyed and then
   were made a new creature in Christ Jesus!

   I wonder whether you have all felt such a change as this? I sometimes
   meet with persons who claim to be Christians and Believers and all
   that, but they have never experienced any change that they can remember
   from their babyhood. Well, dear Friend, there must have been such a
   change if you are a Christian! I will not say that you ought to know
   the day and the hour, but, depend upon it, if you are now what you were
   when you were born, you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds
   of iniquity! If there has not been a turning, you are going the wrong
   way! Every man must be turned from the way in which father Adam set his
   face, for our face is towards sin and destruction, and we must be
   turned right round so as to have our faces towards holiness and
   everlasting life.

   Where there is not such a turning, there is the most solemn cause for
   heart-searching, humiliation and for the seeking of salvation! Have you
   undergone a great transformation? The necessity for it is no fantasy of
   mine, remember. It is that most solemn word of the New Testament--"You
   must be born again." There must be a complete and total change in you,
   so that the things you once loved you come to hate and the things you
   hated you are made to love--as great a change as there was in Ephraim
   who was formerly glued to his idols and then came to abhor them!

   I pray you all search and see whether such a difference has been made
   in your hearts by the Holy Spirit--for a mistake here will be fatal. If
   you have never undergone such a renewing, let the prayer be breathed
   that the Holy Spirit may now renew you in the spirit of your mind. And
   if you hope that such a change has taken place upon you, then may God
   grant it may be a real abiding conversion, so that you may remain in
   Grace and go from strength to strength till the idols are utterly
   abolished and your whole nature shall become the temple of the living
   God! Thus, we have two remarks--a sovereign prediction and a marvelous
   change.

   III. Thirdly, there is in our text AN IMPLIED CONFESSION. "Ephraim
   shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?" "Any more with
   idols?" Then, Ephraim, you have had a good deal to do with idols up
   till now? "Yes," he says, with tears in his eyes, "that I have."
   Hypocrites mean less than their language expresses, but true penitents
   mean much more than their bare words can convey. The confession of the
   text is all the more hearty because it is tacit and, as it were, slips
   out unintentionally. Listen earnestly dear Hearers, for, perhaps, some
   of you may be worshipping idols now.

   We will go into the temple of your heart and see whether we can find a
   false god there. I go into one heart and, as I look up, I see a
   gigantic idol! It is gilded all over and clothed in shining robes! Its
   eyes seem to be jewels and its forehead is "as bright ivory overlaid
   with sapphires." It is a very lovely idol to look upon. Come not too
   close, do not examine too severely, nor so much as dream of looking
   inside the hollow sham! Within it you will find all manner of
   rottenness and

   filthiness, but the outside of the idol is adorned with the greatest
   art and skill--and you may even become enamored by it as you stand and
   gaze upon it! What is its name? Its name is self-righteousness!

   Well do I remember when I used to worship this image which my own hands
   had made till one morning my god had his head broken off and,
   by-and-by, I found his hands were gone. And soon I found that the worm
   was devouring it and my god that I worshipped and trusted in turned out
   to be a heap of dross and dung--and I had thought it to be a mass of
   solid gold with eyes of diamonds! Alas, there are many men to whom no
   such revelation has been given. Their idol is still in first-rate
   condition. True, perhaps, at Christmas time it gets a little out of
   order and they feel that they did not quite behave as they ought when
   the bottle went round so freely--but they have called in the goldsmith
   to overlay the idol with new gold and gild the chipped places afresh!

   Have they not been to church since then? Did they not go on Christmas
   morning to a place of worship and make it all right? Have they not
   repeated extra prayers and given a little more away to charity? So they
   have furbished their god up again and he looks very respectable! Ah, it
   is easy to tinker him up, my Brothers and Sisters, until the Ark of the
   Lord comes in! And then all the smiths in the world cannot keep this
   god erect! If the Gospel of Jesus Christ once enters into the soul,
   then, straightway, this wonderful god begins to bow himself and, like
   Dagon, who was broken before the Ark of the Lord, self-righteousness is
   dashed to pieces!

   But there are thousands all over this world who worship this god and I
   will tell you how they pray to it. They say, "God, I thank you that I
   am not as other men are," and so on--not exactly in the Pharisee's
   language, but after the same style. "Lord, I thank you that I pay
   everybody 20 shillings in the pound and have brought up my children
   respectably. God, I thank you that I have been a regular church-going
   or chapel-going man all my life. God, I thank you that I am not a
   swearer, nor yet a drunk, nor anything of that kind. I am far better
   than most people and if I do not get to Heaven it will be very bad for
   my neighbors, for they are not half as good as I am!"

   In this manner is this monstrous deity adored! I am not speaking of
   what is done in Hindustan, but of an idolatry very fashionable in
   England! The god of self-righteousness is lord paramount in millions of
   hearts! Oh, that every worshipper of that god may be led to say, "What
   have I to do any more with this abominable idol?" Another sort of god I
   have seen in the human heart is the idol of darling sin. A person not
   long ago said--"Well, I suppose there is a good deal in religion, but,
   you see, I am on the turf and I could not leave it. How could I? I
   could not, of course, become a Christian, and yet be known to be a
   betting man." Yes, the betting ring was his god. The running horse is
   as favorite a deity as were the calves of Bethel.

   Another man says, "Yes, yes. I should be glad to be a Christian, but,
   you see, I love the bottle. I must occasionally enjoy a drop too much.
   Not often, you know, but now and then at convivial meetings, holidays
   and bonfire nights. A man must be drunk sometimes, must he not? And
   where's the harm? I could not give it up." They do not say so in actual
   words, but that is what they mean, thousands of them! They must still
   keep Bacchus for their god and offer him their sacrifices. And, ah,
   what sacrifices they make! How they ruin health and destroy life,
   itself, beggar their children, make their wives wretched--and all to
   worship this dunghill god of drink!

   Others have some other darling sin. I need not mention all. In fact I
   could not, for the cheek of modesty would tingle if we were to mention
   certain of the vices which men and women feel that they could not cease
   from. They would gladly be saved in their sins, but not from their
   sins. They would worship God after a fashion, but the first place must
   be given to this darling lust of theirs. O Sir, I care not what idol it
   is, but if there is anything in this world that you love better than
   Christ, you can never see the face of God with joy! If there is any sin
   that you would persevere in, I beseech you change your mind about it
   and cut it off though it is a right hand! Pluck it out though it is a
   right eye! It were better for you to enter into life maimed and with
   one eye than having both hands and both eyes to be cast into Hell fire!
   Darling sins must be renounced if Christ is to be enjoyed!

   Behold how idolaters disagree--one adores righteous self and another
   worships sinful self--but both idols must be utterly abolished! In some
   men's hearts I see the love of pleasure. That god is seated on the
   throne of many hearts. They are overcome, not so much by the grosser
   sins, as by their natural levity and trifling. They cannot think. They
   do not want to think. They say they are, "dull," if they have to be
   quiet for awhile. They like to be always amused, gratified, excited.
   Now, there is a measure of recreation which is as good as medicine to
   both body and soul. And there are proper

   recreations to be had. God has provided innocent pleasures and we shall
   do well to accept them with gratitude from our heavenly Father.

   But to be a lover of pleasure rather than a lover of God is to be dead
   while you live! To make your belly your god, to live to eat and drink,
   to be just meat-digesters and wine-strainers, to be living here merely
   to enjoy yourself-- butterflies flitting from flower to flower,
   gathering no honey, but merely seeking pleasure--this is evil! Sirs,
   this is a god that will not be worshipped by one who knows the love of
   the real God, for his god is his pleasure and pleasure is not his god.
   He casts aside, full often, things that he might otherwise have allowed
   himself to enjoy, that he may honor and glorify his Savior the more.

   Many worship the golden calf. They indulge no vice and pursue no
   pleasure except their one vice and their one pleasure which is their
   greed of gold. If you want to awaken all their energies, jingle a
   guinea near them! This they pursue as the hounds pursue the fox, never
   resting. They fear they will be poor when they are old. They make
   themselves poor when they are young. And, lest they should be starved
   at last, they starve themselves to the last! We have known some to whom
   honor, love, uprightness, integrity, religion have all been nothing
   whatever, so long as gain could be had by sacrificing them. The great
   fabric of their fortune has rolled along, like the car of Juggernaut,
   crushing everything that has been in its way.

   Widows might weep and orphans might lament. The groans of those whom
   they oppressed might go up to Heaven and the iniquities which they have
   perpetrated might go before them unto judgment--but it was nothing to
   them. They were adding field to field and house to house and getting
   richer and richer--they lived for that and for that they seemed content
   to die. O God, convert the man who worships gold! Milton, you know,
   describes the demon of greed as--

   "Mammon the least erected spirit that fell

   From Heaven, for even in Heaven

   His looks and thoughts

   Were always downward bent, admiring more

   The riches of Heaven's pa vement, trodden gold,

   Than anything Divine or holy else enjoyed

   In vision Beatific."

   This vice is very degrading and well does Milton place Mammon in Hell
   and say--

   "Let none admire That riches grow in Hell. That soil may best Deserve
   the precious bane."

   Now, when the Lord delivers a man from the power of the devil, he
   cries, "What have I to do any more with making wealth my idol?" He
   grows content, becomes the Lord's steward and uses his substance in the
   service of Jesus.

   We must go round these temples as quickly as we can and not stop long
   in any one of them, for they are not very sweet--some in the temple of
   their hearts have set up unlawful attachments. They form connections
   which are forbidden by the Word of God. For instance, I have known some
   who profess to be Christians--God knows whether they ever were or
   not--who have put altogether out of court the command of our Lord not
   to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. They have followed the
   dictates of the flesh by joining in marriage with the ungodly. It is a
   dreadful thing to be married to one from whom you know you must be soon
   separated forever--one who loves not God and, therefore, can never be
   your companion in Heaven!

   If that is your case, already, your prayers should day and night go up
   to Heaven for the partner of your bosom, that he or she may be brought
   to Christ. But for any young person willfully to form such a tie is to
   set up an idol in the place of God! Weeping and wailing will come of it
   before long! Any form of love which divides the heart from Jesus is
   idolatry and, alas, I fear the idols are as many as the trees of the
   field! Lord, remove them far from us! A great number of persons worship
   an idol called the praise of men. They speak after this fashion, "Oh,
   yes, you are right enough, but, you see, I could not do it." Well, why
   not? "Why, I do not know what my uncle would say about it, or I could
   not tell how my wife would like it. I am not sure if my grandfather
   would be pleased with me."

   The fear of relatives and the dread of public opinion hold many in
   mental and moral bondage--and the fear of men holds many more. I pity
   those who dare not do what they believe to be right! It seems to me to
   be the grandest of all

   liberties, the liberty wherewith Christ makes us free! The liberty to
   do and dare anything which conscience commands in His name. But numbers
   of people have to ask other people to allow them to breathe, to allow
   them to think, to allow them to believe anything! And there is nothing
   they are so frightened of as Mrs. Grundy. The little society in which
   they live is all in all to them. What will So-and-So think of it? The
   working man dares not go to a place of worship because the carpenters
   in the shop would be down upon him. The men that work with him would be
   saying to him, "Halloa! What? Are you one of those methodistical
   fellows?"

   Many men who are six feet high are cowards and are afraid of some
   little body half their height! They are afraid that some worthless
   fellow would make a joke at their expense--and to be joked at seems to
   be something dreadful! O poor souls! Poor souls! All the jokes they are
   likely to get will be very lukewarm water compared with the scalding
   hot cauldron into which some of us have been plunged into year after
   year--when we could not speak a word without having it
   misinterpreted--and could not utter a sentence without being belied!
   Yet they shrink from their little persecutions as if they were a great
   martyr!

   We are alive, after all the assaults which were made upon us, and not
   much the worse for them--and so will you be, too, dear Friends--if you
   have the heart and the courage to do and dare for the Lord Jesus
   Christ! This idol of the fear of man devours thousands of souls! This
   is a bloodthirsty idol! It is as cruel as any of the idols of the
   Hindus--this "fear of man which brings a snare." Some of you know that
   you are altogether mean in spirit and dare not do what you know you
   ought to do for fear somebody or other should make a remark about how
   strange and how odd you are. God help you to have done with that idol!

   Thus we have considered the implied confession that we have had most
   evil dealings with idols.

   IV. The last point is to be THE RESOLUTE QUESTION, "What have I to do
   any more with idols?" Let us put it this way, "What have I to do any
   more with them? I have had enough to do with them. What have my sins
   done for me, already?" Brothers and Sisters, look at what sin has done
   for us and all our race! It made that beautiful Eden, which was our
   garden of delight, to be a wilderness! It has made us to be the
   children of toil and sorrow! What has sin done for us? It has stripped
   us of our beauty! It has put us away from God! It has set the flaming
   cherubim with the drawn sword to keep us back from coming near to God
   as long as we live in sin.

   Sin has wounded us, spoiled us, killed us, corrupted us! Sin has
   brought disease into the world and dug the grave and bred the worm. O
   Sin, you are the mother of all the griefs and groans and sighs and
   tears that ever befell men and women in this world! O wretched Sin,
   what have we to do any more with you? We have had more than enough of
   you! And have not you and I, personally, had quite enough to do with
   our idols? I had enough to do with my self-righteousness, I do boldly
   say, for, oh, how I loathe to think that I should ever have been such a
   fool as to think that there was anything good in me--to think that I
   could ever have dreamed of coming before God with a righteousness of my
   own!

   Oh, how I abhor the thought! God forbid for one single moment that I
   should ever be other than ashamed of having boasted in anything that I
   could do, or feel, or be! Do you not feel yourselves humiliated at the
   remembrance of such pride and presumption? What have you to do any more
   with the idol of righteous self? Nothing! We can never bow down before
   that any more! With regard to other idols, have you not smarted enough
   about them? The convert who was once a drunk will say, "I have had
   enough to do with the cup of intoxication. Who has woe? Who has redness
   of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine. The men of strength to
   mingle strong drink." The winebibber has had enough to do with that. He
   has paid heavy smart money and now he has done with rioting and excess
   forever.

   The man who has plunged into vice will often have to say, "It has
   injured me in body, mind and estate. What more can I have to do with
   it?" "Ah," said one to me the other day, "when I lived in sin it was so
   expensive that it will take me years to recover what I have wasted upon
   the devil and myself. I am not the man for the service of God that I
   could have been if it had not been for that." Ah, we have all had
   enough of it--more than enough of it! There is no cup of sin, however
   sweet it was in the day of our unregeneracy, but we feel that we want
   no more of it--not even with all its beaded bubbles sparkling on the
   brim when it moves itself right. We are sick of it--sick to the death
   and the very name of it causes nausea in our soul. What have I to do
   any more with idols when I consider what idols have done for me?

   But there is another view of it. "What have I to do any more with
   idols?" Do you see? Can you bear to look upon that strange sight
   yonder--three crosses set upon a hill. And on the center one a wondrous
   Man, in fearful agony, nailed to the wood. If you look at Him you will
   see that there is such a mixture of majesty in His misery that you
   discover Him,

   at once, to be your Lord! Lo, it is the Bridegroom of your soul--your
   heart's best Beloved! And He is nailed up there like a felon hanged to
   die! Who nailed Him there? Who nailed Him there, I say? Where is the
   hammer? Where did the nails come from? Who nailed Him there?

   And the answer is--Our idols nailed Him there! Our sins pierced His
   heart! Ah, then, what have I to do any more with them? If I had a
   favorite knife and with it a murderer had killed my wife, do you think
   I would use it at my table or carry it about with me? Away with the
   accursed thing! How I should loathe the very sight of it! And sin has
   murdered Christ! Our idols have put our Lord to death! Stand at the
   foot of the Cross and see His murdered, mangled body, bleeding with its
   five great wounds and you will say, "What have I to do any more with
   idols?" The vinegar and gall, the bloody sweat and death pangs have
   divorced my soul from all its ancient loves and wedded my heart forever
   to the Well-Beloved, even the King of kings! "What have I to do any
   more with idols?"

   Nothing separates a man from sin like a sense of the love and the
   sufferings of Jesus! Redeeming Grace and dying love--these ring the
   death-knells of our lusts and idols--

   "Soon as faith the Lord can see,

   Bleeding on a Cross for me,

   Quick my idols all depart,

   Jesus gets and fills my heart!"

   Now, you may remember, again, that we must have no more to do with
   idols, for the same sins which put our Lord to death will put us to
   death if they can. O child of God, you never sin without injuring
   yourself! The smallest sin that ever creeps into your heart is a robber
   seeking to kill and to destroy! You never profited by sin and never
   can. No, it is poison, deadly poison to your spirit. Do not, therefore,
   tolerate it for an instant. What have you to do with it? You know it is
   to be evil, only evil, and that continually. You know that it injures
   your faith, destroys your enjoyment, withers up your peace, weakens you
   in prayer, prevents your example being beneficial to others--and for
   all these reasons what have you to do any more with idols?

   Moreover, what have you to do any more with idols, now that you are a
   child of God--now that you are an heir of Heaven? A poor boy sits down
   and plays with bits of mud in the street and makes dirt pies with his
   little friends. One day there comes up a king's messenger who has
   discovered that this is a lost child from the palace! The child is
   taken home and washed. He is clothed in royal apparel and is told that
   he is a prince and that he is heir to a kingdom! Will he go back and
   play with the dirty boys in the street, again, and be a gutter-child, a
   street Arab? No, not he! He will be trained to something nobler and
   more befitting his position.

   And though you and I once loved the sin that others love and found
   amusement where others find it, we have now, by faith, received power
   to become the sons of God! We are heirs of God and joint-heirs with
   Jesus Christ! What have we to do any more with idols? What manner of
   people ought we to be whom the Lord has adopted into the royal family
   of Heaven? Within a few months some of us will be in Heaven--perhaps
   within a few weeks. What have we to do with idols? Even while we are
   here, the Lord has raised us up together and made us sit together in
   the heavenlies in Christ. What have we to do any more with idols? This
   day are we accepted in the Beloved, the elect of God, justified by
   faith--our names are engraved on the palms of Jesus' hands! What have
   we to do any more with idols? Truly, the question answers itself. We
   have nothing to do with them except to loathe them! And whenever they
   are set up in our hearts, even for a moment, we are to break them down
   by the power of the Eternal Spirit.

   Now Beloved, if God has worked a great work in you and changed your
   hearts so that the idols you once worshipped you now detest, I would
   ask you to keep away from the idols all you can. If you have nothing to
   do with them, do not go into the places where they are held in honor.
   "What have I to do any more with idols?" If I knew that a street was
   infected with small-pox, I should not go out of my way to ride down it!
   I had rather go round about to avoid the plague. Let it be so with your
   once darling sin! Get as far away from it as you can, even as you would
   keep clear of a leper! You have nothing more to do with idols,
   therefore do not enter their temples or make a league with their
   worshippers.

   It is an old Rabbinical tradition with regard to the Nazarites that as
   they were not to drink wine so they were bid not eat the grape, nor go
   through a vineyard. The old proverb was, "O Nazarite, go about, go
   about, but go not through a vineyard lest you be tempted to eat of the
   grape and afterwards to drink of the juice thereof." There is a great
   spiritual and moral lesson here for us. Keep as far away from sin as
   ever you can! If you have learned to say, "What have I

   to do any more with idols?" avoid the very appearance of evil and all
   those communications which corrupt good manners.

   The ale house, the dancing saloon and the theater are not for you. I
   loathe to hear Christian people say, "What do you think of
   this-and-that foolish amusement? Do you think I might go as far as
   that?" Well, my dear Friend, if you enjoy anything that has any filth
   in it, I question whether you know anything about the love of God at
   all! You remember Rowland Hill's observation to the person who said he
   liked to go the theater. The person said, "Well, you know, Mr. Hill, I
   am a member of the Church. And I do not go to the theater often. I only
   go once or twice a year, just for a treat."

   "Ah," said Mr. Hill, "you are a great deal worse than I thought you
   were! Suppose it were reported commonly that Mr. Hill fed on carrion
   and was very fond of eating rotten meat. And suppose somebody came to
   me and said, 'I hear, Mr. Hill, that you are very fond of eating
   carrion.' 'Oh, no,' I say, 'Not at all. I do not regularly feed on it,
   I only eat a dish of it once or twice a year for a treat!' Then
   everybody would say, 'You are fonder of it than we thought. For if poor
   creatures have to eat it every day because they cannot get anything
   better, their taste is not so corrupt as yours who turn away from
   wholesome food and find rottenness to be a dainty dish.'"

   If you can find your pleasure and delight where sin of the worst kind
   is always very near at hand, where religion would be out of place and
   where Christ, your Master, would not be expected to come, you have not
   learned to say with Ephraim, "What have I to do any more with idols?"
   Run away from anything which has the least taint of sin and may God
   help you to do so even to the end! Is this in order that you may be
   saved? God forbid! I am only speaking to you who are saved already!

   If you are not saved, the first thing is to have a renewed heart by
   faith in Jesus Christ! And after that we lay no bondage on you and
   exact no tax from you by way of duty--but it will be your joy, your
   delight, your privilege--to keep near to your Master and to say, "What
   have I to do any more with idols?" God bless you for Christ's sake!
   Amen.

Manoah's Wife and Her Excellent Argument

   (No. 1340)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have
   seen God. But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill
   us, He would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at
   our hands, neither would He have showed us all these things, nor would
   He at this time ha ve told us such things as these." Judges 13:22,23.

   The first remark arising out of the story of Manoah and his wife is
   this--that oftentimes we pray for blessings which will make us tremble
   when we receive them. Manoah had asked that he might see the Angel and
   he saw Him--in answer to His request the Wonderful One condescended to
   reveal Himself a second time, but the consequence was that the good man
   was filled with astonishment and dismay. And turning to His wife, he
   exclaimed, "We shall surely die, because we have seen God."

   Brothers and Sisters, do we always know what we are asking for when we
   pray? We are imploring an undoubted blessing and yet if we knew the way
   in which such blessing must necessarily come, we would, perhaps,
   hesitate before we pressed our case. You have been entreating very much
   for growth in holiness. Do you know, Brother, that in almost every
   case, that means increased affliction? We do not make much progress in
   the Divine life except when the Lord is pleased to try us in the
   furnace and purge us with many fires. Do you desire the mercy on that
   condition? Are you willing to take it as God pleases to send it, and to
   say, "Lord, if spiritual growth implies trial. If it signifies a long
   sickness of body. If it means deep depression of soul. If it entails
   the loss of property. If it involves the taking away of my dearest
   friends, yet I make no reserve, but include in the prayer all that is
   necessary to the good end. When I say, sanctify me wholly, spirit, soul
   and body, I leave the process to Your discretion."

   Suppose you really knew all that it would bring upon you, would you not
   pray, at any rate, with more solemn tones? I hope you would not
   hesitate, but, counting all the cost, would still desire to be
   delivered from sin. But, at any rate, you would put up your petition
   with deliberation, weighing every syllable, and then, when the answer
   came, you would not be so astonished at its peculiar form. Often and
   often the blessing which we so eagerly implored is the occasion of the
   suffering which we deplore. We do not know God's methods. This is the
   Lord's way of answering prayer for faith and Grace. He comes with rods
   of chastisement and makes us smart for our follies, for thus, alone,
   can He deliver our childish spirits from us.

   He comes with sharp plowshares and tears up the soil, for thus, only,
   can we be made to yield Him a harvest. He comes with hot irons and
   burns us to the heart. And when we inquire, "Why all this?" the answer
   comes to us, "This is what you asked for. This is the way in which the
   Lord answers your requests." Perhaps, at this moment, the fainting
   feeling that some of you are now experiencing, which makes you fear
   that you will surely die, may be accounted for by your own prayers! I
   should like you to look at your present sorrows in that light, and say,
   "After all, I can see that now my God has given me exactly what I
   sought at His hands. I asked to see the Angel and I have seen Him, and
   now it is that my spirit is cast down within me."

   A second remark is this--Very frequently deep prostration of spirit is
   the forerunner of some remarkable blessing. It was to Manoah and to his
   wife the highest conceivable joy of life, the climax of their ambition,
   that they should be the parents of a son by whom the Lord should begin
   to deliver Israel. Joy filled them--inexpressible joy--at the thought
   of it! But, at the time when the good news was first communicated,
   Manoah, at least, was made so heavy in spirit that he said, "We shall
   surely die, for we have seen God." Take it as a general rule that dull
   skies foretell a shower of mercy. Expect sweet favor when you
   experience sharp affliction.

   Do you not remember, concerning the Apostles, that they feared as they
   entered into the cloud on Mount Tabor? And yet it was in that cloud
   that they saw their Master transfigured! And you and I have had many a
   fear about the cloud we were entering, although there we were to see
   more of Christ and His Glory than we had ever beheld before. The cloud
   which you fear makes the external wall of that secret chamber where the
   Lord reveals Himself! Before you can carry Samson in your arms, Manoah,
   you must be made to say, "We shall surely die." Before the minister
   shall preach the Word of God to thousands, he must be emptied and made
   to tremble under a sense of inability.

   Before the Sunday school teacher shall bring her girls to Christ, she
   shall be led to see how weak and insufficient she is. I believe that
   whenever the Lord is about to use us in His household, He takes us like
   a dish and wipes us right out and sets us on the shelf--and then
   afterwards He takes us down and puts thereon His own heavenly meat,
   with which to fill the souls of others. There must, as a rule, be an
   emptying, a turning upside down and a putting on one side before the
   very greatest blessing comes. Manoah felt that he must die and yet he
   could not die, for he was to be the father of Samson, the deliverer of
   Israel and the terror of Philistia!

   Let me offer a third remark, which is this--great faith is, in many
   instances, subject to fits. What great faith Manoah had! His wife was
   barren, yet when she was told by the Angel that she should bear a
   child, he believed it, although no heavenly messenger had come to him
   personally! He so believed it that he did not want to see the Man of
   God a second time to be told that it would be so, but only to be
   informed how to bring up the child! That was all. "Well might he be the
   father of strong Samson, that had such a strong faith," says old Bishop
   Hall. He had a strong faith, indeed, and yet here he is saying in
   alarm, "We shall surely die, because we have seen God."

   Do not judge a man by any solitary word or act, for if you do, you will
   surely mistake him. Cowards are occasionally brave, and the bravest men
   are sometimes cowards. And there are men who would be worse cowards,
   practically, if they were a little less cowardly than they are. A man
   may be too much a coward to confess that he is timid. Trembling Manoah
   was so outspoken, honest and sincere that he expressed his feelings
   which a more political person might have concealed. Though fully
   believing what had been spoken from God, yet, at the same time, this
   doubt was on him as the result of his belief in tradition--"We shall
   surely die, because we have seen God."

   Once again, another remark is that it is a great mercy to have a
   Christian companion to go to for counsel and comfort whenever your soul
   is depressed. Manoah had married a wonderful wife. She was the better
   one of the two in sound judgment. She was the weaker vessel by nature,
   but she was the stronger Believer and probably that was why the Angel
   was sent to her, for angels are best pleased to speak with those who
   have faith--and if they have the pick of their company--and the wife
   has more faith than the husband, they will visit the wife sooner than
   her spouse, for they love to take God's messages to those who will
   receive them with confidence. She was evidently full of faith and so,
   when her husband tremblingly said, "We shall surely die," she did not
   believe in such a mistrustful inference.

   Moreover, though they say that women cannot reason, yet here was a
   woman whose arguments were logical and overwhelming! Certain it is that
   women's perceptions are generally far clearer than men's reasonings.
   They look, at once, into a Truth of God while we are hunting for our
   glasses! Their instincts are generally as safe as our reasonings and,
   therefore, when they have, in addition, a clear logical mind, they make
   the wisest of counselors. Well, Manoah's wife not only had clear
   perceptions, but she had first-rate reasoning faculties. She argued,
   according to the language of the text, that it was not possible that
   God should kill them after what they had seen and heard!

   Oh that every man had such a prudent, gracious wife as Manoah had! Oh
   that whenever a man is cast down, a Christian Brother or Sister stands
   ready to cheer him with some reminder of the Lord's past goodness, or
   with some gracious promise from the Divine Word! It may happen to be
   the husband who cheers the wife and in such a case it is equally
   beautiful. We have known a Christian Sister to be very nervous and very
   often depressed and troubled--what a mercy to her to have a Christian
   husband whose strength of faith can encourage her to smile away her
   griefs by resting in the everlasting faithfulness and goodness of the
   Lord!

   If God the Holy Spirit shall help us, we will take up the argument of
   Manoah's wife and see whether it will, also, comfort our hearts. She
   had three strings to her bow, good woman. One was--The Lord does not
   mean to kill us, because He has accepted our sacrifices. The second and
   third were--He does not mean to kill us, or else He would not, as at
   this time, have told us such gracious things as these. So the three
   strings to her bow were accepted sacrifices, gracious

   revelations, and precious promises. Let us dwell upon each of them.
   And, first, accepted sacrifices. I will suppose that I am addressing a
   Brother who is sadly tried, terribly cast down and, who, therefore, has
   begun to lament--

   "The Lord has quite forsaken me. My God will be gracious no more."

   Brother, is that possible? Has not God of old accepted, on your behalf,
   the offering of His Son, Jesus Christ? You have believed in Jesus, dear
   Friend. You do not believe in Him now? Lay your hand on your heart and
   put the question solemnly to yourself, "Do you believe on the Son of
   God?" You are able to say, "Yes, Lord, notwithstanding all my
   unhappiness, I do believe in You and rest the stress and weight of my
   soul's interests on Your power to save." Well, then, you have God's own
   Word, recorded in His own infallible Bible, assuring you that Jesus
   Christ was accepted of God on your behalf, for He laid down His life
   for as many as believe in Him, that they might never perish!

   He stood as their Surety and suffered as their Substitute! Is it
   possible that this should be a lie and that, after all, they may be
   cast away? The argument of Manoah's wife was just this--"Did we not put
   the slain goat on the rock and as we put it there was it not consumed?
   It was consumed instead of us! We shall not die, for the victim has
   been consumed! The fire will not burn us--it has spent itself upon the
   sacrifice! Did you not see it go up in smoke and see the Angel ascend
   with it? The fire is gone--it cannot fall on us to destroy us." This
   being interpreted into the Gospel is just this--Have we not seen the
   Lord Jesus Christ fastened to the Cross? Have we not beheld Him in
   extreme agonies?

   Has not the fire of God consumed Him? Have we not seen Him rising, as
   it were, from that sacred fire in the Resurrection and the Ascension to
   go into Glory? Because the fire of Jehovah's wrath had spent itself on
   Him, we shall not die. He has died instead of us! It cannot be that the
   Lord has made Him suffer, the Just for the unjust, and now will make
   the Believer suffer, too! It cannot be that Christ loved His Church and
   gave Himself for it and that, now, the Church must perish, also! It
   cannot be that the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all and now
   will lay our iniquity on us, too! It were not consistent with justice!
   It would make the vicarious sacrifice of Christ to be nullified, a
   superfluity of cruelty which achieved nothing!

   The Atonement cannot be made of no effect--the very supposition would
   be blasphemy! O, look, my Soul! Look to the redeemer's Cross and as you
   see how God accepts Christ, be filled with content! Hear how the, "It
   is finished!" of Jesus on earth is echoed from the Throne of God,
   Himself, as He raises up His Son from the dead and bestows glory upon
   Him! Hear this, I say, and as you hear, attend to the power of this
   argument--If the Lord had been pleased to kill us, He would not have
   accepted His Son for us! If He meant us to die, would He have put Him
   to death, too? How can it be? The sacrifice of Jesus must effectually
   prevent the destruction of those for whom He offered up Himself as a
   Sacrifice!

   Jesus, dying for sinners, and yet the sinners denied mercy?!
   Inconceivable and impossible! My Soul, whatever your inward feelings
   and the tumult of your thoughts, the accepted Sacrifice shows that God
   is not pleased to kill you! But, if you notice, in the case of Manoah,
   they had offered a burnt sacrifice and a meat offering, too. Well, now,
   in addition to the great, grand sacrifice of Christ, which is our
   trust, we, dear Brothers and Sisters, have offered other sacrifices to
   God. And in consequence of His acceptance of such sacrifice we cannot
   imagine that He intends to destroy us. First, let me conduct your
   thoughts back to the offering of prayer which you have presented. I
   will speak for myself.

   I recall now, running over my diary mentally, full many an instance in
   which I have sought the Lord in prayer and He has most graciously heard
   me. I am as sure that my requests have been heard as ever Manoah could
   have been sure that his sacrifice was consumed upon the rock! May I not
   infer from this that the Lord does not mean to destroy me? You know
   that it had been so with you, dear Brother. You are down in the dumps,
   today. You are beginning to raise many questions about Divine love. But
   there have been times--you know there have--when you have sought the
   Lord and He has heard you.

   You can say, "This poor man cried and the Lord heard him and delivered
   him from all his fears." Perhaps you have not jotted down the fact in a
   book, but your memory holds the indelible record. Your soul has made
   her personal boast in the Lord concerning His fidelity to His promise
   in helping His people in the hour of need--for you have happily proved
   it in your own case. Now, Brother, if the Lord had been pleased to kill
   you, would He have heard your prayers? If He had meant to cast you out,
   after all, would He have heard you so many times? If He had sought a
   quarrel against you He might have had cause for that quarrel many years
   ago and have said to you, "When you make many prayers I will not

   hear." But since He has listened to your cries and tears--and many a
   time answered your petitions--He cannot intend to kill you.

   Again, you brought to Him, years ago, not only your prayers but
   yourself. You gave yourself over to Christ--body, soul, spirit, all
   your goods, all your hours, all your talents, every faculty, and every
   possible acquirement--and you said, "Lord, I am not my own, but I am
   bought with a price." Now, at that time did not the Lord accept you?
   You have at this very moment a lively recollection of the sweet sense
   of acceptance you had at that time. Though you are at this time sorely
   troubled, yet you would not wish to withdraw from the consecration
   which you then made, but on the contrary you declare--

   "Hgh Heaven, that heard the solemn vow,

   That vow renewed shall daily hear,

   Till, in life's latest hour, I bow,

   And bless in death a bond so dear." Now, would the Lord have accepted
   the offering of yourself to Him if He meant to destroy you? Would He
   have let you say, "I am Your servant and the son of Your handmaid: You
   have loosed my bond?" Would He have permitted you to declare, as you
   can boldly assert tonight, "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord
   Jesus," delighting to remember the time of your Baptism into Him,
   whereby your body washed with His pure body, was declared to be the
   Lord's forever-- would He enable you to feel a joy in the very mark of
   your consecration, as well as in the consecration itself--if He meant
   to slay you? Oh, surely not! He does not let a man give himself up to
   Him and then cast him away! That cannot be!

   Some of us, dear Friends, can remember how, growing out of this last
   sacrifice, there have been others. The Lord has accepted our offerings
   at other times, too, for our works, faith and labors of love have been
   acknowledged by His Spirit. There are some of you, I am pleased to
   remember, whom God has blessed to the conversion of little children
   whom you brought to the Savior. And there are others on earth whom you
   can look upon with great joy because God was pleased to make you the
   instrument of their conviction and their conversion. Some of you, I
   perceive, are ministers of the Gospel. Others of you preach on the
   corners of the streets and there have been times in your lives--I am
   sure that you wish they were 10 times as many--in which God has been
   pleased to succeed your efforts so that hearts have yielded to the sway
   of Jesus.

   Now, you do not put any trust in those things, nor do you claim any
   merit for having served your Master, but still, I think they may be
   thrown in as a matter of consolation and you may ask, "If the Lord had
   meant to destroy me, would He have enabled he to preach His Gospel?
   Would He have helped me to weep over men's souls? Would He have enabled
   me to gather those dear children like lambs to His bosom? Would He have
   granted me my longing desire to bear fruit in His vineyard if He did
   not mean to bless me?"

   Now, the second argument was that they had received gracious
   revelations. "If the Lord were pleased to kill us, He would not have
   showed us all these things." Now, what has the Lord shown you, my dear
   Brothers and Sisters? I will mention one or two things. First, the Lord
   has shown you, perhaps, years ago, or possibly at this moment He is
   showing you for the first time--your sin. What a sight that was when we
   first had it! Some of you never saw your sins, but your sins are there
   all the same. In an old house, perhaps, there is a cellar into which
   nobody goes and no light ever comes in. You live in the house
   comfortably enough, not knowing what is there. But one day you take a
   candle and go down the steps. You open that moldy door and when it is
   opened, dear Me!

   What a damp, pestilential smell! How foul the floor is! All sorts of
   living creatures hop away from under your feet! There are growths on
   the very walls--a heap of roots in the corner, sending out those long
   yellow growths which look like the fingers of death. And there is a
   spider--and there are a hundred more--of such a size as cannot be grown
   except in such horrible places! You get out as quickly as ever you can!
   You do not like the looks of it. Now, the candle did not make that
   cellar bad--the candle did not make it filthy! No, the candle only
   showed what there was. And then you get the carpenter to take down that
   shutter which you could not open anyway, for it had not been opened for
   years.

   And when the daylight comes in, it seems more horrible than it did by
   candlelight! And you wonder, indeed, however you did go across it with
   all those dreadful things all around you and you cannot be satisfied to
   live upstairs now till that cellar downstairs has been perfectly
   cleansed! That is just like our heart--it is full of sin--but we do not
   know it. It is a den of unclean birds, a menagerie of everything that
   is fearful, fierce and furious--a little Hell stocked with devils! Such
   is our nature. Such is our heart.

   Now, the Lord showed me mine years ago, as He did some of you, and the
   result of the sight of one's heart is horrible. Well does Dr. Young
   say, "God spares all eyes but His own, that fearful sight, a naked
   human heart." Nobody ever did see all his heart as it really is. You
   have only seen a part, but when seen, it is so horrible that it is
   enough to drive a man out of his senses to see the evil of his nature!
   Now, let us gather some honey out of this dead lion. Brothers and
   Sisters, if the Lord had meant to destroy us, He would not have shown
   us our sin because we were happy enough, previously, were we not? In
   our own poor way we were content and if He did not mean to pardon us,
   it was not like the Lord to show us our sin and to torment us before
   our time, unless He meant to take it away!

   We were swine, but we were satisfied enough with the husks we ate--so
   why not let us remain swine? What was the good of letting us see our
   filthiness if He did not intend to take it away? It never can be
   possible that God sets Himself studiously to torture the human mind by
   making it conscious of its evil, if He never intends to supply a
   remedy. Oh no! A deep sense of sin will not save you, but it is a
   pledge that there is something begun in your soul which may lead to
   salvation! That deep sense of sin does as good as say, "The Lord is
   laying bare the disease that He may cure it. He is letting you see the
   foulness of that underground cellar of your corruption because He means
   to cleanse it for you."

   But He has shown us more than this, for He has made us see the
   hollowness and emptiness of the world. There are some here present,
   who, at one time, were very gratified with the pleasures and amusements
   of the world. The theater was a great delight to them. The ballroom
   afforded them supreme satisfaction. To be able to dress just after
   their own fancy and to spend money on their own whims were the very
   acme of delight! But there came a time when across all these the soul
   perceived a mysterious handwriting which, being interpreted, ran
   thus--"Vanity of vanities; all is vanity."

   These very people went to the same amusements, but they seemed so dull
   and stupid that they came away saying, "We do not care a bit for them.
   The joys are all gone. What seemed gold turns out to be gilt. And what
   we thought marble was only white paint. The varnish is cracked, the
   tinsel is faded, the coloring has vanished. Mirth laughs like an idiot
   and pleasure grins like madness." We have heard the words, "Vanity of
   vanities; all is vanity," sounding in our hearts, and now do you think
   that if the Lord had meant to kill us, He would have taught us this?
   Why, no! He would have said, "Leave them alone, they are given unto
   idols. They are only going to have one world in which they can
   rejoice--let them enjoy it."

   He would have let the swine go on with their husks if He had not meant
   to turn them into His children and bring them to His bosom. But He has
   taught us something better than this--namely, the preciousness of
   Christ! Unless we are awfully deceived--self-deceived, I mean--we have
   known what it is to lose the burden of our sin at the foot of the
   Cross. We have known what it is to see the suitability and
   all-sufficiency of the merit of our dear Redeemer and we have rejoiced
   in Him with unspeakable joy full of glory! If He had meant to destroy
   us, He would not have shown us Christ!

   Sometimes, also, we have strong desires after God! What pining after
   communion with Him have we felt! What longings to be delivered from
   sin! What yearnings to be perfect! What aspirations to be with Him in
   Heaven and what desires to be like He while we are here! Now these
   longings, cravings, desires, yearnings--do you think the Lord would
   have put them into our hearts if He had meant to destroy us? What would
   be the good of it? Would it not be tormenting us as Tantalus was
   tormented? Would it not, indeed, be a superfluity of cruelty to make us
   wish for what we could never have and pine after what we should never
   gain? O Beloved, let us be comforted about these things! If He had
   meant to kill us, He would not have shown us such things as these!

   I shall have no time to dwell upon the last source of comfort, which is
   what the Lord has spoken to us--many precious promises. "Nor would He
   have told us such things as these." At almost anytime when a child of
   God is depressed, if he goes to the Word of God and to prayer, and
   looks up, he will generally get hold of some promise or other. I know I
   generally do. I could not tell you, dear Brothers and Sisters, tonight,
   what promise would suit your case, but the Lord always knows how to
   apply the right Word at the right time. And when a promise is applied
   with great power to the soul and you are enabled to plead it at the
   Mercy Seat, you may say, "If the Lord had meant to kill us, He would
   not have made us such a promise as this."

   I have a promise that hangs up before my eyes whenever I wake every
   morning and it has continued in its place for years. It is a stay to my
   soul. It is this--"I will not fail you nor forsake you." Difficulties
   arise, funds run short, sickness comes--but somehow or other my text
   always seems to flow like a fountain--"I will not fail you nor forsake
   you." If the Lord had meant to kill us, He would not have said that to
   us. What is your promise, Brothers and Sisters? What have you

   got a hold of? If you have not laid hold of any and feel as if none
   belonged to you, yet there are such words as these, "This is a faithful
   saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the
   world to save sinners," and you are one!

   Ah, if He had meant to destroy you, He would not have spoken a text of
   such a wide character on purpose to include your case! A thousand
   promises go down to the lowest deep into which a heart can ever
   descend. And if the Lord had meant to destroy a soul in the deeps, He
   would not have sent a Gospel promise down even to that extreme. I
   should like to say these two or three words to you who are unconverted,
   but who are troubled in your souls. You think that God means to destroy
   you. Now, dear Friend, I take it that if the Lord had meant to kill
   you, He would not have sent the Gospel to you. If there had been a
   purpose and a decree to destroy you, He would not have brought you
   here!

   Now you are sitting to hear that Jesus has died to save such as you
   are! You are sitting where you are, earnestly bid to trust Him and be
   saved! If the Lord had meant to slay you, I do not think He would have
   sent me on such a fruitless errand as to tell you of a Christ who could
   not save you! Some of you have had your lives spared very remarkably.
   You have been in accidents on land or on sea--perhaps in battle and
   shipwreck. You have been raised from a sickbed. If the Lord had meant
   to destroy you, surely He would have let you die--but He has spared
   you, and you are getting on in years--surely it is time that you
   yielded to His mercy and gave yourself up into the hands of Grace. If
   the Lord had meant to destroy you, surely He would not have brought you
   here, for, possibly, I am addressing one who has come here, wondering
   why.

   All the time that he has been sitting here, he has been saying to
   himself, "I do not know how I got into this place, but here I am." God
   means to bless you, tonight, I trust, and He will, if you breathe this
   prayer to Heaven, "Father, forgive me! I have sinned against Heaven and
   before you, but for Christ's sake, forgive Me! I put my trust in Your
   Son." You shall find eternal life, rejoicing in the sacrifice which God
   has accepted! You shall, one of these days, rejoice in the revelations
   of His love and in the promises which He gives you, and say, as we say
   tonight, "If the Lord were pleased to kill us He would not have showed
   us all these things!"

Retreat Impossible

   (No. 1341)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot go back." Judges 11:35.

   IN Jephtha case there were good reasons for going back. He had made a
   rash vow and such things are much better broken than kept. If a man
   makes a vow to commit a crime, his vow to do so is, in itself, a sin.
   The carrying out of his vow will be doubly sinful. If a man's vowing to
   do a thing made it necessary and right for him to do it, then the whole
   moral law might be suspended by the mere act of vowing, for a man might
   vow to steal, to commit adultery, or to murder--and then say--"I was
   right in all those acts because I vowed to do them." This is
   self-evidently absurd and to admit such a principle would be to destroy
   all morality!

   You have, first of all, no right to promise to do what is wrong. And
   then, secondly, your promise, which is, in itself, wrong, cannot make a
   criminal act to be right. If you have come under a rash vow, you must
   not dare to keep it! You ought to go before God and repent that you
   have made a vow which involves sin--and as to keeping the sinful vow,
   that were to add sin to sin! "But," says one, "would it not be sin to
   break my vow?" I reply, there was great sin in making it and there will
   probably be some measure of sin connected with your breaking it, for
   few human actions are perfect. But to keep your evil vow would
   certainly be sin and you must not commit the greater sin to avoid the
   lesser which, perhaps, may be involved in the breach of your foolish
   promise.

   I think it would have been well if Jephtha, though he had opened his
   mouth before God, had gone back when it involved, as I think it did, so
   dreadful a necessity as that of sacrificing his own innocent, only
   child! His having sworn to do it did not make it right--it was just as
   wrong. If he really did slay her, it was a horrible action, dramatize
   or disguise it as you may! He had no right to make the dangerous
   promise. He had still less right to carry it out after he had made it,
   if it led to such terrible consequences.

   But now I am going to speak about other openings of the mouth to God in
   which there is no ill--openings of the mouth which need never be
   regretted, which certainly never can be recalled--and of which we may
   rightly say, before the living God, in the strength which He gives us,
   "I have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot go back." My sermon
   will not have much to do with some of you. You have not given your word
   to God, or made any sort of promise. No, you remain as you were, far
   off from Him and negligent of His claims. I do not envy you. Your being
   under no obligation from any resolution of your own does not prevent
   your being under as much natural obligation to God on account of your
   being His creatures and, therefore, subjects under His Law.

   I sometimes hear of people who say, "You know I do not profess
   anything," and after that assertion they appear to feel at liberty to
   say and do whatever they like. Now, if we heard of certain persons
   entrusted with our business that they had not acted honestly, what
   would we think of it if one man among them should rise up and say,
   "Don't blame me. You know I never professed to be honest"? What would
   that mean? It would mean that he is a confessed and acknowledged thief!
   Suppose a man were to say, "Well, I never profess to be truthful." What
   is he? He is an acknowledged liar! And he who says, "Ah, I never made
   any vows or promises, neither do I pretend to serve the Lord,"
   acknowledges himself to be a godless man. He is living in the daily
   robbery of God, defrauding Him of His rights! He is living in direct
   and avowed rebellion against the King of kings! He is living without a
   hope for the hereafter--without Grace in his soul for the present--and
   without glory in prospect for the future!

   Ah, Friend, although the things I may have to say at this time may not
   directly bear upon you, yet the very fact that they do not bear upon
   you should make you think, and weigh, and consider, and ponder your
   ways as to the place which you now occupy! You are, by your
   non-profession and non-avowal of Christ, making a confession of being
   on the opposite side, for he that is not with Him is against Him, and
   he that gathers not with Him scatters abroad.

   But now I speak to my own Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus. Dear
   Friends, there are three things which I would bring to your practical
   remembrance. First, what we have done--we have opened our mouth unto
   the Lord. Secondly, what we cannot do--"I cannot go back." And,
   thirdly, what we must do--there are some things that we must seek after
   if we are to be able to hold on and to act faithfully to our
   profession.

   I. First, then, WHAT WE HAVE DONE. "I have given my word to the Lord."
   We have opened our mouths before the Lord, first, by confessing our
   faith in Jesus Christ. I have said, and most of you upon whom 1 am
   looking have, also, solemnly said, before others, "I believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ with all my heart. Let others believe what they will
   and trust in what they please--

   'My hope is fixed on nothing less

   Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.''" We are troubled by no question
   of our Lord's power to save, or of our interest in His salvation, but
   we have testified outright, as a matter-of-fact which we feel in our
   own souls, that we believe that Jesus died for us and that He is all
   our salvation and all our desire. We have opened our mouth to that in
   the most decided manner and we are continually doing so in various
   ways.

   We have, also, avowed and declared before the living God that we are
   Christ's disciples and followers. If anyone should ask us, "Are you one
   of them? Do you consort with Jesus of Nazareth?" We would gladly
   answer, "Yes." However short we come of perfect obedience to His
   commands, yet His will is our rule. We call Him, "Master," and, "Lord,"
   and when we read about the disciples of Christ we think of ourselves as
   belonging to them. Blessed Master, how glad we are to acknowledge that
   we are, indeed, Your disciples! We are not ashamed to acknowledge that
   we have opened our mouth unto You, to believe all Your teachings and to
   obey all Your commands!

   We have opened our month to the Lord, next, because as we believe in
   Jesus Christ and take Him to be our Master. we have admitted the
   Redeemer's claims to our persons and services and have resolved to live
   for Him only all our days. We have made a dedication of ourselves to
   His service, declaring that we are not our own, but bought with a
   price. Some of us did this years ago and--

   "High Heaven that heard the solemn vow, That vow, renewed, has often
   heard," and shall hear it again! We profess that nothing that we have
   is ours, but our goods, our time, our talents and ourselves are all
   marked with the broad arrow of the King! We are the perpetual heritage
   of the Lord, to be His forever, and never to serve self again, or the
   world, or the flesh, or any except Jesus.

   We have, also, cast in our lot with His people. We belong to their
   fraternity, heart and soul. We are not ashamed of them, either. It is
   some years ago with some of us since we came forward and asked to have
   our names enrolled with the despised people of God. We opened our mouth
   to the Lord that we would take part and lot with His people--that if
   they were abused we would take a share of the abuse--that if they had
   sorrows we would help to bear their burdens and if they had joys we
   only hoped that we might be worthy to enjoy the crumbs of their table!
   We craved to be numbered with the citizens of that noble city, the New
   Jerusalem, and we requested to share the portion of Zion's blessed but
   tried inhabitants, whether they held a fast or a festival, suffered
   siege or enjoyed triumph.

   We asked to have it said of us that we were born there and when we were
   asked if we would forego the world and all its allurements to become
   heirs of the better country, we stood up before the Lord and declared
   that it was even so. In all these things we have, as Christian people,
   opened our mouths unto the Lord, have we not? Now, if you ask me when
   you did so, I shall have to mention several occasions. Some of us
   opened our mouths in this respect to the Lord in a very solemn way in
   private. We made our dedication to God a solemn deed performed in a
   distinct and formal manner. We took time about it, thought it over, and
   then did it deliberately and definitely.

   Some have even written out an act of solemn dedication and signed it.
   Others, perhaps, more wisely, have refrained from writing it, lest it
   should become a bondage to their spirits, but they have, nevertheless,
   made a formal act of transfer of themselves and all that they had, to
   the Lord. At any rate, whether we did it formally or not, we can say--

   "'Tis done! The great transaction's done, I am my Lord's, and He is
   mine!" There was a time when once and for all we gave up the keys of
   the city of Mansoul and surrendered to the Lord, that He might be ours
   and that we might be His forever and ever.

   Then absolutely many of you, beloved Friends, gave your word to the
   Lord in Baptism. Searching His Word, you saw there, clearly, that as
   many as believed were baptized. You read of the eunuch to whom the
   question was put, "Do you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ? For if you
   believe with all your heart you may"--and then on confession of his
   faith he was baptized! I have given my word to the Lord in that manner.
   I remember the solemn occasion when I went into the river! There were
   multitudes of people as witnesses on either bank to mark my burial with
   the Lord in the water! And, though I have not the remotest confidence
   in outward form or ceremony, yet often has my soul recalled that day
   when I did, before men and angels and devils, declare myself to be the
   servant of the living God! And I was, therefore, buried in water in
   token of my death to all the world--and then raised from it as the
   emblem of my newness of life!

   Oh, to be always faithful to what we did, when, coming forward of our
   own accord, we declared that we were dead with Christ that we might,
   also, live with Him! We have opened our mouth unto the Lord since then,
   full often when we have come to the Communion Table. The solemn sitting
   down at the Table of Communion, when others have to go away, or can
   only look on--the separation which is made in that act--is a
   declaration on your part, Beloved, that you belong to the Lord Jesus
   Christ, that He is your meat and your drink, that you feed at His table
   and are His servants! There is something very solemn about the
   communion service--it ought never to be lightly entered upon--and when
   you have been attending to that ordinance in remembrance of Him, you
   should feel, "I have given my word to the Lord in a very special manner
   by sitting at the table with His people."

   Besides that, how often have we given our word to God in hymn-singing?
   I am afraid that we do not always think enough about what we say when
   we sing. But what solemn things you have sung. Did you not sing the
   other day--

   "And if I might make some reserve, And duty did not call, I love my God
   with zeal so great That I would give Him all"?

   And did you not sing--

   "Had I ten thousand hearts, dear Lord, I'd give them all to Thee! Had I
   ten thousand tongues, they all Should join the harmony"?

   Ah, you have given your word very widely unto the Lord in song. And so,
   too, in prayer--both in the closet and in public. We say great things
   to God in supplication--do we always make good on what we say? Are we
   always of the mind of Jephtha, who said, "I have given my word to the
   Lord, and I cannot go back"? Do we remember those vows which our soul,
   in anguish, made when we drew near to God in the bitterness of our
   spirit and poured out our troubles before Him?

   But ah, Beloved, very specially I may speak of some here present who
   are my partners in the work and ministry of the Church for her Lord. We
   who bear public testimony, "we have given our word to the Lord, and
   cannot go back." You who teach classes in the school. You who try to
   tell the Gospel to other men in the workshop. You who talk of Jesus
   Christ even to your children--remember that you have committed
   yourselves! While you are trying to speak to others you make promises
   for yourselves which bind you to present the Truth of God and future
   fidelity. As for me, where could I flee from my Master's Presence?
   Where could I go from His service?

   Should I desert His ministry, unto what part of the earth could I go to
   hide myself? Somebody would remember this face which has been seen by
   so many thousands--the very tones of my voice would betray me--and men
   would point me out as an apostate from my Lord! Jonah might flee to
   Tarshish, but if I went to Tarshish someone or other would know me and
   pronounce my name as soon as I set foot upon the soil! I must fight
   this battle to the finish, now--retreat is out of the question! "I have
   given my word to the Lord" so often and before so many, that I am bound
   by a myriad ties! Nor would I wish to be bound with one less--but daily
   with more and more!

   But, Beloved Friends, remember that in proportion as your religion
   gains publicity and in proportion as, by teaching others, you tacitly
   or avowedly declare your faith in the Gospel, in that proportion you
   have given your word to the Lord--and it is not possible that you
   should go back without deep disgrace and dire destruction! Now, it is
   worth our remembering after what fashion we have done this. I have
   shown you that we have given our word to the Lord and I

   have shown you the occasions when we have done so. But in the very
   manner of the deed there has been practical force. We have done this
   voluntarily. We have given our word to the Lord without any compulsion!

   The little child, you know, who, according to the Prayer Book [Church
   of England] is made a member of Christ and a child of God and so on,
   has nothing to do with the business--and is in no way responsible for
   what others choose to promise without its leave. But you and I did
   willingly what we did. We came forward and said, "Let me be baptized,
   for I am a Believer in Jesus. Let me be united with the Church, for I
   am one of the Lord's redeemed." We said to the Lord Jesus Christ, "I am
   cheerfully and willingly Your servant." We took upon ourselves the
   bonds of a Christian profession because we desired to do so! Well,
   then, if we have done this voluntarily, that is the strongest reason
   why we should not go back from our own chosen position as the Lord's
   own disciples.

   And we did this very solemnly. Oh, to some of you, it was, indeed, a
   devout action when you avowed yourselves on the Lord's side. Many were
   the prayers and praises which preceded and followed it. Shall such
   solemnity be made into a falsehood? Shall the weeping and the
   supplication be proven to have been base hypocrisy? I hope, also, that
   we did it very deliberately, counting the cost, looking round about and
   seeing what it meant--and understanding what we were doing. We did not
   reckon upon a smooth path. We did not consider that we should gain
   crowns without crosses, or win victories without fights--and we have
   found it much as we expected.

   We passed through the wicket gate and entered on the road to the
   Celestial City knowing that there were dragons to encounter, giants to
   fight, hills to climb, rivers to swim and swamps to ford. We set out
   with considerable knowledge of what we were doing and what it
   involved--and we were not, thereby, prevented from decidedly and
   deliberately declaring ourselves to be on the Lord's side. Are we now
   going to confess ourselves to have been fools and dupes? Will we now
   tell our Lord that His service is hard and worthless?

   Most of us made our profession publicly. We had many onlookers. We
   cannot forget that when we began the race, a cloud of witnesses
   surrounded us and have ever since kept us in full survey. If there is a
   little speck in our character, they are sure to point it out! Never a
   cat watched a mouse as the lynx-eyed world watches the Christian! How
   it magnifies and multiplies the faults of Believers and cries, "Aha!
   Aha! We figured they were hypocrites," the moment it finds the
   slightest trip or mistake. Well, we have given our word to the Lord
   before multitudes and shall we recant and deny the

   faith?

   Men and angels and devils know that we belong to the Lord Jesus Christ!
   We have declared it before all with whom we have come into contact--not
   always in so many words, but I hope in our actions--by the decided
   stand that we have taken up for God, for Christ, for Truth, for
   holiness and for the fear of God in the land. But the weight of it all
   lies in this--"We have given our word to the Lord." It is not what we
   promised the Church, though in becoming members of it we have promised
   to fulfill the mutual duties of Christians. It was not what we promised
   to the minister, though, in the very fact of becoming members of a
   Church of which he is the pastor, we have a Christian duty towards him.

   It was not what we promised one another, though we all owe something to
   each other. But we have given our word to the Lord! If a man must
   trifle, let him trifle with men, but not with God! If promises to men
   may be lightly broken-- and they should not be--yet let us not trifle
   with promises made to God! And if solemn declarations can ever be
   forgotten--which they should not be--yet not solemn declarations made
   to God. Beware, oh, beware of anything like frivolity in entering into
   covenant with the Most High! If a man should measure his footsteps and
   weigh his words when he appears before an earthly monarch, how much
   more when he stands before the King of kings, who is, also, Judge of
   the quick and the dead?

   There let your words be few and guarded, but when you have once spoken
   them, and lifted your hand to Heaven, let your promise stand and keep
   it faithfully, saying, "I have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot
   go back."

   II. But enough upon what we have done, for we need our full strength of
   thought to dwell upon WHAT WE CANNOT DO. "I have given my word to the
   Lord, and I cannot go back." That is to say, having once become
   Christians, we cannot apostatize from the faith. We feel that we cannot
   and God's servants in all ages have proven that they cannot. Men have
   threatened them, "You shall go to prison if you do not go back," but
   they have said, "We cannot." And they have gone to prison and they have
   said, like John Bunyan, "I will lie here till the moss grows on my
   eyelids, but I cannot--cannot do other than God bids me."

   The enemy has said, "If you do not leave Christ you shall be stretched
   on the rack," and that means the pulling of every bone from its
   socket--but in defiance of torture they have replied, "We cannot go
   hack--we would rather bear the rack." Poor women, like Anne Askew, have
   been racked most cruelly, but they could not go back. Then the enemies
   of the Lord have sworn, "We will burn you to the death." The saints
   have accepted that challenge, also, and they have burned and triumphed
   in the burning, clapping their blazing hands--for they could not go
   back. The young people in the old city of London, over the water there,
   went down to Smithfield in the early morning to see their pastor
   burned. And when they came home and their mother said, "Why did you
   go?" the boys replied, "We went to learn the way."

   They needed to know how to burn when their turn should come! Brave sons
   of brave sires! God's servants always have known how to burn, but they
   have not known how to turn! They have lifted their hands to the Lord
   and if it involved losses, crosses, torture, torment and death, they
   could not go back! No, Sir, if you can go back, you never knew Christ!
   If you can go back, He never marked the cross mark on your heart, He
   never baptized you into His death for, if He had done so, a sacred
   impulse would be upon you and you would go forward! As though you were
   a thunderbolt launched from the Omnipotent hand of God, you must go on
   and burst through every opposition till you reach the end towards which
   God's eternal might is speeding you! You cannot go back.

   Moreover, if we are right at heart we feel that we have lifted our hand
   to the Lord and we cannot go back, even by temporary turning aside. I
   do not mean that we do not do so, sadly, too often--the Lord have mercy
   upon us for it. But it ought to be our solemn declaration that we
   cannot go back. Somebody says to you when you enter the workshop, "Ah,
   you are one of those Christians fools." The devil tempts you to say
   that you are not, or, at any rate, to be very quiet about it. Do not
   fall into cowardly silence, but say at once, "I have given my word to
   the Lord, and I cannot go back. I am in forever. Whatever it costs, I
   am enlisted and will never desert."

   Sometimes the temptation is, "Come with me, young man, come with me,
   young woman"--to such-and-such a questionable place of amusement.
   "Shall I go? Perhaps I shall not get much hurt." Stand still and say,
   "No, I have given my word to the Lord and I cannot go back, even if I
   have the desire to do so. I have committed myself to the pursuit of
   holiness and I cannot go back to the foolish pleasures of sin." I like
   you young people to make a very straightforward profession of your
   faith because it may be the means of keeping you in the hour of
   temptation. You will say to yourself, "The vows of the Lord are upon
   me. How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?"

   I heard one say once, "I could not join the Church because I should
   feel it such a tie." "Yes, but," I replied, "Brother, it is the sort of
   tie you need to feel." A profession of our faith in Jesus ought to be a
   very strong cord of love to hold us to that which is good. We ought to
   feel that the sacrifice is bound to the horns of the altar, but this
   bondage is true liberty to us and pleasant to us--and it should be our
   desire to be bound tighter and tighter as long as we live. "I cannot go
   back" is an inability of the most desirable kind!

   The enemies of your soul will attempt to persuade you to forsake the
   Lord. They will try ridicule and threats and bribes, but be as a deaf
   man and hear them not! If you have really given your word to God with
   all your heart, you cannot go back--the Divine life within you will
   laugh to scorn all efforts of the foe. Baffled and discouraged, they
   will soon give up their wicked endeavors! They will see that it is of
   no use to tempt such an one as you are--your steadfastness and patient
   endurance will drive them from the field. But there are some of you
   that make a profession who attempt compromises and go a little way with
   the world. If you go a furlong with the world you will soon go a mile!
   I will give you a sentence to remember--"That man who is only half
   Christ's is altogether the devil's."

   Remember that! He who is only half a Christian is altogether an
   unbeliever! As half clean is unclean, so half converted is unconverted
   and half a saint is wholly a sinner! You cannot say to the world, "Up
   to here you shall go, but no further." It is greedy and seeks to win
   the whole man. To its imperious demands give a stern denial, saying, "I
   have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot go back." Now, what are
   our reasons why we cannot go back? The first reason is that if we did
   go back we should show that we have been altogether false. You profess
   to be believers in Jesus Christ. You say that you have been born again,
   that you have received that inward principle which lives and abides
   forever! If you go back to the world and to sin, you say to all
   mankind, "I made a hypocritical profession. I was a mere formalist. The
   root of the matter was not in me."

   You cannot say that, for you know you love the Lord. Even when you are
   in a doubting mood, you know you love Jesus! Though you question
   yourselves over and over again, you know that you love your Master. If
   you hear anybody

   finding fault with Him, are you not sorely grieved? Oh, yes, it brings
   the blood into your cheeks and you say, "I cannot bear to hear Him
   spoken against." You thought that you did not love Him, but the enemy
   provokes you to feel that you do love Him. You do love Him! You cannot
   say that you do not! Can you? And yet if you went back it would be
   tantamount to a declaration that all your former life had been a lie!

   You cannot go back, dear Friend, because that were to act most basely.
   Have you been bought with the precious blood of Christ and will you
   leave Him? Did He die upon the Cross for you and will a little
   buffeting cause you to desert Him? What? Did He fetch you up out of the
   horrible pit and out of the miry clay by His own death and will you
   forsake Him and choose sinful ease and the praises of a wicked world?
   Oh, it were baseness, abominable baseness, for a soul who once has
   tasted of His wondrous love and seen Him in His Glory and death throes
   to desert Christ! No, no, NO! We cannot be so base as this, God helping
   us!

   To go back from that for which we have given our word to the Lord were
   to incur frightful penalties, for there is no judgment so great as that
   which is pronounced upon the apostate. If they have tasted of the
   heavenly gift and the powers of the world to come--"if these shall fall
   away, it is impossible to renew them, again, unto repentance." "Salt is
   good, but if the salt has lost its savor where shall it be seasoned? It
   is from now on good for nothing but to be trod under foot of men," You
   know how many passages there are in which it is positively asserted
   that if a child of God did deliberately and totally apostatize, his
   restoration would be utterly impossible--not difficult--impossible!
   This is one of the greatest proofs of the doctrine of the Final
   Perseverance of the Saints, since there is no man in a condition in
   which it is impossible to save him and yet any man would be in such a
   state if he apostatized!

   Therefore true Believers shall not apostatize, but shall stand fast and
   shall be kept even to the end. Yet, could they totally apostatize, they
   could never be restored again! The greatest remedy having already
   failed, there would remain no other. On the supposition that the power
   of the Holy Spirit and the cleansing influence of the blood of Jesus
   could not preserve the man from falling back into his unregenerate
   state, what else could be done for such an one? If regeneration
   fails--what then? If the incorruptible Seed which lives and abides
   forever can die--what then? Oh, we cannot go back! To go back is death,
   shame, eternal ruin!

   And to go back would be so unreasonable. Why should I leave my Lord?
   Why should I let my Savior go? In my heart of hearts I cannot think of
   a reason why I should forsake my Master. Do I seek pleasure? What
   pleasure is equal to that which He can give me? Do I seek gain? What
   gain could there be if I lost Him? Do I seek ease? Ah, to leave Him
   were to forfeit eternal rest! To whom should we go? That was a forcible
   question of the disciples when the Master enquired, "Will you, also, go
   away?" They replied, "To whom can we go?" Ah, to whom can we go? If you
   give up the religion of Jesus Christ, what other religion would you
   have? If you were to give up the pleasures of godliness, what other
   pleasures would you have?

   "Oh," says one, "we could go into the world." Could you? Could you? If
   you are a child of God you are spoiled for the world. Before you became
   a Christian you could have done very well in the world, but now you
   know too much to be happy there. While the sow is a sow, the mud is
   good enough for her. Turn that sow into an angel--and if the angel has
   no place in Heaven--where shall it go? It cannot go back to the sty!
   What could it do there? The wash of the trough was good enough for the
   sow, but the angel has eaten heavenly food. It cannot roll in the mire,
   nor consort with swine--it must have Heaven or nothing! If you can go
   back to the world you will go back to the world--but if you are a child
   of God you cannot go back because Grace has so changed your nature that
   you would not be in an element in which you could exist!

   There is no reason for apostasy--all the reasons lie the other way. "I
   have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot go back" for this
   reason--I have no inclination that way. Brothers and Sisters, some of
   us have been Christians these 25 years and we are glad of it. You know
   that in the army they have short-time soldiers and long-time soldiers.
   When I enlisted in Christ's army, I did not go in to enlist for a
   quarter of a year and then have a new ticket. I enlisted for life! But
   suppose my Master were to say to me, "Now, you have had some 25 years
   of it--you may now go home and cease from being one of My soldiers."
   "Ah, my Master, where should I go? Do not discharge me!"

   If He were still to say, "You are out of your time and may go home," I
   would tell Him that I would not leave Him in life or death. If I were
   put out at the front door I would come in at the back. Ah, my Lord,
   what anguish has that question stirred, whether I would, also, go as
   others have done. Go? You have fastened me to Your Cross and driven in

   the nails! I cannot go. Go? I am dead and buried with You! Your rich
   Grace has made me part and parcel of Yourself by indissoluble union!
   "Who shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
   our Lord?" No, if I were discharged today, I would enlist again today!

   The man who is married to a good wife thinks to himself, "If I had to
   marry, again, tomorrow morning, she would be the bride and happy would
   we be." And so, if we had our choice to make again, we would choose our
   dear Lord over again, only with much more eagerness and earnestness
   than we did at first! Dear Friends, we have given our word to the Lord,
   and we cannot go back because we are so happy as we now are! A man does
   not turn his back upon that which has become his life and his joy! He
   is bound to it by the bliss which he derives from it. Can the Swiss
   forget his country when he listens to the home music which he heard as
   a child amidst his native hills? Does not the home-sickness come over
   him so that he longs to be among the Alps, again?

   Does not the Englishman, wherever he wanders, whether by land or sea,
   feel his heart instinctively turn to the white cliffs of Albion? And
   does he not say that, with all her faults, he still loves his country?
   Who would cease to be that which he loves to be? And so our joy in
   Christ is great and we cannot wish to be divided from Him. Why should
   we? Shall the star desert the sphere in which it shines, or the fish
   the sea in which it lives? Shall the eagle abhor the craggy rock on
   which he builds his nest, or the angel shun the Heaven in which he
   dwells? No, Beloved, we cannot go back! Our joy holds us fast to our
   Lord.

   And then, besides that, we cannot go back from what we have said, for
   Divine Grace impels us onward. There is a secret power more mighty than
   all other forces called the force of Irresistible Grace and this has
   captured us. When the temptation comes to go back to Egypt and we
   remember the garlic--that strong-smelling garlic and the cucumbers--
   those spongy, watery cucumbers! And when we remember the onions--those
   pungent onions--the thought of going back to the fleshpots comes upon
   us like a man of war! But mighty Grace soon puts it down--it drowns the
   desire in tears of repentance and makes us loathe ourselves to think
   that we should be such fools as to think more of fleshpots than of
   manna, and more of cucumbers than of Canaan!

   Again, we resolutely press forward towards Canaan, blushing to think
   that we should have, in heart, turned back into Egypt. Grace will not
   let us return to our old bondage! And there is Another that holds us.
   It is He with the hands nailed to the tree! Whenever He is revealed in
   us we feel that we cannot go back. A sight of Him with His face to the
   world's opposition, His face to the devil, His face to death, His face
   to Hell, His face towards the wrath of God--and going through it all
   with boundless courage--makes us feel that we must go forward, too,
   even till we enter into His rest!

   Brothers and Sisters, we are moved to testify all these arguments, each
   one for himself, "I have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot go
   back."

   III. Now, the last thing of all is that if this is the case, there is
   something WHICH WE MUST DO. What we must do is this--if there is a
   present sacrifice demanded of us, we must make it directly, "I have
   given my word to the Lord, I cannot go back." Now, if there is anything
   in your business which you cannot do and be a Christian, renounce it at
   once and forever! Do not think about it and do not ask a friend what
   you should do, but follow your conscience. If you know the thing is
   right, do it. Do not ask your mother, or brother, or the wisest man
   that ever lived--consult not with flesh and blood--but follow Jesus at
   all costs. Do not take time for second thoughts, but do it, and have
   done with it.

   Oh, I have known Christians falter as to what they ought to do--their
   duty has been plain enough, but they have not liked it--and so they
   have wished for somebody to tell them that they might be Christians and
   yet do wrong! They need to get some sort of excuse from the judgment of
   others. They have gone fishing about to this and that minister,
   misrepresenting the circumstances to some extent, to gain the judgment
   they desired--till at last they have forged a sort of dispensation for
   sin from some good man's opinion--and then they have cheated their
   conscience by saying, "I feel much relieved. I can do it, now, for I
   have consulted a gracious man and he thinks I may."

   No consultation can be required where duty is plain. "Oh, Sir, but the
   sacrifice is great." If it were a thousand times greater, that does not
   enter into the question! Duty is imperative, so let it be done. If your
   doing right will make yourself and your children poor, so must it be.
   It were better that you were poor and yet maintained your integrity and
   continued in the service of God than that you should roll in riches by
   violating your conscience! Say, "I cannot go back." Make the sacrifice
   and go on. If you are to do this, however, you must ask for more Grace
   and, dear Brothers and Sisters, wherever

   there is an ugly piece in the road, since you cannot go back, all you
   have to do is to ask the Lord to assist you over it-- for you must go
   through it and this can only be done in His strength.

   Remember that your abiding faithful to the end does not depend upon
   yourself. You have to do it, but the Holy Spirit is to find you
   strength to do it. The American slave said, "Massa, if the Lord say to
   me, 'Jump through the brick wall,' I will jump. It is the Lord that
   will make me go through--but I must jump." So it is with persevering in
   the face of difficulty and trouble. If you are bid to a hard duty and
   it involves sacrifice and hardship, do not hesitate, but advance
   unflinchingly! It is the Lord who bids you do it and if the Lord bids
   you go through the brick wall, He will make a hole in it for you, or
   make it soft for you, or in some way or other make you equal to the
   occasion! Yours it is to go through--do not stand back because of your
   own weakness, but let faith lay hold on the Divine strength.

   One other admonition to Christian people is this--burn the boats behind
   you. When the Roman commander meant victory he landed his troops on the
   coast where he knew there were thousands of enemies troops and he
   burned his boats, so as to cut off all chance of retreat. "But how are
   we to get away if we are beaten?" "That is just it," he said, "we will
   not be beaten! We will not dream of such a thing." "Burn the
   boats"--that is what you Christian people must do! "Make no provision
   for the flesh." Let the separation between you and the world be final
   and irreversible. Say, "Here I go for Christ and His Cross, for the
   truth of the Bible, for the Laws of God, for holiness, for trust in
   Jesus! And by the Grace of God I will never go back, come what may."

   This is the right spirit. The Lord send it among us more and more! It
   is the spirit of martyrs. You need it, you converted working men--you
   need the spirit of martyrs. I know how your workmates jest and jeer,
   and torment you. Well, do not think yourself harshly treated, but play
   the man and bear it all and say to yourself, "I did not quite reckon on
   this, but it does not matter. I have given my word to the Lord, and I
   cannot go back if it costs me everything." I will not talk to you
   longer, for what, after all, Brothers and Sisters, can religion cost us
   compared with what our salvation cost our Lord?

   What is it to go forward if we compare it with the Glory that is
   beyond? A pin's prick, that is all--and then you will be in Heaven! Oh,
   to stand among the glorified!--to hear the Master say, "Well done!" One
   might die a thousand deaths to get those two syllables, if there were
   nothing else--"Well done!" To enjoy His smile, to share His crown, to
   stand among His palm-bearing hosts and participate in His Glory--this
   is worth all the difficulty and sacrifice involved in going
   forward--and ten thousand times more!

   Therefore accept this closing word. Forward, my Brothers and
   Sisters--forward! Whatever lies before you--the Red Sea or the rage of
   earth and Hell combined--if God calls you, forward! He will bear you
   through to the glorious end. The Lord be with you, for Christ's sake!
   Amen!

Dagon's Ups and Downs

   (No. 1342)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When the Philistines took the Ark of God, they brought it into the
   house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. And when they of Ashdod arose
   early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the
   earth before the Ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in
   his place again. And when they arose early on the morrow morning,
   behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the Ark of
   the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were
   cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him." 1
   Samuel 5:2-4.

   The Ark of the Lord was captured by the Philistines though it was
   guarded by all the men of arms that Israel could muster for the battle.
   It came to no hurt when it was surrounded by unarmed priests--although
   the times were exceedingly disturbed and perilous all through the
   dreary period of the Judges, yet never was the Ark a captive till it
   was protected by carnal weapons. When those whom God had ordained to
   take care of the Ark of the Covenant had it in their charge, it was
   safe enough. But when the proud banners of the State and the warlike
   array of the nation formed the bodyguard of the sacred shrine, the Ark
   of God was taken. When the civil power was joined with the spiritual,
   and the arm of flesh came in to patronize and to take into connection
   with itself the arm of God's strength, then it was that the Ark was
   borne away in triumph by its foes!

   All through human history you will find the explanation of this
   instructive fact--leave God's Truth alone and it will take care of
   itself without the aid of kings and princes, laws or establishments,
   endowments or privileges. Only state the pure Truth of Revelation and
   it will force its own way. But garnish and adorn it by your eloquent
   language, or protect and guard it by your carnal wisdom and
   prudence--and the Truth of God goes into captivity. Leave the Church
   alone, O you kings and princes, or persecute it if you will, for it
   will laugh your opposition to scorn! Do not pretend to propagate its
   doctrines by the civil power, for this is the worst curse that can
   befall it! Take it under your patronage and the mere touch of your
   royal hands will create disease within it!

   Almost to the death has the so-called "Church" come down when her
   ministers, like Hophni and Phineas, have allied themselves with the
   temporal power, for God will do His work by His own instruments and in
   His own way. He will not be indebted to the might of flesh but will
   defend His own Glory by His own mysterious power. He uses for His
   instruments His consecrated ones who wear the white linen, which is the
   righteousness of saints--not the blood-stained men of war arrayed in
   coats of mail and glittering breastplate of steel.

   Another lesson may be learned from the incident before us. When the
   Philistines had beaten the Israelites in battle and captured the sacred
   chest called the Ark, they boasted and gloried as though they had
   defeated God Himself! They evidently regarded the golden casket as the
   very choicest part of the spoil and they placed it as a trophy in the
   chief temple of their God, Dagon, to show that he was mightier than the
   God Jehovah who was unable, as they thought, to protect His people.
   This touched, at once, the honor of Jehovah, and because He is a
   jealous God this was good for Israel. The fact that God is a jealous
   God has often a terrible side to us, for it leads to our chastisement
   when we grieve Him. This, indeed, led to the defeat of Israel.

   But it has, also, a bright side towards us, for His jealousy flames
   against His foes even more terribly than against His Friends! And when
   His name is blasphemed and honors that are due to Him are ascribed to a
   mere idol--or He is declared to have been defeated by a false god--then
   His jealousy burns like coals of juniper and He makes bare His right
   arm to smite His adversaries as He did on this occasion. He thinks it
   meet to punish His offending people, but when Philistia says, "Dagon
   has defeated Jehovah," then the Lord will no longer suffer Philistia to
   triumph!

   Jehovah's answer to His foes was Dagon broken to shivers before His Ark
   and the Philistines plagued with tumors, until, in their desperate pain
   and dire disgrace, they set the Ark free, being no longer able to
   endure its presence in any of their towns. And so the Jews ever
   afterwards used to exasperate the Philistines by reminding them of the
   disease which so sorely tried them. There is a dash of this in the
   Psalm which says of the Lord, "He smote His enemies in the inner part.
   He put them to a perpetual reproach." Never did a boastful nation
   undergo a deeper dishonor in the eyes of their neighbors, to whom they
   became a laughingstock! And never did an image suffer a worse disgrace
   than that which befell their God, Dagon.

   Now, then, whenever, at any time, infidelity or superstition shall so
   prevail as to discourage your minds, take comfort out of this--that in
   all these, God's honor is compromised. Have they blasphemed His name?
   Then He will protect that name! Have they gone further than they used
   to do in foul utterances against Him? Then they will provoke Him and He
   will make bare His holy arm! I pray that they may so provoke Him! All
   His Church will say, "Amen!" to that, so that He may arise and perform
   the glorious works of His strength and of His love among the sons of
   men and put the adversary to confusion by proving that He is still with
   His people--and still the same mighty God as He was in the days of
   yore.

   Say to yourselves, then, "Our Lord will not always endure this
   idolatrous popery which is multiplying its priests within our national
   Church. His people cannot bear it--much less will He! He will not
   always tolerate these blasphemous theories by which self-conceited,
   learned men and vainglorious skeptics seek to get rid of God out of the
   world. They will provoke Him. He will bestir Himself. He will show
   Himself strong on the behalf of His Truth! He will roll back the waves
   of sin and let the ages know that He is still the great I AM, the
   victorious God over all, blessed forever."

   Those two Truths of God, seem to me, to lie upon the surface of this
   passage. And now, though it would be very wrong to make out the Word of
   God to be a mere set of allegories and so to deny that it records
   facts--and this, I trust, we shall never do--yet, as the Apostle Paul
   has shown us that many of the events in the Old Testament are an
   allegory, and as, indeed, these things are evidently types, and must be
   regarded as emblems and patterns of things that still occur--we shall
   use this passage in a spiritual way and make it the channel of
   experimental teaching.

   Where the living God comes into the soul, Dagon, or the idol god of sin
   and worldliness, must go down! This is the one thought which we shall
   hammer out at this time.

   I. To begin, then--the coming of the Ark into Dagon's temple was an apt
   simile of the coming of Christ into the soul. Dagon, according to the
   best information, was the fish-god of Philistia, perhaps borrowed from
   the Sidonians and the men of Tyre, whose main business was upon the sea
   and who, therefore, invented a marine deity. The upper part of Dagon
   was a man or woman and the lower part of the idol was carved like a
   fish. We get a very good idea of it from the common notion of the
   fictitious, fabulous creature called a mermaid.

   Dagon was nothing more than a merman or mermaid, only, of course, there
   was no pretense of his being alive. He was a carved image--like that
   which the papists worship and call the Blessed Virgin, or Saint Peter,
   or Saint Remy. The temple at Ashdod was, perhaps, the cathedral of
   Dagon, the chief shrine of his worship--and there he sat erect upon the
   high altar with pompous surroundings. The Ark of the Covenant of the
   Lord of Hosts was a small wooden box overlaid with gold. It was, by no
   means, a very cumbersome or bulky thing but, nevertheless, very sacred
   because it had a representative character and symbolized the Covenant
   of God--its capture was grievous, indeed, to pious Israelites, for they
   felt that the Glory of God was departed when the Ark was taken.

   The sacred chest was carried in triumph by the Philistines and brought
   into the temple where Dagon stood. In your mind's eye you can see the
   fish-god high upon his throne and the incense burning before him as the
   priests gather around and the princes of Philistia, with triumphant
   banners, bow before his shrine. We hear the shouts of the Philistine
   lords as they bring in the golden coffer with the golden staves, set it
   down at the foot of Dagon and sing their exultant songs. Hear them as
   they sound their trumpets and chant their blasphemous hymns--"Glory be
   unto you, O Dagon! You have triumphed this day, O mighty god of the
   land and the sea! Glorious fish-god, you have vanquished those who
   vanquished the Canaanites. And though their God slew the Egyptians of
   old, you have smitten them by their thousands. Glory be unto you, you
   mighty god!"

   Thus would they extol their deity and pour contempt upon the captured
   Ark, which they placed at the foot of the image. Then, when the service
   was over and they had worshiped Dagon to their heart's content, they
   shut up the temple and there was darkness in the holy place, or unholy
   place--which shall I call it? Not long did the Ark remain where it was,
   with Dagon still supreme, but the mere incoming of the Ark into the
   idol temple was a fair picture of the introduction of the Grace of God
   into the human heart. The Philistines brought in the Ark of the Lord,
   but only an act of Divine power can bring the Grace of God into the
   soul.

   By different instrumentalities the Truth of God, as it is in Jesus, is
   read, is heard, is brought to the recollection, is seen printed in the
   lives of men and so enters into the temple of the inner man or woman.
   When it first comes into the heart it finds sin enthroned there--and
   the Prince of Darkness reigning supreme. The first Grace that enters
   into the soul finds it in darkness and in death, under the dominion of
   sin. Brothers and Sisters, we have not to deliver ourselves from sin
   and death and darkness--and then obtain Grace! No! While we are yet
   DEAD, Divine Grace visits us! While we are yet slaves, the Liberator
   comes! On our blackest midnight, the Sun of Righteousness arises!

   While the Dagon of sin sits firmly on his throne, as if he never could
   be stirred and his horrid form is, alone, to be seen lording it over
   all the thoughts and imaginations of the heart, even then it is that
   "God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us,
   even when we were dead in trespasses and sins," sends His almighty
   Grace to dwell within us! When that Grace enters the soul, it comes not
   with observation--and sin, at first does not know any more about the
   incoming of Grace than Dagon knew about the Ark. The Grace, the Light,
   the Truth, the Love of God come into the soul and the man does not
   know, as yet, what the Lord has done for him.

   He is only conscious of some impression--of a thoughtfulness he had
   never known before, of a calm frame of mind, of a desire to consider
   eternal things--that may be all that he perceives of the Lord's work
   within him. His Dagon seems to still be there in as supreme a majesty
   as ever--only something strange is also within the mind--the man has no
   idea what it is. It is the beginning of the end--of a blessed and
   glorious end! We have now Dagon and the Ark in the same temple--Sin and
   Grace in the same heart--but this state of things cannot long abide! No
   man can serve two masters! And even if he could, the two masters would
   not agree to be served!

   The two great principles of Sin and Grace will not abide in peace with
   each other, they are as opposite as fire and water. There will be
   conflict and victory, but we know which will conquer, for as surely as
   ever the Grace of God comes into the soul, Sin receives notice to exit!
   That night, when the Philistines had finished their exulting
   ceremonies, they thought they had left Dagon robed in glory, reigning
   and triumphing over the Ark of the Lord. They had scarcely shut the
   doors and gone before Dagon fell on his face to the ground before the
   Ark. Down he went! He did not lean over--he fell! Nor did he drop upon
   his side, but he was made to do obeisance before the Ark, for he fell
   on his face! And he did not fall merely part of the way, but fell on
   his face to the ground before the Ark--a change of positions very
   significant to his worshipers!

   The Ark was set at the foot of Dagon and now Dagon lies before the Ark
   as if he were prostrating himself in worship before the great and
   mighty God! Even thus Grace in the soul is not long before it
   overthrows sin. What a turning of things upside down Grace always
   makes! The watchword is, "Overturn, overturn, overturn!" The Breaker is
   come up, and the images of man's invention must be dashed to shivers!
   Very likely your Dagon is in the shape of self-righteousness. I shall
   call it Dagon, for it is nothing better--one of the worst idols in the
   whole world is the idol of self. The self-righteous man boasts that he
   is as good as other people, if not a little better, although he is not
   a Christian.

   He does not know that he has ever done anything very wrong and he feels
   that in him there is a great deal that is very good and excellent and,
   therefore, he expects that things will go well with him at last. He has
   a very fine figure for his god, and though there may be a rather
   "fishy" tail to his character, he keeps that as much out of sight as
   possible and conceals it with excuses. The god of his self-confidence
   is a very pretty thing, take it for all in all--it is as beautiful as a
   mermaid and he is fascinated with its beauty. He bows before his idol
   and sings before it that ancient canticle of the Philistines--I mean
   the Pharisees--which begins, "God, I thank You that I am not as other
   men are!"

   When Grace enters the soul the dominion of self-confidence comes to an
   end! Down goes the fish-god on its face to the ground before the Ark of
   the Lord and the man discovers that he has no such righteousness as
   that in which he trusted. He begins to bemoan his sins and to lament
   his shortcomings. A perfect change of feeling has come over him. He
   loathes himself as much as he once admired himself! And now, instead of
   taking the highest seat in the synagogue, he is

   willing to be a doormat in the House of the Lord. "Ah, me!" he says,
   "what a sinner I am! How vile in the sight of God!" Can you see how
   this brave Dagon has gone down on his face to the ground before the
   Ark?

   Perhaps the man never had much of this vainglorious self-righteousness,
   but he served the Dagon of besetting and beloved sin. The man was a
   drunk. Bacchus ruled him--but as soon as the Grace of God is brought
   into his soul, he has done with the drink-God! The horrible Dagon of
   drunkenness is hurled from its throne by Divine Grace. The man cannot
   bear to think that he should have so disgraced himself as to be fond of
   wantonness, drunkenness and such-like abominable sins which bring
   manhood below the level of the beast! He who is truly penitent hates
   the very name of these filthy sins!

   If a man has been guilty of using bad language and profane swearing,
   the Grace of God generally cures him of that at once. I have heard men
   who had lived in the practice of swearing for many years say that, from
   the time they were converted, they have never been tempted to it--that
   black sin went away--bag and baggage at once! Some sins are slow in
   dying, but profanity generally gives up the ghost without a struggle.
   John Bunyan says that a stone from the battering ram slew Mr. Profane
   by cracking his skull, so that he died early in the siege of outward
   offenses. Like Dagon, they are soon down before the Ark. Sin of every
   sort is bowed low before the triumphant Grace of God! Yes, and the man
   who receives the Grace of God feels that the love of any and every sin
   is cast out of its place in his heart. Now he desires to be quit of it
   all and anxiously cries, "Lord, what would you have me to do?" He will
   no more go and live in sin, as he did before, than Paul will continue
   to be a persecutor after the Lord, even Jesus, has appeared to him by
   the way. What a Dagon-fall there was in the Apostle's pride just
   outside the Damascus gate! Such a fall takes place in the heart of
   every man to whom the Grace of God comes with power!

   The parallel may be run a little further. This fall of Dagon very soon
   began to be perceived, for, "When they of Ashdod arose early on the
   morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen on his face to the earth." Very soon
   after the entrance of Divine Grace, this sign follows and, before long,
   it is seen and known. Let no man conceive that there is Grace in his
   soul if Dagon still sits on the throne! This is one of the earliest
   tokens of the entrance of the life of God into the soul--that sin falls
   down from its high place and is no more held in honor. At the same
   time, observe that Dagon was not broken. He had fallen on his face, but
   that was all--so that the next day his foolish worshipers set him up,
   again.

   Sometimes, at the first entrance of Grace, there is a downfall of sin,
   but nothing like such a breaking and destroying of sin in the soul as
   there will be afterwards. When the Divine life has entered, sin is
   dethroned--it no longer sits up there in the place of God--but yet, for
   all that, there is an awful power remaining in the corrupt nature.
   There is a deadly tendency to sin, a powerful law in the members
   bringing the soul into captivity. Still, down the idol goes, even if it
   is not broken! It cannot reign, though it may remain to trouble us.

   Now, what happened on the night mentioned in the text? Dagon fell
   before the Ark when it was all quiet and still in the temple. While the
   worshipers were there, during the day, there was noise and
   shouting--the false god sat aloft and you could not tell that there was
   any mysterious power about the Ark. It was in the quiet of the night
   that this deed was done and thus, often, in the hearing of the Word,
   Grace is introduced into the heart. But you would not know that any
   change was worked, for it is only when the man gets away from the
   world's business--gets alone and begins to consider--that a
   Divinely-mysterious might is displayed by the inward Grace so as to
   sink sin and lay the power of evil low.

   Would to God our hearers took more opportunities for quietly
   considering the Word of God! How much more blessing might often be
   gotten out of sermons and books if there were more meditation! You get
   the grapes, but you do not tread them in the winepress! There is more
   trouble taken to collect the sheaves of the sermon than is afterwards
   expended in threshing them out! The power which smote Dagon was
   displayed in the quiet of the night--and when the Grace of God has
   entered into your souls, it is probable that the coming down of sin
   will be better effected in times of quiet thought and searching of
   heart than at any other period. Thought is the channel of immense
   benefit to the soul. Shut the temple doors and let all be still--and
   then will the Holy Spirit work wonders in the soul!

   II. Now, secondly, the setting up of Dagon, the second time, and his
   second fall very well represent the battle going on in the soul between
   sin and Grace. What fools these Philistines were to continue worshiping
   a god which, when it tumbled down, could not get up again! To worship a
   god which fell on its face was bad enough, but to worship one that
   could not rise when he fell--but needed to be set in his place by human
   hands--was certainly vile infatuation! But they

   took up their precious deity and they put him in his place again and,
   no doubt, sang a special "high mass" to him and then went their way,
   quietly, to their homes, little dreaming that their pretty fish-god
   would need their help again so soon!

   Even thus Satan and the flesh come into our souls and try to set our
   fallen Dagon up, again, with some measure of success. It often happens
   that in young converts there comes a period when it looks as if they
   had altogether apostatized and gone back to their former ways. It seems
   as if the work of God were not real in their souls and Divine Grace was
   not triumphant. Do you wonder at it? I have ceased to wonder! The
   Gospel is preached and the man accepts it--and there is a marvelous
   difference in him! But when he goes among his old companions, although
   he is resolved not to fall into his former sins, they try him severely.
   He is assailed in a thousand ways!

   Some of our young people, if they were to tell their story, would
   harrow up your feelings by mentioning the way in which all sorts of
   jests, insinuations and taunts are hurled at them--and that by
   influential persons--their parents, their elder brothers and sisters
   and those who oversee their work. They are beset behind and before, so
   that if they do not transgress in one way, it is very likely that the
   devil craftily trips them up in another. I have known a man, when he
   has been tempted to go into evil company, refuse again, and again, and
   again. His tempters have laughed at him and he has borne it all--but at
   last he has lost his temper--and as soon as the enemies have seen his
   passion boiling up, they have cried out, "Ah, there you are! We have
   got you!" At such a time as that the poor man is apt to cry, "Alas, I
   cannot be a Believer or else I should not have done this."

   Now, all this is a violent attempt of Satan and the flesh to set Dagon
   up again! They know that the Lord has thrown him down and they cannot
   bear it. They would gladly set the fish-god, again, on his throne.
   Sometimes they do, for a time, set Dagon up, again, and cause great
   sorrow in the soul. I have known a poor lost lamb to be found and
   brought into the fold, but it has miserably wandered for a time, and
   the devil has thought that, surely, he had got that lamb and would tear
   him in pieces. And yet he has been deceived after all! Dagon was only
   set up for a time and he had to come down again--and so it happens
   wherever Grace enters the heart. The wanderers have come back, weeping
   and sighing, to admit that they have dishonored their profession--and
   what has been the result in the long run?

   Why, they have had more humility, more tenderness of heart, more love
   to Christ, more gratitude than they had before! And I have been glad,
   (not glad that they wandered), but glad that the Grace of God, when He
   has brought them back again more fully, has given them a deeper
   conversion and a more lasting and substantial work of Grace, so that
   afterwards they have continued, by the Grace of God, honorable, useful
   Christians even to the end! Often and often is that the case, and I
   speak at this time to any young convert who can say in his heart, "O
   Sir, I do love the Lord, but I have been such a backslider! I do trust
   Jesus. I wish to be a Christian, but I have been overthrown by enemies!
   I fear I must not join a Christian Church because if I could not resist
   temptation for six weeks, how could I expect to stand fast all my life?
   I am such a poor, weak creature, so apt to be led astray, what is to
   become of me?" Dear Friend, grieve to think you were so foolish, but do
   not doubt the power of God's Holy Spirit to help you and to break in
   pieces the enemy who seems to have resumed his power over you!

   Now, notice that although they again set Dagon up, he had to go down
   again with a worse fall. I have no doubt it took them a long pull and a
   great heave to haul the uncomely lump of marble into its place again.
   Many strong limbs were tired and muscles strained to lift up the huge
   god and set him on his pedestal! But it was no trouble for the Lord to
   upset the ugly stone! No rope was needed and no straining or pulling!
   "Bel bows down and Nebo stoops" when Jehovah uplifts Himself! Only shut
   the temple gates and leave the Ark and Dagon to have it out between
   them--and Dagon gets the worst of it! Only, mark this, Dagon has not
   gained much by being reinstated, for this time, when he comes down,
   behold, he was fallen on his face to the ground before the Ark of
   Jehovah, "and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were
   cut off upon the threshold."

   The idol's head was gone and, even so, the reigning power of sin is
   utterly broken and destroyed--its beauty, its cunning, its glory are
   all dashed to atoms! This is the result of the Grace of God, and the
   sure result of it, if it once comes into the soul, however long the
   conflict may continue and however desperate the efforts of Satan to
   regain his empire. O Believer, sin may trouble you, but it shall not
   tyrannize over you! "Sin shall not have dominion over you," says the
   Holy Spirit, "for you are not under the Law, but under Grace." If the
   power of evil is set up for awhile, it shall only come down with the
   greater force--and its head shall be cut off.

   Then, too, the hands of Dagon were broken off and even thus the active
   power, the working power of sin is taken away. Both the palms of the
   idols' hands were cut off upon the threshold, so that he had not a hand
   left. Neither right-handed sin or left-handed sin shall remain in the
   Believer when God's sanctifying Grace fetches Dagon down! The secret
   reigning power is broken and so is the manifest working power. The
   Christian is kept from putting forth his hand into iniquity. He is
   crucified with Christ and so both hands are nailed to the Cross and
   fastened up from performing those deeds of ill towards which the lusts
   of the flesh would urge him! This happened, too, if you notice, very
   speedily, for we are told, a second time, that when they arose early on
   the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face.

   It does not take Grace long, when it is once in the soul, to overturn
   the reigning power and the active energy of sin, even when these, for a
   while, appear to get the upper hand. Brothers and Sisters, I hope you
   know this. I hope that the Spirit of God, which is in you, and the love
   of Christ, which reigns in you, have destroyed the power which sin once
   had in your souls. If it is not so, then question yourselves whether
   the Spirit of God is in you at all! It is not possible that the Ark
   should be in the temple and that Dagon should be standing there
   unbroken! Not till the morrow morning shall evil remain unchallenged
   and unmoved upon the throne!

   It is not possible that you, dear Friend, could live and delight in
   sin, and yet be a child of God! If your heart is set upon iniquity,
   where your heart is, there your treasure is--and if sin is your
   treasure--you are no heir of Heaven! That which governs your heart is
   your Lord and your God--what your heart loves, by that you shall be
   judged--and if you love evil, you shall be condemned! We may sin--ah,
   would God we did not!--but to love sin is not in the Believer! There is
   a deadly antagonism between Grace and sin--and where the gracious life
   comes, the evil life must fall. There cannot be an alliance between
   Dagon and the Ark, between God and the world, or between Christ and
   sin!

   III. And now, thirdly, the parallel still holds good in one more point,
   namely, that though the fish-god was thus maimed and broken, yet the
   stump of Dagon was left. The original Hebrew is, "Only Dagon was left
   to him," or, "only the fish"--only the fish part remained. The head and
   the upper portions were broken away--there remained only the fishtail
   of Dagon and that was all--but that was not broken. Now, this is the
   business which brings us so much sorrow--that the stump of Dagon is
   left. I wish it were not.

   I have heard some say that they have no sin remaining in them. Well,
   dear Brothers and Sisters, may the Lord convert you! I shall say no
   more than that, for if there were in you enough light for you to
   perceive your darkness, it were better than to talk as you do. Every
   child of God who knows anything about himself and the experience of a
   real Believer, knows that there is indwelling sin in him and that to a
   most fearful extent, so as to make his very soul cry out in agony, "O
   wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death?" I could not go the length of singing, with Ralph Erskine, as a
   description of myself, the lines written by him in his, "Believer's
   Sonnets"--

   "To good and evil equal bent And both a devil and a saint." But yet,
   taken with a large lump of salt, there is a good deal of truth even in
   that unguarded expression!

   There is the old corruption within us--and there is no use denying
   it--because denying it will put us off our guard, will make many of the
   puzzles of life to be quite unanswerable and often bring upon us great
   confusion of soul. The other Law is within us as well as Grace. Can you
   draw near to God, my Brothers and Sisters, and not see that He can
   justly charge you with folly? Can you stand in His Presence, as Job
   did, and behold His Glory, and not say, "I abhor myself in dust and
   ashes"? Can you have dealings with Perfection and not perceive your
   faults? Can you come near unto the innermost court of the Temple and
   stand in that excessive light of fellowship which is the portion of the
   Lord's chosen and not see within yourself spots and wrinkles, yes,
   thousands of them, so as to make you cover your face for shame and
   adore the amazing Grace which loves you still?

   Can you not see in your daily life enough to condemn you and cast you
   into Hell were it not that God still sees you in Christ and imputes not
   your iniquity to you, but accepts you in the Beloved? Oh, it is so--it
   is so, indeed! The stump of Dagon is still left! And because it is
   left, dear Friend, it is a thing to be watched against, for though that
   stony stump of Dagon would not grow in the Philistine temple--yet they
   would make a new image and exalt it again, and bow before it as others.
   Alas, the stump of sin within us is not a slab of stone, but full of
   vitality like the tree cut down of which Job said, "At the scent of
   water it will bud." Leave the sin that is in you to itself--let
   temptation come in the way and you shall see that which will blind your
   eyes with weeping!

   It is a good thing to look at your face in a mirror, but your face is
   not yourself--no mirror can show you yourself. There is a certain
   temptation which has an affinity to the evil within you and, should
   Satan bring that temptation near, you will see yourself to your horror
   and shame! There shall then look out of the window of your countenance
   a man whom you did not see when you looked in the glass, for you only
   saw the house he lived in! So ugly is he that he makes the very house
   he lives in look horrible! When the angry man comes up and is visible
   to the naked eye, how he deforms the countenance! When obstinate old
   Adam comes to the window, what a dark forbidding face he wears! When
   that envious spirit comes up, what an evil glance there is in the eye!
   When the unbelieving spirit peers through the lattice, what a miserable
   countenance he shows compared with the face of faith and childlike
   confidence in God!

   There is nobody in this world, dear Brothers and Sisters, that you have
   so much cause to be afraid of as yourself! Augustine used to pray,
   "Lord, deliver me from that evil man, myself." A very appropriate
   prayer for a woman, too-- "Lord, save me from myself." If you are saved
   from yourself, you will be saved from the devil--for what can the devil
   do unless selfjoins hands with him in unholy league? But, oh, what
   watchfulness it will need! Here is room for faith, indeed! Faith does
   not decline the conflict nor puff us up with the notion that the fight
   is over--on the contrary, it takes to itself the whole armor of God
   because it sees the battle to be still raging! Faith is needed to be
   the shield to keep off the fiery darts and the sword with which to
   smite the foe.

   Here is the sphere in which faith is to work--it does not talk of ended
   warfare, but carries on the life-long campaign to ultimate victory.
   Faith does not say, "I have ceased the conflict"--she knows better!
   Faith says, "I am in the midst of it, warring with a thousand foes and
   looking for the victory through Jesus Christ, my Lord." O Brothers and
   Sisters, be strong in faith by the power of the Holy Spirit, for you
   have need to be, since the stump of Dagon still remains! The lusting of
   the flesh abides still in the regenerate! Look at this matter again.
   That stump of Dagon which remained was a vile thing--it was a piece of
   an idol--a fragment of a monstrous image which had been worshiped
   instead of God!

   Now, the sin which dwells in you is never to be regarded by you as
   anything else than a horrible, loathsome and detestable thing. After
   such love as you and I have known, that there should be in us even the
   power to be ungrateful ought to shock us! After such proof of His Truth
   as God has shown us, that after such faithfulness and such abundant
   evidences of faithfulness we should still be capable of unbelief ought
   to be a sorrow to us! Oh, I wish I could never sin again throughout
   time or eternity! Oh, that every particle of the tinder of depravity
   into which the devil could let a spark fall was gone from my nature! It
   is a mercy to have the sparks put out, but it is a pity to have even
   the tinder left--and there is plenty of this tinder about us all!

   Tinder? Yes, gunpowder so quick to take the light which Satan is ever
   ready to bring! We carry a bombshell heart about with us--and we had
   better keep clear of all the devil's candles lest there should be an
   explosion of actual sin. These candles are common enough in the form of
   some plausible but skeptical friend, or in the form of amusements which
   are questionable. Keep clear of Lucifer's matches! You have got enough
   mischief in your heart without going where you will get more! If
   anybody here feels that he is so very gracious and good that he can
   safely enter into temptation, I am sure that he is laboring under a
   very great mistake! I would say to him, "Brother, there is devil enough
   in you without your sending out invitation cards to seven more! Go to
   Him that casts out devils! Go into company where the powers of evil
   will be held in chains and bound--do not go where other devils as
   wicked as yourself will call to the demon who now besets you and stir
   him up to work mischief! The stump of Dagon is left. Be careful,
   watchful, prayerful--and loathe sin with all your soul."

   IV. But now, lastly, here is mercy that though the stump of Dagon was
   not taken out of the Philistine temple, we may go beyond the history
   and rejoice that it will be taken from our hearts! The day is coming,
   Brother, Sister, in which there will be no more inclination in you to
   sin than there is in an angel! The day is coming in which your nature
   shall be so established in the Truth of God and righteousness and
   holiness that all the devils in Hell will not be able to make you think
   a wrong thought!

   "Oh," says one, "I wish that time would come soon." It will come,
   Brother. The Lord will keep you fighting and warring, but there will
   come a day when a messenger will wait at your door and he will say,
   "The pitcher is broken at the fountain, and the wheel broken at the
   cistern. Your flesh must return to the dust and your spirit to God that
   made it." And then your spirit shall open its eyes with glad surprise
   and find itself delivered from the body and, at the same time,
   delivered from all sin! There shall also come, by-and-by, the sound of
   the trumpet of Resurrection and the body shall

   rise--and one of the chief characteristics of the risen body will be
   that as it rises it will be free from the bondage of corruption--it
   will have no tendency to lead us into sin! When our perfected spirit
   shall enter into our perfect body, then our complete manhood--body,
   soul and spirit--shall, by God's Grace, have no stain, or spot, or
   flaw!

   All its past sin will be washed away--no, is washed away--in the blood
   of the Lamb! And all its propensities, tendencies and inclinations to
   sin shall all be gone forever! The very possibilities of sinning shall
   be eternally taken away--

   " No cloud those blissful regions know, Forever bright and fair; For
   sin, the source of mortal woe, Can never enter there."

   John Bunyan represents Mercy as laughing in her sleep. She had a dream,
   she said, and she laughed because of the great favors which were yet to
   be bestowed upon her. Well, if some of you were to dream, tonight, that
   the great thing which I have spoken of had actually happened to you, so
   that you were completely free from all tendency to sin, would not you,
   also, be as they that dream and laugh for very joy? Think of it--no
   more cause for watchfulness, no more need of weeping over the day's sin
   before you fall asleep at night! No more sin to confess, no devil to
   tempt you, no worldly care, no lust, no envy, no depression of spirit,
   no unbelief--will not this be a very large part of the joy of Heaven?

   Why, I am ready to cry for joy to think that this will happen to me,
   unworthy though I am! "Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is
   within me, bless His holy name." It will be so, Brothers and Sisters,
   both to you and to me! As surely as we have trusted Christ, He will
   perfect that which concerns us--

   " The feeblest saint shall win the day,

   Though death and Hell obstruct the way." The Lord has undertaken our
   perfect sanctification and He will accomplish it! He has brought old
   Dagon down and broken his head and his hands--and He will break him to
   shivers before long. Yes, He will take the Ark of the Lord away where
   Dagon shall never come into contact with it any more. He will take
   you--the gracious part of you, your truest and best self--away into
   Glory to abide with Him forever! Think of this and sing! Yes, Brothers
   and Sisters, sing with all your might, for all this may happen within a
   week. A week? It may happen within a day! It may happen before you
   reach home tonight!

   We are so near to Heaven that if we were not very dull and our ears
   very heavy, we might, right now, hear the angels chanting their
   ceaseless hallelujahs! Some of God's saints--some here, perhaps--have
   almost got their foot upon the threshold of the Eternal City and do not
   know it! They are closer than they think to the harp and the palm
   branch. They would not fret about what they will do next year--they
   would not be worrying about next quarter--if they knew that they would
   be among the royalties of Heaven by then! They would not even think
   about tomorrow did they know how soon it will all be over and how soon
   the eternal joy will begin!

   God bless you, dear Friends. May the Lord's Grace reign over all, in
   the power of the Holy Spirit--and even to sinners in whom sin is
   triumphant may Jesus Christ come--and His Grace enter! And then their
   beloved sins must fall. To the only living and true God be Glory
   forever and ever! Amen.

The Jewel of Peace

   (No. 1343)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 18, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now the Lord of Peace Himself give you peace always by all means. The
   Lord be with you all." 2 Thessalonians 3:16.

   WHEN the heart is full of love it finds the hand too feeble for its
   desires. Therefore it seeks relief in intercession and
   benediction--wishing, praying and blessing where it cannot actually
   effect its loving purpose. The Apostle would have done for the
   Thessalonians all the good that was conceivable had it been in his
   power, but his wishes far outstripped his abilities and, therefore, he
   betook himself to interceding for them and to invoking upon them the
   blessing of the Lord and Master whom he served. Here is a lesson for us
   in the art of doing good--as we lengthen the eyesight with the
   telescope, as we send our words afar by the telegraph--so let us extend
   our ability to do good by the constant use of intercessory prayer.

   Parents, when you have done all you can for your children, be thankful
   that you may introduce them to a further and greater blessing by
   commending them to the care of the great Father in Heaven! Friends, do
   your friends the best possible deed of friendship by asking for them
   the friendship of God. You who love the souls of men, when you have
   poured out all your strength on their behalf, bless God that there is
   still something more which you can do, for by entreaties and
   supplications you may bring down from on high the earnest and the
   effectual energy of the Holy Spirit who can work in their hearts that
   which it is not in your power to accomplish!

   The Apostle saw that the Thessalonians were much troubled and he wrote
   the most encouraging words to cheer them. But he knew that he could not
   take the burden from off their hearts and, therefore, he turned to the
   God of all consolation and prayed Him to give them peace always by all
   means. The slenderness of our power to bless others will be no
   detriment to them if it leads us to lay hold upon the eternal strength,
   for that will bring into the field a superior power to bless--and our
   infirmity will only make space for the display of Divine Grace. Let us
   look, first, at the many-sided blessing which the Apostle
   invokes--peace. And then let us note the special desirableness of it.
   Thirdly, let us observe from whom, alone, it comes. And fourthly, note
   the wide sweep of the Apostolic prayer.

   I. First, then, let us look at THE MANY-SIDED BLESSING--"The Lord of
   Peace Himself give you peace." Some have thought to restrict the
   expression to peace within the Church since disorderly members were
   evidently increasing among the Thessalonians. But that is a very
   straitened and cowardly interpretation and it is never wise to narrow
   the meaning of God's Word. Indeed, such a contracted explanation cannot
   be borne, for it does not appear that the disorderly persons mentioned
   in the chapter had, as yet, created any special disturbance--they had
   been quietly fattening at the expense of their generous Brethren and
   would not be very eager to quarrel with the rack from which they fed.

   Although, no doubt, Church quiet is included as one variety of peace,
   yet it would be a sad dwarfing of the meaning of the Spirit to consider
   one phase of the blessing to the neglect of the rest. No, the peace
   here meant is "the deep tranquility of a soul resting on God"--the
   quiet restfulness of spirit which is the peculiar gift of God and the
   choice privilege of the Believer. "Great peace have all they that love
   Your Law, and nothing shall offend them." The peace of the text is a
   gem with many facets, but in considering its many-sidedness we must
   remember that its main bearing is toward God. The deepest, best, and
   most worthy peace of the soul is its rest towards the Lord God,
   Himself.

   I trust we know this and are enjoying it at this moment. We are no
   longer afraid of God--the sin which divided us from Him is blotted out
   and the distance which it created has ceased to be. The Atonement has
   worked perfect reconciliation and established everlasting peace. The
   terrors of God's Law are effectually removed from us and, instead
   thereof, we feel the drawings of His love. We are brought near by the
   atoning Sacrifice and have peace with God through Jesus Christ our
   Lord. We know that all His thoughts to us are thoughts of love and we
   bless His name that our thoughts

   toward Him are no longer those of the slave towards a taskmaster, or of
   a criminal towards a judge, but those of a beloved child towards a kind
   and tender father.

   Fervent love reigns in our hearts, casting out all fear and causing us
   to joy in God by our Lord Jesus Christ. This is a great blessing! It is
   surely a choice delight for a man to know that whether he prospers or
   is afflicted, whether he lives or dies, there is nothing between God
   and him but perfect amity, for all that offends has been effectually
   put away. Beloved, when the Apostle wishes us peace in the words of our
   text, he no doubt means that our hearts should be at perfect peace by
   being placed fully in accord with the will of God. But, alas, we have
   known some who we hope are forgiven and are God's children, who,
   nevertheless, quarrel with God.

   They are not pleased with what He does and even complain that He deals
   harshly with them--they are naughty children and carry on a sort of
   sullen contention with their heavenly Father because He does not
   indulge them in all their whims and fancies. Now, may the Lord of Peace
   put an end to all such grievous warfare of heart in His people! May you
   love the Lord so well and trust Him so fully that you could not pick a
   quarrel with Him even if He smote you and bruised you and broke your
   bones! Whatever He does is not only to be accepted with submission, but
   to be rejoiced in. That which pleases Him should please us. We have
   perfect peace when we can magnify and praise the Lord even for the
   sharp cuts of His rod and the fierce fires of His furnace! May the Lord
   bring us into this state, for there is no joy like it-- perfect peace
   with God is Heaven below!

   Yes, Brothers and Sisters, we reach a little further than
   reconciliation and submission, for we come into the enjoyment of
   conscious complacency. There are men who are at peace with God as to
   the forgiveness of sin and, in a measure, are in accord with His will,
   but they are not walking carefully in the path of obedience and so they
   are missing the sense of Divine Love. God is their Father and He loves
   them--but He hides His face from them. They walk contrary to Him and so
   He walks contrary to them. We cannot consider such a condition to be
   one of fullest peace. The truly restful state of mind is enjoyed when
   the heart and life are daily cleansed by Grace so that there is nothing
   to grieve the Spirit of God and, therefore, the Lord feels it right to
   favor His child with the light of His Countenance in full meridian
   splendor!

   O how blessed to bask in the sunlight of Jehovah's love, free from all
   doubt and being no more conscious of sin! In that sense of conscious
   favor lies the rest of Heaven. May the Lord of Peace Himself give us
   this peace! This peace, because sin is forgiven, is the sweet fruit of
   justification--"therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
   God." This peace, because the heart is renewed and made to agree with
   the will of God, is the blessed result of sanctification, for "to be
   spiritually-minded is life and peace." This peace, because the soul is
   conscious of being the object of Divine Love, is a precious attendant
   upon the spirit of adoption which is the very essence of peace!
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, may this threefold peace with God be
   with you always!

   Now we look further and note that this peace spreads itself abroad and
   covers all things with its soft light. God is great and fills all
   things. He who becomes at peace with Him is at peace with all things.
   Being reconciled to God, the Believer says--"All things are mine,
   whether things present or things to come. All are mine, for I am
   Christ's and Christ is God's." Behold, the Lord has made us to be in
   league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field are at
   peace with us! Providence is our pavilion and angels are our
   attendants. All things work together for our good, now that we love God
   and are the called according to His purpose. No longer are we afraid of
   the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day, nor of the
   pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction which wastes
   at noonday!

   Behold the Lord God covers us with His feathers and under His wings do
   we trust! His Truth is our shield and buckler. Because we have set our
   love upon Him, He delivers us and He sets us on high because we have
   known His name. At peace with the Lord of Hosts we are at peace with
   all the armies of the universe, in alliance with all the forces which
   muster at Jehovah's bidding! Though we must be at war with Satan, yet
   even he is chained and made as a slave to accomplish purposes of good
   contrary to his own will. There is neither in Heaven nor earth nor
   Hell, anything that we need fear when we are once right with God!
   Settle the center and the circumference is secure--peace with God is
   universal peace.

   This practically shows itself in the Christian's inward peace with
   regard to his present circumstances, be they what they may. Being at
   peace with God, he sees the Lord's hand in everything around him and is
   content. Is he poor? The Lord makes him rich in faith and he asks not
   for gold. Is he sick? The Lord endows him with patience and he glories
   in

   his afflictions. Is he laid aside from the holy service which he so
   much loves? He feels that the Lord knows best. If he might be actively
   engaged in doing God's will, he would be very thankful and run with
   diligence the race set before him.

   But if he must lie in the hospital and suffer rather than serve, he
   does not wish to put his own wishes before the will of his Master--he
   leaves himself in the Lord's hands, saying--"Lord, do as You will with
   me. I am so at peace with You that if You use me, I will bless You. And
   if You lay me aside, I will bless You. If You spare my life, I will
   bless You, and if You bring me down to the grave I will bless You. If
   You honor me among men, I will bless You, and if You make me to be trod
   under foot like straw for the dunghill, I will still bless You--for You
   are everything and I am nothing--You are all goodness and I am sin and
   emptiness."

   The soul which thus has perfect peace as to all its personal
   surroundings is, indeed, happy! It is lying down in green pastures
   beside the still waters. Blessed be God, this peace is mainly to be
   found in the soul, itself, as to its own thoughts, beliefs, hopes,
   expectations and desires. We have not only peace towards the outer
   world, but peace within! After all, happiness and peace lie more within
   the man than in anything around him. Heaven lies more in the heart than
   in golden streets--and Hell's flame consists rather in man's tortured
   conscience than in the Tophet fire which the breath of God has kindled.
   So the peace which Jesus gives is within us--"the good man is satisfied
   with himself."

   Some minds are strangers to peace. How can they have peace, for they
   have no faith? They are as a rolling thing before the whirlwind, having
   no fixed basis, no abiding foundation of belief. These are the darlings
   of the school of modern thought, whose disciples set themselves as
   industriously to breed doubt as if salvation came by it. "Doubt and be
   saved," is their gospel and who does not see that this is not the
   Gospel of peace? Indeed, they are receptive and are peering about for
   fresh light, though long ago the Sun of Righteousness has arisen! Such
   uncertainty suits me not! I must know something or I cannot live--I
   must be sure of something or I have no motive from which to act!

   God never meant us to live in perpetual questioning. His Revelation is
   not and cannot be that shapeless cloud which philosophical divines make
   it out to be! There must be something true and Christ must have come
   into the world to teach us something saving and reliable! He cannot
   mean that we should be always rushing through bogs and into morasses
   after the will-of-the-wisp of intellectual religion. There is assuredly
   some ascertainable, Infallible, revealed Truth for common people! There
   must be something sure to rest upon. I know it is so and declare unto
   you what I have heard and seen! There are great Truths of God which the
   Lord has engraved upon my very soul, concerning which all the men on
   earth and all the devils in Hell cannot shake me!

   As to these vital doctrines, an immovable and unconquerable dogmatism
   has laid hold upon my soul and, therefore, my mind has peace! A man's
   mind must come to a settlement upon eternal Truths by the teaching of
   the Holy Spirit, or else he cannot know what peace is. I would pray for
   every one of my Brothers and Sisters that they may find an anchor of
   mind and heart and never leave it! We have been often spoken of as an
   old-fashioned Church and your minister is said to be Ultimus
   Puritanorum, the, "Last of the Puritans," a man incapable of any
   thought beyond the limit of the old-fashioned theology. I bless the
   Lord that it is so! I am, indeed, incapable of forsaking the Gospel for
   these new-fangled theories! Down went my anchor years ago! It was a
   great relief to me when I first felt it grip and it is a growing joy to
   me that I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to
   keep that which I have committed to Him.

   Pretensions to original thought I have never made! I invent nothing! I
   only tell the old, old story as God enables me. "Ah," said a certain
   Divine to me one day, "it must be very easy for you to preach because
   you know what you are going to say--your views are fixed and
   stereotyped. As for me," he said, "I am always seeking after truth and
   I do not know one week what I may preach the next." Thus speak the
   teachers--do you wonder if the disciples wander into skepticism?! Has
   the Lord taught the man nothing of the sure Truths of God? Then let him
   wait till he has received His message. Till he knows the Gospel in his
   own heart, experimentally, as the power of God unto salvation, let him
   sit on the penitent form and ask to be prayed for, but never enter a
   pulpit!

   What are Churches doing to tolerate these sowers of infidelity? Time
   was when the fathers in our Israel would have chased from their pulpits
   those who glory in the unbelief which is their shame! May the Lord of
   Peace, Himself, give you peace as to your personal beliefs and
   convictions--and then when you get into deep waters of trial and sorrow
   you will say, "Ah, I did believe the right doctrine after all! I can
   feel the grip of my anchor on the things unseen. I have not been
   deceived. I have not followed cunningly devised fables, for the promise
   is true and I feel the power of it! It sustains and

   cheers and comforts me under all my trials and I know that it will do
   so even to my dying hour." May every troubled thinker find the peace of
   faith and never lose it!

   Many minds are forever restless as to their fears. It is a great thing
   to know why you tremble, for when you know what you fear, your fear is
   half gone! The indefinable shape, the mysterious hand which has no arm
   but writes upon the wall in strange characters--the cloudiness of all
   things dreaded makes the mind more restless. But blessed is the man to
   whom the Lord has taught His fear--so that he knows what he fears and
   does not permit his hopes to be in perpetual eclipse. Of this
   many-sided peace we must say something more. The Thessalonian Church
   had been troubled three ways. They had been persecuted from without.
   That is not a pleasant thing, but the Apostle says, "You that are
   troubled rest with us."

   Now, when the Lord Jesus Christ says to a persecuted saint, "I am with
   you: all the evil which is done unto you is done unto Me, and you are
   bearing it for My name's sake," then, Beloved, no persecution can break
   the peace of the soul! But rather, the sufferer rejoices and is
   exceedingly glad that he is counted worthy, not only to believe in
   Christ, but to suffer for His sake!

   Next, the Thessalonian Church was annoyed by certain false teachers.
   They did not absolutely teach novel doctrine, but upon a basis of the
   Truth of God they erected an edifice of error. They exaggerated one
   special Truth and carried its teaching to extravagance. They said,
   "Christ is coming, therefore the day of the Lord is immediately at
   hand." They belonged to that order of fanatics who are always raving
   about "the signs of the times" and pretending to know what will happen
   within the next 20 years. There were impostors of that sort in Paul's
   day and there are such impostors now. Believe them not! They can see no
   more of the future than blind horses! I put them all together as
   impostors, whether they are preachers or literary hacks, for no man
   knows the future and no man can tell his fellows about it.

   I care no more for their explanations of prophecy than for the
   pretended winking of the eyes of the Madonna--yet they will continue
   the scam and will be saying one thing this time and another that--that
   this and that wonder shall happen--and that terrible judgments shall
   overwhelm our nation. The Apostle would not have the Thessalonians
   disturbed in their minds by fears about the future. Brethren in Christ,
   the most terrible fact of the future can be no just cause of alarm to a
   true Believer! The Lord comforts His people and there is nothing in His
   plans or purposes which is intended to disquiet them. You may rest
   assured that if any doctrine in the Bible prevents a godly man from
   enjoying peace it must be because he has not yet understood it fully,
   or else has mistaken its bearing towards himself.

   The Truths of God must minister peace to true men. All Truths of God,
   whether doctrinal or prophetic, are on the side of the children of God!
   How can it be otherwise? The Apostle tells the Thessalonians not to be
   disturbed about the coming of Christ. "The Lord be with you all," he
   says, and if the Lord is with us, what does it matter to us whether He
   personally comes at once or chooses to delay? We should be looking for
   His coming, but not with alarm, for the fact that He has come, already,
   is a wellspring of delight! We glory in His first advent and do not
   dread the second. Since we are already raised up into the heavenly
   places to sit with Him by faith, what does it matter to us whether He
   is up there or down here--or whether we are in Heaven or on earth--so
   long as we abide in Him?

   There may arise, possibly there will arise, wild fanatics who will
   again spread alarming news about wars and rumors of wars and select
   some fatal year as the end of all things. Well, if such things should
   be, if crowds should go into the wilderness or into the city to look
   for the coming of Christ, believe them not, but sit still in peace and
   tranquility of spirit and say, "My soul loves Him and He loves me. He
   cannot mean ill to me whether He destroys the earth or spares it.
   Though the heavens pass away and the earth, itself, melts with fervent
   heat, my heart is resting in her Lord and knows herself to be secure."
   Thus the Lord saves His people from the disturbance caused by false
   teaching.

   There were, also, in the Church, disorderly characters--people that
   went about spreading idle tales and gossiping. They would not do
   anything for a living and so they set people by the ears. But when the
   Lord gives a Christian deep spiritual peace within, he soon puts aside
   the small nuisances of idle tongues and disorderly deeds. He refuses to
   be worried. Mosquitoes buzz around every Christian Church and blessed
   is the man who does not feel their bite or heed their buzzing! His soul
   shall dwell at ease.

   Peace from Church troublers is a great blessing and we ought to praise
   God for it when we are in the enjoyment of it, for strife within the
   Church, like civil war, is the worst of warfare. O to live in holy love
   and unbroken concord in reference to all our fellow Christians! May the
   Lord of Peace grant us this! Thus, you see, the peace which is here
   spoken

   of has many sides to it. May you possess it in all its forms, modes,
   and phases--and may your spirit enter into the peace of God which
   passes all understanding!

   II. Now, secondly, let us note THE SPECIAL DESIRABLENESS OF PEACE. It
   is a very great thing for a soul to

   realize perfect peace, for if it does not do so, it must miss the joy,
   comfort and blessedness of the Christian life. God never meant His
   children to be like thistledown, blown about with every breath, nor as
   a football, hurled to and fro by every foot. He meant us to be a happy,
   restful, established people. The cattle eat the grass, but they are not
   fattened till they lie down and ruminate in peace--the Lord makes His
   people to feed and to lie down in quietness.

   You do not know the Gospel, dear Friends, if you have not obtained
   peace through it! Peace is the juice, the essence, the soul of the
   Gospel! Doctrines are clusters, but you have never trod them in the
   winepress--you have never quaffed the flowing juice of their grapes if
   you have not peacefully considered Divine Truth in the quiet of your
   heart. Without peace you cannot grow! A shepherd may find good pasture
   for his flock, but if his sheep are hunted about by wild dogs, so that
   they cannot rest, they will become mere skin and bones. The Lord's
   lambs cannot grow if they are worried and harried-- they must enjoy the
   rest wherewith the Lord makes the weary to rest.

   If your soul is always sighing, moaning and questioning its interest in
   Christ. If you are always in suspense as to what doctrine is true and
   what is false. If there is nothing established and settled about you,
   you will never come to the fullness of the stature of a man in Christ
   Jesus. Neither without peace can you bear much fruit, if any. If a tree
   is frequently transplanted you cannot reasonably look for many golden
   apples upon its boughs. The man who has no root-hold--who neither
   believes, nor grasps, nor enjoys the Gospel--can never know what it is
   to be steadfast and unmovable. And neither will he be always abounding
   in the work of the Lord.

   We know, too, some who, because they have no conscious peace with God,
   lack all stability and are the prey of error. That doctrine can soon be
   driven out of a man's head which affords no light and comfort to his
   heart. If you derive no sweetness from what you believe, I should not
   marvel if you soon begin to doubt it. The power of the Gospel is its
   best evidence to the soul--a man always believes in that which he
   enjoys. Only make a Truth of God to be a man's spiritual food--let it
   be marrow and fatness to him--and I guarantee you he will believe it.
   When the Truth of God becomes to a proud carnal mind what the manna
   became to murmuring Israel, namely, light bread that his soul abhors,
   then the puffed up intellect cries after something more pleasing to the
   flesh!

   But to the mind which hungers and thirsts after righteousness, the
   Gospel is so soul-satisfying that it never wearies of it. Brothers and
   Sisters, you must have peace for your soul's health! What a difference
   there is between a soul at peace and a soul continually tossed about! I
   have seen one man's heart like a country whose hedges are broken down,
   whose walls are laid level with the ground, where irrigation is
   neglected, where tilling has ceased, where the vines are untrimmed,
   where the fields are unplowed--and all because there is a perpetual
   sound of war in the soul--the song of peace is never heard! Such a soul
   may be likened to the Holy Land beneath Turkish rule where no man has
   rest and, consequently, the highways lie waste and the gardens are a
   desert.

   But I have seen another man's life which has grown up under the
   influence of holy peace, from whom God has kept back the wandering
   Arabs of doubt and fear--and to whom He has given a settled government
   of Grace and an establishment in steadfastness and quiet assurance and,
   lo, that man has been as the land which flows with milk and honey! As
   war spends and peace gathers the riches of nations, so does inward
   strife devour us, while spiritual peace makes the soul fat. Even as
   Palestine, when it abounded in corn and wine and oil, could nourish
   Tyre and Sidon, which it borders, even so does the man who is rich
   towards God, through internal peace, become a feeder of other souls
   till even they who are but borderers upon Immanuel's land obtain a
   blessing!

   Beloved, I would that every Christian knew this soul-enriching peace to
   the fullest! I am sorry to meet with so many who "hope" they are
   Believers, and "trust" they are saved, but they are not sure. Ah,
   Brothers and Sisters, in these matters we must get beyond mere hopes!
   We must reach to certainties. "Ifs" and "buts" are terrible in the
   things which concern the soul and eternity! We must have plain and
   unquestionable security here--Divine security applied to the soul,
   itself, by the Holy Spirit. Friend, you are either saved this morning
   or you are not saved! Either you are in the love of God, or you are
   not! Either you are secure of Heaven, or you are not--one of the two! I
   beseech you, do not let these things be in jeopardy--chance anything
   rather than your soul! Cry mightily to God that you may have these
   things fixed,

   certain, positive, beyond all dispute--for then shall your soul enjoy
   peace with God--and so shall you become strong, useful and happy.

   III. Now, thirdly, we shall get into the very heart of our text while
   we consider for a minute or two THE ONLY PERSON FROM WHOM THIS PEACE
   MUST COME--"Now the Lord of Peace Himself give you peace." Who is this
   "Lord of Peace" but the Lord Jesus, the Prince of Peace, born into the
   world when there was peace all over the world? It was but a little
   interval in which the gates of the temple of war were closed, and lo,
   Jesus came to Bethlehem and angels sang, "Peace on earth." He came to
   establish an empire of peace which shall be universal and under whose
   influence they shall hang the useless helmet high and study war no
   more.

   "The Prince of Peace!" How blessed is the title! So was it written of
   old by Isaiah, and Paul, the true successor of Isaiah, changing but a
   word, now speaks of, "the Lord of Peace." This is He who, being in
   Himself essential peace, undertook to be the Father's great Ambassador.
   And having made peace by the blood of His Cross, ended the strife
   between man and his offended Maker. This is He who is our Peace--who
   has made Jew and Gentile one--and has broken down the middle wall of
   partition which stood between us. This is the Lord who, when He stood
   in the midst of His disciples, gave them peace by saying, "Peace be
   unto you." And this is He, who, in His departure, made His last will
   and testament and wrote therein this grand legacy--"Peace I leave with
   you, My peace I give unto you; not as the world gives give I unto you."
   This is that Lord of Peace to whom it is part of His Nature and office
   to give peace!

   I want to call particular attention to the Apostle's words in this
   place. He does not say, "May the Lord of Peace send His angel to give
   you peace." It were a great mercy if He did and we might be as glad as
   Jacob was at Mahanaim, when the angels of God met him. He does not even
   say, "May the Lord of Peace send His minister to give you peace." If He
   did we might be as happy as Abraham when Melchizedek refreshed him with
   bread and wine. He does not even say, "May the Lord of Peace at the
   communion table, or in reading the Word, or in prayer, or in some other
   sacred exercise give you peace." In all these we might well be as
   refreshed as Israel was at Elim where wells and palm trees gladdened
   the tribes. But, no, he says, "the Lord of Peace Himself give you
   peace," as if He, alone, in His own Person, could give peace, and as if
   His Presence were the sole means of such a Divine Peace as he desires.
   "The Lord of Peace Himself give you peace."

   The words are inexpressibly sweet to me. If you will think, for a
   minute, you will see that we never obtain peace except from the Lord,
   Himself. What, after all, in your worst times will bring you peace? I
   will tell you. "This Man shall be the peace." To me it has often
   afforded great peace to think of His mysterious Person. He is a Man
   tempted in all points like as I am, a Man who knows every grief of the
   soul and every pain of the body--therefore His tender sympathy and
   power to succor. Have you not often derived peace from that sweet
   reflection? You know you have! His Person, then, is a source of peace.

   And have you not been rested in your soul by meditating upon His death?
   You have viewed Him wounded, bleeding, dying on the tree--and,
   insensibly to yourself--a wondrous calm has stolen over your heart and
   you have felt pacified concerning all things. Yes, Jesus is, Himself,
   that bundle of myrrh and spice from which peace flows like a sweet
   perfume! When He comes very near your heart and lays bare His wounds,
   and speaks His love home to you, making you feel its Divine fervency.
   When He assures you that you are one with Him, united to Him in an
   everlasting wedlock which knows of no divorce--then it is that your
   soul is steeped in peace! This is an experimental business and no mere
   words can express it. "The Lord of Peace Himself give you peace"--this,
   I say, He does mainly by manifesting Himself to the heart of His
   servants.

   Then notice that the text says, "give you peace," not merely offer it
   to you, or argue with you that you ought to have peace, or show you the
   grounds of peace, but, "give you peace." He has the power to breathe
   peace into the heart, to create peace in the soul and lull the spirit
   into that sweet sleep of the beloved which is the peculiar gift of
   Heaven. "I will give you rest," He said, and He can and will do it.
   "The Lord be with you all"--as much as to say, "That is what I mean." I
   pray that Jesus may be with you, for if He is present, you must enjoy
   peace! Let the sea rage and let every timber of the ship be
   strained--yes, let her leak till between each timber there yawns a
   hungry mouth to swallow you up--yet when Jesus arises He will rebuke
   the winds and the waves, and there will be a great calm! "It is I, be
   not afraid," is enough to create peace at once. May you always know
   this peace which Jesus, alone, can give.

   IV. Now I must conclude with the fourth head which is a consideration
   of THE SWEEP OF THE PRAYER--"The Lord of Peace Himself give you peace
   always." What? Always at peace? Yes, that is what the Apostle desires
   for you. May

   you have peace given you always. "Well, Sir, I feel very happy on the
   Sabbath. I have such peace that I wish I could have a week of Sundays."
   May the Lord Himself give you peace always, on all the weekdays as well
   as on Sundays. "Truly, I have been very happy of late," says one, "God
   has prospered us and everyone has been very loving in the family. But I
   do not know how I should be if I had an awkward husband and unruly
   children."

   Sister, I will tell you what I want you to be--I would have you restful
   under all circumstances-- "The Lord of Peace give you peace always." "I
   enjoy such peace in the Prayer Meeting," says one. I want you to have
   peace in the workshop, also. "I have peace when I get alone with my
   Bible," cries another. We pray that you may have equal peace when you
   are troubled with the ledger, tired with those unpaid bills, dull trade
   and all the crosscurrents of business. You need peace always. Our
   Friends who are commonly called Quakers have, as a rule, set us a fine
   example of calm, dignified quietness and peace. How undisturbed they
   generally appear! Whatever they fail in, they certainly excel in a
   certain peacefulness of manner which I hope is the index of calm
   enjoyed within.

   Numbers of professors are very fretful, excitable, agitated, hasty and
   fickle. It should not be so, Brothers and Sisters--you ought to have
   more weight about you, more Grace, more solidity. Your soul's affairs
   are all right, are they not? All is right forever--everything is
   signed, sealed, and delivered--the Covenant is ordered in all things
   and sure, and everything is in Divine hands for our good. Well, then,
   why not let us be as happy as the angels are? Why are we troubled? Is
   there anything worth shedding a tear for, now that all is well for
   eternity? Our lack of peace arises from the fact that we have not
   realized the fullness of our text. "The Lord of Peace Himself give you
   peace always." He can always give you peace, for He never changes!
   There is always the same reason for peace. You may always go to Him for
   peace and He is always ready to bestow it. Oh that we might always
   possess it!

   Notice, again, it is written--"May the Lord of Peace Himself give you
   peace always by all means." Can He give us peace by all means? I know
   He can give us peace by some means, but can all means be made
   subservient to this end? Some agencies evidently work towards peace,
   but can He give us peace by opposing forces? Yes, certainly! He can
   give peace by the bitter as well as by the sweet! He can give peace by
   the storm as well as by the calm! He can give peace by loss as well as
   by gain, by death as well as by life!

   Notice there are two grand ways of giving us peace--one is by taking
   away all that disquiets us. Here is a man who frets because he does not
   make money, or because he has lost much of his wealth. Suppose the Lord
   takes away from him all covetousness, all greed of gain, all love of
   the world--is he not, at once, filled with peace? He is at peace not
   because he has more money, but because he has less of grasping desires.
   Another man is very ambitious. He wants to be somebody. He must be
   great and yet he never will be and, therefore, he is restless. Suppose
   the Grace of God should humble him and take away his lofty aspirations
   so that he only wishes to be and to do what the Lord wills? Do you not
   see how readily he rests?

   Another man has an angry temper and is soon put out--the Lord does not
   alter the people that are round about him, but He changes the man,
   himself--makes him quiet, ready to forgive and of a gentle spirit. What
   peace the man now feels! Another person has had an envious eye--he did
   not like to see others prosper--and if others were better off than he,
   he always thought badly of them. The Lord wrings that bitter drop of
   envy out of his heart and now see how peaceful he is--he is glad to see
   others advanced and if he is tried, himself, it helps to make him happy
   to think that others are more favored. It is a great blessing when the
   Lord removes the disturbing elements from the heart!

   Even curiosity may be a source of unrest. Many are a great deal worried
   by curiosity. I have sometimes wanted to know why the Lord does this
   and that with me. Blessed be His name, I am resolved not to question
   Him any more in that fashion! Somebody prayed the other day that I
   might see the reason why the Lord has lately afflicted me. I hope the
   Brother will not pray that any more, for I do not want to know the
   Lord's reasons--why should I? I know He has done right and I will not
   dishonor Him by catechizing Him and wanting Him to explain Himself to a
   poor worm. This is where the mischief has been with most of us--that we
   have needed to see how this and that can be right. Why should we? If
   God conceals a thing, let us be anxious to keep it concealed.

   A servant was passing through a street with a dish that was curiously
   covered. There met him a fellow who said, "I am most anxious to know
   what your lord has put in that dish, for he has so carefully covered
   it." But the servant said, "Therefore should you not desire to know,
   for seeing my lord has so carefully covered it, it is clear that it is
   no business of

   yours." So whenever a Providence puzzles you, take it as a sign that
   the Lord does not mean you to understand it--and be content to take it
   upon faith. When curiosity and other restless things are gone, peace is
   enjoyed.

   Then the Lord has ways of giving us peace by making discoveries of
   Himself. Some of you do not know, as yet, the things which would give
   you peace. For instance, if you did but know that He loved you from
   before the foundation of the world and that whom once He loves, He
   never leaves, you who are now afraid that you have fallen from Grace
   would obtain strong consolation! Yes, and if you understood the grand
   doctrine of the Divine Predestination and saw that the Lord will not
   fail nor be discouraged, nor turn aside from one jot or tittle of His
   purpose, then you would see how you, poor insignificant Believers
   though you are, are one stitch in the great fabric that must not be
   suffered to drop or else the whole fabric would be marred! You would
   understand how the eternal purpose ordered in wisdom and backed up with
   Sovereign power guarantees your salvation as much as it does the Glory
   of God--and so you would have peace.

   Many a soul has not the peace it might have because it does not fully
   understand the atoning blood. The great doctrine of Substitution is not
   seen in all its length and breadth by some minds. But when they come to
   see Christ standing in the place of His chosen, made sin for them and
   the chosen standing in Christ's place, "the righteousness of God in
   Him," then will their peace be like a river! The grand Truth of the
   union of the saints with Christ, if it is once understood, what a means
   of peace it is! He that believes in Christ is one with Him, a member of
   His body, of His flesh and of His bones! He is one with Christ by
   eternal and indissoluble union, even as the Father is One with the Son!
   If this is known, together with the doctrine of the Covenant, the
   attribute of immutability, the eternal purpose and the marriage union
   between Christ and His elect, deep peace must be enjoyed, like the calm
   of Heaven, like the bliss of immortality!

   But there are some to whom this peace cannot come, some concerning whom
   the Lord says "What have you to do with peace?" "There is no peace,
   says my God, unto the wicked." Your works, your prayers, your
   repentances--none of these can bring you peace! As for the world and
   the pleasures thereof, they are destructive to all hope of peace. Come
   this day and believe in the great Sacrifice which God, Himself, has
   prepared in the Person of His crucified Son! Come look into Emanuel's
   face and read where peace is to be found! Come to the great gash in
   Jesus' side and see the cleft of the rock where God's elect abide in
   peace! Trust in Jesus and you shall begin a peace which shall widen and
   deepen into the peace of God which passes all understanding, which
   shall keep your hearts and minds by Christ Jesus. Amen.

The Student's Prayer

   (No. 1344)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Make me to understand the way of Your precepts: so shall I talk of
   Your wondrous works." Psalm 119:27.

   WHEN we seek any good thing from God, we ought, also, to consider how
   we may use it for His Glory. It is right that desires for good things
   should flow from good motives. When the heart is not only gracious but
   grateful, it will turn to God with doable purpose, desiring the mercy
   and desiring to use it to His praise. The Grace of God, which brings
   salvation, marvelously whets the appetite for good things--it does
   more, it provokes an intense anxiety to glorify God's name in the
   world--even before it has imparted the ability to do any good thing.
   Vehement passion and abject helplessness meeting together and
   struggling in the breast, often lead to despondency, but they ought far
   rather to stimulate prayer.

   As soon as we are saved by Grace we are eager after supplies for our
   soul's needs. "As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word,
   that you may grow thereby." This is the first stage of spiritual
   childhood, like the infant who cries for the bottle and takes its
   little fill and feasts, all to itself and all for itself. There follows
   on this another yearning, a desire for fellowship with the saints,
   although we feel too weak and too foolish to enter into such good
   company as we take the older disciples to be, or even to talk to them.
   But I will tell you what we can do. We may all venture to ask the Lord
   to instruct us and make us understand His ways, so that our
   conversation may be welcome to His people--and so He will! "Therefore
   comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as, also, you
   do." This is the second stage of development.

   Then comes a third grade and come, it surely will, if you follow on to
   know the Lord. "Then will I teach transgressors Your ways; and sinners
   shall be converted unto You." Speak, my Brothers and Sisters, on this
   wise--"You have told me, O my God, to earnestly covet the best gifts. I
   do covet them, Lord, You know, not to consume them upon my lusts, but
   to use them for Your service. I will gladly accept Your talents as a
   trust, not to trifle with them, not to vaunt them as the toys of my
   vanity, but, by Your Grace, as a wise and faithful steward to bring You
   all the profit and all the interest, for I am greedy to get gain out of
   all those endowments You entrust to my care." "Make me to understand
   the way of Your precepts: so shall I talk of Your wondrous works."

   I would have you further observe, on the threshold of our meditation,
   that there is not really any grave duty a man can be called on to
   discharge, no responsible office he may be elected to fill, nor even
   any plan or purpose he lays on his heart to accomplish which does not
   require diligent preparation on his own part to fit himself, to train
   his faculties and to discipline his mind. What you call unskilled labor
   may possibly be utilized by efficient officers, but unskillful labor is
   a sheer waste of power. How much more imperative the demand that we
   should be endowed with the requisite faculties and qualified by
   suitable instruction if we have any work to do for God, or any office,
   however humble, in the service of the great King!

   Zeal without knowledge would only betray us into reckless presumption.
   When called to talk of God's wondrous works, we ought not to rush upon
   that exercise unfitted and unprepared, but we should wait upon the
   Lord, that the eyes of our understanding may be enlightened, that our
   stammering tongues may be unloosed and that our lips may be attuned to
   tell the noble tale in grateful strains. We must first obtain for
   ourselves an understanding of the way of the Lord's precepts before we
   can make it plain to others. He who tries to teach, but has never been
   taught himself, will make a sorry mess of it. He who has no
   understanding and yet wants to make others understand, must assuredly
   fail! Some there are who cannot teach and will not learn--and it is
   because they will not learn that they cannot teach.

   I believe aptness for being taught is at the bottom of aptness to
   teach. The Psalmist had both. He says, "Make me to understand the way
   of Your statutes." There he would be taught. "Then," he says, "I shall
   talk of Your wondrous

   works." There he would be teaching. In pondering the text, it has
   appeared to me to set forth three things. First, the prayer of a
   student. Secondly, the occupation of a scholar. And thirdly, the
   intimate relation there is between them.

   I. I see in it A STUDENT'S PRAYER. I hope, my beloved Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ, that we are all students in the school of
   Christ--all disciples or scholars--and I trust we shall adopt the
   student's prayer as our own--"Make me to understand the way of Your
   precepts." You know that prayer is to study what fire is to the
   sacrifice. I beseech you, therefore, join heartily in the petition of
   the text.

   The student's prayer deals with the main subject of the conversation
   which is to be that student's occupation, namely, the way of God's
   precepts. You and I, Brothers, have to teach those things which relate
   to the counsels and commandments of the Lord. It is not our province to
   guide men in politics or to tutor them in science. Those things are
   better taught by men of mark, whose time and attention are absorbed in
   those profound and laborious researches. As for us who are Christians
   and servants of Christ, our business is to teach men the things of God.
   To that one topic we do well to keep, both for our own good and for the
   good of others. If we have many studies to engage us, our thoughts will
   soon be scattered--and if we multiply our pursuits, we shall be
   incapable of concentrating all our energies upon the grand topic which
   Divine Wisdom has selected for us--"the way of Your precepts."

   In the way of God's legal precepts we have great need of sound
   understanding, that we may be competent to instruct others. It is well
   to be initiated in the Law, to discern its wonderful comprehensiveness,
   spirituality and severity. We need to know the way of the Law--a way
   too hard to be trod by any mortal man so as to win salvation. It is
   well to survey the way of the Lord's precepts to see how exceedingly
   broad and yet, at the same time, how remarkably narrow they are. "Your
   commandment is exceedingly broad," and yet, "strait is the gate and
   narrow is the way which leads unto life and few there are that go in
   there."

   It is well for us to know exactly what the Law teaches and what the Law
   designs--why we were made subject to its prescript, and how we may be
   delivered from its penalties. Great need, too, have we to understand
   the way of God's Gospel precepts--what these precepts are--"repent,"
   "believe," "be converted" and the like. We need to be able to see their
   relation, where they stand, not as means to an end, but as results of
   Divine Grace--commands but yet promises-- the duty of man but yet the
   gift of God! Happy is that preacher and teacher who understands the way
   of the Gospel precepts and never lets them clash with the precepts of
   the Law, so as to teach a mingle-mangle, half Law and half Gospel.
   Happy is he who knows the way of God's legal precepts and sees them all
   ablaze with Divine wrath on account of sin--and discerns the way of the
   Gospel precepts--can see them all bright and yet all crimson with the
   precious blood of Him that opened up for us the way of acceptance!

   The way of God's precepts! Does not that mean that we ought to be
   acquainted with the relative position which the precepts occupy? For it
   is very easy, Brothers, unless God gives us understanding, to preach up
   one precept to the neglect of another! It is possible for a ministry
   and a teaching to be lopsided and those who follow it may become rather
   the caricatures of Christianity than Christians harmoniously
   proportioned. O Lord, what foolish creatures we are! When You exhort us
   one way, we run to such an extreme that we forget that You have given
   us any other counsel than that which is just now ringing in our ears!

   We have known some commanded to be humble who have bowed down till they
   have become timorous and desponding. We have known others exhorted to
   be confident who have gone far beyond a modest courage and grown so
   presumptuous that they have presently fallen into gross transgressions.
   Is fidelity to the truth your cardinal virtue? Take heed of being
   uncharitable! Is love to God and man your highest aspiration? Beware
   lest you become the dupe of false apostles and foul hypocrites! Have
   you clad yourself with zeal as with a garment? Take care, now, lest by
   one act of indiscretion your garment should be rolled in blood.

   Oh, how easy it is to exaggerate a virtue until it becomes a vice! A
   man may look to himself, examine himself and scrutinize all his actions
   and motives till he becomes deplorably selfish! Or, on the other hand,
   a man may look to others, counseling them and cautioning them,
   preaching to them and praying for them till he grows oblivious of his
   own estate, degenerates into hypocrisy and discovers, to his surprise,
   that his own heart is not right with God. There is a "way" about the
   precepts--there is a chime about them in which every bell gives out its
   note and makes up a tune. There is a mixture, as of old, of the
   anointing oil--so much of this and that and the other and, if any
   ingredient were left out, the oil would lose its perfect aroma. So is
   there an anointing of the holy life in which there is precept upon
   precept skillfully

   mingled, delicately infused, gratefully blended and Grace given to keep
   each of these precepts and so the life becomes sweet like an ointment
   most precious unto the Lord. God grant us each, if we are to teach
   others--and I hope we shall all try to do that--to understand the way
   of His precepts!

   As a prayer, too, this must certainly mean, "Make me understand the way
   to keep Your precepts." It is not in human strength, for he that keeps
   the precepts of God must be kept by the God of the precepts. To keep
   the precepts we must keep Him in the heart who gave the precepts and
   whose life is the best exemplification of them. O Lord, teach us the
   way to observe and to do Your commands! Give us humble, dependent
   hearts receptive of the sweet influences of Your Spirit, that we may
   understand the way in which those precepts are to be kept. Does it not
   signify-- "Lord, make me to understand the Christian life, for that is
   the way of Your precepts"?

   Dear Friends, if you are teachers of others, you must be experimentally
   acquainted with the Christian life! You must know the great doctrines
   which support it and furnish motives for it--the great doctrines which
   are the pavement of the road along which the Christian travels. You
   must know the practical precepts, themselves--what they are and how the
   Lord has worded them for each circumstance and each age of the
   Christian life. You must know the doctrinal and the practical--and you
   must know the experimental--he is no preacher of any value who cannot
   tell the way of God's precepts by having experienced that way! He must
   have felt the joy of running in it--having taken the precepts and been
   guided by them so as to have proved that "in keeping of them there is
   great reward."

   Yes, and he will be none the worse teacher if he has a lively memory of
   the bitterness that comes of having wandered from those commandments,
   for he can tell the sinner, with the tears starting in his own eyes,
   that he who wanders from the way of obedience will miss the paths of
   peace, for the way of God's commandments is exceedingly pleasant, but
   they that break the hedge and follow their own will shall find that
   their willfulness entails upon them grievous sorrow and sore pain. This
   is what we need to understand the way of God's precepts. Let the prayer
   go up to Heaven, especially from every young Brother who is hoping to
   preach the Word before long, "Make me to understand the way of Your
   precepts."

   Very obviously a confession is here implied. "Make me to understand the
   way of Your precepts." It means just this. "Lord, I do not understand
   it. I am ignorant and foolish and if I follow my own judgment--if I
   take to my own thinking, I shall be sure to go wrong. Lord, make me to
   understand." It is a confession of a good man who may understand a
   great deal, but feels that he does not understand all. In this
   learning, he who understands most is the man who thinks he understands
   least. He who has the clearest knowledge of Divine things is the very
   one to feel that there is a boundless ocean far beyond his observation
   and he cries "Make me to understand the way of Your precepts." It is a
   confession which should be made because it is intensely felt--the
   consciousness of folly and ignorance forcing the confession to the
   lips.

   Our student's prayer asks a great gift when he says, "Make me to
   understand." This is something more than, "Make me to know." He had
   said just before--"Teach me Your statutes." Every Christian needs this
   teaching for his own sake, but he that is to be an instructor of others
   must especially enquire for a thorough understanding. You Sunday school
   teachers who take the oversight of the children. You elders of the
   Church who look after enquirers and help them to the Savior--you both
   must not be satisfied with knowing--you must understand. A superficial
   acquaintance with the Scriptures will not suffice for your important
   office. Your mind must penetrate into the deeper meaning, the hidden
   treasures of wisdom. "Make me to understand."

   A catechism may supply right answers, but we need the living Teacher to
   give us true perceptions. Intelligence is not a faculty of babies--in
   understanding you must be men! Young pupils soon lose confidence in
   their teacher if he does not seem up to the mark. I heard two
   schoolboys talking of their teacher the other day. Says one, "I don't
   think he knows much more than we do." "Well, he always has to look at
   the book before he can tell us anything, doesn't he?" said the other
   little chap. Just now, as I came along, I watched two babies trying to
   carry another baby a little smaller than themselves and they all three
   rolled down together! It is pretty to see little children anxious to
   help their little brother, but when the father comes up, he lifts all
   three and carries them with ease.

   We have not many fathers, but every Christian man should aspire to that
   honorable and valuable estate in the Church. The wisdom that comes of
   experience leads up to it. "Make me to understand." Oh Lord, the
   children are pleased with the flowers, help me to spy out the roots!
   Take me into the secrets, let me know the deep things of God! Help me
   to discriminate! Enable me to judge and weigh and ponder--and so to
   understand! Such reasons as You give, enable

   me to comprehend. Where You give no reason, teach my reason to feel
   that there must be the best of reasons for no reasons having been
   given! So make me to understand what can be understood and to
   understand that what I cannot understand is just as reliable as what I
   do understand. In understanding I can never find You out, O God, to
   perfection. In Your sight I must still be a baby, though towards my
   fellow Christians I may be a man. "Make me to understand."

   I love to meet with those of the Lord's people who have had their
   senses exercised in Divine things and their intelligence matured. For
   the most part, we find disciples like babies, unskillful in the Word of
   Righteousness, using milk because unable to digest strong meat. Thank
   God for the babies! Pray God they may soon grow and develop into men!
   He who knows that he is a sinner and that Christ Jesus is his Savior,
   knows enough to save him. But we have no wish to perpetuate
   childishness. The spelling book is essential as a primer, but not the
   spelling book forever! A B C must not be sung forever in wearisome
   monotone! Nor must, "Only believe," become the everlasting song!

   Are there not other Truths of God deeper and higher? There is the grand
   analogy of the faith! There is the doctrine of the Covenant! There is
   the doctrine of Election! There is the doctrine of the Union of the
   saints with Jesus Christ! These are the deep things of God and I think
   we should pray, "Make me, Lord, to understand them." Yet the best
   understanding is that which aims at personal holiness. "Make me to
   understand the way of Your precepts." Lord, if I cannot grapple with
   doctrine, let me know which is the right way for me to take in my daily
   life. If sometimes Your Truth staggers me and I cannot see where this
   Truth of God squares with that, yet Lord grant that integrity and
   uprightness may preserve me! So make me to know and understand the way
   of Your statutes that if I am tempted and the Tempter come as an angel
   of light, I may so understand the difference between a true angel of
   light and the mock angel of light that I may not be taken in the snare.
   "Make me to understand the way of Your statutes." May my eyes be keen
   to know the right in all its tangles. May I follow the silken clue of
   uprightness where it seems to wind and twist. Give Your servant such a
   clear understanding of what Israel ought to do and of what he, himself,
   ought to do as a part of Israel, that he may never miss his way.

   This is the best kind of understanding in all the world. The Psalmist
   appeals to the Fountain of all wisdom, the Source from where all
   knowledge springs. Who can put wisdom in the inward parts but the Lord?
   Or who can give understanding to the heart but God Most High? Our
   parents and our Sunday school teachers taught us the rudiments while we
   were supple and pliant with tender age. We thank them much and we
   esteem them highly. Yet they could only teach the Law and imprint, if
   possible, the letter of it on our memory, although even that we often
   repeated and as often forgot. It is the Lord that teaches us to profit
   by the Divine Spirit. How very wonderfully the Lord teaches us! Some
   lessons have to be whipped into us--well, He does not spare the rod for
   our crying! Other lessons can only be burnt into us as with a hot iron.

   Some of us can bless the Lord that we bear in our body the prints of
   the Lord Jesus, that He branded His Truth into our very flesh and bones
   so that we cannot, now, miss it, but must understand it. Into what
   strange places God will put His children! You have heard of colleges
   called by odd names--Brasen-nose and the like--but the most amazing
   college I ever heard of was the whale's belly! Jonah would never have
   bowed himself to Sovereign Grace had he not been cast into the deep,
   compassed about with floods and overwhelmed with billows and waves. But
   the soundness of his doctrine was very palpable in the voice of his
   thanksgiving, for as soon as he came out of the whale's belly, he said,
   "Salvation is of the Lord"! A must college for a Prophet!

   But we may be content to leave the college to God and, if we are, like
   Joseph, sold into Egypt, or like the Hebrew children, carried captive
   into Babylon, or wherever it may be--so long as He makes us to
   understand the way of His precepts we may be well content! Christ
   taught only three of His 12 Apostles upon Tabor, but 11 of them in
   Gethsemane. Some, though favored much with high joys, learn more by
   deep sorrows. He takes but three of them into the chamber where He
   raises the dead girl, for all His wonders are not to be seen by all His
   followers. But they may all behold Him on the Cross and learn the sweet
   wonders of His dying love!

   I would not be satisfied, dear Brothers and Sisters, without trying to
   understand all that can be understood of the love of Jesus Christ and
   of all those precious Truths that make up the way of God's precepts. He
   is a poor scholar who does not wish to learn more than lies within the
   bare compass of his task--a good pupil will try to get as much as he
   can out of his teacher. Be it your resolve and mine always to be
   learning! Let us never be content to lightly skim the wave or

   gently sip the river's brim. Rather let us delight ourselves with
   diving into the clear stream of knowledge! Revelation invites research
   and it unfolds its choice stores only to those who search for them as
   for hidden treasures.

   Oh, my God! I long to glean, to gather, to gain knowledge! I would
   gladly yield up every hour I have to sit at Your feet! To You I would
   surrender every faculty I have that I may be learning. By the ear, by
   the eye, by the taste would I imbibe instruction! Yes, and in every
   season of recreation I would inhale the fragrance of Your wondrous
   works. And when I seek repose I would lean my head upon Your bosom that
   I may learn Your love by the touch as well as by every other sense. May
   each gate of Mansoul be filled with the traffic of the precious
   merchandise of heavenly knowledge. And, Lord, I would open the inmost
   depth of my soul that Your light may shine into the most secret parts
   of my nature. Oh, hear my cry! Make me to understand the way of Your
   precepts!

   II. Now, dear Friends, let us pass on to notice, in the next place, THE
   OCCUPATION OF THE INSTRUCTED

   MAN. When the Lord has taught a man the way of His precepts, it
   behooves him to rightly use his sacred privileges-- "So shall I talk of
   Your wondrous works." As a faithful teacher, let him testify of God's
   works--His wondrous works. It is a sorry sermon that is all about man's
   works, especially if the preacher makes out our good works to be
   something very remarkable. We are to preach not man's works, but God's
   works--not our own works, but the works of our great Substitute!

   There are two works, especially, that you Christian people must talk
   about to others--the work of Christ for us and the work of the Holy
   Spirit in us. These are themes that will never be exhausted. The work
   of God the Son for us in His life and death, Resurrection and
   Ascension--His intercession at the right hand of God and His second
   advent--what a theme is before you here! How great are the works of
   Christ on our behalf! Preach His Substitution emphatically. Let there
   be no mistake about that! Let it be told that Christ stood in the place
   of His people and lived and died for them!

   Moreover, there is the work of the Holy Spirit in us--the vital
   interest and importance of which it would not be possible to
   exaggerate. I should not like any man to try and talk about this Divine
   ministry unless he has been brought under its power and been led, by
   experience, to understand it--the work of conviction, the work of
   regeneration, the work of emptying, humbling and bringing down--the
   work of leading to repentance and to faith, the work of sanctification,
   the work of daily sustenance of the Divine Life, the work of perfecting
   the soul for Heaven! There is plenty of room for blundering, here, if
   God does not make you understand the way of His precepts! But if you
   have a good clear knowledge of what Christian life is, then, my dear
   Brothers and Sisters, always be dwelling on these two things--what the
   Lord has done for us and what the Lord is doing in us when He brings us
   out of darkness into His marvelous light!

   The wonderful character of these works of God opens up a study on which
   the devout mind can discuss with ever awakening emotions of awe and
   delight! There are a few things in the world that men may wonder at.
   They used to speak of the seven wonders of the world. I believe that
   there is not one of those seven wonders which some have not ceased to
   wonder at. If you see them a sufficient number of times you get
   accustomed to them and the wonder evaporates. But the works of the
   Lord, and these two works especially, you may think on them, meditate
   upon them, inspect them, enjoy them every day of a long life and the
   result will be, not a decrease, but an increase of your wonder! "Your
   wondrous works!"

   God Incarnate in the Son of Mary! Wondrous work, this! God in the
   carpenter's shop! The Son of God driving nails and handling a hammer!
   Wondrous work, this! Jesus at the loom, weaving a righteousness for His
   people, casting His soul into every throw of the shuttle and producing
   such a matchless fabric for the wedding dress of His own chosen bride
   that all the angels in Heaven stand still and gaze at it and marvel how
   such a fabric was worked! Behold Him--God, Himself, in human
   flesh--dying, bearing human sin with a condescension that is wonderful
   beyond all wonder! Behold Him casting all that sin into the depth of
   the sea, with wondrous might of merit, which drowned it in the
   bottomless abyss forever! Wondrous work, that!

   Then see Him going forth again, discharged from all His suretyship
   engagements, having paid the debt. And behold Him nailing the
   handwriting of the ordinances that were against us to His Cross! Oh,
   wondrous work! One might talk of it by night and day and never weary.
   View Him rising as our Representative, guaranteeing life to us! See Him
   climbing the skies and casting a largesse of mercies among rebellious
   men. Consider the influence of His mediatorial authority, the power
   committed to Him by His Father, for He has power given Him over all
   flesh, that He may give eternal life to as many as the Father gave Him.

   Listen, listen to His pleading as the Priest upon the Throne! What
   wondrous work is that! Still through the apocalyptic vista gaze--gaze
   on all the glories of the future when He shall come to reign upon the
   earth! There you have new fields of light breaking on your ravished
   view--fresh incentives to wonder, admire and worship! And what shall I
   say of these wondrous works which seem so near and so familiar to our
   observation and yet baffle our investigation, till the more we
   scrutinize them the more amazement we feel? The Church in the world
   kept alive from generation to generation by One whose Presence was
   promised, was bestowed and is now felt and proved by the saints--the
   blessed Paraclete, the Comforter whom Jesus sent from the Father! By
   His agency long seasons of drought and despondency have been ever and
   again succeeded by times of refreshing from the Presence of the Lord by
   revivals and renewals of signs and wonders such as began but did not
   end in the day of Pentecost!

   I never know which to wonder at most--God in human flesh, the Incarnate
   Son--or the Holy Spirit dwelling in man! The indwelling is as wonderful
   as the Incarnation! Let every Gospel teacher yield up his own soul to
   the wonder and gratitude which these works of God are fitted to
   inspire. I like to see the preacher, when he is talking about these
   things, look like a man wonderstruck, gazing forth on a vast expanse,
   lost in immensity! As if he were far out at sea, trembling with
   adoration! As if the chords of his nature vibrated to the mystery and
   awe that encircle him. There are lovely traces of God's transcendent
   skill in things minute when peered at through a microscope--but these
   wondrous works of God are of another order! They display His grander
   power!

   Tell not the old, old story as if it had grown trite and trifling in
   your ears and tripped from off your tongue. Listen to the slow deep
   mellow voice of the mighty ocean of Grace until your soul faints within
   you! Then speak in tones of strong emotion like those of Paul--"O the
   depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
   unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out!" Yet it
   becomes you to speak very plainly. See how it is put. "I will talk of
   Your wondrous works." Talk is the simplest mode of speech. You cannot
   all preach, but you can all talk and, if some preachers would refrain
   from rhetoric and tell their plain unvarnished tale, they would succeed
   better than they do now.

   Do you think that God meant His ministers to kill themselves in order
   come out on Sundays with one or two splendid displays of "intellect"
   and eloquence? Surely this is not God's way of doing things! I do not
   believe that Paul ever preached a fine sermon, or that Peter ever
   dreamed of any display of intellect. I asked, the other day, of one who
   had heard a sermon, if it was likely that sinners would be converted by
   it. He said, "Oh no! By no means! But it was an intellectual treat." Is
   there anywhere in the Bible a word about intellectual treats, or
   anything approximating to such an

   idea?

   Is there not a country on the other side of the sea where they are
   attempting fine flashy oratory sermons that remind you of the way in
   which they finish up the fireworks--discourses made up of blue lights
   and blazes? They call it a "peroration," I believe. But the way for the
   Christian--the real Christian--is to talk of God's wondrous works! Tell
   me the old, old story! Tell it not stately, but tell it simply, as to a
   little child! More Glory will come to God from that, more comfort to
   your soul in reflection and more benefit to the souls of those you
   teach than from all the flights of poetry or the flourishes of rounded
   periods. They that would win souls must take David's words here, and
   say, "Make me to understand the way of Your precepts." And so shall I
   give up all the "spread eagle" and, "I shall talk of Your wondrous
   works."

   "Blessed be God," said a farmer at a Prayer Meeting, "that we were fed
   last Sunday out of a low crib, for we have mostly had the fodder so
   high that we poor things could not reach it." When I heard that
   farmer's thanksgiving, I thought it very wise. When a man is instructed
   in the faith, he will often speak about these things. Such conversation
   may be frequent without being irksome. David says, "I will talk."
   Preaching is an exercise to be undertaken now and then, but talking, I
   believe, is capable of being carried on by some people very nearly
   every minute of the day. Certainly few persons account it a hardship to
   talk every day! And when God makes us to understand the way of His
   precepts, we shall have the Gospel at our fingertips so that whoever we
   meet with, we shall be able to talk to them in an earnest and simple
   style about God's salvation.

   I would, dear Friends, that our talk were always seasoned with
   salt--that our most common conversation were bedewed with heavenly
   unction, ministering Grace unto the hearers. But though very plain and
   very frequent, the good Psalmist's talk was very much to the point and
   it did not lack propriety, for he says, "So shall I talk of Your
   wondrous

   works." What does he mean? Why, according to understanding. "Make me to
   understand and then I shall talk like an intelligent man." May you,
   Brothers and Sisters, who talk about Jesus Christ be enabled to talk
   about Him in a wise way. Very serious mischief has often come from
   harping upon some one string. Some men are far more interested in
   stating their own ideals than in unfolding God's counsels. If we
   understand the way of God's precepts, acquire the language of it, get
   into the groove of it--then we shall talk with understanding--and there
   will be a harmony and a wisdom about our utterances which will be
   blessed to the edification of the hearers.

   III. We will close by noticing THE INTIMATE RELATION BETWEEN THE PRAYER
   OF THE STUDENT AND

   THE PURSUIT THAT HE SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOWED. "Make me to understand the
   way of Your precepts: so shall I talk of Your wondrous works." The
   connection lies partly in the enchantment of this knowledge and the
   passion to communicate it. A man who understands Christ and His
   mediatorial work--and the Spirit and His sanctifying work--cannot be
   silent! The fire once kindled, the flames will spread. He will be so
   transported with wonder, admiration and adoring gratitude at the great
   mercy and love of God that it will cause a fermentation within his
   breast.

   He will be like a full vessel needing vent and he must have it. As with
   a fire in his bones, he will exclaim, "Woe is me if I preach not the
   Gospel!" I would to God there were a deeper understanding of the ways
   of God, for then many silent tongues would speak. The theme, itself,
   without any remarkable gifts on the part of the man, would suffice to
   secure the attention it strongly claims. As the heart swells with
   thankfulness, the lips burst forth spontaneously into song. Doubtless
   Hannah would tell you that it was easier for a barren wife to restrain
   her tears than for a joyful mother to stifle her hymn of praise!

   Did Jesus love you when you were all forlorn? Did He find you, when a
   stranger, and prove Himself your Friend? Did He shelter you, when a
   sinner, and shield you from all harm? Did He die, that you might live?
   Do you know that Jesus is Your near kinsman and that He takes great
   delight in redeeming you for Himself? Let the truth of this but dawn on
   your heart and though your tongue were dumb before, it must now begin
   to talk--

   "Now will I tell to sinners round, What a dear Savior I have found,
   I'll point to His redeeming blood And say, 'Behold the way to God.'"
   May this stir up some of you who love the Lord and yet never talk about
   Him! May it lead you to a holy searching of heart. Surely you have not
   such an understanding of Him as you ought to have, or else sometimes
   your silence would be thawed and your words would betray your strong
   emotions. If I understand the way of God's precepts, then I shall be
   fully furnished with matter to talk of His wondrous works!

   What a dreadful thing it must be for a man to set up to be a teacher of
   others if he does not know the things of God, experimentally, himself.
   It can be done, you know, and done very cheaply. You can buy sermons
   ready lithographed and guaranteed not to have been preached within so
   many miles--for nine pence each! You can be furnished with them for 10
   shillings and sixpence a quarter. But there will be a heavy account at
   the last for the man who does that sort of thing! It is easy for you to
   teach in your class by reading the Sunday School Union notes, getting
   up the lesson and having it all in your head. Ah, but, my dear Friends,
   how will you answer for having taught children in the Sunday school
   when you have never been God's child and never have been taught of God
   yourself? "Unto the wicked God says, What have you to do to declare My
   statutes, or to take My name into your mouth?"

   Do not try to teach others what you do not understand yourself! Go down
   on your knees and cry, "Make Me to understand the way of Your precepts,
   so shall I talk of Your wondrous works." Dear Brethren, especially you
   who are to be ministers of the Gospel and have begun to preach--seek a
   deeper understanding of Divine things, or else your ministry will be
   lean and poverty-stricken. Unless you are taken into the confidence of
   God and initiated into His counsels, you cannot possibly discharge the
   solemn duties which lie upon the ambassador for Christ! Cry mightily to
   be well-filled with an understanding of the Gospel--and so shall you
   overflow to others and talk of God's wondrous works! Such sound
   education will clothe you with authority.

   A man who, in his own heart, knows what he is talking about and
   preaches what he has tasted and handled of the good Word of Grace, will
   put weight into every utterance. It matters but little what language he
   uses--the power lies not in the garnishing, but in the Truth of God,
   itself, which he proclaims! It is not the polish of his speech but the
   fervor of his soul which gives force to his persuasions. Oh, how often
   my heart has been refreshed by a humble testimony from a

   poor man who has talked only about what the Lord has done for him! What
   a power there is about experimental talk! Dry doctrine and pious
   platitudes borrowed from books fall flat on the ears and are gall to
   the taste--but he who talks of the things which he has made touching
   the King--he has a tongue like the pen of a ready writer!

   I know aged Christians who seem, every time they speak, to drop
   diamonds and emeralds from their lips. One could wish to treasure up
   every syllable they utter, not because there is anything very ingenious
   or original in any sentence, but because there is a sound of abundance
   of rain in every word. There is a Divine depth, a sacred sweetness, a
   leaping of life in each broken utterance which is born on their lips!
   You say, "That man knows more than he tells. He does not expose all his
   wares in the window. He has been in the secret place of communion. His
   face shines though his voice falters." Such teachers may you and I
   prove in our riper years, having light in ourselves and illuminating
   all who are within the range of our influence! What God has led us to
   understand, may we be the means of communicating by our ordinary
   conversation, by speech which is simple, unostentatious, yet earnest,
   faithful and heavenly-minded.

   Brothers and Sisters, not all can preach, but all can be up and doing,
   teaching others what you know! Do not try to teach them what you do not
   know. As far as you know Christ, speak about Him to your kinsfolk and
   acquaintances, your friends and neighbors. Our dear Brother and Elder,
   the late Mr. Verdon, on such a night as this would have been anxiously
   looking after any person who seemed to have heard with
   thankfulness--and he would not have suffered them to leave the place
   without accosting them in his own gentle manner and beginning to talk
   to them about Christ.

   I need some more like he! He has gone Home. I pray the Lord that some
   may be baptized for the dead, to stand in his place and fill up the gap
   which his removal has made in our ranks. We need a host of wise and
   prudent Christian talkers. I do not know that we have, at present, any
   more urgent need--people who can talk on the train, can talk by the
   roadside, can talk in the kitchen, can talk in the workshop, can talk
   across a counter--can, in fact, make opportunities to talk of Jesus! I
   need you, dear Friends, to ask the Lord to qualify you for this service
   and lead you into it. Some of you appear to be marching backward, for
   you are even more reticent than you used to be! I would have you like
   Archimedes when he found out his secret and could not keep it for very
   joy, but ran down the street crying out," I have found it! I have found

   it!"

   Come, break your guilty silence and cry aloud, "I have found Him of
   whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets did write, and I cannot help
   talking about Him." As for others of you who are not Believers, I pray
   the Lord that you may give a listening ear to the message which I ask
   others to tell. Here it is--"Jesus Christ came into the world to save
   sinners. Whoever believes in Him has everlasting life." "He that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved." The Lord bring you to accept
   these tidings, to believe in Jesus and to find eternal life. Amen.

For Whom Is The Gospel Meant?

   (No. 1345)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MARCH 25, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are
   sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
   Mark 2:17.

   "Christ died for the ungodly." Romans 5:6.

   "God commends His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
   Christ died for us." Romans 5:8.

   "This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners." 1 Timothy 1:15.

   LAST Thursday evening, with considerable difficulty, I stood here to
   preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and I handled one of the simplest
   imaginable texts, full of nothing but the very plainest elements of the
   Gospel. Within a very few minutes I had a harvest for the sermon. The
   congregation was slender, for you know how ill a night it was, and how
   little you expected that your pastor would be able to preach, but three
   souls came forward uninvited to acknowledge that they had found peace
   with God. How many more there were I do not know, but these three
   sought out the Brethren and bore a good and hearty confession to the
   blessed fact that, for the first time in their lives they, had
   understood the plan of salvation.

   Now, it seemed to me that if a plain Gospel theme was so promptly
   profitable, I had better keep to the same subject. If a farmer finds
   that a certain seed has paid him so well that he never had a better
   crop, then he will keep to that seed and sow more of it. Those
   processes of farming which have been successful should be persevered in
   and even used upon a larger scale. So this morning I shall just preach
   the A B C of the Gospel, the first rudiments of the art of salvation.
   And I thank God this will be no new thing to me. May God the Holy
   Spirit, in answer to your prayers, grant us a reward this morning after
   the same proportion as last Thursday and, if so, our heart will be
   exceedingly glad.

   Out of a very great number I have selected the four texts which I have
   just read to set forth the Truth of God that the mission of our Lord
   related to sinners. What did Christ come into the world for? For whom
   did He come? These are questions of the greatest importance and they
   are clearly answered in Scripture. When the children of Israel first
   found manna outside the camp, they said to one another, "Manna?" or,
   "what is it?" for they knew not what it was. There it lay, a small
   round thing, as small as the hoar frost upon the ground. No doubt they
   looked at it and rubbed it in their hands and smelled it. And how glad
   they were when Moses said, "This is the bread which the Lord has given
   you to eat." It was not long before they put the good news to the test,
   for each man gathered his arms full and took it home and prepared it
   according to his liking.

   Now, concerning the Gospel, there are many who might call out, "Manna?"
   for they know not what it is. Very frequently, too, they make a mistake
   as to its bearings and its objectives, dreaming that it is a kind of
   improved Law, or an easier system of salvation by works and, therefore
   they err, also, in their idea of the persons for whom it is designed.
   They imagine that surely the blessings of salvation must be meant for
   deserving persons and Christ must be the Redeemer of the meritorious!
   On the principle of, "good for the good," they infer that Grace is for
   the excellent and Christ for the virtuous. Therefore it is a most
   useful thing for us continually to be reminding men what the Gospel is
   and for whom it is

   sent into the world, for, though the great mass of you know full well
   and do not need to be told, yet there are multitudes around us who
   persist in grave mistakes and need to be instructed over and over again
   in the very simplest of the Doctrines of Grace.

   There is less need for laborious explanations of profound mysteries
   than for simple explanations of plain Truths of God. Many men need only
   a simple latchkey to lift the latch and open the door of faith--and
   such a key, I hope God's infinite mercy may put into their hands this
   morning! Our business is to show that the Gospel is intended for
   sinners-- that it has an eye to guilty persons--that it is not sent
   into the world as a reward for the good and for the excellent or for
   those who think they have any measure of fitness or preparation for the
   Divine favor. We need to show that it is intended for law breakers, for
   the undeserving, for the ungodly, for those who have gone astray like
   lost sheep, or left their father's house like the prodigal.

   Christ died to save SINNERS and He justifies the ungodly. This Truth of
   God is plain enough in the Word, but since the human heart kicks
   against it, we will the more earnestly insist upon it.

   I. First, EVEN A SUPERFICIAL GLANCE AT OUR LORD'S MISSION SUFFICES TO
   SHOW THAT HIS WORK WAS FOR THE SINFUL. For, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   the descent of the Son of God into this world as a Savior implied that
   men needed to be delivered from a great evil by a Divine hand! The
   coming of a Savior who would, by His death, provide pardon for human
   sin, supposed men to be greatly guilty and to be incapable of procuring
   pardon by any works of their own. You would never have seen a Savior if
   there had not been the Fall. Eden's withering was a necessary preface
   to Gethsemane's groaning.

   You would never have heard of a Cross and a bleeding Savior on it if
   you had not first heard of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil
   and of a disobedient hand which plucked the forbidden fruit. If the
   mission of our Lord did not refer to the guilty, it was an altogether
   unnecessary errand as far as we can see. What justifies the Incarnation
   except man's ruin? What explains our Lord's suffering life but man's
   guilt? Above all, what explains His death and the cloud under which He
   died but human sin? "All we like sheep have gone astray, and the Lord
   has laid on Him the iniquity of us all"--that is the answer to an
   otherwise unanswerable riddle. If we give a glance at the Covenant
   under which our Lord came, we soon perceive that its bearing is towards
   guilty men.

   The blessing of the Covenant of Works has to do with men who are
   innocent. And to them it promises great blessings. If there had been
   salvation by works, it would have been by the Law, for the Law is
   upright and just and good. But the new Covenant evidently deals with
   sinners, for it does not speak of the reward of merit, but it freely
   promises, " I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins
   and their iniquities will I remember no more." If there had been no
   sins and iniquities, and no unrighteousness, then there had been no
   need of the Covenant of Grace of which Christ is the Messenger and the
   Ambassador.

   The slightest glimpse at our Lord's official Character as the Adam of a
   new Covenant should suffice to convince us that His errand is to guilty
   men. Moses comes to show how the holy should behave, but Jesus comes to
   reveal how the unholy may be cleansed! Whenever we hear the mission of
   Christ spoken of, it is described as one of mercy and of Grace. In the
   redemption which is in Christ Jesus, it is always the mercy of God that
   is extolled--according to His mercy He saved us. He, for Christ's sake,
   according to His abundant mercy, forgives us our trespasses. "The Law
   was given by Moses, but Grace and Truth by Jesus Christ." "The Grace of
   God, and the gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Jesus Christ, has
   abounded unto many."

   The Apostle Paul, who most fully expounds the Gospel, makes Grace to be
   the one word upon which he rings the changes--"Where sin abounded Grace
   did much more abound." "By Grace are you saved, through faith, and that
   not of yourselves, it is the gift of God." "Grace reigns through
   righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord." But,
   Brothers and Sisters, mercy implies sinfulness--there can be no mercy
   extended to the just, for Justice, itself, secures every good thing to
   them. Grace, too, can only be for offenders. What Grace is needed by
   those who have kept the Law and deserved well at Jehovah's hands? To
   them eternal life would be a matter of debt, a fairly earned reward!
   But when you talk of Grace, you at once shut out merit and introduce
   another principle. Mercy can only be exercised where there is sin and
   Grace cannot be manifested except to the undeserving.

   This is plain enough, and yet the whole tenor of some men's religion is
   based on another theory. The fact is, when we begin to study the Gospel
   of the Grace of God we see that it turns its face always towards sin,
   even as a physician looks

   towards disease, or as charity looks towards distress. The Gospel
   issues its invitations, but what are the invitations? Are they not
   addressed to those who are burdened with a load of sin and laboring to
   escape from its consequences? It invites every creature because every
   creature has its needs, but it especially says, "Let the wicked forsake
   his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts." It invites the man who
   has no money, or, in other words, no merit. It calls to those who are
   needy, thirsty, poor, naked--and all these are but used as figures of
   states produced by sin!

   The very gifts of the Gospel imply sin--life is for the dead, sight is
   for the blind, liberty is for the captives, cleansing is for the
   filthy, absolution is for the sinful. No Gospel blessing is proposed as
   a reward and no invitation is issued to those who claim the blessings
   of Grace as a matter of right--men are invited to come and receive them
   freely according to the Grace of God. And what are the commands of the
   Gospel? Repent. But who repents unless a sinner? Believe. But believing
   is not according to the Law--the Law speaks only of doing. Believing
   has to do with sinners and with the method of salvation by Grace. The
   Gospel representations of itself usually look sinnerward. The great
   king who makes a feast finds not a guest to sit at the table among
   those who were naturally expected to come--so from the highways and
   hedges men are compelled to come in.

   If the Gospel describes itself as a feast it is a great feast for the
   blind, the crippled and the lame. If it describes itself as a fountain,
   it is a fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness. Everywhere, in all
   that it does and says and provides to men, the Gospel proves itself to
   be the sinner's friend. The motto of its Founder and Lord still is,
   "this Man receives sinners." The Gospel is an hospital for the
   sick--none but the guilty will ever accept its benefits. It is medicine
   for the diseased--the whole and the self-righteous will never relish
   its saving draughts. Those who imagine that they have some excellence
   before God will never care to be saved by Sovereign Grace. The Gospel,
   I say, looks sinnerward. That way, and that way only, does it cast its
   blessings.

   And Brothers and Sisters, you know that the Gospel has always found its
   greatest trophies among the most sinful. It enlists its best soldiers
   not only from among the guilty but from among the most guilty. "Simon,"
   said our Lord, "I have something to say unto you--A certain man had two
   debtors, the one owed him 500 pence and the other fifty. And when they
   had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me, therefore,
   which of them will love him more?" The Gospel goes upon the principle
   that he who has had much forgiven loves much. And so its gracious Lord
   delights to seek out the most guilty and to manifest Himself to them
   with abundant and overflowing love, saying "I have blotted out your
   sins like a cloud, and like a thick cloud your transgressions."

   Among great transgressors it finds its warmest lovers. When once it has
   saved them, it receives from them the heartiest welcome and in them it
   obtains the most enthusiastic adherents. Great sinners, when saved,
   crown free Grace with its most illustrious diadems. Well may we be sure
   that it has its eye towards sinners since it is among the chief of
   sinners that it finds its highest glory. There is one other reflection
   which, also, lies very near the surface, namely, that if the Gospel
   does not look towards sinners, to whom else could it look? There seems
   to have been a revival, lately, of the old quibbling spirit, so that
   proud Pharisees constantly tell us that the preaching ofjustification
   by faith is overdone and that we are leading people to think less of
   morality by preaching up the Grace of God.

   This often refuted objection is coming forth again because
   Protestantism is losing its sap and soul. The very force and backbone
   of the Reformers' teaching was that great Doctrine of Grace, that
   salvation is not of works but of the Grace of God, alone! And because
   men are getting away from the Reformation and drifting into Romanism,
   they are casting into the background this grand Truth of God of
   Justification by Faith, alone, and pretending to be afraid of it. Most
   men are knaves and fools upon this matter! I put to all such, this one
   question--To whom, Sirs, would the Gospel look, if not towards sinners,
   for what are you but sinners? You who talk about morality being
   injured, about holiness being ignored--what have you to do with either?

   The people who usually urge these objections, as a rule, had better be
   quiet on such topics. In general these fierce defenders of morality and
   holiness are exceedingly lax, while believers in the Grace of God are
   frequently charged with Puritanism and rigidity. He who stands out most
   to speak against the Doctrines of Grace is frequently the man or woman
   who needs Grace most, while the very man who cries down good works as a
   ground of trust is just the person whose life is carefully directed by
   the statutes of the Lord! Know you, O men, that there lives not on the
   face of the earth a man upon whom God can look with pleasure if He
   considers that man on the ground of His Law. "They are all gone out of
   the way, they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that
   does good, no not one."

   Not one heart is sound and right before God by nature! Not one life is
   pure and clean when the Lord comes to examine it with His all-searching
   eyes! We are all shut up in the same prison as the guilty--if not alike
   guilty, yet guilty according to the proportion of our light and
   knowledge--and each one justly condemned! We have all erred in heart
   and have not loved the Lord! To whom, then, could the Gospel look if it
   did not cast its eyes sinnerward? For whom else could the Savior have
   died? Who is there in the world for whom the benefits of Grace could be
   designed?

   II. Secondly, THE MORE CLOSELY WE LOOK, THE MORE CLEAR THIS FACT
   BECOMES, for, Brothers and Sisters, the work of salvation was certainly
   not performed for any of us, who are saved, on account of any goodness
   in us! If there is any goodness in us, it was put there by the Grace of
   God and it certainly was not there when first the heart of Jehovah's
   love began to move towards us.

   If you take the first sign of salvation that was actually visible on
   earth, namely, the coming of Christ, we are told, concerning it, that,
   "when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the
   ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for
   a good man some would even dare to die. But God commends His love
   toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." So
   that our redemption, my Brothers and Sisters, was effected before we
   were born! This was the fruit of the Father's great love, "wherewith He
   loved us, even when we were dead in sins."

   There was nothing in us going before which could have merited that
   redemption, indeed the very idea of meriting the death of Jesus is
   absurd and blasphemous! Yes, and when we were living in sin and loving
   it, there were preparations made for our salvation--Divine love was
   busy on our behalf when we were busy in rebellion. The Gospel was
   brought near to us. Earnest hearts were set praying for us. The text
   was written which would convert us and, as I have already said, the
   blood was spilt which cleanses us and the Spirit of God was given who
   should renew us. All this was done while as yet we had no breathings of
   soul after God!

   Is not that a wonderful passage in Ezekiel where the Lord passed by and
   saw the helpless infant cast out in the open field while it was yet
   unswaddled and unwashed and was foul and polluted in its own blood? He
   says that it was a time of love and yet it was a time of pollution and
   loathing. He did not love the chosen baby because it was well-washed
   and fitly clad--He loved it when it was foul and naked. Let every
   believing heart admire the freeness and compassion of Divine love--

   "He saw me ruined in the Fall, Yet loved me, notwithstanding all. He sa
   ved me from my lost estate, His loving kindness, oh, how great!" When
   your heart was hard. When your neck was obstinate. When you would not
   repent nor yield to Him but rebelled yet more and more, He loved
   you--even you--with supreme affection!

   Why such Grace? Why, indeed, but because His Nature is full of goodness
   and He delights in mercy? Is not mercy seen to be evidently extended
   towards the sinful and not exerted because of some goodness moving
   thereto? Look a little closer, still. What did our Lord come into the
   world to do? Here is the answer. "He was wounded for our
   transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
   our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed." He came
   that He might be a Sin-Bearer--and do you think He came to bear only
   the little, trifling sins of the best sort of men, if such sins there
   are? Do you suppose that He is a little Savior who came to save us from
   little offenses?

   Beloved, it is Jehovah's darling Son that comes to earth and bears the
   load of sin, a load which, when He bears it, He finds to be no
   fictitious burden, for it forces from Him bloody sweat! So heavy is
   that load that He bows His head to the grave and even unto death
   beneath it. That stupendous load which lay on Christ was the heap of
   our sins--and, therefore, as we look into the subject, we perceive that
   the Gospel must have to do with sinners. No sin? Then the Cross is a
   mistake! No sin? Then the "Lama Sabachthani" was a just complaint
   against unnecessary cruelty!

   No sin? Then, O Redeemer, what are those glories which we have so
   eagerly ascribed to You? How can You put away sin which does not exist?
   The existence of great sin is implied in the coming of Christ and that
   coming was occasioned and rendered necessary by SIN, against which
   Jesus comes as our Deliverer! He declares that He has opened a
   fountain, filled with the blood of His own veins. But what for? A
   cleansing fountain implies filth. It must be, Sinner, that somewhere or
   other there are filthy people, or else there had not been such an
   amazing fountain as this, filled from the heart of Christ!

   If you are guilty, you are one who needs the fountain, and it is opened
   for you! Come with all your sin and foulness about you and wash this
   morning, and be clean!--

   "'Twas for sinners that He suffered

   Agonies unspeakable!

   Can you doubt you are a sinner?

   If you can--then hope farewell.

   But, believing what is written--

   'All are guilty'--'dead in sin,'

   Looking to the Crucified One

   Hope shall rise your soul within." Brothers and Sisters, all the gifts
   which Jesus Christ came to give, or at least most of them, imply that
   there is sin! What is His first gift but pardon? How can He pardon a
   man who has not transgressed? With all reverence do I speak-- there can
   be no such thing as pardon where there is no offense committed.
   Propitiation for sin and blotting out of iniquity both require that
   there must be sin to be blotted out, or what is there real about them?
   Christ comes to bring justification and this shows that there must be a
   lack of natural holiness in men, for if not, they would be justified by
   themselves and by their own works. And why all this outcry about
   justification by the righteousness of the Son of God if men are already
   justified by a righteousness of their own? Those two blessings, and
   others of the same kind, are clearly applicable only to sinful men. To
   no other men can they be of any use.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ came girded, also, with Divine power. He says,
   "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me." To what end was He girded with
   Divine power unless it was because sin had taken all power and strength
   from man, and man was in a condition out of which he could not be
   lifted except by the energy of the eternal Spirit? And what does this
   imply but that Christ's errand bears upon those who, through sin, are
   without strength and without merit before God? The Holy Spirit is given
   because man's spirit has failed--because sin has taken the life out of
   man and made him dead in trespasses and sins--therefore the Holy Spirit
   comes to quicken him into newness of life, and that Spirit comes by
   Jesus Christ. Therefore the errand of Jesus Christ is manifestly to the
   guilty.

   I will not omit to say that the great deeds of our Lord, if you look at
   them carefully, all bear upon sinners. Jesus lives--it is that He may
   seek and save that which is lost. Jesus dies--it is that He may make a
   propitiation for the sins of guilty men. Jesus rises--He rises again
   for our justification and, as I have shown, we would not need
   justification unless we had been naturally guilty. Jesus ascends on
   high and He receives gifts for men--but note that special word--"Yes,
   for the rebellious, also, that the Lord God may dwell among them."
   Jesus lives in Heaven, but He lives there to intercede. "Therefore He
   is able, also, to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him,
   seeing He ever lives to make intercession for them."

   So take whatever part of His glorious achievements you please and you
   will find that there is a distinct bearing towards those who are
   immersed in guilt. And Beloved, all the gifts and blessings that Jesus
   Christ has brought to us derive much of their radiance from their
   bearing upon sinners. It is in Christ Jesus that we are elect and, to
   my mind, the glory of electing love lies in this--that it pitched upon
   such undeserving objects. How had there been any election had it been
   according to merit? Then men would have taken rank by right according
   to their own deeds! But election's glories are brilliant with Grace and
   Grace always has for its foil and background the unworthiness of the
   objects towards whom it is manifested. The election of God is not
   according to our works, but it is a gracious election of sinners! Adore
   and wonder!

   Turn to effectual calling and see how delightful it is to view that
   calling as a calling from among the dead, as a calling of the things
   that are not as though they were, as a calling of condemned ones into
   forgiveness and favor! Turn next to adoption. What is the glory of
   adoption, but that God has adopted those who were strangers and rebels
   to make them His children? What is the peculiar beauty of regeneration
   but that He has been able to raise up children, from these stones, unto
   Abraham? What is the beauty of sanctification, but that He has taken
   such unholy creatures as we are to make us kings and priests unto God
   and to sanctify us wholly--spirit, soul, and body?

   To my mind it is the glory of Heaven to think that yonder white-robed
   choristers were once foully deified--those happy worshippers were once
   rebels against God! It is a happy sight to see the unfallen angels who
   have kept their first estate perfectly pure and forever praising God.
   But the vision of fallen men divinely restored is more full of the
   Glory of

   God! Lift, as they may, their joyful voices in perpetual chorales, the
   angels can never reach the special sweetness of that song--"We have
   washed our robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." They
   cannot experimentally enter into that Truth of God which is of
   Jehovah's name its crowning glory--"You were slain and have redeemed us
   to God by Your blood."

   Thus I have abundantly shown that the further we look, the more clear
   it is that the Gospel is aimed at sinners and especially intended for
   their benefit.

   III. Now, thirdly, it is evident that IT IS OUR WISDOM TO ACCEPT THE
   SITUATION. I know that, to many,

   this is a very unpalatable doctrine. Well, Friend, you had better have
   your palate altered, for you will never be able to alter the doctrine!
   It is the Truth of the everlasting God and cannot be changed. The very
   best thing you can do, since the Gospel looks towards sinners, is to
   get where the Gospel looks--and I can recommend this to you, not merely
   on the ground of policy, but on the ground of honesty--because you will
   be only in your right place when you get there.

   I think I hear you raising objections. "I do not admire this system. Am
   I to be saved in the same way as the dying thief?" Precisely so, Sir,
   unless there should happen to be even more Grace shown towards you than
   to him. "But you do not mean to assert that in the matter of salvation
   I am to be put on a level with the woman that was a sinner? I have been
   pure and chaste and am I to owe my salvation just as much to the
   absolute mercy of God as she did?" Yes, Sir, I do say that, exactly as
   it stands. There is but one principle upon which the Lord saves men and
   it is that of pure Grace. I want you to understand this.

   Even if it grinds like grit between your teeth and makes you angry, I
   shall not regret it so long as you know what I mean, for the Truth of
   God may yet find entrance into your soul and you may yet bow before its
   power. Oh, you children of godly parents, you young people of excellent
   morals and delicate consciences, to you I speak, even to you! Rejoice
   in your privileges, but do not boast in them, for you, too, have
   sinned! You have sinned against light and knowledge. You know you have!
   If you have not plunged into the grosser sins in act and deed, yet in
   desire and in imagination you have gone far enough astray--and in many
   things you have offended grievously against God. If, with these
   considerations before you, you take your place as a sinner, you will
   not be disgraced but be merely standing where you certainly are!

   And then, remember, if you get the blessing this way, you will have
   obtained it in the safest possible way. Suppose there are a number of
   guest chambers and I have my seat in one of the best of them. I may
   have no right to be there. I am eating and drinking of what is provided
   for superior guests, but my ticket does not mark me out as one of these
   and, therefore, I am ill at ease. Every mouthful that I eat I think to
   myself, "I do not know whether I shall be allowed to remain here.
   Perhaps the Lord of the feast will come in and say to me, 'Friend, how
   came you in here?' and I must begin, with shame, to take the lowest
   room." Brothers and Sisters, when we begin at the bottom and sit in the
   lowest room, we feel safe. We are satisfied that what we do get is
   meant for us and will not be taken away from us.

   Perhaps, also, when the king comes, he may take us up to a higher room.
   There is nothing like beginning in the lowest place. When I lay hold of
   the promise as a saint, I have my doubts about it. But when I grasp it
   as a sinner, I can have no question! If the Lord bids me feed on His
   mercy as His child, I do it! The devil may whisper that I am presuming,
   that I never was really adopted by Grace--but when I come to Jesus as a
   guilty, undeserving sinner, and take what the Lord freely presents to
   me upon believing--the devil himself cannot tell me that I am not a
   sinner, or if he does, the lie is too transparent and causes me no
   distress! There is nothing like having an indefeasible title--and if
   the description given to you in the title is that you are a sinner, it
   is an indisputable one--for depend upon it, you are a sinner! So the
   sinner's place is your true place and your safest place.

   Another blessing is it is a place into which you can get directly, even
   at this very moment. If the Gospel looks towards men in a certain state
   of heart in which there are commendable virtues, then how long will it
   take me to raise my heart to that state? If Jesus Christ comes into the
   world to save men who have a certain measure of excellence, then how
   long will it take me to obtain that excellence? I may be taken sick and
   die within the next 30 minutes and hear the sentence of eternal
   judgment--it would be poor Gospel to tell me that I might possibly
   obtain salvation if I attained a state which would take me several
   months to reach! At this hour I, a dying man, know that I may be gone
   out of this world and beyond the reach of mercy within an hour--what a
   comfort it is that the Gospel comes to me and gives itself to me just
   now, even as it finds me! I am already in that position in which Grace
   begins with men, for I am a sinner, and I have only to admit that I am
   so.

   Now then, poor Soul, just sit down before the Lord and say, "Lord, does
   Your Son come to save the guilty? I am such and I trust Him to save me.
   Did He die for the ungodly? I am such, Lord, I trust in His blood to
   cleanse me. Was His death for sinners? Lord, I take up the position! I
   plead guilty! I accept the sentence of Your Law as being just, but save
   me, Lord, for Jesus died." It is done! You are saved! Go in peace, my
   Son. Your sins, which are many, are forgiven you! Go, my Daughter, go
   your way and rejoice! The Lord has put away your sin--you shall not
   die, for he that believes is justified from all sin. Blessed is the man
   to whom the Lord imputes not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no
   guile! Get, then, into your true position--accept the situation in
   which Grace considers you to be. Do not talk of justice and merit, but
   appeal to pity and love.

   A certain man had, several times, plotted against the first Napoleon
   and eventually, being entirely in the emperor's hands, the sentence of
   death was pronounced upon him. His daughter earnestly pleaded for his
   life and at last, having obtained an audience with the Emperor, she
   fell upon her knees before him. "My girl," said the Emperor, "it is of
   no use to plead for your father, for I have the clearest evidence of
   his repeated crimes, and it is but justice that he should die." The
   girl replied, "Sire, I do not ask for justice, I beg for mercy. It is
   upon the mercifulness of your heart and not upon the justice of the
   case that I rely." She was heard patiently and her father's life was
   spared at her request.

   Imitate this appeal, and cry, "Have mercy upon me, O God, according to
   Your loving kindness." Justice owes you nothing but death--mercy alone
   can spare you. Have done with every idea of making out a good
   case--admit it to be a bad one and plead guilty! Cast yourself upon the
   mercy of the court and ask for mercy, free mercy, undeserved mercy,
   gratuitous favor! This is what you must ask for and as in law they have
   a form of suing called in forma pauperis, that is, in the form of a
   pauper, adopt the method and as a man full of necessities beg for favor
   at the hands of God, in forma pauperis, and it shall be bestowed upon
   you.

   IV. Now I close this discourse with the next point, which is, THIS
   DOCTRINE HAS A GREAT SANCTIFYING

   INFLUENCE. "There," says one, "I do not believe that. Surely you have
   been holding out a premium to sin by saying that Christ came to save
   nobody but sinners and does not call anybody to repentance but the
   sinful." My dear Sirs, I have heard all that sort of talk so many times
   that I know it by heart--the same objections were raised against this
   doctrine in Luther's day by the Papists and, since then, by workmongers
   of all classes! There is nothing substantial in their notion that free
   Grace is opposed to morality--it is only their fancy.

   They dream that the doctrine of justification by faith will lead to
   sin, but it can be proved by history that whenever this doctrine has
   been best preached, men have become most holy! And whenever this Truth
   of God has been darkened, all manner of corruption has abounded.
   Gracious doctrine and gracious living fitly go together--and legal
   teaching and unlawful living are generally found associated. Let us
   show you the sanctifying power of this Gospel. Its first operation in
   that direction is this--when the Holy Spirit brings the truth of free
   pardon home to a man, it completely changes his thoughts concerning
   God.

   "What?" he asks, "Has God freely forgiven me all my offenses for
   Christ's sake? And does He love me notwithstanding all my sin? I did
   not know He was such an One as this, so gracious and kind! I thought He
   was hard! I called Him a tyrant, gathering where He had not
   strewed--but does He feel towards me like this? Then," says the soul,
   "I love Him in return." There is a complete reversal of feeling--the
   man is turned right round as soon as he understands redeeming Grace and
   dying love. Conversion follows on a sight of Grace. Moreover, this
   grand Truth of God does more than turn a man, it inspires, melts,
   enlivens and inflames him. This is a Truth which stirs the deeps of the
   heart and fills the man with lively emotions.

   Before, you talked to him about doing good, about right, justice,
   reward and punishment--he heard it all and it may have had a measure of
   influence over him--but he did not deeply feel it. Such teaching is too
   cold to warm the heart. Then the Truth comes home to the man and
   appears to him to be new and exciting. It runs like this--God, out of
   His free mercy, forgives the guilty and He has forgiven me! Why, this
   awakens him, stirs him up, touches the fountain of his tears and moves
   his whole being! Perhaps at the first hearing of the Gospel, he does
   not care for it, and even hates it. But when it comes with power, it
   obtains a wonderful mastery over him! When he really receives its
   message as his own, then his cold heart of stone is turned to flesh!
   Warm emotion, tender love, humble desire and a sacred longing after the
   Lord are all excited in his bosom.

   The quickening power of this Divine Truth, as well as the converting
   power of it, can never be too much admired. Besides, this Truth, when
   it enters the heart, deals a deadly blow at the man's self-conceit.
   Many a man would have become wise, only he thought he was already! And
   many a man would have been virtuous, only he concluded that he had
   already attained that, too! Behold, this doctrine smites upon the skull
   all confidence in your own goodness and makes you feel your guilt! And
   in so doing, it removes the great evil of pride. A sense of sin is the
   very threshold of mercy! A consciousness of shortcoming, a grief
   because of past offenses are necessary preparations for a higher and a
   nobler life. The Gospel digs out the foundation, makes a great vacuum
   and so makes room to lay in their places the glorious stones of a noble
   spiritual character.

   Moreover, where this Truth of God is received, there is sure to spring
   up in the soul a sense of gratitude. The man who has had much forgiven
   will be sure to love much in return. Gratitude to God is a grand
   mainspring for holy action. Those who do right in order to be rewarded
   for it are acting selfishly. Selfishness is at the bottom of their
   character-- they abstain from sin only lest self should suffer--and
   they obey only that self may be safe and happy. The man who does right,
   not because of Heaven or Hell, but because God has saved him and he
   loves the God who saved him, is the truly right-loving man. He who
   loves right because God loves right, has risen out of the fog of
   selfishness and is capable of the loftiest virtue, yes, he has in him a
   living spring which will well up and flow forth in holy living so long
   as he exists.

   And, dear Brothers and Sisters, I think you will all see that free
   forgiveness to sinners is very conducive towards one part of a true
   character, namely, readiness to forgive others, for he who has been
   forgiven much himself is the very man who finds it easy to pass by the
   transgressions of others. If he does not, he may well doubt whether he
   has been forgiven! If the Lord has blotted out his debt of a thousand
   talents, he will, readily enough, forgive the hundred pence which his
   brother owes him.

   Last of all, some of us know and we wish that all knew by personal
   experience, that a sense of undeserved favor and free forgiveness is
   the very soul of enthusiasm--and enthusiasm is to Christianity what the
   lifeblood is to the body! Were you ever made enthusiastic by a cold
   discourse upon the excellence of morality? Did you ever feel your soul
   stirred within you by listening to a sermon upon the rewards of virtue?
   Were you ever made enthusiastic by being told of the punishments of the
   Law? No, Sirs--but preach up the Doctrines of Grace--let the free favor
   of God be extolled and mark the consequences! There are people who will
   walk for many miles and stand without weariness by the hour together to
   hear this! I have known them labor many a weary mile to listen to this
   doctrine!

   Why? Because the preacher was eloquent, or because he put it well? Not
   so! It has sometimes been badly spoken and in uncouth language--and yet
   this doctrine has always awakened the people. There is something in the
   soul of man that is looking out for the Gospel of Grace! And when it
   comes, there is a hungering to hear about it! Look at the Reformation
   times, when death was the penalty of listening to a sermon--how the
   people crowded at midnight! How they journeyed into the deserts and the
   caves to listen to the teaching of these grand old Truths of God! There
   is sweetness about mercy, Divine Mercy freely given, which holds the
   ear of man and stirs his heart!

   When this Truth of God enters the soul, it breeds zealots, martyrs,
   confessors, missionaries, saints. If any Christians are in earnest and
   full of love to God and man, they are those who know what Grace has
   done for them. If any remain faithful under reproaches, joyful under
   losses and crosses--they are those who are conscious of their
   indebtedness to Divine Love. If any delight in God while they live and
   rest in Him as they die--they are the men who know that they are
   justified by faith in Jesus Christ who justifies the ungodly.

   All glory be to the Lord who lifts the beggar from the dunghill and
   sets him among princes, even the princes of His people! He takes the
   very cast-offs of the world and adopts them into His family and makes
   them heirs of God by Jesus Christ! The Lord grant us all to know the
   power of the Gospel upon our sinful selves! The Lord endear to us the
   name, work and Person of the Sinner's Friend! May we never forget the
   hole of the pit from where we were drawn, nor the hand which rescued
   us, nor the undeserved kindness which moved that hand! From now on let
   us have more and more to say of Infinite Grace. "Free Grace and dying
   love." Well does the old song say, "Ring those charming bells." Free
   Grace and dying love--the sinner's windows of hope! Our hearts exult in
   the very words! Glory be unto You, O Lord Jesus, ever full of
   compassion. Amen.

Guile Forsaken When Guilt Is Forgiven

   (No. 1346)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MARCH 25, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity, and in
   whose spirit there is no guile." Psalm 32:2.

   THE only blessing the Law can give, it bestows on those who do no
   iniquity and walk perfectly in God's ways--the Gospel, alone, has a
   blessing for the guilty. Upon their believing in Jesus, it pronounces
   the benediction, "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, and
   whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not
   iniquity." To be "blessed" is to be in the most desirable state--at
   peace with God, happy in yourself and full of Divine favor. A man
   cannot be more than blessed, or, what if I say, doubly blessed since
   the benediction is pronounced twice? Nor is it a stinted blessing, for
   no limiting word is put before it or after it to mark an inferior
   benediction.

   When our Lord opened His mouth in the Sermon on the Mount, He poured
   forth a stream of blessings, and even so does the Gospel, when it
   speaks to the soul--rivers of blessing flow from its every word! The
   language of the text is very emphatic in the original and implies a
   multiplication of blessings. There cannot be a more true, real and
   assured blessedness than that which belongs to the forgiven sinner. All
   the blessedness which could have come to a perfect man comes to the man
   whose transgression is forgiven.

   O you who have sinned against God and are conscious of it, rejoice that
   you are not shut out from blessedness! If, by faith, you can believe in
   the sin-forgiving God and accept the matchless Atonement which covers
   all your guilt and if you will exercise faith upon that blessed system
   by which sin is no longer imputed, then you are even now among the
   blessed! God Himself has blessed you and neither men nor devils can
   reverse the benediction. Now, mark that at the very same time that the
   guilt of sin is taken away and blessedness is bestowed, it happens unto
   the forgiven man that he undergoes a change of nature.

   The work of the Spirit is linked with the work of the Son--when the Son
   removes guilt, the Spirit removes guile. He who takes away our
   offenses, also cures our deceit. When we begin to be Believers, we
   cease to be liars. He who was, before, crafty as Jacob no sooner
   receives the blessing of the Lord in answer to prayer than he becomes
   "an Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile." It is to this fact that I
   am going to draw your attention at this time. As I desire to use it as
   a means for self-examination and awakening, I pray the Holy Spirit to
   apply it with power to many souls.

   You must all have noticed in David's case, that after he had fallen
   into his foul sin with Bathsheba, he ceased to exhibit that transparent
   truth-speaking character which had charmed us so much before. Until he
   had obtained a sense of pardon for his great crime, David was as
   crooked and perverse as he could be. Guile was as abundant in him as
   guilt, for he made no confession of his sin and would not allow himself
   to see the heinousness of it. He must have put a fearful strain upon
   his conscience to have hushed its protests against his grievous
   offense. Perhaps even months passed without any honest acknowledgment
   to his own conscience and to God that he had so foully sinned. His
   entire endeavors were concentrated upon the concealment of his crime
   and, to that end, all his wits were set to work with horrible cunning.

   What crafty devices he practiced in seeking to hide his sin--such as
   bringing Uriah back and making him drunk! Could this be David--the
   honest and conscientious David of former days? Could he have become so
   mean, so full of low scheming? Could he be the Psalmist who sung so
   sweetly? Could he deliberately plan the death of the man whom he had so
   fearfully wronged? Yes, and worse, when Uriah, being willfully exposed
   to danger, fell in battle, David manifested no compunction, nor uttered
   a word by way of confession. He put it off with apparent indifference,
   saying, "the sword devours one as well as another."

   He knew right well how Uriah came to die, and Joab knew, also, and yet
   he trumped up a message, as if nothing had been arranged between them
   beforehand. Ah, David, what a deceitful heart you had and how you did
   practice guile upon

   guile! Yes, so blind had his mental vision become, as to his own
   sinfulness, that when Nathan outlined a picture which was the very
   photograph of his own case, he did not see it, but pronounced a fierce
   sentence against the supposed culprit! It needed the Prophet to come
   forward and say, "You are the man," before that guileful heart of David
   was able to perceive that Nathan spoke of him!

   Yes, sin gives a twist to our entire manhood and makes us play a
   thousand tricks both with our conscience and with God. But notice, as
   soon as Nathan said, "The Lord has put away your sin: you shall not
   die," David became another man! He wrote the 51st Psalm, which is one
   of the most honest pieces of writing that ever fell from human pen. How
   plain-spoken it is all through! How bare is the penitent's bosom! In it
   you do not so much hear the sound of vibrating harp-strings as of
   throbbing, breaking /zeart-strings! All through it, the man's soul is
   running over at his lips and at his eyes--concealment and trickery are
   quite out of the field. Pardoned sin makes an honest heart, but while
   sin is unconfessed and unforgiven the serpent rules within and men
   twist, wriggle, wind and turn in a thousand deceitful ways.

   My first head tonight is this--many men play tricks with God and their
   consciences. Secondly, the forgiven man gives evidence of having ceased
   from this evil habit--"In His spirit there is no guile."

   I. While I speak upon my first head--that MANY MEN PLAY TRICKS WITH GOD
   AND THEIR CONSCIENCES, I shall be very glad if you will each carefully
   notice how much of what is said belongs to you personally. I want to be
   very honest with you, but I should be sorry to be unjust. Do not take
   home what does not apply to you, but anything which is really yours, I
   pray you to lay to heart. Court the entrance of the Truth of God, even
   though it should cut you to the quick. "Faithful are the wounds of a
   friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful." Avail yourselves of
   the opportunity which the Lord is now affording us to search our
   hearts, as in the presence of the Lord who weighs the spirits. May the
   Holy Spirit aid us in this business.

   The guile of the human heart shows itself in a refusal to come to
   serious consideration. Men cannot be induced to examine themselves and
   to look to the state of affairs between God and their souls. We press
   them to it and plead with them, even to tears, but they refuse to do
   themselves this necessary service. They are more or less conscious that
   something is very wrong, but they have no mind to enquire. Is this
   truthful? Is it reasonable? If their house were reported to be on fire,
   would they not see to it? But no, they could not enjoy the fool's
   paradise of false peace if they were seriously to think and enquire
   and, therefore, they prefer to take matters easily and ignore as much
   as possible all that is unsatisfactory about their condition and
   prospects.

   From week to week there is no calling of conscience to account.
   Sabbaths follow one another and though there may be a little occasional
   awakening, there is no resolute determination to cast up accounts and
   find out the soul's actual condition. They prefer to shut their eyes
   and stop their ears rather than see signs and hear tidings which would
   distress them. What childishness is this! It is worse--it is dishonesty
   to their souls and God. When a steward declines to render an account,
   you may easily guess the reason. When a shipmaster refuses to have his
   vessel surveyed, you shrewdly suspect the sea-worthiness of the ship.
   When a merchant does not care to look into his books, you judge on
   which side the balance has turned.

   Honest men are prepared to go into matters and are willing to see the
   naked truth, but men who are not brave enough to face uncomfortable
   facts play the foolish game of bandaging their eyes. Putting the
   telescope to the blind eye and declaring that you see nothing is an old
   trick, and commonly practiced even now. May we never be suffered to
   persevere in the self-deception which is supported by a heedless
   disregard of warnings. Most men will do anything sooner than think
   about eternal things. The most frivolous amusements, the most stupid
   songs, the most carking cares and even the most weary ceremonial
   fashions are adopted as a happy release from the labor of reflection.
   Death, judgment, eternity, Heaven and Hell--they dare not think of
   these--and why? Because they know that all is wrong with them and so
   they practice a crafty carelessness and a cunning indifference.

   Others who do think a little are partial in their judgments of
   themselves. They present accounts, but these are cooked and made to
   appear other than they should be by a sort of spiritual financing.
   Ungodly men color all that they do with a rosy tint and endeavor to be
   gratified with the appearance of their lives. Is it not very usual for
   business men, when their financial position is becoming more and more
   unsound, to make a show of prosperity in order to keep up their credit?
   Doubtful investments are reckoned as available assets and heavy
   liabilities are toned down by clever adjustments. Public

   companies often show us fine specimens of the art of coloring. Alas,
   that reasonable beings should practice this art upon themselves in
   relation to their most vital interests--yet they do so year after year!

   They put darkness for light and light for darkness, and reckon
   themselves to be rich and increased with goods while they are naked and
   poor and miserable. Well-skilled are many in the method of "making the
   worse appear the better reason." They exaggerate any little excellence
   which they think they possess and greatly underestimate their faults.
   They deny, or extenuate, or altogether excuse their sin--they blame
   their nature, or their circumstances, or the Tempter--but they,
   themselves, must be excused. How could they help sinning? Others would
   have done the same had they been in their shoes--why, then, should they
   be blamed?

   Moreover, what they did was not so very bad, after all, and there are
   all their good deeds as a set off against the bad! Men use false
   weights and deceitful balances when they are dealing with their souls.
   They will not endure honest handling. They cry, "peace, peace," where
   there is no peace and prophesy smooth things for themselves. Like the
   unjust steward, they permit false statements to be made of what is due
   to their Lord and when they come up to their false standard they
   congratulate themselves as if they were the pink of honesty! Again,
   many are evidently tricking themselves willfully because they rest on
   such frivolous grounds of confidence. Could any man depend on his own
   good works unless he had juggled with his judgment?

   What do you think? Do you believe that any man would build his hope for
   eternity upon his being christened when he was a baby and his having
   taken the communion at certain seasons since if he were not anxious to
   be deceived? Do you think that any man, unless willingly duped, could
   believe that he was made a child of God by an outward ceremony? Do you
   think any man would rely upon sacraments unless he desired to be
   misled? A mortal man believes in absolution given to him by a fellow
   sinner who calls himself a priest--is he not willingly deceived? If any
   man relies upon outward performances as a means for the putting away of
   sin, do you think he has not sense enough in him, if he chooses to use
   it, to know that this is utter absurdity?

   True, many are duped by the teachings of others, but if they possess
   even so much as a trace of brain, might they not see through such false
   teaching if they chose? If a man would sit down and only think, would
   he not see that confidences based upon such frail foundations are as
   sure to fall as houses built upon the sand? But, alas, multitudes of
   men play such tricks with themselves so that they are led by the nose
   by the servants of Antichrist! They see that others yield their assent
   to the pretensions of priests and they conclude that they will go with
   the many. It is inconvenient to be too particular and so they leap with
   the majority!

   But what a wretched way of doing business and how hollow the peace
   which comes of it! Men will trust their souls upon statements so flimsy
   that they would not risk a half-crown upon them. There is guile at the
   bottom of this and those who profess to be easy in these confidences
   are not so. Sirs, there is no man honest in his peace but the man who
   gained it through the blood of Jesus Christ! If you come to testing and
   trying, all other confidences fail you except confidence in the Christ
   of God! But the sinner is full of guile and does not want to test and
   try. Like the simple, he believes every word because it would be
   tedious to discriminate and troublesome to doubt a good report.

   Some practice guile in another way. They avoid all home truths and keep
   clear of searching doctrines. If they hear a faithful sermon and it
   comes home to them, do you know what they say? "The preacher was so
   very harsh. I could not hear a man like that. I want more love." Of
   course they cannot abide a ministry which reveals their true state,
   for, "he that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light
   lest his deeds should be reproved." Only honest hearts ask to hear that
   searching Word of God which lays bare the thoughts and intents of the
   heart--gracious men know that to be turned inside out by a searching
   discourse is the very thing they need--and they are grateful to the
   honest man of God who will not spare them.

   Those persons must be very foolish who prefer a doctor who, when they
   are dreadfully diseased and near to death, nevertheless flatteringly
   says, "Oh, this is but a small matter! I shall soon set you right. Here
   is my wonderful pill--take a certain quantity of boxes and you will be
   perfectly restored. I have seen many cases worse than yours completely
   cured." The poor wretch is almost in his grave and yet he promises him
   long life! Sensible men hate such a deceiver. Rational men choose a
   trustworthy physician who will, so far as he knows, tell them what ails
   them and not bolster them up in falsehood. So, if men would but let
   their senses exercise themselves on the best things, they would prefer
   an honest teacher

   and prize his faithful warnings. And they would be glad that things
   should be put plainly, even if harshly, lest haply they should perish
   in self-deception.

   Very commonly we meet with people foolish enough to endeavor to turn
   the edge of an unpalatable home truth by finding fault with the
   preacher. He is too censorious and that is your excuse for remaining in
   spiritual apathy. He blundered in pronunciation, or grammar, or
   style--and that is tacitly placed as an excuse for your rejecting the
   Gospel which he preached. Even books come in for the same censures! The
   plain-speaking volume is not "conceived in a gentle spirit," or is too
   narrow, bigoted and one-sided. The witness is hated because he
   prophecies only evil. If the sinner cannot escape the censure of his
   conscience, he will raise a deal of dust and throw handfuls of it upon
   those who seek his good, so that in the fog he may effect a retreat.
   Ah, foolish trickery!

   Beyond this, many are clever at parrying home thrusts by introducing
   other themes. Many imitate the Samaritan woman at the well. When our
   Lord began to unveil her character and touch her conscience about those
   five husbands of hers, she sought to change the subject by the remark,
   "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and You say that in Jerusalem
   men ought to worship." Thus with questions about rites or ceremonies,
   or doctrines, or types, or prophecies, men shield themselves from the
   blows of the Spirit's sword! A brother minister told me, some time ago,
   that he visited a woman whose husband had died very suddenly, and he
   found that she had at one time been an attendant upon his ministry.

   She was sitting with her brother, who was an elder of the Scot Church,
   who began at once, somewhat harshly, to remind her of her negligence of
   Christian ordinances. The woman evidently feared that the minister
   would follow in the same strain and so she cleverly warded off the
   expected attack by stating that she had a great difficulty which she
   could by no means get over. The minister had no idea of rebuking her
   while just newly made a widow, but her conscience was evidently putting
   her into a state of alarm. And so she again interrupted the minister's
   kindly earnest remarks by saying, "But still, you see, Sir, I cannot
   get my mind easy about this one thing. In the Shorter Catechism it says
   that God is without beginning and I cannot understand how that can be.
   That He should be without end I can understand, but that He should be
   without beginning is quite beyond me."

   "Well," said the pastor, "my good Soul, I do not think that this is
   quite the time to talk about such a mysterious matter. You see the Lord
   has removed your husband from you and it is well for us to hear the
   voice of the rod." It was of no use, for the woman held to her shield
   and repeated that still she could not understand how God could be
   without a beginning. At last her brother, the elder, silenced her
   objection, by saying, "Woman, what are you doing? Why make such a fuss
   about a plain subject? Of course the Lord never had a beginning and He
   never needed any, for He was always

   there."

   This, for awhile, silenced that particular form of caviling, but before
   long the woman was at the same mode of defense. You know how the
   lapwing pretends to have a broken wing and flies as if it must be taken
   and all with the view of leading the passenger from her nest--so do our
   hearers try to lead us away from the main matter. When comparing notes
   about the way in which the unconverted meet us when we try to deal
   personally with them, ministers can all bear witness to the cleverness
   of many in the art of turning the switch and shunting the conversation.
   You know how it has been with some of you when you have been hard
   pressed, you have crept under the Doctrine of Election! You have hidden
   in the dark corner of Predestination, or dodged the Gospel behind some
   theory of free agency.

   This is sheer trickery, a display of evil subtlety, exceedingly
   mischievous! What would it help you if you could understand all
   mysteries? As long as you are unreconciled to God, what does it matter
   about what you understand or do not understand? Is it not your business
   to confess your sin and go and seek mercy at the hands of the Most
   High? What degree of knowledge will excuse you if you neglect this
   chief duty? Those points which are worth your knowing, God will teach
   you in due time by His Spirit. I beseech you, attend to the main
   business which is that you should be saved from sin by faith in the
   Lord Jesus!

   Another very cunning trick which is often practiced by sinners who are
   full of guile is this--they pass on to other people anything which is
   uncomfortably applicable to themselves. It seemed as if the preacher
   had made a cap specially to fit that head, but the result was that the
   person who watched the making exclaimed, "Dear me! How well he has
   taken my neighbor's measure." The letter is meant for him, but he puts
   it in another envelope, drops it into his friend's mailbox

   and runs away! If there is a solemn warning for unregenerate men, he
   does not see its bearing on himself. He perceives somebody in the crowd
   who needs just such a serious word and he hopes that it will be useful
   to him.

   You will hear him sometimes say after a sermon in which almost every
   point has been put personally to himself, "I cannot think how our
   friend Smith could keep his seat while the pastor was dealing so
   faithfully with him." "You are the man" is an application as much
   needed now as ever, for it is one of the common tricks of sinners to
   get another to wear their robes that they, themselves, may pass
   unwounded through the battle. Alas for such wretched deceit!

   One sorry piece of craft which Satan teaches to many is to make them
   doubt, or pretend to doubt, anything in Scripture which frowns upon
   them. If they find that, dying as they are, they will be driven from
   the Presence of God forever, they comfort themselves by recollecting
   that a wise man has discovered that everlasting does not mean forever!
   And they hear that a clever Divine has found out that there is to be a
   general jail release in Hell and everybody is to be admitted into
   Heaven in due time. They hear this and they hear that--and as drowning
   men catch at straws, so do they cling to any new inventions which
   promise them ease in their sins. They lay the flattering unction of
   false doctrine to their souls as if it were the balm of Gilead.

   "Perhaps it may be so," they say, and thus they risk their future
   happiness upon so poor a chance as the hope that, perhaps, these modern
   thinkers may turn out to be right and the plain teaching of Scripture
   prove to be a mistake! It is a wonderfully easy thing to make yourself
   out to be an honest skeptic and from this earthwork to assail your
   assailants. And yet all the while you may have no doubt at all, but in
   the core of your heart you may, like the devil, believe and tremble!
   Ah, you pretended doubters! If you were stretched on a dying bed, you
   would believe the old Revelation, fast enough, and begin to cry out for
   mercy in the fear which the approach of death would bring upon you!

   Half the men who talk so much about their not believing, believe a
   great deal more than they would like to admit-- but they dare not test
   their own imaginary infidelity by spending an hour alone in their
   chamber at eventide and looking into their own hearts. There are many
   hypocritical Believers, but are there not quite as many pretended
   unbelievers to whom doubting is a mere sop to quiet the cerberus of
   their conscience? Guile plays its part with the human intellect and
   conjures up an army of ghosts in the form of doubts--but when the sun
   of the Truth of God arises, they immediately disappear.

   Let us examine another product of the deceit of the natural heart.
   While yet they are far from God, many calm and quiet themselves with
   outward religion. They never pray in sincerity--neither does their
   heart speak at any time with God--and yet they dare not go to bed at
   night without kneeling down at their bedside and repeating a form of
   prayer! They have never repented of sin and yet they will repeat words
   of confession most humbly. They do not praise the Lord in sincerity and
   yet their voices may be heard in Psalm and hymn. On the Lord's Day they
   go up to the House of God and sit there and do as God's people do--and
   they would not be easy if they did not do so--but their heart is in
   none of the worship.

   Far be it from me to discourage even outward reverence, but it is a
   strange cheat that a man puts upon himself when he supposes that mere
   formal, heartless worship can be a reason for peace of mind! To have
   mocked God with solemn sounds upon a thoughtless tongue ought not to be
   a ground of comfort! Repeating words of prayer without life and feeling
   should rather move us to self-condemnation than to self-congratulation!
   How can men feel content with rending their garments when the Lord bids
   them rend their hearts? O Sirs, if you do not pray with your hearts,
   what are all your forms worth? What are bended knees without broken
   hearts? If you do not, indeed, repent of sin and lay hold on Christ,
   what are all your Church goings, or your Chapel goings, however
   constant they may be? Of what good can external religion be to you
   while you deny to God the homage of your minds? And yet too many wrap
   themselves up in this garment of guile.

   There are others who conceal in the secret of their hearts a
   blasphemous notion which they hardly dare to put into words, but it
   amounts to this--the reason why they are not saved is not by any means
   due to themselves. They reject the Savior and refuse to leave their
   sins, but they are not to blame for it! In fact, they dare not actually
   say so, but they insinuate that the blame of their condition lies with
   God, Himself! They have been waiting, but Grace has not come! They are
   quite ready, but God is not! They are poor victims of adverse fate and
   rather to be pitied than condemned! Or so they endeavor to make out for
   themselves. Distorted truth is used to support their lies and
   conscience is drugged into a

   dangerous slumber. Thus do men trick themselves out of their souls with
   sophistical arguments forged by him who from the beginning is a
   murderer and a liar!

   Be not hoodwinked by this slanderous falsehood, but read God's Word
   where He declares, "As I live, says the Lord, I have no pleasure in the
   death of him that dies, but that he turn unto Me and live." He
   testifies that He waits to be gracious and all day long stretches out
   His hands to a disobedient and gainsaying generation! What a strong
   delusion is this, when men dare to lay their blood at God's door and
   make Him to be the Author of their sin! In their consciences they know
   better, but their inward crookedness delights in lies.

   Perhaps the most numerous victims of this guile are those who flatter
   themselves that they will be right some day. They have been hearers of
   the Gospel for 20 years and are not saved--but they have a full
   persuasion that they shall not die as they are now. They nurse the fond
   idea that one of these days it will be convenient for them to seek the
   Lord. The convenient day has never come, yet, but still they think it
   will. There will be a favored hour and a peculiar time--and they half
   promise that it shall not be very much longer. O you who play at
   procrastination! You are knaves to your own souls! Think about it--if
   you resolve that you will repent in a year's time, what is that but a
   daring defiance of God by declaring that you will continue in sin for
   12 more months, at least? Have you ever looked at it in that light?

   Even if a man knew that he would live a year and that on this day 12
   months from now he would carry out his resolution to become a
   Christian, yet if he should make such a resolution, what would it
   amount to but this--"I mean for 12 months to refuse the Savior's claims
   and remain an enemy to God"? Do you think that he who thus resolves is
   in a hopeful condition? If he is determined to rebel against his Lord
   for 12 months, do you not conclude that at the end of the year he will
   be a worse man and be even less likely to yield himself to God?

   Thus have I exposed a few of the many "knavish tricks" by which our
   unrenewed hearts manifest their deceit. May God the eternal Spirit
   bless the searching word to all who are deceiving themselves.

   II. But now, secondly, THE PARDONED MAN GIVES EVIDENCE OF CEASING FROM
   THIS GUILE, for, in

   the first place, he makes an open confession of his sin to God. Here he
   stands before the Most High and cries, "God be merciful to me, a
   sinner," for he feels his guiltiness. He takes his fault and
   criminality to himself and does not cloak his iniquity. He admits that
   he has sinned against Heaven and in the Presence of the Most High. This
   he does all the more freely because he has no motive to do otherwise.
   Why should he hide his sin? There is full forgiveness for him! Why
   should he deny it when the precious blood of Christ is ready to put it
   all away?

   I think the most honest confession is that which falls from the
   Believer's lips when he gazes upon the--

   "Fountain filled with blood, Drawn from Immanuel's veins." "There,"
   says a creditor to his debtor, "you owe me a great deal of money, but
   if you will bring me the account, I will receipt it all." My Friend,
   would you not willingly put down all you owed in such a case? Ah, I
   think you would rather put down too much than too little when such a
   promise was before you! You would be afraid lest you should overlook
   anything and would be eager to make a clean breast of all your
   liabilities. And so when the Lord Jesus gives a full pardon to the soul
   that believes in Him, it is sure to be met with a full confession. How
   could it be otherwise?

   The pardoned man has, also, done with all sorts of excuses. He does not
   try to set his virtues in a brighter light than that of Truth of God or
   to make his sins appear less heinous than they are. He confesses all
   their guilt and heartily humbles himself in the sight of God. The lowly
   words in the language he loves best. The lowest place in the synagogue
   is his choice. Once he boasted that he was almost a saint, but now he
   admits that he is altogether a sinner. You shall hear no extenuations,
   excuses, or denials. The man beholds the pardon of God and it makes him
   honest.

   Now he desires to know the worst of his case and longs to be searched
   and probed. He who has found peace through Jesus Christ surrenders the
   keys of the most secret chambers of his soul and asks for inspection.
   "O Lord," he says, "I pray You make sure work with my case. I beseech
   You cut from my heart this dreadful cancer of sin, even though the
   painful knife must follow every root of the hideous evil, for I desire
   Truth in the inward parts and the complete eradication of the love of
   sin." He is not content to make the outside of the cup and platter
   clean and leave the inward part filthy, but he cries for inward
   cleansing and for renewal in the hidden fountains of thought and
   action.

   Now he courts Divine investigation and begs his Redeemer to let the
   winnowing fan discover and remove his chaff. Now would he put himself
   in the full blaze of Jehovah's light and desire the consuming fire to
   burn up his dross. He

   cultivates heart-searching and practices daily repentance. He
   continually desires a lowly estimate of himself because he feels that
   self-abhorrence endears Christ to his heart as the great Savior of
   unworthy ones. He would rather have a little true Grace than abound in
   great pretensions and he considers the lowest place among the children
   of God to be better than he deserves.

   Sincerity has, also, entered into the sinner's belief in the terrible
   things of God's Word. He now sees their certainty and their justice and
   does not pretend to question them. He is one who trembles at the Word
   of the Lord and he leaves the cavilers to do their daring work alone.
   He knows in his own conscience that there is a Hell. He confesses,
   also, that it is just that there should be such a place of punishment
   and he only marvels that he has not been driven there, himself. Such a
   man now wishes to be dealt with personally and impartially whenever he
   reads a book or hears a sermon. He does not want the preacher to speak
   to others and leave him out. No, but he has come hungering and
   thirsting after the Word and he opens his mouth and pants for his
   portion.

   And if, instead of getting comfort, he is to receive rebuke, he is
   reverently ready to receive it so long as it shall be for his real
   good. He is ready to take bitter medicine, for he is anxious to be
   healed. He lays bare his breast, for he desires the heavenly Surgeon to
   inflict any wound rather than leave the heart of stone within his
   flesh. He delights in the searching Word, and the more closely it tries
   and tests him the more thankful he is for it. The pardoned man, also,
   desires everything that he does to be true. He is often afraid to pray
   in public lest he should say more than he feels. When he rises from his
   knees in private, he frequently questions himself--"Has it been real
   devotion? Did I really mean all that I said?" He catechizes himself
   lest he should be a hypocrite!

   And I have known a man, whose sins have been pardoned, when he has
   dared to preach a sermon, sit down afterwards and take all his
   sentences to pieces lest he should have said more than he altogether
   knew and actually felt, for he was exceedingly afraid of going beyond
   the line of his actual knowledge. The saved soul hates paste gems and
   mimic jewels. He desires to have true precious stones or none at all.
   He is afraid of shams. He wants to be real in all things and,
   therefore, he sometimes doubts his own safety because he is in the
   habit of pulling himself to pieces--to dissect his heart and to see
   whether it is sound all through. This habit may be carried to excess,
   but, in itself, it is an exceedingly good one. It is infinitely better
   than the dishonesty of setting down all our gilt as gold.

   The really pardoned man, also, desires to be rid of all sin. I know
   some who can never hope to obtain forgiveness, for they continue in
   their iniquity. Can a woman expect to find peace with God while she
   goes on taking her sly drop and becoming intoxicated in private? Can a
   man find joy in God who still clings to the drunk's vice? Will God
   receive into His favor those who continue to practice dishonesty in
   trade? Shall sin be fondled and yet pardoned? No one dares to expect it
   and yet deceitful hearts attempt to think so. They will condemn other
   people's pet sins and yet excuse their own! They pretend much sorrow
   for sin in general, but hold to one favorite sin in particular.

   Their delicate Agag must live! Kill all the rest, but surely, as to
   this one, the bitterness of death has passed! O Sirs, be not
   deceived--you must be willing for all sin to go! If you desire one sin
   to live, you will not live yourself! The honest-hearted sinner--he whom
   the Lord absolves of iniquity--desires to see all his sins brought
   forth and hung up like the kings whom Joshua found in the cave at
   Makkedah--hung up in the face of the sun that they might die the
   death--

   "The dearest idol I have known, Whatever that idol be, Help me to tear
   it from Your Throne, And worship only Thee."

   We are not perfect, but every really pardoned man wishes that he were
   so. Though there are sins into which we fall, there are no sins which
   we love. Though we come short of the Glory of God, yet we do not rest
   happy in falling short, and we can never be wholly content till it is
   no longer so with us.

   Beloved, the pardoned man is cleansed from the guile which would ask
   for quarter for darling sins. He seeks after perfect purity of life and
   he has heartily ceased from guile, for now, as an heir of Heaven, he
   lives in the Presence of God and delights to remember the all-seeing
   eye. Now he does not say to God, "Depart from me: I desire not the
   knowledge of Your ways," but he looks upon every action of every day as
   done before his Father's face. He needs nothing but the Truth of God
   and that which will bear the test of the Judgment Day. Beloved, I can
   well understand why a pardoned man becomes a man without
   deceit--because his pardon is a real pardon--there is no fiction in it.
   God justifies him, but He does not justify him by a deception, as some
   have blasphemously ventured to say.

   No, but there is my sin. Christ took it and was punished for it and,
   therefore, my sin was honestly put away without any violation of
   justice, for Christ has made a full Atonement for it--and so my sin has
   justly ceased to be! Why, with such an honest foundation as that, an
   honest pardon may well make an honest man! God makes the Believer
   righteous-- righteous beyond dispute. His faith is counted to him for
   righteousness, seeing he has believed in Jesus Christ, and that is a
   righteousness which, at the Last Great Day, will stand the test of the
   most searching enquiry! The man is saved on honest principles and,
   therefore, from now on there are no tricks for him. He stands erect and
   fears no accuser while he cries, "Who shall lay anything to the charge
   of God's elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns? It
   is Christ that died, yes, rather that is risen again, who is even at
   the right hand of God, who, also, makes intercession for us."

   The lesson from the whole is this--be honest. Sinner, may God make you
   honest. Do not deceive yourself! Make a clean breast of it before God.
   Have an honest religion, or have none at all. Have a religion of the
   heart, or else have none. Put aside the mere vestment and garment of
   piety and let your soul be right within. Be honest. And you who are
   Christians, remember that your blessedness will never be enjoyed by
   yourselves unless you continue to be without guile. Some Christians
   live rather by policy than by honesty--I hope they are Christians, but
   I am not sure--for their life is full of scheming. They never go
   straight. They would not care to go straight--they like going a little
   round about just to show that they can dodge in and out. There are men
   of this sort in business and you need not go out of your road to meet
   them. Even their thinking seems to revolve on a wheel--all round about
   and round about.

   Now, Friends, you will never be happy while you act craftily. The only
   life in which a man can enjoy the blessedness of pardoned sin is a
   downright straightforward life. Be like clear glass so that all who
   choose to do so may see right through you. There is a way of living
   guardedly in which you never speak your mind, but are diplomatic and
   reserved. You take your words out of your mouth and look at them--and
   judge what other people will think of them. And then you put the best
   of them back again. There is a system of living, as it were, in armor,
   buckled up, with your visor down--you never dare show your real self,
   but maintain great prudence and reserve. What is this but to live in
   fetters? I would sooner die at once--

   "I would rather not be, as live to be In awe of such a thing as I
   myself." To speak his heart and to act honestly is, to a true Believer,
   the path of peace and happiness. If any man chooses another path and
   tries diplomacy and policy, so he may, but as sure as he lives he will
   come to a sorrowful ending and find that such a course is not a way
   which God approves, nor will He let His servants have peace in it. May
   God, in His infinite mercy, bring us all to follow Jesus, trusting in
   His blood and treading in His footsteps! And to Him be glory forever
   and ever. Amen.

How Is Salvation Received?

   (No. 1347)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 1, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by Grace; to the end the
   promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the
   Law, but to that, also, which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the
   father of us all." Romans 4:16.

   WE shall turn during yet another Sabbath morning to one of the great
   vital Truths of the Gospel. I feel it to be more and more important to
   bring forward the fundamental doctrines since they are, in certain
   quarters, placed so much in the background. I met with a remark the
   other day that even the evangelical pulpit needs to be evangelized--I
   am afraid it is too true and, therefore, we will give such prominence
   to the Gospel and to its central Doctrine of Justification by Faith,
   that no such remark shall be applicable to us. We have heard it said
   that if an instrument could be invented which would serve the same
   purpose towards sermons as the lactometer does towards milk, you would,
   with great difficulty, be able to discover any trace of the
   unadulterated milk of the Word of God in large numbers of modern
   discourses.

   I shall not subscribe to any sweeping censure, but I am afraid there is
   too much ground for the accusation. In abundance of sermons, the polish
   of the rhetoric is greatly in excess of the weight of the doctrine and
   "the wisdom of words" is far more conspicuous than the Cross of Christ.
   Besides, the Gospel is always needed. There are always some persons who
   urgently need it and will perish unless they receive it. It is a matter
   of hourly necessity! There may be finer and more artistic things to
   speak about than the simplicities of Christ, but there are certainly no
   more useful and requisite things.

   The signposts at the crossroads bear very simple words, generally
   consisting of the names of the towns and villages to which the roads
   lead. But if these were painted out and their places supplied with
   stanzas from Byron, or stately lines from Milton, or deep thoughts from
   Cowper or Young, I am afraid there would be grievous complaints from
   persons losing their way! They would declare that however excellent the
   poetry might be, they thought it an impertinence to mock them with a
   verse when they needed plain directions as to the king's highway! So
   let those who will, indulge in poetical thoughts and express them in
   high-flown language--it shall be ours to set up the signposts marking
   out the way of salvation and to keep them painted in letters large and
   plain--so that he who runs may read.

   There is another reason for giving the Gospel over and over, again and
   again. It is the reason which makes the mother tell her child 20 times,
   namely, because 19 times are not enough! Men are so forgetful about the
   things of Christ and their minds are so apt to step aside from the
   Truth of God, that when they have learned the Gospel they are very
   easily bewitched by falsehood and are readily deceived by that "other
   gospel" which is not another! Therefore we need to give them "line upon
   line and precept upon precept." I scarcely remember the old rustic
   rhyme, but I remember hearing it sung in my boyish days when the
   country people were planting beans according to the old plan of putting
   three into each hole--I think it ran thus--

   "One for the worm and one for the crow, And let us hope the other will
   grow." We must be content to plant many seeds in the hope that one will
   take root and bear fruit! The worm and crow are always at work and will
   be sure to get their full share of our sowing and, therefore, let us
   sow the more! Come we, then, to our text and to the Gospel of faith.
   Last Lord's Day the theme was, "For whom is the Gospel meant?" And the
   reply was, for sinners. The question, today, is, "How is the Gospel
   received?" The answer is, by faith. Our first head shall be the fact--
   "it is of faith." Secondly, the first reason for this-- "that it might
   be by Grace." And thirdly, the further reason-- "to the end that the
   promise might be sure to all the seed."

   I. First, then, here is THE FACT--it is of faith. What does the "it"
   refer to? It is of faith. If you will read the context, I think you
   will consider that it refers to the promise, although some have said
   that the antecedent word or thought is, "the inheritance." This matters
   very little, if at all--it may mean the inheritance, the Covenant, or
   the promise, for these are one. To give a wide word which will take in
   all--the blessedness which comes to a man in Christ, the blessedness
   promised by the Covenant of Grace is of faith--in one word, salvation
   is offaith!

   And what is faith? It is believing the promise of God, taking God at
   His word and acting upon that belief by trusting in Him. Some of the
   Puritans used to divide faith improperly, but still instructively, into
   three parts. The first was self-renunciation, which is, perhaps, rather
   a preparation for faith than faith itself. In it a man confesses that
   he cannot trust in himself and so goes out of self and all confidence
   in his own good works. The second part of faith, they said, was
   reliance in which a man, believing the promise of God, trusts Him,
   depends upon Him and leaves his soul in the Savior's hands. And then
   they said the third part of faith was appropriation by which a man
   takes to himself that which God presents in the promise to the
   Believer--he appropriates it as his own, feeds upon it and enjoys it.

   Certainly there is no true faith without self-renunciation, reliance
   and at least a measure of appropriation--where these three are found,
   there is faith in the soul. We shall, however, better understand what
   faith is as we proceed with our subject, if God the Holy Spirit will be
   pleased to enlighten us. Dear Friends, you can easily see that the
   blessing was of faith in Abraham's case--and it is precisely the same
   with all those who, by faith, are the children of believing Abraham!
   First, it was so in the case of Abraham. Abraham obtained the promise
   by faith and not by works nor by the energy of the flesh. He relied
   alone upon the Divine promise.

   We read in the 17th verse--"(As it is written, I have made you a father
   of many nations), before Him whom he believed, even God, who quickens
   the dead and calls those things which are not as though they were."
   Abraham's faith consisted in believing the promise of God and this he
   did firmly and practically. He was far away in Chaldea when the Lord
   called him out and promised to give him a land and a seed. And
   straightway he went forth, not knowing where he went. When he came into
   Canaan, he had no settled resting place, but wandered about in tents,
   still believing most fully that the land in which he sojourned as a
   stranger was his own.

   God promised to give him a seed and yet he had no children. Year
   followed year and in the course of nature he grew old and his wife was
   long past the age of child-bearing--and yet there was no son born to
   them. When at last Ishmael was born, his hope in that direction was
   dashed to the ground, for he was informed that the Covenant was not
   with Ishmael--believing Abraham had stepped aside to carnal expediency
   and had hoped, in that way, to realize the lingering promise! But he
   had 14 more years to wait--till he was 100 years old and till Sarah had
   reached her 90th year! Yet he believed the word of the Lord and fell
   upon his face and laughed with holy joy and said in his heart, "Shall a
   child be born unto him that is 100 years old?" So, too, when Isaac was
   born and grown up, he believed that in Isaac should the Covenant be
   established. Nor did he doubt this when the Lord bade him take Isaac
   and offer him up as a sacrifice! He obeyed without questioning,
   believing that God was able to raise Isaac from the dead, or in some
   other way to keep His word of promise.

   Now consider that we have multiplied promises and those are written
   down in black and white in the Inspired Word, which we may consult at
   any time we please, while Abraham had only, now and then, a verbal
   promise--and yet he clung to it and relied upon it. Though there was
   nothing else to rely upon and neither sign nor evidence of any
   offspring to fulfill the promise that he should be heir of the world
   and father of many nations, yet he needed no other ground of confidence
   but that God had said it and that He would make His word good. There
   was in Abraham, also, an eye to the central point of the promise--the
   Messiah--Jesus, our Lord.

   I do not know that Abraham understood all the spiritual meaning of the
   Covenant made with him. Probably he did not. But he did understand that
   the Christ was to be born of him, in whom all nations should be
   blessed. When the Lord said that He would make him a blessing and in
   him should all nations of the earth be blessed, I do not suppose
   Abraham saw all the fullness of that marvelous word--but he did see
   that he was to be the progenitor of the Messiah. Our Lord, Himself, is
   my Authority for this assertion--"Abraham saw My day, he saw it and was
   glad" (John 8:56). Though there appeared to this man, old and withered,
   with a wife 90 years of age, no likelihood that he should ever become a
   father, yet did he fully believe that he would be the father of many
   nations--and that upon no basis whatever but that the living God had so
   promised him and, therefore, so it must be!

   This faith of Abraham we find considered no difficulties whatever. "Who
   against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many
   nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your seed be. And
   being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when
   he was about 100 years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:
   he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief." Brothers and
   Sisters, these were, in themselves, terrible difficulties--enough to
   make a man fear that the promise did but mock him--but Abraham did not
   consider anything beyond the promise and the God who gave it! The
   difficulties were for God to consider--not for him! He knew that God
   had made the world out of nothing and that He supported all things by
   the word of His power and, therefore, he felt that nothing was too hard
   for Him!

   His own advanced years and the age of his wife were of no consequence.
   He did not take them into the reckoning, but saw only a faithful
   Almighty God and felt content. O noble faith! Faith such as God
   deserves! Faith such as none render to Him but those whom He calls by
   Irresistible Grace! This it was which justified Abraham and made him
   the father of Believers! Abraham's faith, also, gave glory to God. I
   stopped in the middle of the 20th verse just now, but we must now
   complete the reading of it. "But was strong in faith, giving glory to
   God." God had promised and he treated the Lord's promise with becoming
   reverence. He did not impiously suspect the Lord of falsehood, or of
   mocking His servant, or of uttering today what He might take back
   tomorrow.

   Abraham knew that Jehovah is not a man, that He should lie, nor the son
   of man that He should repent. Abraham glorified the Truth of God and,
   at the same time, he glorified His power! He was quite certain that the
   Lord had not spoken beyond His line, but that what He had promised He
   was able to perform. It belongs to puny man to speak more than he can
   do--full often his tongue is longer than his arm--but with the Lord it
   is never so. Has He said, and shall He not do it? Is anything too hard
   for the Lord? Abraham adoringly believed in the immutability, truth and
   power of the living God--and looked for the fulfillment of His words!

   All this strong, unstaggering faith which glorified God rested upon the
   Lord alone. You will see that it was so by reading the 21st verse.
   "Being fully persuaded that, what He had promised, He was able, also,
   to perform." There was nothing whatever in his house, his wife,
   himself, or anywhere else which could guarantee the fulfillment of the
   promise. He had only God to look to--only, did I say?--What could a man
   have more? Yet so it was. There were no signs, marks, tokens, or
   indications to substantiate the confidence of Abraham! He rested solely
   upon the unlimited power of God! And this, dear Brothers and Sisters,
   is the kind of faith which God loves and honors--which needs no signs,
   marks, evidences, helps, or other buttresses to support the plain and
   sure Word of the Lord--but simply knows that Jehovah has said it and
   that He will make it good!

   Though all things should give the promise the lie, we believe in it
   because we believe in God. True faith ridicules impossibility and pours
   contempt upon improbability, knowing that Omnipotence and Immutability
   cannot be thwarted or hindered. Has God said it? Then so it is! Dictum!
   Factum! Spoken! Done! These two are one with the Most High! Well, now,
   the faith of every man who is saved must be of this character. Every
   man who receives salvation receives it by a faith like that of Abraham,
   for, my Brothers and Sisters, when we are saved we, too, take the
   promise of God and depend upon it! To one Believer, one Word of God is
   applied. To another, some sweet Word, most sure and steadfast, is
   discovered upon which we fix our hope and find an anchor for our
   spirit. Yes, and as we search the Word by faith--we take each promise
   as we find it and we say, "this is true," and, "this is true," and so
   we rest upon all of them!

   Is it not so with all of you who have peace with God? Did you not gain
   it by resting upon the promises of God as you found it in the Word and
   as it was opened up to you by the Holy Spirit? Have you any other
   ground of confidence but God's promise? I know you have not, my
   Brethren, nor do you desire any! And we, also, believe in God over the
   head of great difficulties. If it were difficult for Abraham to believe
   that a son should be born to him, I think it is harder for a poor
   burdened sinner, conscious of his great guilt--conscious that God must
   punish him, also, for that guilt--to believe, nevertheless, in the
   hopeful things which the Gospel prophesies unto him!

   Can I believe that the righteous God is looking upon me, a sinner, with
   eyes of love? Can I believe that though I have offended Him and broken
   all His Laws, He, nevertheless, waits to be gracious to me? While my
   heart is heavy and the prospect is black around me and I see nothing
   but a terrible Hell to be my eternal portion--can I, at such a time,
   believe that God has planned my redemption and given His Son to die for
   me--and that now He invites me to come and receive a full, perfect and
   immediate pardon at His hands? Can the Gospel message be true to such a
   worthless rebel as I am?

   It seems as if the Law and Justice of God set themselves against the
   truth of such wonderful deeds of mercy as the Gospel announces! And it
   is hard for a stricken heart to believe the report--but the faith which
   saves the soul believes the Gospel promise in the teeth of all its
   alarms and, notwithstanding, all the thunders of the Law! Despite the
   trepidation of the awakened spirit, the Holy Spirit enables it to
   accept the great Father's promise, to rest upon the propitiation which
   He has set forth and to quiet itself with the firm persuasion that God,
   for Christ's sake, does put away its sin.

   At the same time another grand miracle is also believed in, namely,
   regeneration. This seems to me to be quite as great an act of faith as
   for Abraham to believe in the birth of a child by two parents who were
   both advanced in years. The case stands thus--here am I, dead by
   nature--dead in trespasses and sins. The deadness of Abraham and Sarah,
   according to nature, was not greater than the deadness of my soul to
   every good thing. Is it possible, then, that I should live unto God?
   That within this stony heart there should yet throb eternal life and
   Divine Love? That I should come to delight in God? Can it be that with
   such a depraved and deceitful heart as mine should yet rise to
   fellowship with the holy God and should call Him my Father and feel the
   spirit of adoption within my heart?

   Can I, who now dread the Lord, yet come to rejoice in Him? "Oh," says
   the poor troubled sinner, "can I, that have fought against the Throne
   of God. I that even tried to doubt His existence--can I ever come to be
   at perfect peace with Him so that He shall call me His friend and
   reveal His secrets to me and listen to my voice in prayer? Is it
   possible?" The faith which saves the soul believes in the possibility
   of regeneration and sanctification--no, more--it believes in Jesus and
   obtains for us power to become children of God and strength to conquer
   sin! This is believing God, indeed!

   Look this way, yet again, for here is another difficulty. We know that
   we must persevere to the end, for only he that endures to the end shall
   be saved. Does it not seem incredible that such feeble, fickle, foolish
   creatures as we are should continue in faith and the fear of God all
   our lives? Yet this we must do! The faith which saves, enables us to
   believe that we shall persevere, for it is persuaded that the Redeemer
   is able to keep that which we have committed unto Him, that He will
   perfect that which concerns us, that He will suffer none to pluck us
   out of His hands and that having begun the good work in us He will
   carry it on! This is faith worthy of the father of the faithful!

   Once again, let us behold another difficulty for faith. We believe,
   according to God's promise, that we shall one day be "without spot or
   wrinkle, or any such thing." I do believe that this head shall wear a
   crown of glory and that this hand shall wave a palm branch. I am fully
   assured that He will one day sweetly say to me--

   "Close your eyes that you may see What I ha ve in store for thee. Lay
   your arms of warfare down, Fall that you may win a crown." We, all, who
   are Believers in Jesus, shall one day be without fault before the
   Throne of God! But how is this to be? Surely our confidence is that He
   who has promised it is able to perform it! This is the faith which
   finds its way to Glory--the faith which expects to enter into the
   Redeemer's joy because of the Redeemer's love and life!

   Brothers and Sisters, in this matter we see the difficulties, but we do
   not consider them--we count them as less than nothing since Omnipotence
   has come into the field. "Thanks be unto God which gives us the victory
   through our Lord Jesus Christ." We know that our Redeemer lives and
   that because He lives, we shall, also--live and be with Him where He
   is! At the end of the chapter we are told that this saving faith rests
   in the power of God as manifested in Jesus-- "If we believe in Him who
   was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our
   justification." Beloved, we believe that Jesus died, as certainly died
   as ever any man died--and yet on the morning of the third day He rose
   again from the dead by Divine power.

   It is not, to us, an incredible thing that God should raise the dead!
   We, therefore, believe that because God has raised the dead He has
   raised us, also, from our death in sin and that He will raise our
   bodies from the tomb after they shall have slept, awhile, in the earth.
   We believe, also, that our Lord Jesus died for our offenses and put
   them away. Our faith builds upon the substitution of the Lord Jesus on
   our behalf and it rests there with firm confidence. We believe, also,
   that He rose again because His substitution was accepted and because
   our offenses were forever put away--rose again to prove that we are
   justified in Him! This is where we stand! I expect to be saved, not at
   all because of what I am, nor of what I can do, nor because of anything
   I ever shall be able to be or to do--but only because God has promised
   to save those who believe in Jesus Christ through what the Lord Jesus
   has suffered in their place.

   Because Jesus has risen to prove that His suffering was accepted on the
   behalf of Believers, there do we rest and trust, and that is the way in
   which every Believer is saved--that way and no way else. Even as
   Abraham believed, so do we! Here is the fact--it is of faith.

   II. Now we come to the second point. Here we are to consider THE FIRST
   REASON why God has chosen to make salvation by faith, "that it might be
   of Grace." Now, dear Friends, the Lord might have willed to make the
   condition of salvation a mitigated form of works. If He had done so, it
   would not have been of Grace, for it is a principle which I need not
   explain now, but a fixed principle, that if the blessing is of Grace it
   is no more of works, otherwise Grace is no more Grace. And if it is of
   works, it is no more of Grace, otherwise work is no more work.

   As water and oil will not mix, and as fire and water will not lie down
   side by side in quiet, so neither will the principle of merit and the
   principle of free favor. You cannot make a legal work to be a condition
   of a gracious blessing without at once introducing an alien element and
   really bringing the soul under the Covenant of Works and so spoiling
   the whole plan of mercy! Grace and faith are congruous and will draw
   together in the same chariot, but Grace and merit are contrary, the one
   to the other, and pull opposite ways and, therefore, God has not chosen
   to yoke them together. He will not build with incongruous materials or
   daub with untempered mortar. He will not make an image partly of gold
   and partly of clay, nor weave a linsey-woolsey garment--His work is all
   of one piece and that one piece is all Grace!

   Again, in Abraham's case, inasmuch as he received, by faith, the
   blessing which God promised him, it is very evident that it was of
   Grace. You never heard anyone ascribe Abraham's salvation to his merits
   and yet Abraham was an eminently holy man. There are specks in his
   life--and in whose life will there not be found infirmities?--but he
   was one of the grandest characters of history. Still, no man thinks of
   Abraham as a self-justifying person, or as at all related to the
   Pharisee who said, "God, I thank You that I am not as other men." I
   never heard anybody hint that the great Patriarch had reason to glory
   before God. His name is not " the father of the innocent," but, "the
   father of the faithful."

   When we read of Abraham's life, we see that God called him by an act of
   Sovereign Grace, made a Covenant with him as an act of Grace and that
   the promised child was born--not of the power of the flesh, but
   entirely according to promise. Grace reigns through righteousness unto
   eternal life in the life of the Patriarch and it is illustrated in a
   thousand ways whenever we see his faith receiving the promises! The
   holiness of Abraham, since it arose out of his faith, never leads us to
   ascribe his blessedness to anything but the Grace of God!

   Now, inasmuch as we are saved by faith, every Believer is made to see
   in himself that, in his own instance, it is by Grace. Believing is such
   a self-renounciating act that no man who looks for eternal life thereby
   ever talked about his own merits except to count them but dross and
   dung. No, Brothers and Sisters, the child of the promise cannot live in
   the same house with the son of the bondwoman. When Isaac grows up,
   Ishmael must depart--the principle of believing unto everlasting life
   will not endure a hint about human merit. Those who believe in
   Justification by Faith are the only persons who can believe in
   salvation by Grace!

   The Believer may grow in Grace till he becomes fully assured of his own
   salvation, yes, and he may become holiness unto the Lord in a very
   remarkable manner, being wholly consecrated to God in body, soul and
   spirit. But you will never hear the believing man speak of his
   experience, or attainments, or achievements as a reason for glorying in
   himself, or as an argument for becoming more confident as to his
   safety. He dares not trust his works, or states of feeling, for he
   feels that he stands by faith. He cannot get away from simple faith,
   for the moment he attempts to do so, he feels the ground going from
   under him and he begins to sink into horrible confusion of spirit.
   Therefore he returns to his rest and resolves to abide in faith in his
   risen Savior, for there he abides in the Grace of God.

   Through the prominence given to faith, the Truth of God of salvation by
   Grace is so conspicuously revealed that even the outside world is
   compelled to see it, though the only result may be to make them raise
   trivial objections. They charge us with preaching too much concerning
   Grace because they hear us magnifying and extolling the plan of
   salvation by faith. They readily perceive that a gift promised to faith
   must be a gift of Grace and not a reward for services done. Only begin
   to preach salvation by works or ceremonies and nobody will accuse you
   of saying too much of Grace! But keep to faith and you are sure to keep
   to the preaching of Grace!

   Moreover, faith never did clash with Grace. When the sinner comes and
   trusts Christ and Christ says to him, "I forgive you freely by My
   Grace," Faith says, "O Lord, that is what I need and what I believe in.
   I ask You to deal with me even so." "But if I give you everlasting
   life, it will not be because you deserve it, but for My own name's
   sake." Faith

   replies, "O Lord, that, also, is precisely as I desire! It is the sum
   and substance of my prayer." When Faith grows strong and takes to
   pleading in prayer (and oh how mighty she is with God in supplication,
   moving His Omnipotence to her mind), yet all her pleadings are based on
   Grace--none of them upon the merit of the creature! Never yet did Faith
   borrow weapons from Mount Sinai! Never once did she ask as though the
   favor were a debt, but she always holds to the promise of the gracious
   God and expects all things from the faithfulness of her God.

   Yes, and when Faith grows strongest and attains to her highest stature
   and is most full of delight, so that she dances for very joy, yet she
   never, in all her exultation, boasts or exalts herself! Where is
   boasting, then? It is excluded! By the Law of works? No, but by the Law
   offaith! Faith and carnal boasting never yet walked together! If a man
   should boast of the strength of his faith, it would be clear evidence
   that he had none at all, or at least that he had, for the time, fallen
   into vainglorious presumption. Boasting? No, Faith loves to lie low and
   behave herself as a little child. And when she lifts herself up, it is
   to exalt her Lord, and her Lord, alone.

   Faith, too, is well calculated to show forth the Grace of God, because
   Faith is the child of Grace. "Ah," says Faith, "I have grasped the
   Covenant. I have laid hold on the promises, I have seen Christ, I have
   gazed into Heaven, I have enjoyed foretastes of eternal joys! But (she
   says) I am of the operation of God--I would never have existed if the
   Spirit of God had not created me!" The Believer knows that his faith is
   not a weed suitable to the soil of his heart, but a rare plant--an
   exotic which has been planted there by Divine Wisdom--and he knows,
   too, that if the Lord does not nourish it, his faith will die like a
   withered flower.

   He knows that his faith is a perpetual miracle, for it is begotten,
   sustained and preserved by a power not less mighty than that which
   raised our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead! If I met with an angel in a
   hovel I should know that he was not born there, but that he came from
   above. And so is it with faith--its heavenly descent is manifest to
   all! Faith, then, tracing her very existence to Grace, never can be
   anything but the friend, the vindicator, the advocate and the glorifier
   of the Grace of God--therefore it is of faith that it might be by
   Grace!

   III. Now, thirdly, there is A FURTHER REASON for faith and Grace being
   the Lord's chosen method of salvation--"To the end that the promise
   might be sure to all the seed." Look at this, dear Friends, very
   carefully. Salvation was made to be of faith and not of works that the
   promise might be sure to all the seed, for first, it could not have
   been sure to us Gentiles by the Law, because in a certain sense we were
   not under the Law of Moses at all. Turn to the text and you find that
   it runs thus--"Sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the
   Law, but to that, also, which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the
   father of us all."

   That is to say, the Jew, receiving the seal of circumcision and coming
   under the ceremonial Law, eating its Passover and presenting its
   sacrifices, might possibly have been reached by a legal method. But we
   who are Gentiles would have been altogether shut out. As to the
   Covenant according to the flesh, we are aliens and have never come
   under its bonds or participated in its privileges and, therefore, Grace
   chooses to bless us by faith in order that the Gentile may partake of
   the blessing of the Covenant as well as the Jew.

   But there is a still wider reason--it is of faith because the other
   method has failed, already, in every case. We have all broken the Law
   and so have put ourselves beyond the power of ever receiving blessing
   as a reward of merit. Failure at the outset has ruined our future
   prospects--and from now on--by the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be
   justified. What remains, then, if we are to be saved at all, but that
   it should be of faith? This door, alone, is open! Let us bless God that
   no man can shut it!

   Again, it is of faith that it might be sure. Now, under the system of
   works nothing is sure. Suppose, my dear Brothers and Sisters, you were
   under a Covenant of salvation by works and you had fulfilled those
   works up till now, yet you would not be sure. Are you 70 years of age
   and have you kept your standing till now? Well, you have done a great
   deal more than father Adam did, for though he was a perfect man without
   any natural corruption, I do not suppose that he kept his first estate
   for a day. But after all you have done for these long years you may
   lose everything before you have finished your next meal! If your
   standing depends upon your own works, you are not safe and can never be
   safe till you are out of this present life, for you might sin and that
   one offense against the conditions would destroy the Covenant!

   "When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity,
   he shall even die thereby." But see the excellence of salvation by
   Grace--when you reach the ground of faith in the promises, you are upon
   terra firma and your soul is no longer in jeopardy. Here is a sure
   foundation, for the Divine promise cannot fail! If my salvation depends
   upon

   the Lord and is received by me on the ground that the Lord has decreed
   it, promised it in Covenant and ensured it to me by the blood of Jesus
   Christ, then it is so mine that neither life nor death nor Satan nor
   the world shall ever rob me of it! If I live to the age of Methuselah,
   my faith will have the same promises to rest upon--and clinging there
   she will defy the lapse of years to change her immutable security.

   The promise would not be sure to one of the seed by any other means
   than that of Grace through faith, but now it is sure to all the seed.
   Moreover, if the promise had been made to works, there are some of the
   seed to whom, most evidently, it never could come. One of the seed of
   Abraham hung dying upon a cross and within an hour or two his bones
   were broken that he might the more quickly die and be buried. Now, if
   salvation to that poor dying thief must come by works, how can he be
   saved? His hands and feet are fastened up and he is in the very grip of
   Death--what can he do? The promise would not have been sure to him, my
   Brothers and Sisters, if there had been any active condition! But he
   believed, cast a saving eye upon the Lord Jesus and said, "Lord,
   remember me," and the promise was most sure to him, for the answer
   was--"Today shall you be with Me in Paradise"!

   Many a chosen one of God is brought into such a condition that nothing
   is possible to him except faith, but Grace has made the act of
   believing divinely possible. Well was it for those bitten by serpents
   that all that was asked of them was a look, for this was possible even
   when the hot venom made the blood boil and scalded all the frame with
   fever! Faith is possible to the blind, the lame, the deaf, the dumb!
   Faith is possible to the almost-idiot, the desponding and the guilty!
   Faith can be possessed by babes and by the extremely aged, by the
   illiterate as well as by the instructed! It is well chosen as the cup
   to convey the living water, for it is not too heavy for the weak, nor
   too huge for the little, nor too small for the full-grown.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, I have done when I have said just this. I
   will ask you who have believed in Christ, one question--you who are
   resting in the promise of God, you who are depending upon the finished
   work of Him who was delivered for your offenses--how do you feel? Are
   you rejoicing in your unquestionable safety? As I have turned this
   matter over and thought upon it, my soul has dwelt in perfect peace! I
   cannot conceive anything that God Himself could give to the Believer
   which would make him more safe than the work of Christ has made him.
   God cannot lie! Are you not sure of this? He must keep His promises!
   Are you not certain of this? What more do you need? As a little child
   believes its father's words without any question, even so should we
   rest on the bare, naked promise of Jehovah! And in so doing we become
   conscious of a peace that passes all understanding, which keeps our
   hearts and minds by Christ Jesus.

   I dare not say otherwise, nor be silent, for I am conscious of being
   able to say--"therefore being justified by faith, I have peace with
   God." In that place of the soul, much love springs up and inward unity
   to God and conformity to Christ. Faith believes her God and trusts Him
   for time and eternity, for little things and great things, for body and
   for soul and this leads on to still higher results! O blessed God, what
   a union of desire, heart and aim exists between You and the soul that
   trusts You! How are we brought into harmony with Your mind and
   purposes! How is our heart made to delight in You! How completely is
   our soul "bound up in the bundle of life with the soul of the Lord our
   God"!

   We grow up into Him in all things who is our Head, our Life, our All. I
   charge you, dear children of God, "as you have received Christ Jesus
   the Lord, so walk in Him." Live in His peace and abound in it more and
   more. Do not be afraid of being too peaceful, "rejoice in the Lord
   always, and again I say rejoice." When you have to condemn yourself for
   shortcomings, yet do not question the promises of the Lord! When sin
   overcomes you, confess the fault, but do not doubt the pardon which
   Jesus still gives you! When sharp temptations and severe trials arise
   from different quarters, do not suffer them to carry you by storm--let
   not the stronghold and castle of your spirit be captured--"let not your
   heart be troubled." Stagger not at the promise through unbelief, but
   hold to it whether you walk in the sunshine or in Egyptian darkness.
   That which the Lord has promised He is able, also, to perform. Do not
   doubt it! Lean hard on the faithful promise and when you feel sad at
   heart, lean harder and harder still, for, "faithful is He that has
   promised, who, also, will do it."

   Last of all, you sinners here this morning who have heard all about
   this salvation by trusting--I charge you do not rest till you have
   trusted the Lord Jesus Christ and rested in the great promises of God.
   Here is one--"I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
   sins and their iniquities will I remember no more forever." Here is
   another which is very cheering--"Whoever calls upon the name of the
   Lord shall be saved." Call upon Him in prayer and then say, "Lord, I
   have called, and You have said I shall be saved." Here is another
   gracious word--"He that believes and is

   baptized shall be saved." Attend you to these two commands and then
   say, "Lord, I have Your Word for it that I shall be saved, and I hold
   You to it." Believe God, Sinner!

   Oh that He would give you Grace this morning, by His Holy Spirit, to
   say, "How can I do otherwise than believe Him? I dare not doubt Him." O
   poor tried Soul, believe in Jesus so as to trust your guilty soul with
   Him. The more guilty you feel yourself to be, the more is it in your
   power to glorify God by believing that He can forgive and renew such a
   guilty one as you are! If you lie buried like a fossil in the lowest
   stratum of sin, yet He can quarry for you and fetch you up out of the
   horrible pit--and make your dry, petrified heart live! Do you believe
   this? "If you can believe, all things are possible to him that
   believes."

   Trust the promise that He makes to every Believer that He will save
   him! Hold to it, for it is not a vain thing! It is your life! "But what
   if I obtain no joy or peace?" Still, believe the promise, and joy and
   peace will come. "But what if I see no signs?" Ask for no signs! Be
   willing to trust God's Word without any other guarantee but His
   truthful Character and you will thus give Him glory. "Blessed are they
   that have not seen and yet have believed." Believe that Jehovah cannot
   lie and as He has promised to forgive all who believe in Jesus, hang on
   to that Word and you shall be saved!

   Sinners, I have set before you the way of salvation as simply as I can,
   will you have it or not? May the Spirit of God sweetly lead you to say,
   "Have it? Yes, that I will." Then go in peace and rejoice from now on
   and forever! God bless you. Amen.

The Great House and the Vessels In It

   (No. 1348)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 8, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver,
   but, also, of wood and of earth; and some to honor and some to
   dishonor. If a man, therefore, purges himself from these, he shall be a
   vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the Master's use, and
   prepared unto every good work." 2 Timothy 2:20,21.

   ONE of the most serious calamities which can befall a Church is to have
   her own ministers teaching heresy. Yet this is no new thing--it has
   happened from the beginning. Paul and Peter and James and John, in
   their Epistles, had to speak of seducers in the Churches, even in those
   primitive days, and ever since then there have arisen in the very midst
   of the House of God those who have subverted the faith of many and led
   them away from the fundamental Truths of God into errors of their own
   inventing.

   The Apostle compares this to gangrene which is one of the most
   dangerous and deadly mischiefs which can occur to the body. It is
   within the body--it eats deeper and deeper into the flesh, festering
   and putrefying--and if it is not stopped it will continue its ravages
   till life is extinguished by "black mortification." False doctrine and
   an unchristian spirit in the midst of the Church, itself, must be
   regarded as such a gangrene--a silent wolf ravenously gnawing at the
   heart--the vulture of Prometheus devouring the vitals. No external
   opposition is one-half so much to be dreaded!

   Yet here is our comfort when distressed at the evils of the present
   age, among which this is one of the chief, that the Truth of God abides
   forever the same! "The foundation of God stands sure." There is no
   moving that. Whether 10,000 oppose it or promulgate it, the Truth of
   God is still the same in every jot and tittle. Even as the sun shines
   evermore, as well when clouds conceal its brightness as when, from a
   clear sky, it pours abroad a flood of glory, the lovers of profane and
   vain babblings have not taken away from us, nor can they take from us,
   the eternal Truths of God!

   The Lord lives, though they have said, "There is no God." The precious
   blood of Jesus has not lost its efficacy, though divines have beclouded
   the Atonement. The Spirit of God is not less mighty to quicken and to
   console though men have denied His personality. The Resurrection is as
   sure as if Hymenaeus and Philetus had never said that it is passed
   already. And the eternal Covenant of Grace abides forever unbroken
   though Pharisees and Sadducees unite to revile it! The foundation of
   God stands sure and, moreover, the foundation of the Church remains
   sure, also, for, blessed be God, "the Lord knows them that are His."

   All that God has built upon the foundation which He, Himself, has laid,
   keeps its place--not one living stone that He ever laid upon the
   Foundation has been lifted from its resting place. Earthquakes of error
   may test the stability of the building and cause great searching of
   heart, but sooner shall the mountains which are round about Jerusalem
   start from their seats than the work or Word of the Lord be frustrated!
   The things which cannot be shaken remain unaltered in the very worst
   times. "After all," says the Apostle, in effect, though in fewer words,
   "it is not such a very great wonder that there should be persons in the
   Church who are not of the sterling metal of sincerity, nor of the gold
   and silver of Truth which endures the fire. You must not look at
   Hymenaeus and Philetus as if they were prodigies. There have been many
   like they are and there will be many more. These ill weeds grow in all
   ages and they multiply and increase."

   Where, dear Brothers and Sisters, beneath the skies shall we find
   absolute purity in any community? The very first family had a Cain in
   it and there was a wicked Ham even in the select few within the Ark. In
   the household of the father of the faithful there was an Ishmael.
   Isaac, with all his quiet walk with God, must be troubled with an Esau.
   And you know how, in the house of Jacob, there were many sons that
   walked not as they should. When the Church of God was in the wilderness
   and had a barrier of desert between it and the outer world, yet you
   know how Korah, Dathan and Abirain were there, beside many other
   troublers in Israel!

   Yes, even amidst the most select part of the visible Church of God, in
   the priesthood, there were found those that dishonored it. Nadab and
   Abihu were slain with fire before the Lord and Hophni and Phineas died
   in battle because they had made themselves vile, though God's anointed
   priests. Even when our Divine Master had formed for Himself--

   "A little garden, walled around,

   Chosen, and made peculiar ground," in which there were but 12 choice
   trees, yet one of them bore evil fruit. "I have chosen you 12, and one
   of you is a devil." In the great field which Christ has sown, tares
   will spring up among the wheat, for the enemy takes pains to sow them.
   Neither is it possible for us to root them up. In the king's garden,
   briars will grow--thorns, also--and thistles will the most sacred soil
   yield us.

   Even the lilies of Christ grow among thorns. You cannot keep the best
   of Churches altogether pure, for though the Lord Himself has prepared a
   vineyard and make a winepress and built a wall about it, yet the foxes
   come and spoil the vines. And though our great Lord has an orchard
   which yields rare fruit, yet when He comes to visit it, He finds a
   barren fig tree, dug about and fed, it is true, but still barren! Look
   to Christ's fold on earth and behold there are wolves in sheep's
   clothing there! Look to the net which His servants draw to shore and
   there are both good and bad fish in it. Yes, lift your eyes to the
   skies and though there are myriads of stars, yet you shall mark
   wandering stars among them--and meteors which are and are not--and are
   quenched in the blackness of darkness forever. Until we shall come to
   the Heaven of the Most High we must expect to find chaff mixed with the
   wheat, dross with the gold, goats with the sheep and dead flies in the
   ointment. Only let us see to it that we are not of that ill character,
   but are precious in the sight of the Lord.

   Coming to the text, the Apostle suggests the encouragement I have
   already given, under a certain metaphor. He says that in a great house
   there will naturally be varieties of furniture. And there will be
   vessels and utensils of many kinds-- some of them will be of wood and
   of earthenware, for meaner purposes--but others of gold and silver, for
   state occasions--when the honor and glory of the great proprietor are
   to be displayed. There are vessels of precious metal in a great house
   and these are its honor, decking the tables on high festivals when the
   Master is at home. But there are others of baser stuff kept in the
   background, never displayed at times of rejoicing, but meant for common
   drudgery.

   There are cups and flagons of solid silver prized as perpetual
   heirlooms of the family which are carefully preserved. And there are
   plates and pots which are soon worn out and are only of temporary use.
   There are many sets of them being broken up in the lifetime of a
   family. The same is true in the Church of God which, being in the
   world, has its common side and its common vessels. But being, also, a
   heavenly house, the Church has its nobler furniture, far more precious
   than gold which perishes though it is tried with fire.

   For our instruction, may the Holy Spirit help us while we look, first,
   at the great house. Secondly, at the meaner vessels, peeping into the
   kitchen. Thirdly, at the nobler vessels, going into the china cabinet
   to look at the silver and gold. And then, fourthly, before we leave the
   house, let us ask for an interview with the Master, Himself.

   I. First, let us consider THE GREAT HOUSE. The Apostle compares the
   Church to a great house. We feel sure he is not speaking of the world.
   It did not occur to him to speak about the world and it would have been
   altogether superfluous to tell us that in the world there are all sorts
   of people--everybody knows that! The Church is a great house belonging
   to a great Person, for the Church is the House of God, according to the
   promise-- "I will dwell in them, and walk in them."

   The Church is the temple in which the Lord is worshipped, the palace in
   which He rules. It is His castle and place of defense for His Truth. It
   is the armory out of which He supplies His people with weapons. The
   Church is God's mansion in which He abides--"This is My rest forever.
   Here will I dwell for I have desired it." There it is that He rests in
   His love and, in infinite condescension, manifests Himself as He does
   not unto the world. King Solomon built a house for himself in the
   forest of Lebanon, and behold, the Lord has, of living stones, built
   for Himself a far more glorious house where He may abide! It is a great
   house because it is the house of the great God! Who can be so great as
   He? It is a great house because planned and designed upon a great
   scale.

   I fear that some who live in the house have no idea how great it is.
   They have a very faint notion of its length and breadth. The great
   thoughts of God are far beyond their most elevated conception, so that
   He might say to them as He has said to others, "My thoughts are not
   your thoughts, neither are My ways your ways, says the Lord." The
   palace of

   the King of kings is "exceedingly magnificent," and for spaciousness
   far excels all the abodes of earthly princes. We read of the golden
   palace of Nero, that it reached from hill to hill and enclosed lakes
   and streams and gardens beneath its wondrous roof. But behold, the Lord
   has stretched the line of His electing Grace over nations and kindreds
   even to the ends of the earth!

   His house takes in a mighty sweep of humanity. Many are the rooms in
   the house and there are dwellers in one room who have never yet seen
   any part of the great house but the little chamber in which they were
   born! They have never walked through the marvelous corridors, or moved
   in the vast halls which God has built with cedar pillars and cedar
   beams and carved work of heavenly workmanship. Some good men hardly
   care to see the long rows of polished columns, quarried by Grace from
   the rough mass of Nature which now shine resplendent as monuments of
   Divine Love and Wisdom! Colossal is the plan of the Eternal--the Church
   of God is worthy of the infinite mind!

   Angels and principalities delight to study the stupendous plan and well
   they may--as the great Architect unrolls His drawings, piece by piece,
   to let them see the various sections of the complete design, they are
   struck with admiration and exclaim, " Oh the riches of the wisdom and
   the knowledge of God!" The Church is no narrow cottage wherein a few
   may luxuriate in bigotry, but it is a great house, worthy of the
   infinite heart of Jehovah, worthy of the blood of Jesus, the Incarnate
   God, and worthy of the power of the ever-blessed Spirit!

   It is a great house because it has been erected at great cost and with
   great labor. Who can tell the cost of this mansion? It is a price
   beyond price, for God has given His only-begotten Son--He had but one,
   and Heaven could not match Him--that He might redeem unto Himself a
   people who should be His dwelling place forever. Solomon's temple, now
   that they have laid bare a part of the foundations, even though it is
   in utter ruin, astonishes all beholders as they mark the enormous size
   and accurate adjustment of the stones--what must it have been in its
   glory? What cost was lavished on that glorious house!

   But think of the labor and the skill, the Divine art and engineering
   with which Jehovah has hewn out of the rock of sinful nature the stones
   with which He builds up His spiritual house! What energy has the Holy
   Spirit displayed! What resurrection power! Harder than any granite we
   were by nature, yet has He cut us away from the rock of which we formed
   a part and fashioned and squared us--and made us to be built together
   for an habitation of God through the Spirit. Tell it to the praise of
   the glory of His Grace, that the Lord's Omnipotent power and boundless
   wealth of love are revealed in His Church!

   When our eyes shall see the Church of God, at last, in all her beauty
   descending out of Heaven from God, having the Glory of God and her
   light like unto a stone most precious, even like unto a jasper
   stone--when we shall see, I say, that the length and the breadth and
   the height of it are equal--when we shall see its deep foundations laid
   in the eternal purpose and its walls built up with lofty pinnacles of
   glory, high as the Divine Person of her Lord. And when we shall mark
   its wondrous compass, broad enough to hold the glory and honor of the
   nations--then shall we shout for joy as we behold the riches and the
   power and the splendor of the great King of kings who has built for
   Himself this great house!

   It is a great house, again, because its household arrangements are
   conducted on a great scale. You know how country people, when there is
   some rich lord living in the village, speak always of his mansion as
   "the great house." It is the great house for which those bullocks are
   being fattened and those sheep and lambs will be consumed at the great
   house, for there are many in the family and none are allowed to go
   hungry. Solomon kept a great house. When you read the account of the
   daily provision for his table, you see that it was a great house,
   indeed--a vast and truly royal establishment!

   Yes, but neither for quality nor quantity could Solomon's palace match
   the great house of God in its plenty. Speak of fine flour--behold, He
   has given us angels' food! Speak of royal dainties--behold, the Lord
   has given us fat things full of marrow, wines on the lees well-refined!
   What a perpetual feast does the Lord Jesus keep up for all His
   followers! If any of them hunger it is not because their rations are
   stinted. If there are any complaints, it is not because the Master's
   oxen and fatlings are not freely provided! Ah, no, to every man there
   is a good piece of meat and a flagon of wine dealt out, even as David
   dealt it out in the day when he removed the Ark unto the hill of Zion.

   Glory be to God! He has said, "Eat, O Friends! Drink, yes, drink
   abundantly, O Beloved!" In this mountain shall the hand of the Lord
   rest and He will make unto all nations a feast of fat things. Behold,
   His oxen and fatlings are killed, all things are ready. It is a great
   house, where great sinners are fed on great dainties and filled with
   the great goodness of the Lord! It is a great house for the number of
   its inhabitants. How many have lived beneath that roof tree for ages.
   "Lord,"

   they say like a great host, "You have been our dwelling place
   throughout all generations." God is the home of His people, and His
   Church is the home of God!

   And what multitudes are dwelling there now! Not only the companies that
   we know of, with whom it is our delight to meet for solemn worship, but
   all over the world the Lord has a people who dwell in the midst of His
   Church! And, though men have disfigured their Master's house by
   chalking up odd signs over some of the rooms and calling them by other
   names than those of the Owner, yet the Lord's people are all one
   Church--and to whatever part or party they may seem to belong, if
   Christ is in them they belong to Him of whom the whole family in Heaven
   and earth is named--and they make up but one spiritual house. What a
   swarm there is of the Lord's children and yet not one of the family
   remains unfed. The Church is a great house wherein thousands dwell,
   yes, a number that no man can number!

   Once more, it is a great house because of its importance. People speak
   of "the great house" in our remote counties because to the whole
   neighborhood it bears a special relationship, being connected with some
   of its most vital interests-- county politics and police--dignity and
   wealth find their center at "the great house." The Church is a great
   house because it is God's hospice where He distributes bread and wine
   to refresh the weary and entertains wayfarers that otherwise had been
   lost in the storm. It is God's hospital into which He takes the sick
   and there He nourishes them till they renew their youth like the
   eagle's.

   It is God's great lighthouse with its lantern flashing forth a
   directing ray so that wanderers far away may be directed to the haven
   of peace. "Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined." It
   is the seat of God's magistracy, for there are set thrones of judgment,
   the thrones of the house of David. Behold, the Lord has set His King
   upon His holy hill of Zion and therefore shall the power of His scepter
   go forth to the ends of the earth! The great house of the Church is the
   university for teaching all nations! It is the library wherein the
   sacred oracles are preserved! It is the treasury wherein His Truth is
   deposited and the registry of new-born heirs of Heaven!

   It is important to Heaven as well as to earth, for its topmost towers
   reach into Glory and there is in it a ladder, the foot of which rests
   on earth, but the top reaches to Heaven--up and down which the angels
   come and go continually. Said I not well that the Apostle had wisely
   chosen the figure when he called the Church a great house?

   II. We will now go inside the great house and we at once observe that
   it is well furnished. Our text, however, invites us to note that it
   contains a number of MEANER VESSELS, articles of the coarser kind for
   ordinary and common uses. Here are plates, wooden buckets, pitchers and
   pots and various vessels of coarse pottery. Some have thought that this
   figure of vessels to dishonor relates to Christians of a lower grade,
   persons of small Grace and of less sanctified conversation. Now,
   although Believers may, from some points of view, be comparable to
   earthen vessels, yet I dare not look upon any child of God, however low
   in Grace, as a vessel to dishonor!

   Moreover, the word, "these," refers to the earthen and wooden
   vessels--surely they cannot represent saints--or we should never be
   told to purge ourselves from them! If a man is God's child, into
   whatever state and condition he may fall it is our business to look
   after him and endeavor to restore him, remembering ourselves, also,
   lest we be tempted. But it cannot be right to purge ourselves from even
   the least of our believing Brothers and Sisters! Besides, that is not
   the run of the chapter at all.

   The real meaning is that in the Church of God there are unworthy
   persons serving inferior and temporary purposes who are vessels to
   dishonor. They are in the Church, but they are like vessels of wood and
   vessels of earth--they are not the treasure of the mansion, they are
   not brought out on state occasions and are not set much store by--for
   they are not "precious in the sight of the Lord." The Apostle does not
   tell us how they came there, for it was not his intent to do so and no
   parable or metaphor could teach everything. Neither will I stay to
   describe how some professors have come into the Church of God--some by
   distinct falsehood and by making professions which they knew were
   untrue--others through ignorance and others, again, by being
   self-deceived and carried away with excitement.

   The parable does not say how they got there, but they are there--yet
   they are only vessels of wood and vessels of earth. It is no credit to
   them that they are where they are, for they are not vessels to honor,
   though in an honorable place. It is no honor to any man to be a member
   of a Christian Church if he is, in himself, intrinsically worthless
   though they make a minister of him, or elect him deacon! It is no honor
   to him to be in office if the metal he is made of does not fit him for
   so honorable a purpose. He is an intruder in an honorable position and
   it is a dishonor to him to be where he is. It is

   no honor to a weed to grow in the best part of the garden. It is no
   honor to a barren fig tree to cumber the finest ground in the vineyard.

   Ah, dear Friend, if you are in the Church of God, but not truly one of
   the Lord's people, it is a dishonorable thing of you to have come
   there! And it is equally dishonorable for you to remain there without
   fulfilling that great requisite which is demanded of everyone who names
   the name of Jesus--that he departs from all iniquity! The vessels in
   the great house are, however, of some use, even though they are made of
   wood and earth. And so there are persons in the Church of God whom the
   Lord Jesus will not acknowledge as His treasure, but He, nevertheless,
   turns them to some temporary purpose. Some are useful as the scaffold
   to a house, or the dogshores to a ship, or the hedges to a field. I
   believe that some unworthy members of the Church are useful in the way
   of watch dogs to keep others awake, or knives to let blood, or burdens
   to try strength. Some quarrelsome members of the Church help to scour
   the other vessels lest they should rust through being peaceful.

   The Church is made up of men who are yet in the body and it has to deal
   with the outside world. And sometimes the worldly men who are in her
   serve some purpose in connection with this, her lowest need. Judas made
   a good treasurer, for his economy saved more than he stole. Joab was a
   good warrior for David, though he was by no means a saint. False
   professors do not make the Gospel untrue and sometimes, when they have
   spoken it, God has blessed it. You may see, if you go down the
   Kennington Park road today, a row of young trees planted by the
   road--how are they kept up while yet they are slender? Why, small posts
   of dead timber hold them up! And even so, a dead Sunday school teacher
   may yet be useful to a genuine Christian child--and a dead deacon may
   be the financial support of a living Church! Yes, and there are dead
   preachers, too, who, nevertheless, serve to fill up a space--but what
   vessels to dishonor they are!

   It is a dreadful thing, however, for those who are like the posts I
   just mentioned, because the quicker the young tree grows, the sooner
   will the post be taken away, having no participant in the life which it
   helped to support. You see, then, that the base professors who get into
   the Church are turned to some good for His Church by our great Master.
   The servants of the great house can use the wooden ware and the
   earthenware, for a while, for rough everyday purposes, even as mere
   formalists can be employed in some scullery work or another.

   There is one thing noticeable--the wooden and earthen vessels are not
   for the Master's use. When He holds high festival His cups are all of
   precious metal! "All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold."
   Would you have the King of kings set an earthen pot upon His royal
   table? Shall the guests at His table eat from wooden bowls? False
   professors are only useful to the servants, not to the Master--they
   serve base purposes and are not to be seen on those great days when He
   manifests His Glory. The Great Master overrules all things, being the
   Master of the servants and, as far as that which answers the purpose of
   His servants, is serviceable to Him. But personally, between the King
   at His table and the wooden vessel, there is no congruity--it would be
   an insult to hand Him wine in any but a sumptuous cup of precious
   metal, or to bring Him butter in any but a lordly dish!

   How sad it is that many Christians are useful to the Church in various
   ways, but as for personal service rendered to the Lord Jesus Christ,
   Himself, they have no share, whatever, and never can have till Grace
   changes them from wood to silver, or from earth to gold. Note that in
   these vessels of which the Apostle speaks the substance is base. They
   are wood, or they are earth, nothing more. So are we all, by nature, of
   base material. Grace must make us into silver or into golden vessels or
   the Master cannot, Himself, use us, nor can our use in the Church ever
   be to honor. The wooden vessels in the Church are very easily hacked
   and carved and spoiled--if a man is inclined to mischief, he can put
   his knife to them and can cut great notches in them. He can ruin their
   character and render them worthless. Cunning teachers can soon take
   away from merely nominal Christians what they professed to believe, for
   they are very readily cut and hacked by those who play at such games.

   As for the earthen vessels, how soon they are broken! Outside of any
   great house there are the remains of many broken pots which fell to the
   ground and shattered to pieces. And, I am sorry to say, we, also, can
   find enough of such relics to sadden us all. There were some in this
   house, once, who were comely to look upon. But there came a temptation
   and brushed them from the table--and they were shattered in a moment!
   Others of precious metal have endured far more shocks and tests of a
   severer kind. But those being only of earth were broken at once. Heaps
   of crockery accumulate outside every great house and certainly outside
   the great house of Christ. These vessels unto dishonor, though turned
   to some account, require a great deal of care on the part of the
   servants.

   When our forefathers used to eat from wooden plates, the time the good
   wives used to spend in scalding and cleaning them to keep them at all
   sweet to eat upon was something terrible! And there are members of the
   Church who take a world of time from pastors and elders to keep them at
   all decent--we are continually trying to set them right, or keep them
   right in the common relationships of life. There are quarrels in their
   families which must be settled lest they become scandals--and these
   occupy the careful thought of their fellow Christians who have to watch
   for their good. Or they get lax in their doctrines, or foolish in their
   habits, or loose in their business transactions and we have to be
   scouring and cleaning them times without number!

   Certain sorts of earthen vessels you have to be very particular in
   handling. Like egg-shell china, you may hardly look at them. Thank God
   I have not many in this Church--perhaps none of that sort as far as my
   handling is concerned--but other people's touches, though quite as
   wise, are not so welcome. Certain earthen vessels get dreadfully
   chipped unless they have dainty handling. If a Brother does not take
   his hat off to them in very lowly style and behave very reverently,
   they are ready to take offense! They feel themselves hurt and slighted
   when no such thing was intended. They stand upon their dignity and
   expect the fullest recognition of it. These are real earthen pots, very
   apt to be chipped, perhaps a little cracked already and needing a great
   deal of care and trouble on the part of the Lord's servants, lest they
   should go to pieces and spill everything that is put into them.

   There are such in all great houses, and in the Master's great house
   there are, I fear, not just a few. They are useful up to a certain
   point, but they bring no honor to the house because there are plenty as
   good as they in other houses--every cottage can have common earthen
   pitchers in it. They are vessels in which is no pleasure. They are not
   peculiar, or precious. Nobody ever sounds abroad the Master's fame
   because He has so many thousands of wooden bowls or earthen pots. No,
   the king's honor comes from the plates--the gold and silver vessels,
   the peculiar treasure of kings. People speak about these rich goods and
   say, "You should see the sideboards loaded down with the massive
   services of gold and silver! You should see how the tables groan
   beneath the splendor of the royal feast when the king brings forth his
   treasures."

   True Christians are the glory of Christ, but false professors bring, at
   their very best, only dishonor. Better the smallest silver vessel than
   the largest earthen one! Better the least of all the saints than the
   greatest of vain professors! So much upon the vessels of dishonor.

   III. We are now going into the treasury, or plate room, and will think
   of THE NOBLER VESSELS. These are, first of all, of solid metal--vessels
   of silver and vessels of gold. They are not all equally valuable, but
   they are all precious. Here is weight for you--here is something that
   is worth treasuring--something which will last for ages and at any time
   will endure the fire. Now, in real Christians, those who really love
   the Lord, there is something substantial and weighty. When you get hold
   of them, you know the difference between them and the wooden professor.
   Even those who do not like them--strange taste, that which does not
   appreciate silver and gold--are nevertheless compelled to say, "That is
   a genuine article, worth a great deal, weighty and substantial."

   Now, we shall, none of us, ever be vessels of silver and gold unless
   the Lord makes us so by Divine Grace. Vessels of earth are things of
   nature--any potter can make them. Vessels of wood are common enough.
   Copper soon produces a pail. But a vessel of silver or of gold is a
   rarer thing! It costs mining and searching, furnace work and
   fashioning, toil and skill. On each vessel unto honor, Jesus Himself
   has put His hand to mold and fashion it--and to cause it to be
   "prepared unto glory." Did you ever hear how vessels come to be golden?
   Listen to this, and you shall know. One very dear to me has put the
   story into rhyme--

   " 'Oh that I were a cup, a golden cup

   Meet for the Master's use!

   Brimming and trembling with that draught of joy

   (The love of His beloved and purchased ones)

   Which fills His heart with gladness.'

   So spoke a poor, vile, broken, earthy thing,

   A worthless castaway.

   The Master heard and when He passed that way He stooped and touched it
   with His wounded hand-- When lo! Its baseness vanished, and instead

   There stood a golden chalice wondrous fair, And overflowing with deep
   love for him! He raised it to His gracious lips, and quaffed 'The wine
   that makes glad the heart of God,' Then took the cup to Heaven."

   On the vessels of honor you can see the hallmark. What is the hallmark
   which denotes the purity of the Lord's golden vessels? Well, He has
   only one stamp for everything. When He laid the foundation what was the
   seal He put upon it? "The Lord knows them that are His, and let
   everyone that names the name of Christ depart from all iniquity." That
   was God's seal! That was the impress of the great King upon the
   foundation stone. Do we find it here? Yes, we do. "If a man, therefore,
   purges himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor." You see,
   then, that the man who is the golden or silver vessel, departs from all
   iniquity--and that is the token of his genuine character.

   The man who is truly the Lord's, seeks to be cleansed, not only from
   the open sin of the world, but from the common sin of professing
   Christians. He labors to be purged from that which the wooden vessel
   and the earthen vessel would delight in. He wants to be pure within and
   without. He desires perfection. He labors daily to conquer every sin
   and strives with all his might to serve his Lord. He is not content to
   have a fair appearance, as wood and earth may have--he wishes to be
   solid, substantial metal, purged and purified to the utmost possible
   degree and fit for the highest purposes. Now, this seeking after purity
   is the hallmark of the King's vessels of gold and silver.

   Notice, however, that they are purged, for the Lord will not use filthy
   vessels no matter what they may be. He will only use those that are
   clean. And He would have His true people purged, as I have said before,
   not only from gross sin, but from doctrinal error and from association
   with the perverse-minded. We are to be purged from Hymenaeus and
   Philetus and from the vain babblings of which the Apostle has been
   speaking in the previous part of the chapter. I fear that Christian men
   do a great deal of mischief by their complicity with those who are
   teaching what is downright falsehood. If we are to serve the Lord in
   the matter of advancing His Truth, we must be true to the Truth of God
   ourselves. If we join hand in hand with others and so form a
   confederacy when the very pillars of the temple are being pulled down
   by rude hands, it may be we shall be partakers of other men's sins. We
   must be clean-handed in this matter!

   And then notice that these gold and silver vessels are reserved as well
   as purged. They are made meet for the Master's use. Nobody is to drink
   out of them but the King, Himself. This is the blessedness of the child
   of God when he comes to be what he should be, that he can sing as we
   did just now--

   "I am Yours and Yours, alone, This I gladly, fully own! And in all my
   works and ways, Only now would seek Your praise." As Joseph had a cup
   out of which he, alone, drank, so the Lord takes His people to be His
   peculiar treasure, vessels for His personal use. Brethren, I count it
   an honor to be useful to the meanest child of God, but I confess that
   the honor lies mainly in the fact that I am thereby serving the Master,
   Himself. Oh, to be used by God! This is to answer the end of our being.
   If you can feel that God has used you, then may you rejoice, indeed!

   There are some Christians whom the Lord cannot much use, because, first
   of all, they are not cleansed from selfishness. They have an eye to
   their own honor or aggrandizement. The Lord will not be in complicity
   with selfish aims! Some men are self-confident--there is too much of
   the "I" about them--and our Master will not use them. He will have our
   weakness, but not our strength! And if we are great somebodies, He will
   pass us by and take some little nobody and make use of him. The Lord
   cannot use other men because they are too apt to be proud. If He were
   to give them a little success, it would be dangerous to their Christian
   existence! Their poor brains would begin to swim and they would think
   the Lord could hardly do without them! Indeed, when they meet with a
   little encouragement they swell into such wonderful people that they
   expect everybody to fall down and worship them!

   God will not use them, neither will He set upon His table vessels which
   are in any way defiled. There must be purity! A man may work his heart
   out in the ministry or the Sunday school, but if he is practicing some
   secret sin he cannot prosper--it is not possible that God should honor
   him! There may be a measure of apparent success for a time and, in
   God's Sovereignty, He may use His Truth, itself, in spite of the man,
   but the man himself will not be useful to the Master. Littleness of
   Grace and contentedness with that spiritual poverty, also puts many a
   man aside. We must be full if God is

   to pour out of us to the thirsty! We must be full of His Light if we
   are to illuminate the darkness of others! We cannot reveal to the world
   what the Lord has not revealed to us.

   Oh, for a holy character and holy communion with God! Then we shall be
   golden vessels fit for the Master's use and so, according to the text,
   we shall be ready for every good work--ready for the work when it comes
   and ready at the work when it has come--because completely consecrated
   to God and subject to His hand. In this readiness for whatever comes we
   shall be honored. Men may despise us, as they will, but what does it
   matter if God honors us? This height of Grace may cost us a sharp
   experience, but must not gold be tried with fire? As thieves are most
   anxious to steal not the pots and wooden vessels, but the gold and the
   silver, so we may expect to be exposed to greater temptations and
   greater persecutions than others.

   More Grace involves more trials, but then we shall have the delight of
   glorifying God more. Oh, to be vessels unto honor! Beloved members of
   this Church, aspire to this! You have acknowledged in your names, that
   you are Christians! You have been baptized into the sacred name of the
   Divine Trinity! You have borne, up to now, a consistent moral
   character, but oh, see to it that the inner substance is the real
   metal--the gold and silver! See to it that you are reserved for the
   Lord's own special use! Be as consecrated to Him as were the bowls
   before the altar. Never let the world drink out of you, as Belshazzar
   did out of the vessels taken at Jerusalem. May the Lord grant that you
   may never be defiled, but may be kept, by His Grace, pure and
   consecrated to Him.

   IV. Fourthly, for a moment we must speak about THE MASTER. He is
   introduced here, you see, as having certain vessels meet for His
   use--and this shows that He is in the house. There would be no need to
   reserve vessels for His use if He were not there--He is in the midst of
   His Church by His indwelling Spirit. How this ought to make us wish to
   be purged, sanctified and ready for Him! Your Master is not far away.
   His Presence in the Church is promised--"Lo, I am with you always, even
   to the end of the world." What manner of persons, therefore, ought you
   to be?

   Secondly, the Master knows all about the house and knows the quality of
   all the vessels. There is no deceiving Him with the wooden plate--He
   knows it is not gold. And as for that earthen cup, though it may be
   gilt all over, He knows it is not gold. He reads the heart of everyone
   here present--wood or earth, silver or gold--the Master understands us.
   And then reflect that the Master will use us all as far as we are fit
   to be used. We are in God's house and if we are wood, He will put us to
   wooden use.

   There are many wooden preachers. If we are earth and earthly-minded He
   may put us to earthly uses, as He did Judas, who carried the bag, but
   had no Grace. If you are silver He will give you silver use. And if you
   are gold He will give you golden service in which you shall be happy,
   honored and blessed. What comes of this, then, lastly? Why, Brothers
   and Sisters, let us bestir ourselves that we be purged, for the text
   says, "If a man therefore purges himself." It throws this business upon
   each one of us personally--a man must purge himself from ill company!
   And when we have confessed the responsibility, let us turn to God in
   prayer and feel that thorough purging is a work which we cannot achieve
   and, therefore, we cry, "Cleanse me, O God! Sanctify me! Make me meet
   for Your service and prepared for every good work."

   Beloved, finish with earnest prayer. Pray God that you may not be
   hypocrites! Beseech the Lord to search you and try you, that you not be
   found deceivers. And when you are sure that you are His, then ask Him
   to make you not merely silver, for it is very apt to tarnish, but
   rather the precious gold which, when exposed to the worst influences,
   scarcely shows a trace of dullness. Pure unalloyed gold may we be! And
   then may the Master, both in secret and public, use us to His own joy.
   May He refresh Himself with our love and faith, yes, may His joy be
   fulfilled in us, that our joy may be full. God grant it may be so, for
   Christ's sake.

Faith Purifying the Heart

   (No. 1349)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 15, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Purifying their hearts by faith." Acts 15:9.

   THE Jewish or Pharisaic party violently opposed the Gospel from
   without. Wherever the Apostles went, the Jews who believed not, being
   moved with envy, stirred up the people against them. They could not
   endure to hear of the salvation of the Gentiles by Grace through faith!
   It grated on their ears, for they thought that this doctrine was
   contrary to the Law of Moses in which they boasted. They were children
   of the bondwoman under the old Covenant of Works and they could not
   endure that the children of the promise should come to the inheritance.
   They struggled and rebelled against the Gospel of salvation by Grace,
   for it went against their natural pride and their national
   exclusiveness.

   Yes, and even when any of them, as blessed be the Grace of God was the
   case, became converted, the old man was still within them and the
   spirit of bondage was still apt to assert itself. Those who had been of
   the sect of the Pharisees brought a good share of Pharisaic tendencies
   with them into the Church--and these were dangerous to the young
   kingdom of Christ. I scarcely know whether legal principles were not
   able to do more mischief inside the Church by perverting pure doctrine
   than they could do outside the Church by exciting persecution.

   One can hardly imagine how the Gospel could have escaped being overlaid
   and smothered by Judaism, like a baby by its mother, had it not been
   for the preserving Grace of God and the indwelling Spirit within the
   Church of God. You know, Brothers and Sisters, how we mourn, today,
   that certain who claim to be Christians are laboring most zealously to
   put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor
   we were able to bear. They invent pompous ceremonies, observe days and
   months and are bound by rubrics and regulations--all of which are an
   idle and needless servitude to outward forms.

   Certain others would bind us with creeds and ordinances not plainly
   taught in the Word of God, nor agreeable thereto--of which Peter and
   John knew nothing whatever--having no force but that which comes of
   human authority. The old Pharisaic spirit is a great forger of bonds
   and builder of prisons! It would subject us to ordinances of, "Touch
   not, taste not, handle not," and fetter us with rules of many
   sorts--for it cannot understand the liberty wherewith Christ has made
   us free. It teaches this and it teaches that, whereof the Apostles
   would have said, "We gave no such commandment."

   We must contend against this spirit as much now as ever! We must refuse
   to be entangled, again, with the yoke of bondage. Christ is all! We are
   complete in Him and we will not permit a single letter to be added to
   His perfect Law of Liberty. Peter, at the great Jerusalem council was
   enabled, through his experience to answer those who said that unless a
   man was circumcised he could not be saved. Depend upon it, Brothers and
   Sisters, there is nothing like practical work for Christ to teach us
   Christ's Truth!

   For the most part, the heretics of the present day are a clique of
   literary men, adept at the pen, but quite unable to speak. It may be
   that their failure in this direction sours them and sets them upon
   opposing the Gospel ministry. At any rate, they are a set of theorizers
   who know nothing of practical service for the Lord! And so they make up
   all manner of nonsense according to their own fancies. They sit in
   their studies and do nothing----and then criticize those who are doing
   hard service and are successful in it. They are so busy with nibbling
   their quills and polishing their periods that they care nothing about
   saving souls! And they are so intent upon making discoveries which
   shall manifest their own gigantic intellects that they cannot soil
   their hands with practical work among the poor and ignorant.

   Having nothing upon their hearts, their whole nature runs to their head
   and the head being unbalanced by a busy heart takes to spinning cobweb
   theories and novelties of heresy. Fiercely liberal, the spirit which
   they manifest against the orthodox is grandly bigoted--in this they are
   earnest--but in little else except in engendering grievous errors which

   are ravaging the Churches and ruining souls. Among the do-nothings all
   mischief begins! Give a man practical work for Jesus and keep him at
   it, and he will, like Peter, learn as he goes and, like a river, filter
   as he flows. Peter could not continue to believe in restricting the
   Gospel to the Jews after the Lord had bid Cornelius send for him from
   Joppa, that he might teach him the Gospel--his actual service refined
   his theory!

   If those who ruled botanical science never saw a flower, would you
   wonder if they ran into gross heterodoxies of belief? A naturalist who
   never saw a living animal would not be likely to be very sound in
   zoology and, even so, those who never deal with the souls of men--who
   never see penitents under conviction, nor hear the songs of new-born
   Believers in Christ, nor see men rejoice in affliction and triumph in
   death--are sure to blunder when they set up for teachers. They lean
   back in their study chairs and blow bubbles and vent doubts to the
   subverting of the faith of many godly but feeble souls--and all for the
   need of something better to do.

   I prescribe as medicine for them and I heartily wish they would take
   it, to do something for Christ and the good of fallen men. Peter got
   out of what would otherwise have been his natural condition of bigotry
   by being exercised in the service of his Master. Peter tells us how he
   came to see that circumcision was not necessary. At the Divine bidding,
   he went in and preached to Cornelius and his household--and while he
   was preaching they believed! He had not finished his sermon before they
   had all become Believers and he adds, "God the heart-knower bore them
   witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as He gave unto us."

   They believed and he knew that their faith had purged their hearts, for
   the Lord sent the Holy Spirit upon them then and there! The Holy Spirit
   dwells not in unclean hearts! But when the temple of the heart has been
   purified, there He comes. Though these men had never been circumcised,
   yet they were purified in heart, for the Spirit of God rested upon
   them--it was evidently the same Spirit which had descended upon the
   circumcised ones at Jerusalem since it produced the same results--"for
   they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God." Now, if the Spirit
   puts no difference between the circumcised and the uncircumcised, why
   should the Church do so? Peter therefore said, "Can any man forbid
   water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy
   Spirit as well as we?"

   He therefore commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord and
   thus affirmed his belief that faith had purified them. He saw that the
   Lord had given the choicest of Gospel blessings to uncircumcised
   Believers, even the power of the Holy Spirit and, therefore, he felt
   that they were to be received into the Church without circumcision.
   Peter's argument is eminently clear and convincing. You and I cannot be
   impartial because we, being Gentiles, are naturally pleased with an
   argument which includes us in the blessing.

   But if we were sitting as judges to listen to the pleading of the
   Apostle, I feel sure we would say--Whether it blesses us or curses us,
   the reasoning is unanswerable--if God would not give the Spirit unless
   the heart had been purified, then these men's hearts were purified and
   it is evident that they were purified by faith, alone, seeing that they
   were uncircumcised and altogether outside the Jewish Law. Seeing, then,
   that they are pure in heart, what need can there be of further
   purification? What need to lay upon them the outward and visible sign,
   the putting away of the filth of the flesh, when it is proven by the
   Divine witness What they are pure in heart already? It is well argued,
   Peter, and we rejoice in the conclusion!

   Now let us consider the point upon which the argument depends, the
   statement which made, to a great extent, the hinge of Peter's
   reasoning--namely, that by faith the hearts of the Gentile Believers
   had been purified. First, consider the agent of this purifying, "by
   faith." Secondly, the secret of its power--it was God that purified
   them by faith. Thirdly, the seat of its action-- "purifying their
   hearts." And, fourthly, (what is not in the text, but which we gather
   from our own experience), the mode of its operation, or how faith
   purifies our hearts.

   I. First, then, dear Friends, let us speak of THE AGENT OF HEART
   PURIFICATION--FAITH. There was nothing but faith in the case of
   Cornelius, nothing but ordinary faith such as you and I possess--faith
   born of hearing and resting alone on Jesus. Faith alone did it! Read
   Peter's sermon to Cornelius and you will perceive that his faith was
   not created by Peter's eloquence and did not stand in the wisdom of
   man. Peter told a very simple story about the life, death and
   Resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth--just such a story as a converted a
   lad from our Sunday schools might relate, in fact, "the old, old
   story."

   And while he was telling it, I hope not so hoarsely as I am compelled
   to do this morning, the power of God was present and the centurion and
   his family believed the testimony. The innate power of the story,
   itself, by God's blessing,

   worked faith in the hearts of his hearers and they were straightway
   purified by that faith! If I were to talk of Jesus Christ and His
   matchless death, this morning, and some of you hearing the story were
   to trust Him, you would be purified just as these Caesarean Believers
   were. Their faith came by hearing, just as yours would, and they heard
   the very same Gospel of the Grace of God which I would preach to you.
   By such faith hearts are purified!

   Their faith purified them at once. They were not purified by month
   after month of contemplation. Faith purified their hearts immediately,
   for, to the astonishment of the circumcised Believers who were looking
   on, the Holy Spirit fell upon them then and there--the evidence from
   Heaven that their faith had made them meet for the indwelling of the
   Holy Spirit! What matchless energy is this which purifies hearts
   stained with original sin and defiled by actual transgressions--and
   cleanses them at once! The sacred power which requires not even a
   single day for its marvelous operations, but achieves its purpose in a
   moment, is worthy of our highest admiration! How speedy is the work!
   The hearing ear, the believing heart, the purified heart--these three
   follow each other in rapid succession, without long pauses of dread
   conviction or dreary doubt.

   Delays may occur in some cases, but they are not necessary to the work,
   neither are they of the Lord. Here the operations of mercy followed
   upon the heels of one another--hearing, believing, purification--the
   gift of the Spirit, the public avowal of the same by Baptism into the
   sacred name came in rapid succession--and here you see the wondrous
   power of faith by which the soul is purified at once. The agent of the
   purification was FAITH alone! And it is clear from the narrative that
   water Baptism did not aid it at all.

   It is supposed by those who deal with suppositions only, for they
   certainly can have no facts to support their theory, that there is
   something purging in Baptism. Do they not say that by it they are made
   members of Christ, children of God and inheritors of the kingdom of
   Heaven? Now, no baby has ever yet given any evidence that such a thing
   took place! How could it? The little creature is unconscious, at the
   time, and as he grows up he does not show any superiority to others who
   have not undergone the aqueous regeneration! We find our unbaptized
   sons and daughters converted by Grace in quite as large a proportion as
   those little "members of Christ" and "inheritors of the kingdom of
   Heaven." These "children of God by sprinkling" show that they need
   converting, for they grow up to be heirs of wrath, even as others. The
   regeneration seems to be only skin deep if we may judge by the
   character of 99 out of every hundred of those who are thus regenerated.

   But in this case there was no mistaking the meaning of Baptism, for
   Cornelius and his household were not baptized till after they had
   received the Holy Spirit--and the Holy Spirit was the sign that their
   hearts were already purified. Now, my Brothers and Sisters, the Lord
   will not permit us to mix up His own ordinances with the work of His
   blessed Spirit in purifying the heart by faith, alone! God forbid we
   ever should fall into such an error! No--soul-purification is of faith,
   it is not of Baptism. It is not by any outward rite even of God's own
   ordaining, nor by the will of man, nor by blood, nor by birth, but by
   the work of the Holy Spirit through the agency of faith and that alone.

   If it should, however, occur to some Brother that perhaps the case of
   Cornelius may have been somewhat special because he had been a devout
   man and an alms-giver even before he knew the Gospel, I reply that
   Peter, in his narrative and argument, said not a word upon that point!
   He held forth the centurion's case simply as that of an uncircumcised
   person who had believed and had been purified in heart. It seems to me
   clear enough that if Cornelius, instead of having been a devout man,
   had been called by God out of the utmost profligacy, he would have been
   purified in heart in precisely the same manner. If not, Peter was
   unfair in quoting as a typical instance what would have been a palpable
   exception to the rule--but he speaks of the centurion and his family as
   being specimens of what God was doing for Gentile Believers.

   So Peter saw nothing at all exceptional about them. He saw, indeed,
   nothing but that they were Believers and were purified in heart by
   their faith. The fact is that the instrument by which hearts are truly
   purified is faith which comes by the hearing of the Gospel--and this is
   all. And so I say to you upon this point, even to you who know not the
   Lord as yet--do not be looking for pure hearts within yourselves before
   you come to Christ by faith. Do not look for the fruits before you have
   the roots! Look by faith to the great Purifier, however impure you feel
   your heart to be.

   There is a blessing for the pure in heart, but you cannot claim it at
   present and, therefore, be it yours to believe as sinners in whom is no
   good thing whatever. Though you mourn the deep depravity of your
   nature, do not vainly endeavor to alter it before you believe, but,
   sinner as you are, condemned by the verdict of your conscience, believe
   in the

   Lord Jesus Christ that you may be completely renewed! I beseech you
   seek purity of heart by faith, alone, for you will be disappointed if
   you search for it in any other way. Do not think that anything else can
   touch the matter, for it cannot! No washing and cleansing can make the
   Ethiopian white--only the Redeemer's Divine power can do it!

   Read your Bibles, by all means, and pray, by all means, and hear
   sermons, by all means, but none of these things are of any use to
   change the radical impurity of your inward nature. FAITH must behold
   the bleeding Lamb and know the virtue of the water and the blood which
   flowed from His pierced side--and until then the soul must remain in
   the impurity of the Fall. All the efforts of unbelieving nature do but
   plunge us deeper in the mire and increase our defilement! Faith is that
   branch of hyssop which, being dipped in the blood of Jesus, makes the
   heart clean from sin--and nothing else will do this.

   Look, then, poor Soul, away from yourself that you may have yourself
   renewed. Look to your black, disordered and loathsome self and mourn,
   but look not there for cure--that were to seek for riches amid
   bankruptcy and death amid life! That were to search for Hell in Heaven
   and for God among demons! Look to JESUS, whom God has set forth to save
   His people from their sins--and as you look to Him, FAITH will purify
   Your soul!

   II. How is faith strong enough to do this? What is THE SECRET OF ITS
   POWER? Believing other things does not purify the soul--why does
   believing the Gospel? Trusting is a very simple act--how does it come
   to pass that trusting Christ becomes the means of cleansing the heart?
   I answer, because God works by it. Let us read our text with the
   preceding verse. "God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving
   them the Holy Spirit, even as He did unto us; and put no difference
   between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith."

   Who was it that was purifying their hearts? The answer is clear. It was
   the Omniscient God. Ah, Brothers and Sisters, you must not look, alone,
   to the instrument which the Lord uses, but you must have regard to His
   own power which He puts forth in connection therewith. Faith alone
   would be nothing--but when God works by faith, wonders are
   accomplished! You remember the old story of the sword of Scanderbeg
   with which he used to cleave men in two from the crown of the head
   downwards? As one looked at it he declared that he saw nothing about
   the sword to make it so fatal a weapon. But another replied, "You
   should have seen the arm which was used to wield it."

   Faith looked at, of itself, appears to be contemptible, but oh, the arm
   that wields it! Who shall resist that everlasting arm? Jacob may be but
   a worm, but God can thresh the mountains with him! Faith may be but a
   poor broom, but when Jesus comes to purge the temple of the heart, He
   sweeps out all the accumulated filth by this feeble means! This greater
   than Hercules cares little for the weakness of the instrument, but
   behold, He cleanses the Augean stable of our nature with no other
   agency than childlike faith! God works through faith, and so faith does
   marvels!

   Ah, Beloved, if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ your inbred sins
   have another champion to meet them beside yourself. God Himself is with
   you for your Captain and He will use your faith to be the ram's horn to
   lay low the walls of Jericho, or to be as the pitchers and the
   trumpets, by whose means the Midianite myriads were overthrown! Your
   iniquities shall bow before His Grace! Only trust and your poor
   child-like trust shall be in God's hands the sacred scourge of small
   cords which shall free your soul from all the thieves who now make it
   their den! Besides, the text suggests that God is at work in the heart
   by His Holy Spirit.

   Now, where the Holy Spirit comes, He burns as a heavenly fire and
   consumes sin. He comes, also, as a flowing stream and cleanses away
   evil. He comes as a rushing mighty wind to chase away all that is foul
   and polluted which has gathered in the stagnant air of the soul. The
   Holy Spirit is the spirit of holiness and as He always dwells with
   faith, being its Author, its Strengthener and Guardian, you may be sure
   that where faith comes, the heart will speedily be purified. The fact
   is, Brothers and Sisters, faith sees sin, loathes it and flings itself
   into the eternal arms to be delivered from it. Faith feels sin, like a
   huge mountain, pressing on its bosom and crushing down its heart. And
   Faith cries, "Eternal God, You have promised to deliver Your people
   from their sins. Lo, I invoke Your power and challenge Your promise! I
   cast myself upon Your might to lift this load from off my bosom and to
   let me breathe freely as being delivered from its terrible weight."

   All is well when such an appeal is believingly made! When you bring God
   into your quarrel it is ended. When you lay hold on the Divine
   strength, Goliath falls, though your weapon is but a sling and a stone.
   Here is the power of faith, that she wears the promise of her God as
   her belt of strength! She has laid hold upon the Omnipotence of Him
   that makes Heaven and earth to stand! Well may she perform miracles,
   for God is at her beck and call. See, then, where the power of

   faith lies whereby she works the purification of the soul--it is GOD
   that works by her! "But," you ask, "how does God purify the heart? He
   cannot do it by physical force."

   No. Who thought He could? He does it by His wisdom which was never
   baffled yet, bringing before the human mind arguments which suit the
   case, revealing His Truths which convince the understanding and plying
   the conscience with facts which gain its verdict. If human wisdom wins
   men's minds, what shall Infallible Wisdom do? Together with Omnipotent
   Wisdom there is the most important element of Irresistible Love. Do you
   think there is no power anywhere but that which can be measured by
   pounds and gauged as we compute the force of steam in the locomotive
   engine? Ah, Brothers and Sisters, in the impulse of persuasion, in the
   force of conviction, in the plea of love, there are powers which never
   violate the human will, but yet rule it with sacred supremacy!

   What is stronger than the power of love--love which makes the most
   obdurate at length to yield? Love which compels the most malicious to
   love, in spite of themselves? Love which surprises men into repentance
   and gratitude before they are aware of it? God loves men until they
   must love Him! God loves them with such Omnipotence that at last they
   hurl their weapons of rebellion down and submit with eagerness! Nothing
   conquers like love! Now it is because Faith trusts in this Wisdom and
   this Love--and these come to aid her in her war with sin--that the
   raging lusts and wayward passions of the heart are subdued and Grace
   reigns through righteousness unto eternal life.

   So, then, I say, as we leave this point, Brothers and Sisters, remember
   humbly and hopefully that the battle is not yours after all! The Lord
   has undertaken the conflict and He will gain the victory! The conquest
   of sin is to be achieved by the Almighty--you are to wrestle and
   contend--but God in you is the winner of the contest! Therefore, since
   God is with you, nothing is impossible! There is no constitutional
   fault which you cannot remedy! There is no strong passion which you
   cannot check! There is no inward desire, however fierce, which you
   cannot, at last, destroy! Have courage! High degrees of sanctity are
   possible to you, now that God is with you. Despair of nothing! Doubt
   not, for in all things you shall be more than conquerors through Him
   that loves you! Only let your faith continually fling herself upon the
   Omnipotence of God and you shall see that He will purify your hearts.

   III. Thirdly, let us consider that THE SEAT OF FAITH'S ACTION is
   primarily the heart--"purifying their

   hearts." I will not speak upon this topic more than to outline what I
   would have said had I been able to utter my words with greater
   rapidity. Infirmities of voice are a sad hindrance to ministers--pray
   that they may be removed, for in my case, at least, the brain is slow
   when the speech is hampered.

   Faith changes the current of our love and alters the motive which sways
   us--this is what is meant by purifying the heart. It makes us love that
   which is good and right. It moves us with motives free from self and
   sin--this is a great work, indeed! Therefore, the change which faith
   produces is very radical and deep. It is a small matter to wash the
   outside of the cup and of the platter--the inside of the cup must be
   first and chiefly attended to. If the heart is changed, the conversion
   is thorough and complete--it is not a mere superficial affair, but a
   through and through renewal. "Rend your hearts and not your garments,"
   was God's command to His people--and faith acts in this spirit--it does
   not begin with the garments nor frame regulations for the external
   actions. It begins with the inner man.

   Faith lays the axe at the root. It heals the stream at the fountainhead
   and what is done is, therefore, done thoroughly, effectually and
   honestly. The heart being purified, the purification becomes operative
   throughout the whole life. A diseased heart means a sickly man all
   over--you cannot get your heart wrong but what every organ is, in its
   measure, wrong--the whole life is disarranged. Neither can you have the
   heart right without its affecting the entire nature and affecting, for
   the better, all that is within you and all that comes forth of you--of
   thought, word and deed! There is nothing like beginning at the heart
   out of which are the issues of life. All else is poor patchwork. But to
   have the heart made new is to be renewed, indeed!

   And, therefore, such a change is permanent. Acknowledge appetites which
   still remain and the dog returns to his vomit. Purify externals, leave
   the nature untouched, and the sow that was washed goes back to her
   wallowing in the mire. Transform the dog to a sheep, change the swine
   to a child and you shall not see the old habits return--but without
   this, all human goodness is as a fading flower. Such a purification is
   acceptable with God, who searches the heart. Man judges according to
   the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart. And so, faith, in
   purifying the heart, produces a purification which is well-pleasing
   before God.

   The sum of this is, Brothers and Sisters, do not begin seeking after
   the purification of your hearts and then seek after faith in Christ as
   a second thing. No! Let all things be done in order. Emotions are good
   if they are good, but they are not the source of purity nor antecedent
   to faith. Faith is the parent of right emotions. Never confuse the
   mother with the children. If you would have men purified, aim, by the
   blessing of God, to produce faith in them. The preaching which only
   stirs the passions is of small value. We have heard a good deal about
   crowds weeping, but we had rather see one individual believing. We
   count it far better to lead a man to believe with his heart than to cry
   with his eyes and, therefore, I aim rather at preaching Christ
   Crucified, so as to beget faith, than to paint pathetic pictures of
   deathbeds and dying mothers, which things work on the emotions but have
   small tendency to lead to faith.

   If, first of all, we believe that Jesus is the Christ and come to rest
   in Him, the emotions will be brought right enough in due time--the
   heart will be changed where once faith assumes the sway. But if you
   have a faith which never touches your heart--a faith which never causes
   you to rejoice or mourn, a faith which neither makes you hate sin nor
   love the Lord Jesus, I charge you, shake off that faith as Paul shook
   the viper from his hand--for it is a deadly faith and if, instead
   thereof, you should feel an aching heart and a deep sense of alienation
   from God, the change will appear terrible to you, but it will be
   conducive to your highest good.

   Only the living faith which works upon the heart and influences the
   desires and the affections can be the faith of God's elect. A moonlight
   faith, which has light but no warmth, is a thing of the night and is
   not the faith of the children of the day. Faith which lives in the cold
   attic of the brain and never descends into the parlor and banqueting
   room of the heart, will starve with cold--and it is not the life which
   the Holy Spirit works in man. Judge what I say, but if you forget all,
   still remember that faith stands first and then the heart's
   purification follows as a consequence. Never put the cart before the
   horse, nor the effect before the cause! Do not expect the fruit of
   holiness without the root of faith, nor try to increase purity, which
   is a result, without first strengthening the faith which is its
   original.

   IV. Lastly, let us consider THE MODE OF FAITH'S OPERATION--how does
   Faith go to work to purify the

   heart? Observe, dear Friends, first, that Faith believes in sin as sin
   and sees the horror of it as an offense against a holy and gracious God
   in whom she devoutly believes. Faith believes in Hell and sees the
   "smoke of its torments going up forever and ever." Faith believes in
   the worm that dies not and the fire that never can be quenched." Faith,
   "the evidence of things not seen," places before the soul, in dread
   array, the pomp of that tremendous day when Christ, with clouds, shall
   come, so that the soul sees sin to be an exceedingly dreadful and
   damnable thing and turns to God for deliverance from it--this is one
   element in the purification of the soul.

   Next, Faith delights to set Christ before the heart and to make it gaze
   upon His bleeding wounds and pierced side and marred face. Faith makes
   Him no dream, but a reality! She causes the soul's ears to hear His
   groans and listen to His "Lama Sabachthani." The soul perceives that
   when sin was laid on Christ, it bruised Him sorely and crushed Him down
   and, therefore, the heart hates the sin which slew its best
   Friend--here is another clement which works towards its purification.
   Faith delights much in the Person of Christ and, therefore, she sets
   before the soul His incomparable loveliness, as the Well-Beloved of
   saints.

   To Faith, Christ is not an historic Person who flitted over the page of
   history even as a passer-by moves before a camera when an artist is
   taking a street photograph and leaves a dim trace of his having passed
   across the scene while the picture was being fashioned. Faith has
   learned to see Christ stand out as the most real Man that ever lived,
   the fact of the ages, the focus of the Truth of God! Faith touches,
   handles, embraces and feeds upon Christ. She has been so familiar with
   Him as to have been kissed with the kisses of His lips and she has been
   filled with His love which is better than wine and, therefore, she
   feels His constraining power and follows Him.

   Faith is Christ's familiar Friend. Faith, as John, lies even in His
   bosom and there enjoys His love and pours forth her own. Faith, by
   revealing the love and loveliness of Christ to the soul, kindles in the
   heart a vehement flame of love to Him and this fire of love becomes a
   powerful element of purification--for you cannot love Christ and love
   sin! You cannot feel gratitude for deliverance from evil and then go
   and plunge into it again. Further, faith has a wonderful art of
   realizing her gracious privileges.

   Faith says to the man, "Do you not know that you are God's elect? The
   eternal Father wrote Your name in His Book of Life before He lit up the
   lamps of Heaven! How ought you to live? You are redeemed, the blood
   mark is on you! You are not your own, but bought with a price--what a
   holy life yours ought to be! You are precious to the heart of God!

   You are His Hephzibah, He delights in you. You are His child, no more a
   servant, but a son! You are Christ's bride, yes, you are a part of His
   mystical body, you are one with Him--how ought you to behave yourself?"

   Brothers, Sisters, did you ever realize any one of these blessings
   without feeling that such privileges purge the soul? Did they not, each
   one of them, seem to say to you, "What manner of persons ought you to
   be in all holy conversation and godliness, since you are partakers of
   mercies like these?" Faith has another wondrous power of acting upon
   the telescopic principle by bringing near to us the things to come. Has
   she not even opened to us the gates of pearl and set the golden streets
   a-glittering before our eyes? How near to faith's far-seeing eyes, oh
   you blessed Jerusalem, your celestial splendors have appeared!

   At such seasons, so far from thinking that we would indulge in sin
   because we felt our Heaven secure, we have groaned after more purity
   and begun to take our shoes off, for we have felt that even the suburb
   of Heaven, where we, then, stood, was holy ground! Transported by
   Faith's vision, we have commenced to put on the snow-white robes of the
   immaculate. Having this hope in us, we have purified ourselves, "even
   as He is pure." O you who are Brothers and Sisters to perfect
   spirits--co-heirs with the glorified of the Crown of Life that fades
   not away, with angels for your servitors and Christ Himself for your
   elder Brother--what should be the manner of our walk and conversation?
   We feel that we shall never be perfectly content till we are perfectly
   holy, unblameable and unreprovable in His sight. What could more
   effectually purify the heart than the vision of Heaven which Faith
   presents to us?

   Suffer me, now, to crowd a number of matters together, to show you that
   faith does not merely give us motives, but that it really finds us
   power. I will tell you how faith does this, for I have tried it in
   fighting against sin. Power is gained by faith through pleading the
   promises of God. Did you ever feel that you could not master a sin and
   have you then gone and knelt down and cried, "Lord, You have said, 'sin
   shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under the Law, but
   under Grace,' Lord save me from the tyranny of sin which now seeks to
   exercise upon me"? Did you ever plead that other promise, "I will turn
   My hand upon you, and surely purge away your dross, and take away all
   your sin"?

   Did you ever cry, "Lord, I will not let You go till you have taken away
   my bonds and delivered me from the iniquities which prevail against
   me"? Then I am sure you have obtained the help of God! Thus does Faith,
   by pleading God's own Word, gain power to master sin. Try her sacred
   art! Believe without a doubt the faithful Promiser and hold Him to His
   Word, a Word from which He never did draw back and never will, for He
   is not a man that He should lie, nor the son of man that He should
   repent. Faith daringly lays hold upon the power of God, Himself! On the
   strength of the promise she grasps the Divine hand! She has the sacred
   impudence, the consecrated impertinence to thrust herself near the
   Throne and lay hold upon God, for she has heard Him say, "Let him lay
   hold upon My strength."

   And oh, Beloved, how she then smites the Philistines! How she lays
   iniquity low when once God, the Irresistible Slayer of sin, has come to
   her help! She constrains Him to come by laying hold upon Him and then
   she routs all her adversaries. Faith brings us real power to conquer
   sin by applying the blood of Christ. She does not merely talk of the
   Atonement, but she delights in it as her own and makes a medicine of it
   for the curing of sinful habits. The blood of Jesus is the life of
   faith and the death of sin! All the saints overcome through the blood
   of the Lamb! We sprinkle it before us and kings of armies flee!

   The atonement by blood. The literal substitution of our Lord. The
   smarting suretyship. The triumphant righteousness and the
   representative glorification of the Lord Jesus are all great purifiers
   of the soul-- sharp swords with which to smite sin! Rest happily in Him
   who died for you and rose again, and you will be strong for virtue--sin
   shall lose all power over you. The blood of Jesus is the chief and,
   indeed, the only Fountain for cleansing! It is the supreme source of
   holiness, the preparation for Heaven! Faith gets us power, for she
   plunges us in the atoning blood which is our life. Faith, herself,
   also, gives us power against sin by mixing herself with all Gospel
   ordinances. We read of some, "that the word preached did not profit
   them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it."

   Faith is a necessary ingredient to be mixed with means and ordinances
   to give them savor and efficacy. With hearing sermons, attending
   communion, private prayer, Bible study--mix faith! "Without prescribing
   how much," mix faith, and the more the better! Faith will enable you to
   draw the nourishment and essence out of Gospel ordinances and so it
   will make you vigorous in agonizing against sin! Last of all, faith
   awakens the new man to intense resistance of sin. Faith, like a
   trumpet, wakes up the unsinning new nature to battle and leads it into
   the thick of the fight. Did I startle you when I said the, "unsinning
   new nature"? I said it advisedly, for it cannot sin because it is born
   of God! There is

   within the regenerate man a principle of Divine birth, a Seed which is
   incorruptible which will remain and abide in the renewed soul forever
   and ever.

   This seed, or principle faith, excites into growth and energy. Faith
   arouses love, stirs up courage, girds patience with her belt and
   perseverance with her shoes. She excites zeal and stirs up jealousy,
   bestirs desires after holiness and quickens the diligence of devotion.
   And so she keeps the powers of evil in check and purifies the heart.
   This is a brief sketch of how faith purifies, from day to day, the soul
   of man. I have done when I have said--see, then, to the simplicity and
   energy of your faith. Beloved, "as you have received Christ Jesus the
   Lord so walk in Him." As you believe in Him unto justification, believe
   in Him to sanctification. If anybody tells you that you are to get
   justification in one way and sanctification in another way believe him
   not!

   Jesus Christ is made of God unto us sanctification as well as
   redemption. Pharisees virtually teach us that we are to be sanctified
   by the Law, though justified by faith, but we know better! These are
   twin Covenant blessings and are not to be had apart. Believe in Christ
   to conquer sin as well as to pardon sin. Believe that the only power
   which can subdue a base passion in you is the power which washed you
   from your iniquity of old. Trust Christ with the power of sin as well
   as the guilt of sin. You need not go through a round of performances in
   order to be purified in heart. You need not look for a higher life than
   Jesus gave you when you looked and lived--there is no higher life, for
   He gave you His own! What more do you need than the Holy Spirit which
   quickens you? What is higher than that?

   What more can you have than what faith has brought you and will bring
   you? Jesus has given you Himself! Did you believe in half a Christ at
   the beginning? Did you receive from Him a lower and inferior life? Oh,
   shame on you to think so! You trusted your soul wholly with Him, did
   you not? And did He not give His whole self to you? Do you mean to say
   that you trusted Him to save you from Hell and not from sin? Did you
   trust Him to blot out the past and were you fool enough to trust to
   yourself for keeping in the future? If so, you did not believe in Him
   at all--your faith was faulty at the very core--for Christ must be
   everything or nothing!

   And, if up to now you have been so foolish as to have half a
   Savior--and if even now you are looking for something which is not
   contained in Him--be foolish no longer! Go back to the very beginning
   and say, "Blessed Savior, just as I am I come to You. Behold, I take
   You to be All in All to me, for wisdom, righteousness, sanctification
   and redemption." Doing this you shall find all in Jesus and, by faith,
   your heart shall be purified. I had intended to appeal to sinners, but
   my voice refuses to be longer tried and so I leave it with the
   prayerful desire that the whole subject may appeal to seekers and
   encourage them. God save you. Amen.

Enlivening and Invigorating

   (No. 1350)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Quicken me according to Your Word." Psalm 119:25.

   You will frequently find David uttering this petition. It is a favorite
   prayer of his, "Quicken me, O Lord!" And, as David was like the rest of
   us--indeed, his experience is the mirror of the experience of all
   Believers--you may depend upon it, we all have a great need to pray as
   he did, "Quicken me, O Lord!" If he felt a coldness and deadness
   frequently stealing over him, so do we. Did he find it hard to endure
   such a wretched state? So ought we, also, to loathe and abhor it. And
   as he cried to the Strong for strength and knew that quickening must
   come from God, we ought to know--I trust we know--the same resource
   under the same necessity. Therefore, let it be our prayer now and let
   the prayer be repeated often--"Quicken me, O Lord, according to Your
   Word."

   How are we to understand this quickening? It means, of course, making
   alive, keeping alive, and giving more life-- in a word, enlivening. He
   was alive--he was a spiritual man, or else he would not have asked for
   life. Dead men never pray, "Quicken me." It is a sign that there is
   life, already, when a man is able to say, "Give me life, O Lord!" This
   is not the prayer of the unconverted! It is the prayer of a man who is
   already regenerate and has the love of God in his soul-- "Quicken me, O
   Lord, according to Your Word." Quickening, of course, comes to us,
   first, by regeneration. It is then that we receive spiritual life. And
   as there is no natural life in the world except that of which God is
   the Author, so assuredly in the new world there is no spiritual life
   except that which God has created.

   The first quickening is that which comes upon us when we begin to feel
   our need of a Savior, when we begin to perceive the preciousness of
   that Savior and when, with a feeble finger, we touch the hem of the
   Savior's garment. Then are we quickened into newness of life! But that
   spiritual life needs to be kept alive. It is like the life of a fire
   which must be fed with fuel and supported with air. It is like our
   natural life which needs food to sustain it and needs to breathe the
   atmosphere in order to its continuance. We are as much creatures of
   God's power in our continuing to live as in our commencing to live!
   And, spiritually, we owe as much to Divine Grace that we remain
   Believers as that we became Believers. As soon as we get spiritual
   life, this prayer is most proper as a sacred instinct, "Lord, continue
   this life in my soul, continue to quicken me, for, if You do not, I
   have no life in myself apart from You and I would die were I severed
   from You, as does a branch when severed from the vine. Continue
   therefore, good Lord, to quicken me."

   Obviously, too, some special invigoration and excitement of life must
   be implied here. The trees, all through the winter, are alive. Their
   substance is in them when they cast their leaves. The vitality is not
   extinct, though our poet of "The Seasons" does sing--

   "How dead the vegetable kingdom lies: How dumb the tuneful choir!"

   A Divine act of power secretly maintains the life, hidden away till
   spring comes. Then the chains of frost are broken, the genial warmth
   begins to light upon the sealed buds, the sap flows and the trees, in
   their reviving tints and bursting buds, give such promise of returning
   foliage and flower that in a very special sense they may be said to be
   quickened. As soon as the sap begins to rise, the buds swell, the
   leaves unwrap themselves and the concealed flowers gradually open--a
   quickening comes over what was alive and what had been kept alive all
   through its dreary, wintry time.

   So, Beloved, you see, first of all, God gives us life then He maintains
   life. And then, at times and seasons, (would to God they were more
   frequent and without intermission!), He gives vigor to that life so
   that it becomes more manifest and mighty. And then it is that in a
   conspicuous manner the quickening is seen. I would to God that He would
   lead some poor sinner to pray in the very first sense of the word,
   "Lord, quicken me! Give me life!" It would be a sign that life was
   coming! I would that every Christian would incessantly pray the prayer
   in the second sense--"Quicken me, Lord"--that is, "Continually keep me
   faithful and true to Your Word." And then, thirdly, I would that we
   would all go on to the

   third sense and say, "Lord, inspirit me, revive me, lift me up unto a
   higher life. Fill me with more of Your Holy Spirit and so make me more
   truthful and more like Your ever living Son Jesus, who has life in
   Himself."

   Having thus introduced to you the prayer, I would use the Psalm to
   explain it--to explain, rather, the experience which commends the
   prayer to our constant use. First, Brothers and Sisters, I would assign
   some reasons why you need quickening. Secondly, I would point out some
   motives to see it. Thirdly, we shall mention some ways in which it is
   worked. And, fourthly, we will suggest pleas such as the Psalmist used,
   for obtaining it.

   I. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY WE SHOULD SEEK QUICKENING. You cannot
   overlook that confessed in the text--because of the deadening influence
   of this world--"My soul cleaves unto the dust: quicken me according to
   Your Word." We are surrounded with dust. We are associated with dust.
   The best and brightest things that are in this world are made of dust.
   And as for ourselves, although we have within us a new and higher life
   that has no fraternity with the dust, there is an old life belonging to
   us which is brother to the dust--which says to the worm, "You are my
   sister." "Dust you are, and unto dust you shall return," is true of
   every one of us.

   Yet, Beloved, we cannot feed on the dust--that is the serpent's
   meat--it is not ours. The new life in us craves for something higher,
   but the old nature tries to be content with dust. It clings to it--the
   dust cleaves to it and it cleaves to the dust. You know how the care
   and cross, the work and worry of a busy day will often dampen your
   ardor in prayer and disqualify your thoughts for devout meditation? You
   cannot think much of treasure laid up in Heaven if you think a great
   deal of this world's goods.

   Riches are often a dangerous encumbrance to those who seek after
   righteousness. They steal the heart away from God. Matthew Henry, in
   his own sharp style, warns us that the care in getting, the fear in
   keeping, the temptation in using, the guilt in abusing, the sorrow in
   losing and the responsibility of giving account for gold and silver,
   houses and lands, accumulate a heavy burden for him to bear who would
   have a conscience void of offense toward God and toward man. And yet if
   you have but little of this world's wealth, you will find poverty a
   trying ordeal. The cares of poverty, like those of property, often
   break the calm repose which our faith ought to enjoy.

   If things go smoothly with you in business, then those smooth,
   deceitful streams bear you away from God. And, if they go roughly with
   you, then in the deep and in the storm you are too apt to forget the
   Lord or to murmur against His Providence. There is nothing in this
   world to help a Christian--it is all against him! The world holds us to
   itself as tightly as it can--it acts like bird-lime to us. When we
   would mount on the wings of eagles, we are often like the eagle that
   you see in the gardens where they keep such creatures--there is a chain
   on our foot and we cannot rise. Our soul cleaves to the dust.

   Now, as this is the case and as you cannot get out of the world, pray
   that you may rise superior to its influence. You men of business, you
   heads of families, you who guide and you who follow, you who are
   sociable and you who are solitary--all of you must still be in the
   world and mix with men of the world--therefore cry to God, yes, cry
   mightily, "Lord, deliver us from the deadening influence of the world
   in which we live! Quicken us, we beseech You, from day to

   day!"

   A second reason for our need of quickening lies in the influence of
   vanity--of that which is actually sinful. Refer to the 37th
   verse--"Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken me in Your
   way." As we go about in the world we see a great deal of that which is
   injurious to us. The sins of others leave some kind of stain upon the
   conscience. I question whether you can read a newspaper and scan the
   story of a murder or a robbery, or survey with more distant glance in
   any book of history the sin of your fellow men without being, in a
   degree, injured. We are compelled to see much of vanity and sin in our
   daily callings. We do not merely read of profanity but we hear the
   oaths.

   You enter into a railway carriage and you cannot always avoid hearing
   conversation which is the reverse of pure. You go into your house and,
   unless you are happily situated so that all are Christians, there will
   be a great deal of which you cannot approve and which can be of no
   benefit to your soul. Besides, the whole world runs after its own
   idols--men each seek his own, and not the things of Christ--and all
   these things are vanity. "Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, all is
   vanity."

   Our eyes are often fascinated by the glitter and the glare of these
   vanities. The world puts on a very beauteous complexion. She attires
   her head and paints her face like Jezebel. And it is not always easy,
   like Jehu, to detest her, and to say, "Fling her down, and let the dogs
   consume her." We have nothing to do with this vain world! We are not
   citizens of

   this land! But, truly, Madam Bubble, as Bunyan calls her, with her
   purse and her person, continually presenting herself, is enough to make
   even Standfast, himself, to stagger and even he needs to fall on his
   knees, and cry, "Quicken Me, O Lord, and turn away my eyes from
   beholding vanity."

   There is thus a second good reason why we should seek for quickening.
   Sometimes we shall have need to cry for quickening because we are
   surrounded by deceivers. Turn to the 87th and 88th verses--"They had
   almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not Your Precepts. Quicken
   me after Your loving kindness; so shall I keep the testimony of Your
   mouth." If you are often assailed by foes and if those foes happen to
   be the men of your own household--if they jeer at your faith, if they
   make a jest of holiness on purpose to pain you--you will need a great
   deal of Divine Grace not to be ruffled.

   To always be a dove--to be a dove in the midst of ravens. To always be
   a lamb--to be a lamb in the midst of wolves--is not so easy. He must
   have much spiritual life who shall be able, wisely and discreetly, to
   behave himself in the midst of those who lie in wait to entrap him in
   every word that he says. Remember how David acted in the court of Saul,
   when Saul eyed him. Unsullied purity is the safest policy. Though Saul
   eyed David, he could not see any fault or rake up any charge that he
   could bring against him. Oh, that all of you young people, especially
   those of you who are subjected to scorn and contempt because of your
   fidelity to Christ, may be doubly blessed with Grace--may you be,
   indeed, quickened to the full spiritual life that you may stand the
   test of persecution and reproach, of suspicion and disparagement, of
   misrepresentation and slander which is sure to come upon you!

   Do not pray to be rid of the grievance--rather rejoice that you are
   counted worthy to suffer shame for your Savior's sake! You may pray, if
   you like, that the distress may be lightened because your strength is
   small. You may pray that your flight is not in the winter--but do not
   make that the special object of your petition. Rather pray for Grace to
   endure it! Pray for life, spiritual life, that you may throw it off. I
   suppose that, in order to prevent disease, it is a good thing to remove
   the cause of the disease and take away everything that produces ill
   savors in the air. But the sure thing is for the man himself to be
   vigorous as to his own life.

   I have no doubt many die in moderately healthy localities because they
   have no stamina. They are constitutionally weak, while the young man
   who is in robust health may even pass through a pestiferous district
   and be for hours in the midst of malaria without falling a prey to its
   deadly influence. And this simply because the life that is in him
   resists the disease. Your business, dear Friend, if you live in the
   midst of those that are set on fire by Hell--those who pour out venom
   against you, is to pray-- "Lord, quicken me that I may have so much
   spiritual life that these evil influences may not be ruinous to me.
   Deliver me from them when it is Your will, but meanwhile let me have
   such a full tide of life that I may be able to endure what I must
   encounter without being injured."

   Another reason for seeking quickening will be found in the 107th verse:
   "I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O Lord, according unto Your
   Word." In seasons of affliction we are very apt to fall into a dark,
   cold, dead state of mind. We have known many persons in poverty. I have
   often been sorely pained by it--when members of this Church, who have
   much, become very poor--and have given up attendance at the House of
   God. I could understand their reasons far better than I could
   appreciate them. Their pride was doubtless wounded, because they could
   not dress as they used to do, though I am sure nobody here thinks any
   better of you for dressing yourselves in fine clothes. I do not think
   so much of you, myself.

   As they could not dress quite so well they felt they could not mix as
   they did with some with whom they were once equal in circumstances. So
   they have gone out by the wayside. It is a sad thing when they do so. I
   am much saddened by it. I hope none of you ever will. You ought to
   think that you will be more welcome at the House of God when you are in
   trouble than you ever were before! And if you lose your earthly
   possessions, it is all the more reason why you should seek to hold
   faster to the riches which are above.

   If you are in pain, too, that kind of affliction has a great tendency
   to distract the mind. Who can think when the brow is throbbing? Who can
   be calm when every vein becomes a road for the hot feet of pain to
   travel on? It is not easy. Well now, we have reason, when we feel weak,
   when we feel that the mind is suffering in sympathy with the body, to
   cry, "Lord, let Grace triumph over nature. Let Your Spirit have
   power--Your blessed comforting Spirit--to lift me up above the weight
   which now is laid upon me, that I may glory in tribulation because Your
   power rests upon me."

   You look upon a weight as a heavy matter which keeps you down, but
   mechanics know how to make a weight raise you. A little adjustment of
   ropes and pulleys and such-like contrivances, and the weight shall lift
   you up! And the Lord knows how to make our afflictions minister to our
   quickening, as we shall have to show you directly. But in themselves
   they deaden us. They do not assist, but rather hinder and so, whenever
   they come, then is the time for us to pray with special emphasis,
   "Quicken me, O Lord, according to Your Word." Thus have I endeavored to
   show you from the Psalm itself some of the reasons why we need
   quickening.

   II. Now, let us pass on to describe SOME OF THE MOTIVES FOR SEEKING
   QUICKENING. There are very

   many. Seek it because of what you are. You are a Christian and,
   therefore, already alive unto God. Life seeks more life-- it is its
   natural tendency. If there is life in a tree, it seeks to put forth its
   branches. And when it has had its spring growth spurt, you will notice
   that it then begins to seek for its midsummer spurt. And when the
   midsummer growth is over, the tree always has an eye to the growth of
   the next spring! And before the old leaves go there is every
   preparation made for the new leaves. Life is always aiming at more
   life. It a law of Nature. There is a propagation continually
   progressing in which life develops and multiplies itself. Now, if you
   have the life implanted by the Holy Spirit, you will long for more. If
   you do not long to have more life, it surely must be because you have
   no life. The living man will be sure to cry to God that he may have
   life more abundantly.

   The next motive is not only because of what you are, but because of
   what you ought to be. Here is a question for you which I will leave you
   to answer--"What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy
   conversation and godliness?" We like, sometimes, to work out a problem.
   There is one to solve. Draw a picture, if you can, of what you ought to
   be. I will tell you, if you draw that picture accurately, what it will
   be like. It will be like Jesus Christ! That is the answer to this
   question--"What manner of persons ought we to be?"

   Now Christ was full of life. Although He did not strive or cry, or lift
   up His voice, or cause it to be heard in the streets by way of seeking
   after popular notoriety, yet what life was in Him! He was brimful of
   life! There was nothing stagnant, indifferent, or purposeless in any of
   His actions or in all His career. Why, the life of Christ was so full
   that it seemed to flow out even onto His garments, so that when they
   touched His garments, virtue went out of Him! How full must He have
   been of the living force--the inward power! O Beloved, we ought to be
   so! As we are redeemed, as we are quickened by Christ--as we are
   members of His body, as we belong to Him--we ought to reckon ourselves
   dead unto sin, but alive unto God by Jesus Christ!

   Above all men that live, the Christian ought to live at the most
   vigorous rate. We have a race to run! We must not creep and crawl, or
   we shall not win the prize. We have a battle to fight! If we should
   sheath our sword, put off our armor and go to sleep, how can we
   overcome our enemies? We have an agony to endure, according to His
   power that works in us mightily, and there cannot be this resisting
   unto blood--striving against sin--unless all our passions are awakened
   and all our powers are stirred for the wondrous inward strife. We ought
   to ask for quickening because of what we ought to be.

   Then, we ought to ask for quickening because of what we shall be. "It
   does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when He shall
   appear we shall be like He, for we shall see Him as He is." Brothers
   and Sisters, you are to be a pure spirit in Heaven! Be spiritual now!
   Brothers and Sisters, you are to sing among the angels! Rehearse the
   music now! Brothers and Sisters, you are to see His face that is as the
   sun that shines in its strength! Let not your eyes be now sealed with
   dust! Let them be clear, as clear as they can be in this misty
   atmosphere of earth. Brothers and Sisters, you are to sit upon the
   Throne with Christ, for He says, "As I have overcome, and have sat down
   with My Father upon His Throne, so, also, shall you sit with Me upon My
   Throne." Remember where you are to be and behave yourself accordingly!
   You cannot maintain the dignity of your high calling, or your heavenly
   destiny unless you have an abundance of spiritual life--so pray,
   "Quicken me, O Lord."

   Now, to come back to the Psalmist's own confessions and reflections. He
   gives us another motive for seeking this in the 88th verse: "Quicken me
   after Your loving kindness; so shall I keep the testimony of Your
   mouth." We need quickening in order to obedience. If our life decays,
   then the power of sin will get the mastery over us. We cannot go in the
   way of obedience and punctuality and scrupulous care and inward
   heartiness unless we are daily quickened. I am sure you want to be
   holy, Brothers and Sisters. I am sure you do! Well, then, pray,
   "Quicken me." There is no such thing as dead holiness--it must be
   living holiness and you must be made alive in order to be obedient--for
   there is no such thing

   as dead obedience. Up to the altar of God they brought birds and they
   brought beasts, but they never brought fish! Why? Because they could
   not bring live fish and there must be no sacrifice presented to God but
   that which has life! Ask for life, that you may have obedience!

   Look at the 107th verse and you have another reason for seeking
   quickening, because it will be your comfort. "I am afflicted very much:
   quicken me, O Lord, according to Your Word." Or, better still, at the
   50th verse, "This is my comfort in my affliction: for Your Word has
   quickened me." Do you need comforting? Get quickening! Do not so much
   ask the Lord to give you sweet promises, as to give you inward life,
   for in life there is always light. "In Him was life, and the life was
   the light of men." As the light is the life, the life is the light--and
   when you get the life of God within your soul, you will get the comfort
   of God. I urge you to seek quickening, then, if you are under any
   distress, because it will be the quickest means of your finding
   consolation in your trouble.

   Look, also, at the 87th and the 88th verses, to which we have already
   referred, and you will see that we ought to seek quickening as the best
   security against attacks of enemies. We need not examine how we can
   meet the foe, or with what argument we can refute his sophistries, or
   with what weapons we can overthrow him. "Quicken me, O Lord," is still
   the prayer, even though they threaten to consume us from off the face
   of the earth! We have but to keep close to the precepts of God and pray
   for quickening, and we shall be "more than conquerors through Him that
   loved us." The use of the word, "quicken," will be seen in the 93rd
   verse. "I will never forget Your Precepts: for with them you have
   quickened

   me."

   We are always in danger of forgetting God's precepts. So, to invigorate
   our memories and to fortify our hearts, we must get quickening. Nothing
   can make a man so secure of walking rightly and defying all the attacks
   of his enemies as the reception of spiritual life. The young man can
   only cleanse his way by taking heed to it according to God's Word. But
   he cannot take heed to his way if he is not alive in the way. Life is
   the great thing. Look at a pool of water when it stands still--how it
   becomes mantled over with weeds--how stagnant and defiled it is. But
   give it vent and let it run down yonder brook among the stones--let it
   leap in little cascades on its way down to the river. It is alive and
   see how pure it gets, refining as it goes, dropping all the filthiness
   it had accumulated before! It become sweeter and clearer because of
   life! So it must be with us. We must have life!

   We shall forget God's precepts, also, and lose the purity of life
   unless quickening is abundantly given to us. If I needed some one
   thrilling motive to awaken the reluctant, I would resort to this--the
   terrible consequences of losing spiritual life. I do not mean the
   effect of losing it, altogether, but of lacking it in its manifest
   display. Alas that it should be so easy to give obvious illustrations!
   But I could tell you of many congregations and Churches where there is
   no evidence of vitality, growth or increase. It is as if they were all
   dead. I do not say that there is no spiritual life, but there is none
   in the sense in which I am using the term. They have fallen into a dead
   sleep and the members of the Church are cold, apathetic, spiritless.

   Life among them is at the lowest ebb. You cannot be sure they breathe.
   By breathe I mean--a breath of prayer. Some of them have not been to a
   Prayer Meeting, they could not tell when. Some do not know if they ever
   were. And when they attend Lord's-Day services, not a few of them
   literally sleep--and the rest of them sleep with their eyes open. The
   minister is dozing, dreaming, snoring, talking in his sleep--that is
   what his preaching is like. There is plenty of preaching like that--an
   inarticulate snoring of the everlasting Gospel! The preacher, perhaps,
   reads, or else he repeats what he has laboriously committed to memory
   and says it as a school boy does his lesson--and he is glad when it is
   over--for he considers that preaching twice on Sunday wears him out,
   dear man!

   And well it may, as he does it. It wears his people out as well. They
   have no evangelical spirit. The surrounding neighborhood is not
   evangelized by them. They do not increase--they do not think of
   increasing. In fact, they get fewer as the good people go home to
   Heaven. Any attempt to do anything there would be looked upon as "an
   innovation." Yet they do something--they have a disturbance every now
   and then. They hold what they call a, "Church meeting," which means, in
   their case, a spiritual bear-garden in which they show their life. And
   one minister after another is driven away--not that it is a fit place
   for anybody to desire to go, you know, for there is very little to be
   had except abuse. But still, that is the style of the thing--and there
   are hundreds of churches in England in that condition.

   O that the Lord would quicken them! May this place be reduced to ashes
   and may the congregation be scattered to the four winds of Heaven
   sooner than it should become a huge mausoleum, a catacomb of which it
   may be said, "the dead

   are there"! Ah, it is ill to have "the means of Grace" without the
   Grace of the means--to have a name to live and to be dead! God save us
   from it! Take heed to yourselves! Some of the members of this Church, I
   fear, are getting into that condition! Yet not, I know, you that are
   present this evening. You would not, most likely, have been here on
   such a wet night as this if you had not some care for the things of
   God.

   I refer to those that are not here. When you get home tell them
   so--tell them what I have said about it--and then perhaps they will
   say, "Well, if the pastor always speaks severely of those who are not
   there we had better go, so as to escape his censures."

   III. Now let us mention briefly SOME OF THE WAYS BY WHICH THIS
   QUICKENING MAY BE WORKED IN

   US. Of course the Lord, Himself, must do it. In prayer it must be
   sought because by His power it must be worked. The prayer is, "Quicken
   me, O Lord, according to Your Word." He does not expect the quickening
   from any but a Divine source. From where can life come but from the
   ever living God? How can we expect that we should get life if, while we
   seek the gratuity, we totally forget the Divine energy of Him who alone
   can bestow it? In the 37th verse we are told how the Lord often
   quickens His people, namely, by turning off their eyes from beholding
   vanity. "Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken me in
   Your way."

   The Lord sometimes takes the vanity away of which we made our idol--or
   else He takes us away from the idol and does not permit us to find any
   contentment in it. Oh, it is half the battle to be weaned from the
   creature! It is half the battle, I say, to get the eyes off vanity, for
   then you are likely to get your eyes turned upon God! May He be
   graciously pleased to quicken some of you in that way. In the 50th
   verse we find that God quickens His people by His Word. "Your Word has
   quickened me." And the part of the Word which He often blesses to this
   end is remarkable, for, in the 93rd verse it is written, "I will never
   forget Your Precepts; for with them You have quickened me."

   Promises are quickening, doctrines are quickening, but David says,
   "Your Precepts--with them you have quickened me." If we preach
   frequently and earnestly the precepts of our Lord there are hearers who
   will complain and say, "The minister is getting legal." No, Brothers
   and Sisters, it is you that are getting dead, for when you are alive
   you will love God's Laws and those precepts will quicken you. "But they
   pain me," says one. That is often how people are quickened! While a
   person is drowning, we have heard that his sensations are often really
   delightful--but when he is fished out of the water, as soon as he
   begins to recover life, the blood begins to tingle in the veins and the
   pain is intense. The pain of returning life is something terrible.

   Well, so it is with God's precepts when He quickens us with them. These
   Laws pain us because they show us our shortcomings, expose to us our
   faultiness and humble us. Brothers and Sisters--that is the way to be
   quickened! When you are numbed, you know that is next door to being
   dead. But when that numbed flesh of yours begins to come to life
   again--you have felt it, you must have felt it--when the blood begins
   to circulate by rubbing, a sharp pain is excited in the part that,
   before, was numbed and painless. Be thankful for the pain--that is an
   index of life. "I love Your Precepts, for with them you have quickened
   me."

   May the Lord apply a text of Scripture to your soul with power, or let
   Him send a Word from the minister as he speaks in Jehovah's name with a
   Divine force, and you will soon feel the effect. Though you appeared to
   be dead, you will start up and begin to live again! Have you not often
   found it so? Have you not often found great reviving come to your
   sinking spirit? Pray the Lord to make His Word always thus vivifying
   and inspiriting to you. In the 107th verse we have another means of
   quickening which God frequently uses, namely, affliction. "I am
   afflicted very much: quicken me, O Lord, according to Your Word." God
   frequently employs adversity as a black poker to stir us up that the
   flame of devotion may be brighter.

   When you observe the fire in your sitting room getting dull and going
   out, you do not always put more coals on, but you stir it--and
   sometimes affliction does that for us. It stirs us and makes the life
   which was languishing to briskly burst forth. Be thankful if God stirs
   your fire. Then, again, this quickening is sometimes worked in us by
   means of Divine comfort, as in the 50th verse--"This is my comfort, for
   Your Word has quickened me." The great flush of comfort, the sudden
   inflow of supreme joy when you were much depressed--this has greatly
   cheered and invigorated you. At least I know it has often been so with
   me.

   When very despondent and sad at heart, I have felt a soft stream, as
   though it were the Gulf Stream with its warm, genial temperature,
   flowing into my soul, melting all the icebergs that had gathered round
   my heart. and I have wondered what it was. How has my gratitude turned
   to my gracious God and found sweet expression in that hymn--

   "Your mercy is more than a match for my heart, Which wonders to feel
   its own hardness depart, Dissolved by Your goodness, I fall to the
   ground, And weep to the praise of the mercy I've found." You will often
   have proved, I doubt not, how God uses the comfort of His Spirit to
   quicken His children.

   IV. Our last point is to enquire WHAT ARE OUR PLEAS WHEN WE COME BEFORE
   GOD TO ASK FOR

   QUICKENING? What arguments shall we use? Well, Brothers and Sisters,
   use first the argument of your necessity. Whatever that necessity is,
   particularize it, as David does in the 107th verse--"I am afflicted
   very much; quicken me." Or take our text, "My soul cleaves to the dust,
   quicken me." Plead your necessities! Your needs shall be the argument
   for the oil and wine. Your emaciation and your hunger shall be the
   argument for a festival. Show the Lord what you are and where you are.
   Confess it before Him and this shall be good pleading.

   Also plead, if it is in your power to do so, the earnest desire that
   God has kindled in you. Read the 40th verse-- "Behold I have longed for
   Your Precepts; quicken me in Your righteousness." This is as much as to
   say, "Lord, You have given me great longings after You. You gave me
   these cravings--will You not satisfy them? Do You torture me with the
   miseries of Tantalus? Do You grieve me with a thirst which You will not
   gratify? Have You given me a hunger for the Bread of Heaven only for
   the sake of torturing me?" Beloved, if you have a desire, you may
   depend upon it, the desire of the righteous shall be granted. God does
   not excite the appetite without providing the nourishment.

   If He makes you hunger and thirst after righteousness, remember the
   promise, "Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after
   righteousness, for they shall be filled." They shall not have merely a
   little, a crumb or two to stay their stomachs, but they shall be
   filled! Go and plead that before God. "I have longed after Your
   Precepts; quicken me in Your righteousness." There is the second plea.
   And then you may find a third in the very righteousness of God, as we
   have seen in the 40th verse. Appeal to His righteousness! Do I see you
   start back abashed? Do I hear you say, "Oh no! I could not appeal to
   that, for the righteousness of God must condemn me."

   Stop a minute. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
   forgive us our sins." Why, the Justice of God is on the side of the man
   who has received God's promise because it were unjust of God to break
   it! He will not alter the thing that has gone out of His mouth! The
   Lord has given His Word that He will give His people life. The very
   fact of His having made them live at all is the proof that He means to
   continue to make them live! Go and plead it, then. Say--"In Your
   righteousness, oh Lord, quicken me." David is very often harping upon
   that string. As I showed you in the reading, he twice appeals to God's
   judgment, or His Justice, that He would quicken him.

   Another, and a very sweet plea is that of God's loving kindness. Read
   the 88th verse--"Quicken me after Your loving kindness." Look at the
   149th verse--"Hear my voice according unto Your loving kindness: O
   Lord, quicken me according to Your judgment." And so again in the 156th
   verse--"Great are Your tender mercies, O Lord: quicken me according to
   Your judgments." "You pitying God, give me more life. O You who wills
   not the death of any, give me more life. O You that loves as a father
   loves, give me more life! O You who have engraved me upon the palms of
   Your hands, quicken me! Quicken me, I beseech You." Are they not
   blessed pledges to lay hold on--His loving kindness and His tender
   mercies? With such promises you will be sure to prevail!

   And then what a comprehensive plea is that of our text--"Quicken me
   according to Your Word." You have it in the 25th verse and you have it
   in the hundred and seventh. He pleads the Word of God. What that Word
   was that David had to appeal to, it would rather puzzle me to tell you.
   His Bible was not so large nor near so full as ours. I do not find any
   promise of quickening before David's time. Perhaps a special promise
   had been given to him, or, at any rate, the promise is virtually in the
   Pentateuch. But certainly, to us, there is abundant testimony to be
   found in the Word of God, for our Lord Jesus Christ Himself has told
   us--"Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never
   thirst, but it shall be in him a well of water springing up into
   everlasting life." "I give unto My sheep eternal life." The Son of man
   has come not only that we might have life, but that we might have it
   more abundantly!

   Plead the promises, Brothers and Sisters! Plead the promises and, as
   you plead them before the Lord, you may rest quite certain that God
   will be as good as His Word and, if you can plead the promise, the
   promise will be surely fulfilled

   to you. Beloved in Christ, do tenderly watch over your spiritual life,
   or otherwise you are hypocrites when you pray "quicken me." Take heed
   lest you neglect the food of your souls! Do not go where your life
   would be in danger! Do not seek worldly company, do not indulge in
   worldly amusements. Keep out of all the deadening influences of the
   world as much as you can.

   Have you ever seen the Grotto del Cane near Naples? It has a deadly gas
   at the bottom of it. They take a dog and throw him in and when they
   drag him up the dog looks as if he were dead. But by the aid of a fresh
   water bath he comes round again. As they thus kill the poor dog half a
   dozen times a day, I do not envy him his experience. Indeed, I rather
   think if I were that dog I would lose no time in seeking another
   master! Yet there are some professing Christians that will go into bad
   company--get into the bad gas of temptation--and then they go and hear
   a sermon and get back their spiritual life. I would advise you not to
   be like that poor dog, but to keep out of harm's way.

   If you have life, do your best to maintain it and do not run the risk
   of suspended animation. Knowing the worth and joy of life, yourself,
   pray very earnestly that God would give it to others. Look on the dead
   in sin, but not with stony eyes. Look on them with tears. Even if I
   knew that my hearers must be lost, I would pray God to help me to weep
   over them, because our Savior's tears over Jerusalem, you remember,
   were accompanied with a distinct indication that Jerusalem would be
   destroyed. "Oh, that you had known, even you, in this your day, the
   things which make for your peace! But now are they hid from your eyes."
   Still He wept.

   We have no such terrible knowledge about the destiny of any man. We
   look hopefully upon you unconverted people and we exhort you because we
   expect you to believe in Jesus! We sincerely trust that you will be
   saved and, therefore, we pray for you in hope. May the Lord in infinite
   mercy lead you to feel for yourselves and pray for yourselves--
   "Quicken me, O Lord!" Do you feel that prayer welling up from your
   soul? Does it rise from your heart? Then, already there is something of
   spiritual life there! Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall
   have life, for He who said, "He that lives and believes in Me shall
   never die," said also, "He that believes in Me, though He were dead,
   yet shall He live."

   God give you that living faith which is the token of the Divine life.
   To Him be glory forever and ever! Amen.

The Divine Call for Missionaries

   (No. 1351)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING APRIL 22, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who
   will go for Us? Then said I, Here am I; send me." Isaiah 6:8.

   BROTHERS AND SISTERS, the heathen are perishing and there is but one
   way of salvation for them, for there is but one name given under Heaven
   among men whereby they must be saved. God, in the glorious unity of His
   Divine Nature is calling for messengers who shall proclaim to men the
   way of life. Out of the thick darkness my ears can hear that sound
   mysterious and Divine, "Whom shall I send?" If you will but listen with
   the ear of faith you may hear it in this house today--"Whom shall I
   send?" While the world lies under the curse of sin, the living God, who
   wills not that any should perish but that they should come to
   repentance, is seeking heralds to proclaim His mercy. He is asking,
   even in pleading terms, for some who will go forth to the dying
   millions and tell the wondrous story of His love--"Whom shall I

   send?"

   As if to make the voice more powerful by a threefold utterance we hear
   the sacred Trinity enquire, "Who will go for Us?" The Father asks, "Who
   will go for Me and invite My far-off children to return?" The Son
   enquires, "Who will seek for Me, My redeemed but wandering sheep?" The
   Holy Spirit demands, "In whom shall I dwell and through whom shall I
   speak that I may convey life to the perishing multitudes?" God, in the
   unity of His Nature, cries, "Whom shall I send?" and in the trinity of
   His Persons, He asks, "Who will go for Us?" Happy shall we be, today,
   if earnest responses shall be heard in this house--"Here am I, send
   me." It is ours, at any rate, very solemnly to put the matter before
   you, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, and while we shall try to plead
   Jehovah's cause we trust the Holy Spirit may be here, saying of one and
   another, quite unknown to us, "Separate Me Saul and Barnabas for the
   work whereunto I have called them."

   Yes, may the constraining voice of the special call of Grace come to
   the ear of some here present who shall respond like young Samuel and
   say, "Here am I, for You did call me." First, we shall, this morning,
   consider the vision of Glory in reference to the offer of service made
   by the Prophet--the vision which he saw. And secondly, the vision of
   ordination which he more than saw, for his lips were touched. Thirdly,
   we will speak upon the Divine Voice and conclude by dwelling upon the
   earnest response.

   I. Reverently, and with all our hearts attention, let us gaze upon THE
   VISION OF GLORY which Isaiah saw. It was necessary for him to see it in
   order that he might be brought into the condition of heart out of which
   should come the full consecration expressed in--"Here am I, send me."
   Observe what he saw. He saw, first, the supreme Glory of God. "I saw
   the Lord," he says, "sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and His
   train filled the temple." Was it Jesus that he saw? Was this one of the
   anticipations of His future Incarnation? Probably so, for John writes
   in his 12th chapter, at the 41st verse, "These things said Isaiah, when
   he saw His Glory, and spoke of Him"--referring to the Lord Jesus
   Christ. We will not, however, insist upon that interpretation, for the
   word, "Lord," doubtless included, at times, the whole Godhead and,
   therefore, the vision may have represented the Lord Himself revealed in
   visible form.

   As to His absolute Essence, eyes cannot behold the Lord, but He chooses
   to make an apparition of Himself-- appearing among men in such a form
   as may come under the understanding of their senses. Now, Brothers and
   Sisters, we know of nothing that will supply a better motive for
   missionary work, or for Christian effort of any sort, than a sight of
   the Divine Glory. This is one of the strongest impulses a soul can
   feel. Behold, O believers in the Divine Word, at this day the Lord God,
   even Jehovah, is not dethroned, but sits on the Throne of His Glory!
   Some know Him not and others deny Him and blaspheme Him, but He is
   still God over all, blessed forever!

   See the patience of His infinite majesty--He sits in calm Glory upon
   His eternal Throne. The nations furiously rage and imagine a vain thing
   but, "He that sits in the heavens does laugh; the Lord does have them
   in derision." Still are His

   purposes fulfilled and His soul abides in its serenity. He is the same
   and of His years there is no end. He sits as a King, observe, upon a
   throne--He never renounces His sovereignty and dominion. All things
   still feel the Omnipotence of the reign of God. "The Lord has prepared
   His Throne in the heavens and His Kingdom rules over all." The
   rebellions of men, can they ever shake His firm dominion? No, but out
   of their wildest uproar He fashions order and by their most violent
   resistance He works His own purposes! After all, the Lord reigns--let
   the earth rejoice, let the multitudes of the isles be glad! Still,
   despite all the hurly-burly of war and all the wickedness of men in the
   dark places of the earth, and the detestable blasphemies of the heathen
   against the Most High, the Lord sits on a throne which can never be
   shaken.

   Nor is it a mean throne, either, nor one of little dignity. It is "high
   and lifted up." It is not merely above all other thrones by way of
   greater power, but over them all by way of supreme dominion over them,
   for He is King of kings and Lord of lords! I wish, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, we could get a glimpse of the Glory and power and dominion
   which belong to the Most High! If we did, though it would certainly
   humble us in the very dust, yet it would fire us with a consecrated
   indignation against those who set up other gods. It would fill us with
   a sacred courage to do and dare anything against these blind, deaf and
   dumb deities to whom it is almost too great an honor to pour contempt
   upon them! And it would make us feel confidence in the ultimate success
   of the cause and kingdom of the living God.

   Even now, while He restrains His hand, He sits upon a throne high and
   lifted up and is even now the Governor among the nations. The day shall
   surely come when all nations shall behold His Throne and bow before it
   and God shall be seen to be Lord over all. The God whom we serve is
   able to give victory to His own cause. Here is an impulse for us in all
   warring for His cause and crown. If you choose to take the text as
   referring to the Lord Jesus Christ, what a delight it is for us to
   think that there is no more for Him the thorny crown and the cruel
   lance and the contemptuous spit, but He who bowed His head to death has
   left the dead, no more to die and ascended to the right hand of God,
   even the Father!

   God, having highly exalted Him, He now sits upon a throne high and
   lifted up. This, in fact, is the origin of our commission--"Go you,
   therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them into the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." Because all power is
   given unto Him in Heaven and in earth, therefore we are to go forth and
   subdue the people under His feet. O, when will His Church fully believe
   in the Glory of her Lord and rejoice therein, so that His power shall
   fill her, as His train filled the temple? If we cannot behold His
   greatest glories, yet we pray that His Presence, by the Holy Spirit,
   like the perfumed smoke and the resplendent hems of His robes, may be
   known among us and fill us with adoration. Did the posts of the door
   move at that august Presence? Let our hearts be moved, also, as in
   lowly adoration we bow before Him who is Lord and Christ!

   But then Isaiah saw, also, the court of the great King. He beheld the
   glorious attendants who perpetually perform homage, nearest to His
   Throne. He says, "Above it (or rather above Him) stood the seraphims,"
   not implying that their feet rested upon the earth, or upon any other
   solid substance, but that they were stationary around and above the
   great King, poised in mid air in a circle, like a rainbow round about
   the Throne of God, or as a bodyguard surrounding the Throne of Majesty.
   There they were, waiting to know His pleasure, on the wing, ready for
   any errand and adoring while they waited. These seraphim may furnish us
   with a pattern for Christian service--as the Throne of God becomes the
   impulse to that service, so let these serve us as the model.

   They dwell near the Lord and so should we. He is their center and their
   bliss, even so should He be ours. But I specially note that they were
   burning ones, for such is the meaning of the word seraphims, a term
   applied in the Hebrew to the fiery flying serpents of the wilderness.
   These courtiers of the great King were creatures of fire, ablaze with
   ardor-- all glowing and shining, they worship Him--"who makes His
   angels spirits, His ministers a flame of fire." Jehovah, who is a
   consuming fire, can only fitly be served by those who are on fire,
   whether they are angels or men. Hence that solemn question, "Who among
   us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with
   everlasting burnings?" (Isa. 33:14).

   None can do this but the man on fire with Divine Love. In the Presence
   of that consuming fire, it is not possible for lukewarmness or
   indifference to exist, we would be utterly burned up. To act as
   courtier before the burning Throne of God requires a seraphic or
   burning spirit and if we become lethargic and soulless we shall not be
   counted worthy to be employed on Divine errands. Therefore, let all
   coolness of love and slumbering of spirit be removed. May the Lord make
   us, like John the Baptist, burning and shining lights! These courtiers
   of God were burning ones and they are, also,

   pictured to us--for remember these are only representations of things
   actually invisible and seen only in vision--as having six wings. Such
   are His servants full of motion, full of life!

   Some that I know of who profess to serve the Lord seem to have no wings
   at all, but are stolid and inactive--more like the sloth than the
   seraph--having more weight than wing. Those who come near Him should be
   all in motion, quick, active, willing, awake, energetic, ready to fly
   upon the Lord's business with a mighty swiftness. In a word, six fold
   should be their wings, that they may not tarry nor tire, nor linger nor
   loiter in the way. Have we such readiness of mind as this? Having life
   and motion, these glorious spirits use their powers with prudence and
   discretion. They use not all their wings for flight, but with two, each
   one covered his face, for even they cannot gaze upon the dazzling
   brightness of Jehovah's Throne and, therefore, in humble shamefacedness
   of awe they adore with veiled countenance!

   "With two he covered his feet," or his body, or his lower parts, for
   the seraph remembers that even though sinless, he is yet a creature
   and, therefore, he conceals himself in token of his nothingness and
   unworthiness in the Presence of the thrice Holy One. The middle pair of
   wings was used for flight, for mere bashfulness and humility cannot
   offer complete adoration, there must be active obedience and readiness
   of heart for service. Thus they have four wings for adoration and two
   for active energy--four to conceal themselves and two with which to
   occupy themselves in service. We may learn from them that we shall
   serve God best when we are most deeply reverend and humbled in His
   Presence. Veneration must be in larger proportion than vigor--adoration
   must exceed activity.

   As Mary at Jesus' feet was preferred to Martha and her much serving, so
   must sacred reverence take the first place and energetic service follow
   in due course. The angels do His commands, hearkening unto His voice
   and thus they excel. Our excellence must lie in the same direction--the
   union of worship with work in due proportions. The covering of the face
   is as necessary as the flight. The burning one is as seraphic in the
   veiling of his feet as in the stretching of his wings. Let us pray the
   Lord will fill us with the Divine enthusiasm, which is the work of the
   Holy Spirit, and so make us burning ones. And then when He has winged
   us with sacred energy, may He make us humble in mind, removing from us
   all vain curiosity, so that we shall not attempt to gaze with uncovered
   eyes on the great Incomprehensible. Let us pray that He will take away
   all unhallowed presumption, so that we will use no proud bravado, but
   cover our feet in the solemn Presence of the Holy One. Let us ask God
   to make us ready to every good word and work, swift to go anywhere and
   everywhere, as He may call us, being, as it were, six-winged in the
   service of our God!

   Again, another part of the vision of Isaiah in the temple was the
   perpetual song, for these sacred beings continually cried, "Holy, holy,
   holy is the Lord of Hosts, the whole earth is full of His Glory."
   Brothers and Sisters, let us take this cry to be the life song of each
   one of us! Adore the holy God, perfection's self! Whatever He shall do
   with you, bless Him and still call Him holy. Find no fault with His
   dispensations--never dare to quarrel with any of His ways. Holy, holy,
   holy, is He in all things. In creation, Providence and redemption He is
   holy, holy, holy! Praise Him with ardor! Be not content to call Him
   holy once, but dwell upon the theme! Extol the Lord with all your
   might! Raise again and again, and again the sacred song.

   Adore not only the Father, but the Son and the ever-blessed Spirit--let
   the Trinity in Unity be the object of your perpetual adoration--

   "Holy holy holy Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning our song shall
   rise to Thee! Holy, holy holy! Merciful and mighty! God in Three
   Persons, blessed Trinity!" While you praise His holiness do not forget
   His power, but adore Him as "Jehovah of Hosts." He is as great as He is
   good, as high as He is holy, as potent as He is pure! He created the
   heavens, the earth and all the hosts of them. Legions of angels do His
   bidding! Hosts of intelligences wait His call! All forces of Nature,
   animate and inanimate, march at His command! From the crash of thunder
   to the flight of an insect, all things are at His beck and call. Hosts
   of birds migrate at His direction. Hosts of fishes swarm the sea at His
   call. Hosts of locusts and caterpillars devour the fields at His order.
   His armies are innumerable and all living things are in their regiments
   a part of His camp which is very great.

   Men, also, whether they will or not, shall be subservient to His
   supreme dominion. Their armies and their navies fulfill His decrees
   even when they think not of Him. He is Lord of all! Exult in this and
   let your hearts be brave because of it. And then dwell, that you may
   feel a missionary spirit, on that last part of the song, "The whole
   earth is filled with His Glory," for so it really is in one sense.
   "Jehovah of Hosts is the fullness of the whole earth." God is glorious
   all over the

   world! Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of His Glory.
   Everything adores Him except that wandering, wayward creature, man!
   Turn this ascription, for it may be so read, into a wish--"Let the
   whole earth be filled with His Glory."

   Read it, if you please, as a prophecy--"The whole earth shall be filled
   with His glory," and then go forward, O you servants of the Most High,
   with this resolve--that in His hands you will be the means of
   fulfilling the prophecy by spreading abroad the knowledge of His name
   among the sons of men! The earth is the Lord's and the fullness
   thereof, and He must reign over it. Are you going to succumb to the
   modern theory that the world is never to be converted to God? Is human
   history to end with the triumph of the devil over the Church of God? Is
   the Lord about to give up the present battle of good with evil with
   feeble men as the instruments? Are the conditions of the conflict to be
   changed altogether? Is the Holy Spirit to fail until an earthly kingdom
   is set up for the Lord Jesus?

   Is the Gospel never to spread among the heathen? Is Christ to come upon
   an unenlightened heathen world, with Mohammed, the false prophet, still
   unconquered and the harlot of Rome still upon her seven hills and all
   the idols in their places? Is the battle which now glorifies God by the
   weakness of man to be fought out in another manner? You may believe it
   if you will and go to the beds of your inglorious sloth! But I think
   there is something more worthy of faith than that, namely, that God
   will be victorious all along the line in the present battle and in the
   present style of conflict! By His Church, His Word and His Spirit, He
   means to win the victory! By the testimony of weak, feeble men to the
   Gospel of His Grace, He means to conquer the powers of darkness!

   For nearly 2,000 years our Lord has stood foot to foot with Satan and
   He will not end this wrestling match till He has given His foe a deadly
   fall! Then the shout shall go up from a ransomed world, "Hallelujah!
   Hallelujah! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns." Oar prayers will never
   end till we see the desire of pious David fulfilled when he said, "Let
   the whole earth be filled with His Glory! Amen, and amen. The prayers
   of David, the son of Jesse are ended." We are looking and laboring for
   that consummation and we believe that we shall realize it, though it
   looks most improbable, especially just now when the heathen are
   converting our missionaries instead of the missionaries converting the
   heathen! We have had bishops turned into Zulus instead of Zulus into
   Christians and several other instances less known to evil fame!

   But we still believe in the conquest of the world because we believe in
   the Omnipotence of God. Nothing short of "dominion from sea to sea"
   dare we ask in prayer or seek in service for our Lord Jesus! The idols
   must be utterly abolished! Error and sin must fly before the light of
   the Truth of God and holiness! The ends of the earth must yet see the
   salvation of our God and the whole earth must be filled with His Glory!

   II. Let us now turn our thoughts to THE VISION OF ORDINATION. This man,
   Isaiah, was to go forth in

   Jehovah's name, but in order to preparation for so high a privilege, he
   must undergo a process peculiar but necessary. He was brought into a
   state which, to human judgment, would seem to disqualify him for all
   future usefulness, crushing the courage out of him and leaving him like
   a bruised reed. By reason of the glorious vision which he saw, there
   was no strength left in him. He was cast down as low as he could well
   go with a sense of his own utter unworthiness and felt himself to be
   less than nothing.

   In the Presence of God he cried, "Woe is me! for I am undone because I
   am a man of unclean lips." "Alas, alas, alas," he says, "woe has taken
   possession of my soul. I am destroyed by it." Yes, dear Brother, and
   this is our way to success-- God will never do anything with us till He
   has, first of all, undone us! We must be taken to pieces and made to
   undergo a process much like destruction--and then we shall be newly
   fashioned according to a nobler mold--more fit to be used by our great
   Lord. I shall not regret if every Brother here called to the work of
   the Lord shall feel as if he could not go on with it and shall mourn
   daily his incapacity, his unworthiness and failure! It is good for us
   to be laid in the dust. Downward in breaking, in crushing, in grinding,
   in being made into dust we must go, for this is the way to be made
   strong in the Lord and in the power of His might! The death of self is
   the life of Divine Grace. When we are weak then are we strong. We can
   only rise to ability for the most noble errands by being emptied of all
   self-sufficiency and filled with the all-sufficient Spirit of God!

   Observe, next, that he made a confession of sin while thus prostrate.
   He said, "I am a man of unclean lips." Why does he lament the
   uncircumcision of his lips rather than the evil of his heart? It was
   partly because he longed to join the seraphim in their song but felt
   his lips unfit. And more because he was a Prophet and, therefore, his
   lips were the instruments of his office and he was most conscious of
   sin where he felt most the need of Grace. I know not that Isaiah had
   ever kept back any part of the Truth of God, or that he had spoken in
   uncomely tones, or that in his work of prophecy he

   had in anything been unfaithful, but yet he felt his shortcomings.
   There was nothing about him that you and I could have seen to find
   fault with, but he saw it. He felt it!

   And what minister is there, that God has ever sent, who does not, when
   he surveys his ministry, feel that he is a man of unclean lips? Often
   and often does our soul say, "Oh that these lips had language! They are
   poor dumb things that will not speak aright. O that instead of flesh
   they were flames--that we might let fall a burning torrent of
   persuasions, entreaties and solicitations which should run amid
   multitudes of men like fire in dry stubble!" But it is not so with us.
   We are often cold and lifeless and so we are made to mourn that we have
   unclean lips. Who, that ever saw the Glory of God, or the love of
   Christ, would refuse to join in this confession?

   And, then, this man of God felt, also, a deep sense of the sin of the
   people among whom he dwelt. He cried, "I dwell among a people of
   unclean lips." I do not think a man can be a good missionary if he
   winks at the sin that surrounds him. Unless it stinks in his nostrils.
   Unless it makes his soul boil with holy indignation. Unless, like Paul,
   his heart is stirred in him, how can he speak as he should speak, the
   message of his God? Familiarity with evil too often takes off the edge
   of tender feelings. Men readily cease to weep over the sin which is
   always before their eyes. You may look upon the superstitions of Rome
   till you almost admire the gallant show! And I suppose you may regard
   heathen temples till the majesty of their architecture may make you
   forget the infamy of their purpose.

   But it must not be so! We must feel that we dwell among a people of
   unclean lips and we must bear their sins upon our hearts, repenting for
   them if they will not repent, and breaking our hearts over them because
   their hearts are as granite against their God. Only in such a frame of
   mind shall we be fit to go forth in God's name. And do you notice that
   he had a sacred awe upon him because of the Divine Presence? Do you see
   how bowed down he was because his eyes had seen the King, the Lord of
   Hosts? O favored servant of God! Isaiah, you are honored above your
   fellows, to behold God's Throne and Glory! What would you and I not
   give if we might but have stood in the temple, peered within the
   doorway and gazed into the smoke--and have seen some glimpse of the
   brightness? But Isaiah never exulted in it. On the contrary, he cried,
   "Woe is me!" There is no thought of the dignity to which the marvelous
   sight has lifted him--deep in the dust he cries, "I am undone, for I
   have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts!"

   Now this awe-full sense of the Divine Presence is necessary to make a
   man serve the Lord fitly and acceptably. Forget that God is all around
   you, forget that you live in His Presence and are His servant--get away
   from Him and you can be careless--you can restrain your zeal and your
   conscience may be at ease. But let a man feel that God sees him and let
   him know that he is under His immediate guidance and he will be
   awakened at once to do the will of the Lord on earth after the fashion
   in which it is done in Heaven! He will put forth all his energies
   because God should be served with our best! But conscious that when he
   has done his best, he has fallen short of the glory of God, he will be
   very humble, as those should be who are in such a Presence.

   O Lord Jesus, by Your Holy Spirit give us an overpowering sense of Your
   Presence! If You will but do this, we shall be a tabernacle full of
   worshippers, first, and of workers afterwards, and shall cheerfully
   adore You and labor for You. In this second part of the Prophet's
   vision, the most notable thing is the way in which God met and removed
   His servant's infirmities. His unclean lips were his great impediment.
   Where he most needed power, he most felt his infirmity, and so there
   came a seraph with the golden tongs, or snuffers, and took a burning
   coal from off the altar and touched his lips with it. What does this
   mean? We have the explanation--"Your iniquity is taken away and Your
   sin purged."

   Fellowship with the great Sacrifice--the application of one of the
   coals which consumed the ever blessed Jesus is the way to make our lips
   ready for preaching! I believe that most of my dear Hearers have the
   application of the live coal to their hearts so as to have been purged,
   for we believe in Him who died for us and we are resting in His great
   sacrifice. But in order to be prepared for service we need to have that
   coal touching us again till we feel the fire. We need fellowship with
   the pangs and woes of Christ! We need to feel as if we, too, wished to
   be consumed for others, as He was consumed for us! The disinterested
   love which made Him die must come and influence us, that we may be
   willing to die for others. We need just that.

   Did it not make you feel joy in your fellow men, the other day, when
   you read of the poor men in the pit and of their gallant deliverers?
   One rejoiced that manhood could exhibit such heroism. "We can do no
   more," said some, "it is death to go into the pit again. We cannot
   rescue the poor fellows and it is idle to throw away life for no
   purpose." The brave men who had been toiling there in the bowels of the
   earth, finding themselves in the presence of almost certain death,

   might well have stood back, but not so the bold Welshmen. One said, "If
   it is death to go and save them, I will go, death or no death," and
   then others came forward and said they would go, also. Had I been there
   I should have been ready to weep, because, being unskilled in the
   miner's craft, I should have been helpless to assist. But they would
   not have lacked my heartiest cheers and most ardent prayers, nor
   anything else that I could have done.

   Assuredly since Jesus Christ has died for us, we need to be touched
   with something of that same zeal for the rescue of others from eternal
   ruin. A coal from off the altar where He was consumed must be laid on
   us that we may feel willing to make any sacrifice for His dear sake and
   for the souls of men! That touching of the lips was the Lord's way of
   setting the Prophet on fire where the fire was needed. He needed lips
   blistered with the griefs of Christ and burning with love to men's
   souls--and he had such lips bestowed upon him by his God--and so was he
   fit to go and preach in the name of the Lord. Here, then, is the true
   ordination for a Christian worker!

   You must be nothing, lying in the dust with confession of sin--and you
   must be purged by the great Sacrifice of Calvary and your tongue
   compelled to tell the tale because you have felt such royal mercy, such
   free mercy, such unspeakable mercy, that if you did not speak of it,
   the very stones in the street would cry out against you! You need this
   for your preparation and if you have it, my Brother, you have obtained
   your ordination from the great Shepherd and Bishop of your souls--and
   you need no other!

   III. When a man is prepared for sacred work he is not long before he
   receives a commission. We come, then, to think of THE DIVINE CALL. I
   feel in my soul, though I cannot speak it out, an inward grieving
   sympathy with God, that God Himself should have to cry from His Throne,
   "Whom shall I send?" Alas, my God, are there no volunteers for Your
   service? What? All these priests and sons of Aaron--will none of these
   run upon Your errand? And all these Levites, will not one of them offer
   himself? No, not one. Ah, it is grievous, grievous beyond all thought,
   that there should be such multitudes of men and women in the Church of
   God who, nevertheless, seem unfit to be sent upon the Master's work, or
   at least never offer to go, and He has to cry, "Whom shall I send?"

   What? Out of all these saved ones, no willing messengers to the
   heathen! Where are his ministers? Will none of these cross the seas to
   heathen lands? Here are thousands of us working at home. Are none of us
   called to go abroad? Will none of us carry the Gospel to regions
   beyond? Are none of us bound to go? Does the Divine Voice appeal to our
   thousands of preachers and find no response so that again it cries,
   "Whom shall I send?" Here are multitudes of professing Christians
   making money, getting rich, eating the fat and drinking the sweet--is
   there not one to go for Christ? Men travel abroad for trade--will they
   not go for Jesus? They even risk life amid eternal snows--are there no
   heroes for the Cross?

   Here and there a young man, perhaps with little qualifications and no
   experience, offers himself--and he may or may not be welcomed. But can
   it be true that the majority of educated, intelligent Christian young
   men are more willing to let the heathen be damned than to let the
   treasures of the world go into other hands? Alas, for some reason or
   other, (I am not going to question the reasons), God Himself may look
   over all His Church and, finding no volunteers, may utter the pathetic
   cry, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?"

   But there were the six-winged seraphim. Why did not the Lord send them?
   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, that He might have done, but it is not
   according to the order of the Gospel dispensation, for He is pleased,
   by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe--and the
   preachers must be men like the rest of mankind. It is great
   condescension on His part that He has chosen men and unto the angels He
   has not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak. But He
   has given this honor to us, putting His treasure in earthen vessels
   that the excellency of the power may be all His own. We ought to
   rejoice in this, but it is sad, surpassingly sad, that from among
   myriads of willing seraphim, God's cry should come to unwilling men,
   "Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us."

   I call to your attention, again, to the fact that this is the voice of
   the one God and it is, also, the question of the sacred Trinity--"Whom
   shall I send, and who will go for Us?" The Father, Son and Spirit thus
   question us--shall not the threefold Voice be regarded? Notice the
   particular kind of man for whom this Voice is seeking. It is a man who
   must be sent, a man under impulse, a man under authority--"Whom shall I
   send?" But it is a man who is quite willing to go, a volunteer, one
   who, in his inmost heart, rejoices to obey--"Who will go for Us?" What
   a strange mingling this is! "Woe is me if I preach not the Gospel," and
   yet, "taking the oversight of the flock of God not by constraint but
   willingly." Irresistible impulse and cheerful choice and Omnipotent
   compulsion and joyful eagerness most mysteriously combine! We must have
   a mingling of these two!

   I do not know that I could put into so many words that wonderful
   feeling of freeness and overpowering impulse, of necessity and freedom,
   but our experience understands what our language cannot express. We are
   willing and yet a power is over us. We are willing in the day of God's
   power, coming forth as freely as the dewdrops from the womb of the
   morning and yet as truly the product of Divine power as they are. Such
   must God's servant be. I wonder if I echo and reecho the voice of God,
   this morning, whether it will find amidst the thousands in this house
   and the thousands that may read this word, some loving responses in at
   least a few chosen hearts? "Whom shall I send?"--it is Jehovah's voice.
   "And who will go for Us?"--it is the voice of the bleeding Lamb! It is
   the voice of the loving Father! It is the voice of the ever blessed
   Spirit!

   Does no one leap up at this moment and freely offer himself? Must I
   speak in vain? Ah, that were a light thing--must the Voice from Heaven
   be in vain? Did the child Samuel reply, "Here am I, for You did call
   me," and will no full-grown man answer to the voice of the Eternal?
   With your hearts and consciences I leave it.

   IV. Now comes the last point, and that is THE EARNEST RESPONSE. The
   reply of Isaiah was, "Here am I; send me." I think I see in that
   response a consciousness of his being in a certain position which no
   one else occupied, which rendered it incumbent upon him to say, "Here
   am I." There was no one else in the temple. No one else saw that vision
   and, therefore, to him the voice of the Lord came as at once and
   personally as if there were not another man in all the world. "Here am
   I."

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, if at any time the mission field lacks
   workers, (it is a sad thing that it should be so, but yet so it is),
   should not that fact make each man look to himself and say, "Where am
   I? What position do I occupy towards this work of God? May I not be
   placed just where I am because I can do what others could not?" Some of
   you young men, especially, without the ties of family to hold you in
   this country. You without a large Church around you, or not having,
   yet, plunged into the sea of business. You, I say, who are standing
   where, in the ardor of your first love, you might fitly say, "Here am
   I." And if God has endowed you with any wealth, given you any talent
   and placed you in a favorable position, you are the man who should say,
   "Perhaps I have come to the kingdom for such a time as this. I may be
   placed where I am, on purpose, that I may render essential help to the
   cause of God.

   "Here, at any rate, I am--I feel the Presence of the glorious God. I
   see the hem of His garments as He reveals Himself to me. I almost hear
   the rush of seraphic wings as I perceive how near Heaven is to earth
   and I feel in my soul I must give myself up to God. I feel in my own
   heart my indebtedness to the Christ of God. I see the need of the
   heathen. I love them for Jesus' sake. The fiery coal is touching my
   lips even now--here am I! You have put me where I am! Lord, take me as
   I am and use me as You will." May the Divine Spirit influence some of
   you who greatly love my Lord till you feel all this.

   Then you observe that he makes a full surrender of himself. "Here am
   I." Lord, I am what I am by Your Grace, but here I am. If I am a man of
   one talent, yet here I am. If I am a man of 10, yet here I am. If in
   youthful vigor, here I am. If of more mature years, here I am. Have I
   substance? Here I am. Do I lack abilities? Yet I made not my own mouth,
   nor did I create my infirmities. Here I am. Just as I am, as I gave
   myself up to Your dear Son to be redeemed, so I give myself up, again,
   to be used for Your Glory because I am redeemed and am not my own, but
   bought with a price.

   "Here I am." Isaiah gave himself up to the Lord, none the less
   completely, because his errand was so full of sadness. He was not to
   win men, but to seal their doom by putting before them the Truth of God
   which they would be sure to reject. We read, "And He said, Go and tell
   this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed,
   but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their
   ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and
   hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and
   be healed." Thank God ours is not so hard a task! The Spirit of God is
   with us and men are turned from darkness to light. Ought we not to be
   all the more eager to go?

   It is a point of great weight, an argument most telling. Do not refuse
   to feel its power, but yield yourselves up to God, seeing that He calls
   you to the most happy and blessed work which even He, Himself, could
   commit to you. Then comes Isaiah's prayer for authority and anointing.
   If we read this passage rightly we shall not always throw the emphasis
   upon the last word, "me," but read it, also, thus, "Here am I, send
   me." He is willing to go, but he does not want to go without being
   sent, and so the prayer is, "Lord, send me. I beseech You of Your
   infinite Grace, qualify me! Open the door for me and direct my ways. I
   do not need to be forced, but I would be commissioned. I do not ask for
   compulsion, but I do ask for guidance. I would not run of my own head
   under the notion that I am doing Your service. Send me then,

   Lord, if I may go! Guide me, instruct me, prepare me, and strengthen
   me." There is a combination of willingness and holy prudence--"Here I
   am; send Me."

   I feel certain that some of you are eager to go for my Lord and Master
   wherever He appoints. Keep not back, I pray you, Brother, make no terms
   with God. Put it, "Here am I; send me--where You will--to the wildest
   region, or even to the jaws of death. I am Your soldier, put me in the
   front of the battle if You will, or bid me lie in the trenches. Give me
   gallantly to charge at the head of my regiment, or give me silently to
   sap and mine the foundations of the enemy's fortresses. Use me as You
   will. Send me and I will go. I leave all else to You. Only here I am,
   Your willing servant, wholly consecrated to You."

   That is the right missionary spirit and may God be pleased to pour it
   out upon you all, and upon His people throughout the world. To me it
   seems that if a hundred were to leap up and each one exclaim, "Here am
   I; send me," it would be no wonder. By the love and wounds and death of
   Christ. By your own salvation. By your indebtedness to Jesus. By the
   terrible condition of the heathen and by that awful Hell whose yawning
   mouth is before them, ought you not to say, "Here am I; send me"? The
   vessel is wrecked, the sailors are perishing--they are clinging to the
   rigging as best they can--they are being washed off one by one! Good
   God, they die before our eyes and yet there is the lifeboat new and
   trim. We need men! Men to man the boat! Here are the oars, but never an
   arm to use them! What is to be done? Here is the gallant boat, able to
   leap from billow to billow, only men are needed! Are there none? Are we
   all cowards? A man is more precious than the gold of 0phir.

   Now, my brave Brothers, who will leap in and take an oar for the love
   of Jesus and yon dying men? And you brave women, you who have hearts
   like that of Grace Darling, will not you shame the laggards and dare
   the tempest for the love of souls in danger of death and Hell? Weigh my
   appeal in earnest and at once, for it is the appeal of God! Sit down
   and listen to that sorrowful yet majestic demand, "Whom shall I send,
   and who will go for Us?" and then respond, "Ready, yes, ready! Ready
   for anything to which our Redeemer calls us." Let those who love Him,
   as they perceive all around them the terrible token of the world's dire
   need, cry in an agony of Christian love," Here am I; send me!"

Strong Consolation for the Lord's Refugees

   (No. 1352)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, APRIL 29, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to
   lie, we might ha ve a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to
   lay hold upon the hope set before us." Hebrews 6:18.

   WHEN we read such a choice verse as this we are apt, at once, to
   conclude that it "belongs to them that are of full age, even to those
   who by reason of use have had their senses exercised to discern both
   good and evil." We set this aside as a choice morsel reserved for those
   who have worn well and borne the burden and heat of the day--for those
   who have attained to full assurance of faith and, therefore, are able
   to lay hold upon rich Covenant provisions. Let us at once correct this
   mistake, for the passage belongs to a very early form of Christian
   experience! It relates, indeed, to the lowest degree of Christian
   Grace!

   Let me read it again. "That by two immutable things, in which it was
   impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation." To whom
   does the, "we," refer? We "who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon
   the hope set before us." The strong consolation mentioned in the text
   belongs to those who have fled to Christ for refuge--and surely this is
   at the very beginning of the Divine life. It belongs, also, to those
   who lay hold upon the hope of the Gospel and this, also, is a very
   elementary part of Christian experience. If you have only newly fled to
   Christ for refuge and if, by a child-like faith, you have freshly laid
   hold upon the hope that is set before you, then the riches of Grace are
   yours and God's oath and promise are intended to afford you strong
   consolation.

   As far as this text is concerned, you need not examine yourselves to
   search for strong faith, or deep experience, or great growth in Grace,
   or advanced holiness, for if you are but Christ's refugee and a grasper
   of the Lord's promises, you may rejoice in the two immutable things and
   rest in peace! I gather from God's beginning, thus early, to encourage
   His people, and from His laying down so much comfort for them at the
   outset, that He would have them happy all their lives. It is not the
   Lord's mind that the King's children should go mourning all their days.
   If you hang your harps upon the willows, it is not by Divine Precept
   that you do so, for His Word to the Prophet is, "Comfort you, comfort
   you My people, says your God. Speak you comfortably unto Jerusalem."

   He would have you clothed in raiment of rejoicing, yes, He desires that
   your joy may be full! If your heavenly Father would not have you
   sorrowful, will you not consent to His loving wish concerning you and
   drink deeply into the comfort which He provides? The Lord knew of old
   that His people would need comforting, for He foresaw our infirmities
   and our afflictions from our birth. He knew what creatures of the dust
   we are, how frail and feeble and, therefore, He has ordained abundant
   consolation, that His poor, weak, tried and tempted people may be
   strengthened and cheered. Carefully notice that the Lord has laid most
   stress upon the point which is most vital to the Believer's comfort.

   He knew right well that we should often doubt His great Grace and think
   the Covenant way of salvation to be too good to be true and, therefore,
   that we might have no excuse for mistrust or suspicion. He has first
   pledged His word and then has condescendingly uttered a solemn oath,
   swearing by Himself that from now on we might never raise a question
   about the foundations upon which the eternal settlements of love are
   laid. To Believers He has put salvation and all other Covenant
   blessings beyond dispute in order that all who are interested in them
   might have the firmest assurance concerning them.

   The worst possible trial to a Believer is to have it suggested to him
   that the Gospel is not true, that pardon through the precious blood is
   a fiction and that God is not reconciled through the atoning Sacrifice.
   If we are absolutely certain as to the Truth of God's Gospel and our
   own salvation, thereby, then all other things are of small consequence
   to us and, therefore, has the Lord fixed on a sure basis of promise and
   oath this cornerstone of our comfort. He has set His promise

   in such a light that it becomes blasphemy to doubt it! Our loving
   Father knew that we should often be assailed by the spirit of distrust
   and this has led Him so abundantly to certify the Truth of the things
   which He has promised. You know, Beloved, guilt is very suspicious.
   When you have done wrong to a man, you cannot believe him. Nothing
   renders you so full of doubt towards another as your own consciousness
   of having acted unjustly towards him.

   Now, when a sense of guilt comes over the soul, Nature begins to say,
   "Can the Lord be a sin-pardoning Lord? Can He love me as He says He
   does? Such a base, ungrateful rebel as I--can I really have part in so
   great a salvation as that which God has provided and set forth?"
   Knowing the suspicions nature of a guilty heart, God has made His oath
   and promise to be two sheet-anchors to the soul so that our faith may
   ride out every storm of doubt. The greatness of the mercies,
   themselves, often staggers us. When we consider God's electing love,
   when we reckon the amazing cost of redemption and when we see the high
   honor of adoption, union to Christ and heirship with Him, we naturally
   exclaim-- "Why all this for me?" And, alas, we are apt to go a step
   further and say, "Can it be true? Is it not all a pleasant dream? Has
   the Lord really made me one with Christ and called me His Beloved? Will
   He prepare for me, also, a place among the

   glorified?"

   Lest the greatness of the blessing should stagger our confidence, the
   Lord has ensured every blessing to us by a Covenant rendered valid by
   His own act and deed--a Covenant signed, sealed and delivered so as to
   be beyond all question! Moreover the Lord knew that we should doubt His
   faithfulness because we, ourselves, are so false. We remember many a
   broken promise, broken though made before the Lord. And persons who are
   untruthful, themselves, are very apt to think others so. Therefore our
   God, knowing the deceitful nature of our hearts, foresaw that we should
   be an unbelieving race and has set two swords at the heart of our
   suspicions and questions--slaying unbelief by His oath and promise.

   Besides, our nature runs so cross to the whole system of Divine Grace
   that we need much assuring before we can believe it. We are always for
   working, deserving and earning! Phariseeism is the religion of Nature.
   We boast of our merit and yet we are as meritless as Satan, himself.
   The idea of working and deserving appears to be ingrained in our nature
   and as certain as the blood is red, so sure is the heart
   self-righteousness. We cannot divest ourselves of the idea of salvation
   as payment for work done--that it is a gift, a free gift of Grace--it
   is hard to make us believe. Even after conversion the old tendency
   betrays itself. We steal away from Jesus to Moses as often as we get
   the opportunity and then begin to doubt Free Grace. Therefore the Lord
   has fettered and bound us down to believing with golden chains of
   promise and oath. "It must be so," He says, "the Grace that I have
   revealed is, indeed, true, for I have sworn by Myself." Beloved, we
   ought earnestly to abhor that wicked legality of ours which so often
   does despite to the Grace of God, casts suspicion upon His mercy and
   brings our souls into bondage.

   Another door for doubt is found in the fear of presuming. It is right
   that we should be fearful of being comforted in a wrong manner, for
   nothing is more deadly than false peace. The Lord approves of that holy
   jealousy which leads us to examine ourselves whether we are in the
   faith. I am always sorrowful when hallowed fear departs from a man so
   that he no longer dreads self-deception. But the fear of presuming may
   be perverted by the Evil One and then it becomes a snare to our feet.
   Beloved, be sure of this, that it is no presumption to believe God! The
   presumption lies in doubting Him! Faith is sister to humility, and
   mistrust is neighbor to pride.

   But lest any of you tremblers should be afraid to take the promise of
   God as being absolute and Truth to you, behold, Jehovah swears it! And
   do you dare doubt it? You dare not question the veracity of God who
   thus with, "amens," and, "verilys," pledges His own eternal power and
   Godhead that the Covenant of His Grace shall stand fast forever! Thus
   does God lay the stress of assurance where we are apt to put the force
   of our doubt. And by making His own promise sure, He affords to us
   consolation of the strongest order.

   At this time, hoping that some of God's people may be comforted
   thereby, we shall describe the conditions of mind to which the text is
   addressed and the blessing which it brings. The text speaks of three
   states--first, we have "fled for refuge." Secondly, we have, "laid hold
   upon the hope set before us." And thirdly, we have, "a strong
   consolation."

   I. First, WE HAVE "FLED FOR REFUGE." Although the original Greek does
   not quite so plainly refer to a refuge as our authorized version would
   suggest, the figure here used is undoubtedly that of the City of Refuge
   to which the man-slayer fled when he was in danger from the avenger of
   blood. I shall not attempt to draw the parallel at any

   length, pleasing as such a work would be, for you can easily trace it
   out for yourselves. I will only follow the figure so far as I need it
   for my present purpose.

   The man-slayer, the moment he had, in the heat of passion, killed a
   man, became an apt representative of an awakened sinner who discovers
   himself to be in an evil case. There lies the body of the man he has
   murdered with a hasty blow. He knows not what to do. Can you conceive
   the rush of unhappy feeling which overwhelms his mind? May none of us
   never know the pang of seriously injuring, much less of killing, any
   man by accident. But to have done it in the heat of wrath, in sudden
   passion--how terrible! What must be the horror of the man's soul! He
   sees the clay-cold corpse upon the ground and wishes he could die, too!
   Blood is on his hands and on the soil--and his conscience hears a voice
   appealing to God for vengeance!

   He looks around and trembles at the fall of a leaf. Everything is
   changed. The plot of land which his father left him, once so pleasant,
   is now a horrible Aceldama, a field of blood. He cannot endure to look
   upon the homestead which once he loved. He turns his eyes upward and
   the very skies seem to frown! He wonders that the earth beneath him
   does not open and swallow him up. Bloodstains are on everything! Even
   when he shuts his eyes, he sees the crimson blots. He knows not what to
   do--to go to his house, to hide himself in yonder thicket--or to plunge
   into the river which flows hard by. He is in a terrible state of mind,
   the furies hover around him and a thousand stings of serpents are fixed
   in him.

   I remember well when I was in a similar state of heart as to my sins,
   for I saw my Lord upon the Cross and I felt that I was guilty of His
   death--

   "My conscience felt, and owned the guilt,

   And plunged me in despair

   I saw my sins His blood had spilt,

   And helped to nail Him there.

   Alas! I knew not what I did

   But now my tears are vain!

   Where shall my trembling soul be hid? For I, the Lord have slain!"

   I discovered that I had so sinned as to have involved myself in eternal
   destruction! What a horrible discovery it was! Everything had been
   pleasant enough before, but, lo, I found myself a rebel against the
   Most High and my very existence was dreadful beyond conception. Where
   should I flee, or how should I escape? An awful dread was over me and I
   could not bear it. Hell had begun to burn within my spirit and the
   undying worm had begun its gnawing! It is the work of the Spirit of God
   to convict men of sin, of righteousness and of judgment to come--and it
   is well when the soul begins to fear--for then it begins to live.

   The alarmed man-slayer would, next, if he could calm himself at all,
   consider what he could do and he would soon come to the conclusion that
   he could neither defy, nor escape, nor endure the doom which threatened
   him. The avenger of blood would be sure to be after him. Could he
   resist him? Would it do to take up arms and defend himself? Could he
   hope to escape from the vengeance of the tribe by hiding in some secret
   den or cave of the earth? Or could he endure the wrath of the avenger?
   He knew that he could not, for the avenger of blood would seek blood
   for blood and not be satisfied till he had taken his life.

   Now, it is altogether in vain that men dream of defying the Lord. They
   would be utterly consumed as stubble in the flame! The Lord of Hosts is
   terrible in arms and we cannot stand out against Him. We may have
   thought ourselves strong, but when it comes to an actual facing the
   Lord before the bar of judgment in our own conscience we find that we
   cannot stand before Him for an instant--and our loins are loosed with
   fear. As to escaping from Him, how impossible we feel it to be! The top
   of Carmel has no caverns in which we could lie concealed! In the deeps
   of the sea, the crooked serpent, commissioned by God, would find us!
   The wings of the morning could not bear us swiftly enough to enable us
   to escape from the right hand of Jehovah, nor could the thick darkness
   cover us from His eyes. As to bearing the penalty of His wrath, that we
   know to be impossible, for should He once begin to deal with us in
   vengeance, we must be driven from His Presence into the lowest Hell.

   Thus, in the days of our conviction no hope is discovered to natural
   reason and our dread is increased till fear takes hold upon us as pain
   of a woman in travail, for we see what we have done and we know not
   what we can do to escape from the consequences! Then there comes to our
   ears what, perhaps, we had heard before, but had heard so indifferently

   as never to have really understood it--we hear of a divinely provided
   way of escape! The man-slayer had, perhaps, left unnoticed the
   provision of the six Cities of Refuge because he had, then, no personal
   need of them. But as soon as he became a murderer, those places became
   all important in his esteem and his mind admired that merciful statute
   which had ordained a shelter from blood-revenge.

   When under a sense of sin men value Christ Jesus! We heard of God's way
   of salvation but we never studied it, set our hearts upon it, or
   labored to understand it fully until we saw our guilt before us in all
   its blood-red hue. How wonderful is the system of Grace! Here it
   is--that as in Adam we die through Adam's sin, so if we are in Christ,
   we live through Christ's righteousness. The way of escape for the
   sinner lies not in himself but in Another. He must come under another
   headship and then he is saved. Under the first natural headship we
   became sinners. Under the second gracious Headship we become righteous!
   How consoling it is to perceive that the second Adam, in whom we become
   righteous through believing, has the power to save us because the Lord
   has laid on Him the iniquity of us all--and He has made atonement to
   the fullest!

   Instead of dealing personally with every man in Christ and asking from
   each of them the penalty due for sin, God, in His mercy, has taken the
   whole sin of those in Christ in the bulk and asked payment for the
   whole mass at the hand of their great Covenant Head! The Lord has gone,
   in fact, to the second Adam, to Christ Jesus, and presented to Him the
   dread account of all the sin of His redeemed. He has said to Him, "Will
   You discharge all this?" and Jesus has answered, "Yes," and has carried
   up to the Cross all the gigantic load of sin and made an end of it
   there! He shouted the victory, saying, "It is finished," for the whole
   debt of His people was forever blotted out! Their sins were buried in
   His sepulcher, never to rise again! But He, Himself, has risen, having
   personally discharged of all the liabilities which He took upon Himself
   on our behalf, and so we, also, are discharged, for He died for our
   offenses--and He rose, again, for our justification!

   Now, when a man begins to perceive that his sin can be reckoned with by
   God rather than according to what he has personally been and done. When
   he learns that God regards Believers as being in Christ and, therefore,
   reckons with Christ for them, then his soul finds peace. Behold this
   and admire--I, believing, am dead to sin, for Jesus died! I, believing,
   have borne Jehovah's wrath, for Jesus bore it on my behalf! Behold, He
   says unto the Believer, "Your warfare is accomplished and your sin is
   pardoned, for you have received, at the Lord's hands, in the Person of
   His Son, double for all your sins." The Believer's debt was imputed to
   the Lord Jesus and, therefore, it is no more on the Believer! He is
   discharged and may go his way in peace!

   Dear Hearers, such a plan as this may not please some of you who have
   never felt the horror of guilt and have known no need of a Savior, but
   it charms us! You have always been so good and excellent that you feel
   no joy at the thought of another standing in your place--but a man who
   is alarmed, distressed, amazed and conscious of his guilt--when he
   hears of this strange, this wondrous plan of not imputing unto us our
   trespasses because God has laid all our iniquity upon Jesus, our Surety
   and Substitute! That man, I say, rejoices when he hears of it and at
   once flies to it! The text, however, not only implies that we need the
   refuge and have heard of it, but that we have fled to it.

   To flee away from self to the provided Refuge is a main act of faith.
   The manslayer left his house, his wife, his children, his farm and the
   oxen with which he was plowing. He left everything to flee away to the
   City of Refuge. That is just what a man does when he resolves to be
   saved by Grace--he leaves everything he calls his own! He renounces all
   his rights and privileges which he thought he possessed by nature. Yes,
   he confesses to have lost his own natural right to live and he flies
   for life to the Grace of God in Christ Jesus! The manslayer had no
   right to live except that he was in the City of Refuge. He had no right
   to anything except that he was God's guest within those enclosing
   walls. And so do we relinquish heartily and thoroughly, once and
   forever, all claims and rights arising out of our supposed merits! We
   hasten away from self that Christ may be All in All to us. We have
   "fled for refuge."

   Observe that fleeing for refuge implies that a man flees from his sins.
   He sees it and he repents of it, but he flees away to Christ, the Sin
   Bearer, at once. His thoughts return gloomily to the sad memories of
   the past, but from all these he flies to Christ. He thinks of himself
   as under the Law and he soon finds that he cannot keep it and,
   therefore, the Law curses him for his failures. He will then have no
   consolation unless he flees away to Christ who kept the Law on our
   behalf. In Christ is our refuge from the Law and nowhere else. When
   despair hovers over a man like a black cloud charged with lightning, he
   must run to Jesus!

   "How can you be justified?" asks the wounded conscience. The answer
   must be found in Jesus. When we fly to Christ, the Fulfiller of the
   Law, despair vanishes at once, for we see that we are righteous in the
   righteousness of Christ and accepted in the Beloved! Every now and then
   we foolishly go back to our own self-righteousness, but our wisdom is
   to flee from this as from the plague. We cannot live in that
   abomination! Creature righteousness is all a lie and a forgery-- it
   ought to be regarded by us as dross and dung, for it is no better. Flee
   from it with all your might! A Christian is always fleeing from
   himself! It is the business of his life to escape, alike, from his sin
   and his righteousness--that he may never regard himself before the Lord
   as an individual, sole and separate from Christ, but only as one with
   Jesus and, therefore, in Him, dear to the Father's heart--cleansed,
   justified and accepted. May the Holy Spirit keep us to this.

   You will perhaps ask me, "How came the Apostle Paul to get where this
   text lands him? What line of thought led him to speak about the strong
   consolations which furnish the Lord's fugitives with such confidence?"
   He had been speaking of three matters which represent the confidence to
   which we flee. He spoke just before (Heb. 6:13-16), of the Covenant
   which the Lord made with Abraham in which He had sworn with an oath
   that He would bless him and his seed. Now it is understood that the
   seed of Abraham is, first, the Lord Jesus, and secondly, all
   Believers--for the Covenant was by promise, as in another place the
   Apostle proves--and was made with a seed, not after the flesh, but
   after the spirit, so that Abraham was the father of the faithful, or of
   all who have faith.

   Now a Covenant firmly established by oath with the Father is sure to
   the heirs and, accordingly, Paul says, "Wherein God, willing more
   abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of His
   counsel, confirmed it by an oath." He, then, who is a Believer, is
   certified by the oath of God that in blessing He will bless him. This
   is sure to all Believers and sure to me and to you if we are Believers.
   As Believers we flee away from ourselves and the Covenant of Works to
   the sure Covenant of unchanging Grace--and our consolation is strong,
   because God is true.

   The Apostle had, also, been speaking of the inheritance of rest which
   was typified by Canaan. An oath was sworn by God that the unbelievers
   in the wilderness should not enter into His rest and this was
   tantamount to an oath that Believers would enter into His rest, seeing
   that some must enter therein. Now, we, because we are Believers, and
   upon that ground, alone, enter into rest. Believing in Him who
   justifies the ungodly, we, by faith, enjoy peace with God. And we need
   not fear that we shall enter into eternal rest, for the oath of God
   will bring us in. Furthermore, the Apostle referred to the eternal
   priesthood of Christ as set forth in the type of Melchisedec and, there
   again, we have a matter in which promise and oath unite.

   In a later chapter Paul opens up what he had already mentioned--"For
   those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by Him
   that said unto Him, the Lord swore and will not repent, You are a
   Priest forever after the order of Melchisedec." By the oath of God, the
   Son is consecrated forevermore and, having offered one Sacrifice for
   sins forever, He sits at the right hand of God, able to save them to
   the uttermost that come unto God by Him. Well then, I, a poor convicted
   sinner, without any other hope, flee away from myself to the eternal
   priesthood of Christ and to the Sacrifice that He has offered once and
   for all! And I know, because God has sworn it, that His Sacrifice
   avails for me and for all Believers. In thus fleeing for refuge to our
   great Lord and Priest, we find a strong consolation in the oath and
   promise of God.

   The one solemn question is--beloved Hearers, have you fled for refuge?
   Are you the Lord's refugees today? Are you fugitives, daily, from self
   and sin? Are you in Christ as in a city of Refuge? And is He the sole
   ground of your security? If so, the strongest consolations are your
   portion!

   II. But, secondly, WE HAVE COME TO "LAY HOLD." Here we have a change of
   figure unless we recall the case of Joab who fled for refuge to the
   temple and laid hold upon the horns of the altar. We will not insist
   upon that rare incident, for probably it did not occur to the Apostle's
   mind. Beloved, we feel that we need a refuge and we find that God has
   been pleased to set one forth. He says, "Whoever believes in the Lord
   Jesus Christ shall not perish, but have everlasting life." He bids us
   cease from all hopes of merit and simply come and believe Him and trust
   in the great work which His Beloved Son has finished for us.

   He bids us accept the great plan of Christ's Headship on our behalf and
   His sacrificial suffering in our place. Justification by faith in Jesus
   is set before us. What are we to do according to the text? We have to
   "lay hold" upon it. We are not commanded to prepare ourselves for it,
   or to get what the Romish writers call, "the grace of congruity," by
   which we should be fit for it. It is simply to be laid hold upon by us
   just as we are. Everybody here knows what it is to lay

   hold upon a support or a treasure. Sinner, that is just what you have
   to do with Christ! You have to lay hold upon Him by faith. You are
   drowning--there is a rope thrown to you. What have you to do? "Lay
   hold." You are not to look at your hands to see whether they are clean
   enough. No, lay hold, dirty hands or clean hands!

   "But my hands are weak." Lay hold, Brother, as best you can, weak hands
   or not, for while you are laying hold of Christ, God is laying hold of
   you! You may rest assured of that. If you have the faintest grip of
   Christ, Christ has a firm grip of you as never shall be relaxed! Your
   business at this moment is to lay hold and keep hold. God has given us
   this blessed hope, that those who are in Christ are, for Christ's sake,
   forgiven all their iniquities. They are accepted and are secure of
   everlasting life--and of this we have only to lay hold! What does it
   mean? What is to be done in order to lay hold? Well, first, we must
   believe the Gospel to be true. Do you, all of you, believe it to be
   true that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not
   imputing their trespasses unto them? Yes, I know you believe that God
   has sent His Son to be a propitiation for sin. So far, so good.

   The next thing is to apprehend for yourselves this Truth of God. Christ
   justifies Believers. He is worthy of trust-- trust Him--and He has
   justified you. "I do not feel it," says one. You do not need to feel
   it! It is a matter of believing, not feeling. Believe in Jesus and,
   because you are a Believer, be assured that you are saved. "But I
   thought I should feel," says another. Yes, you shall feel enough
   by-and-by, but now there is a question between you and God. Is the Lord
   a liar or not? "He that believes not has made God a liar," and, on the
   other hand, "He that believes on Him has set to his seal that God is
   true." Which of the two is it to be?

   God, with a solemn oath, declares that Believers are blessed. Being the
   seed of Abraham they are blessed according to His Covenant. With an
   oath He declares that Believers shall enter into His rest! With an oath
   He declares that His Son, the everlasting Melchisedec, is able to save
   to the uttermost them that come unto God by Him! What then? Do you
   believe Him or not? "Oh," says one, "I believe God's Word, but I doubt
   its application to me!" You do not believe it unless you believe it for
   yourself, for there are no exceptions made in the case! If you believe,
   you are blessed. If you believe, you shall have rest. If you believe,
   the great Melchisedec lives for you and pleads for you--and you are
   saved. If you believe--that is the point--if you honor God by accepting
   His Word as true, and by relying upon Christ for yourself--then is it
   well with you!

   If you say, "Yes, the rope is a strong one, and I believe it will
   support a sinking man," why not lay hold upon it? That is the vital
   point of faith--to believe God practically by resting one's own eternal
   destiny upon the Truth of God which we say we believe. "Lay hold on the
   hope." While a man lays hold upon a thing he goes no further, but
   continues to cling to it. We have fled for refuge, but we flee no
   further than the hope which we now lay hold upon, namely, eternal life
   in Christ Jesus. We never wish to get beyond God's promise in Christ
   Jesus to Believers, the promise of salvation to faith. We are satisfied
   with that, and there we rest. "Laying hold" in the forcible language of
   the Greek, would imply firm retention of that which we have seized.

   I remember well when first I laid hold on the hope that God had set
   before me. I was terribly afraid to grasp it, for I thought it was too
   good to be true. But I saw that there was no other chance for me and,
   therefore, I was driven right out of myself to be bold and venture all.
   I knew that I must flee somewhere and it seemed to be that or nothing.
   I was forced to believe in the wondrous plan of salvation by Another
   and in Another, even in salvation by Jesus Christ! I made a dash at it,
   believed it--and joy and peace filled my spirit! That is 27 years ago,
   now, and I am still laying hold upon it. Brothers and Sisters, I have
   not gone an inch beyond the old hope! Jesus Christ was All in All to
   me, then, and He is the same now, only I am more resolved than ever to
   lean my soul on Him and upon Him alone.

   I profess to you this day I dare not place a shadow of reliance on any
   sermons I have preached, or any alms I have given, or any prayers I
   have offered, or any communion with Christ I have enjoyed, or on
   anything that I have done, or said, or thought. I rely wholly on what
   Jesus did and is doing, as my Covenant Head and Surety! I know He bore
   my sin in His own body on the tree. I know He buried my sin where it
   never shall have a resurrection and I know He stands as my
   Representative at the eternal Throne. And I also know that I shall soon
   be where He is because I am one with Him, since I have believed in Him.

   Now, my Friend, if you believe in Him, too--if it were but five minutes
   ago that you received faith--you are just as safe in the hands of Jesus
   as those of us who have been in Him for years. If by an act of trust
   you do but accept what God has set forth, fleeing to it and laying hold
   upon it, the "strong consolation" of which the text speaks belongs to
   you! I

   pray God, in His mighty mercy, will lead many to believe in Him now.
   Did you notice that the Apostle speaks of laying hold upon a hope? This
   does not mean that we are to lay hold, by imagination, upon something
   which we hope to obtain in the dim future, for the next verse goes on
   to say, "which hope we have." We have our hope now! It is not a shadowy
   idea that possibly, when we come to die, we may be saved. We know that
   we, at this moment, are safe in our refuge and we lay hold on our
   confidence as a present joy.

   Yet that which we lay hold upon is full of hope--there is more in it
   than we can now see or enjoy. What is the hope? The hope of final
   perseverance! The hope of ultimate perfection! The hope of eternal
   Glory! The hope of being with our Lord where He is that we may behold
   His Glory forever--a purifying hope--elevating and full of glory! A
   hope which cheers and delights us as often as we think of it! This we
   have laid hold of by a simple act of faith, believing God to be true.
   This laying hold upon the hope which God sets before us is a very
   simple matter and yet there are some who do not understand it, for they
   ask us again and again, "What is faith?"

   Well, it is laying hold, but if you want to know more about it, lay
   hold at once, and see what it is by practice. Lay hold at once, Sinner!
   It is all you have to do--and the Spirit of God enables you to do it!
   As I said before, black-handed Sinner, do not stop to wash your hands,
   but lay hold! That which you lay hold on will wash you and cleanse you.
   And poor, feeble, trembling, paralyzed Soul, Jesus bids you stretch out
   your hands and as you lay hold you shall find peace and consolation!

   III. This is our last point. WE ENJOY "STRONG CONSOLATION." I have not
   time to speak upon this as I should like and, therefore, will just
   throw out a few hints. Many of our fellow men have no consolation. When
   trouble comes, woe is unto them! There are many others who have a weak
   consolation. They depend upon the "absolvo te" of a priest. That must
   be a very poor thing, I should think, for anybody to get consolation
   out of--to know that you have been to "mass," have "confessed," and
   have been assured of forgiveness by a poor, mortal man who is no better
   than yourself, except that he has had his head shaved! What ground for
   consolation poor beings can see in this, I cannot tell--it must be a
   very poor support when sin and Satan assail the soul.

   Many have a very insufficient consolation, for as soon as trial or
   trouble arise they faint--and when they have the prospect of death
   before them their consolation vanishes like the dew in the sun. But we
   have a strong consolation! We call that additive strong of which a very
   few drops will flavor all into which it falls! How wonderfully the
   consolation of Christ has affected our entire lives! There is such
   potency in it that it sweetens everything about us. It is so strong
   that it masters all our fears and slays all our skepticisms. Though
   there are many teachers busily engaged in suggesting unbelief, yet our
   strong consolation flings a thousand doubts aside as Samson slew a
   thousand Philistines! It conquers all our trouble, too, for it makes us
   feel that, being called according to the eternal purpose, all things
   work together for our good.

   Yes, this consolation is so strong that it vanquishes death, itself,
   and makes us descend into the chill precincts of the sepulcher without
   a shiver, joyfully triumphant because Christ has promised us life, God
   has sworn it and the promise and the oath must be true! What I want you
   to note is that the consolation of the Christian lies wholly in His
   God, because the ground of it is that God has sworn and that God has
   promised. Never look, therefore, to yourselves for any consolation--it
   would be a vain search. Flee from yourselves and lay hold upon the hope
   set before you. Oh Christian, you lose consolation when you look away
   from your God! Fasten the eyes of faith on Him and never let them
   glance elsewhere. His promise, His oath, Himself--a true and faithful
   God--this consideration, alone, can sustain you.

   Remember, too, that your consolation must come from what God has spoken
   and not from His Providence. Mind that you do not look to the Lord's
   Providential dealings for your springs of joy, for He may chasten you
   with the rod of men and beat you with many stripes. But His promise
   smiles when His Providence frowns. See how the Apostle dwells upon the
   promise and the oath as the two immutable things and not upon temporal
   blessings! Outward Providences change, but the oath never
   changes--remember that! Your comfort must not even depend upon sensible
   realizations of God's favor, nor on sweet communions and delights. No,
   but upon--"He has said it and He has sworn it"--those are the two
   strong pillars upon which your comfort must rest. Not upon what you
   think He says to your heart, nor upon what you may believe you have
   felt to be applied to your own soul, but upon the bare Word, promise
   and oath of God without feeling or evidence to back it. God has said it
   and sworn it--there is your strong consolation.

   Remember, however, that the power of the strong consolation derived
   from the oath of God must, in your personal enjoyment, depend very much
   upon your faith. What is the consolation of a promise if you do not
   believe it? And what is the comfort of an oath if you doubt it? O
   Brothers and Sisters, I charge you by the veracity of God, labor after
   an increased faith! If you never doubt God till you have cause to do
   so, you will never doubt again! It is impossible for Him to lie in
   anything and, above all, in the great things that your soul rests upon!
   Therefore do not treat Him as if He could lie, nor dare to suspect His
   faithfulness, but hold on to the immutable veracity of God.

   Remember that this consolation which is intended to come to you by
   faith, if you do not get it, will prove that you are insulting God. It
   may appear to be a small and an easy thing to believe God, but it is a
   horrible and a detestable thing to disbelieve Him! Picture some
   generous friend in this assembly coming before us and saying "I promise
   such-and-such a thing." He would be grieved at heart if someone should
   rise and say, "I am willing enough to believe it, but I cannot." I can
   hardly think of anything which would be more insulting to an honest man
   than to have doubt cast upon him by one who pretends to be anxious to
   believe him. But suppose in great gentleness of spirit the person so
   mistrusted were to say, "To put an end to all questions, prepare a deed
   and I will set my hand and seal to it. And I will, at the same time,
   take a solemn oath, calling God to witness that what I promise is
   true"?

   Now if any person should say, "I still do not believe it," can you
   conceive the pain of heart, yes, and the indignation which would
   naturally take possession of our friend's mind? Now God cannot swear by
   anything greater than Himself, for there is no greater, and so He has
   sworn by Himself. By His own existence, by His holiness from which He
   can never part, by the majesty of His Deity He has solemnly sworn that
   the believing seed shall be blessed--and blessed they must be. There
   shall be forgiveness and eternal life to everyone that believes in His
   Son Jesus Christ. This is no fiction! God cannot deceive us on such a
   point as this, nor, indeed, upon any other! This is no dream, no
   charming myth as some would seem to fancy! It is reality, Divine
   reality!

   Now then, Souls, will you cast yourselves upon this Divine reality? May
   the devil be kept back from you that you may cease blaspheming God by
   doubting Him! May the eternal Spirit now convince you how natural, how
   proper, how necessary it is that you should at once believe the promise
   and the oath of God and trust yourselves with Jesus Christ, whom He
   sets forth to be a Prince and a Savior to give repentance unto Israel
   and remission of sins this day! I wish I knew how to plead with you,
   but the time has gone. There was a time with me when to have heard this
   message would have made my heart leap within me, for I needed Christ.
   And when I heard that I must lay hold upon Him and flee to Him and so
   be saved, I was delighted to do so!

   Those of you who are as sinful as I was and as conscious of it, will, I
   trust at this very moment, look unto Him and be saved--and if you do,
   by the promise and the oath of God, you are eternally secure! May God
   the Holy Spirit lead you to Jesus. Amen.

Ecce Rex

   (No. 1353)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 6, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He said unto the Jews, Behold your King." John 19:14.

   PILATE said much more than he meant and, therefore, we shall not
   restrict our consideration of his words to what he intended. John tells
   us considering Caiaphas, "and this spoke he not of himself," and we may
   say the same of Pilate. Everything said or done in connection with the
   Savior during the day of His Crucifixion was full of meaning, far
   fuller of meaning than the speakers or actors were aware. Transformed
   by the Cross, even the commonplace becomes solemn and weighty!

   When Caiaphas said that it was expedient that one man should die for
   the people, that the whole nation perish not, he little thought that he
   was enunciating the great Gospel principle of Substitution! When the
   Jewish people cried out before Pilate, "His blood be on us and on our
   children," they little knew the judgment which they were bringing upon
   themselves which would commence to be fulfilled at the siege of
   Jerusalem and follow them, hanging like a heavy cloud over their race,
   for centuries! When the soldier with a spear pierced His side he had no
   idea that he was bringing forth before all eyes that blood and water
   which are, to the whole Church, the emblems of the double cleansing
   which we find in Jesus, cleansing by atoning blood and sanctifying
   Grace.

   The fullness of time had come and all things were full. Each movement
   on that awful day was brimming with mystery. Neither could the Master
   or those around Him stir or speak without teaching some Gospel, or
   enforcing some lesson. Whereas on certain days frivolity seems to rule
   the hour and little is to be gathered from much that is spoken--on the
   day of the Passion even the most careless spoke as men inspired!
   Pilate, the undecided spirit, with no mind of his own, uttered language
   as weighty as if he, too, had been among the Prophets. His acquittal of
   our Lord, his mention of Barabbas, his writing of the inscription to be
   fixed over the head of Jesus and many other matters were all fraught
   with instruction.

   It was to the Jews that Pilate brought forth Jesus, arrayed in garments
   of derision, and to them He said, "Ecce Rex"--"Behold your King!" It
   was by the seed of Abraham that He was rejected as their King. But we
   shall not think of them in order to blame that unhappy nation, but to
   remind ourselves that we, also, may fall into the same sin. As a nation
   favored with the Gospel, we stand, in many respects, in the same
   privileged condition as the Jews did. To us is the Word of God made
   known! To our keeping, the oracles of God are committed in these last
   days and we, though by Nature, shoots of the wild olive, are engrafted
   into that favored stock from which Israel has, for a while, been cut
   off. Shall we prove equally unworthy? Shall any of us be found guilty
   of the blood of Jesus?

   We hear of Jesus this day--are we rejecting Him? The suffering Messiah
   will be brought forth, again, this morning, not by Pilate, but by one
   who longs to do Him honor. And when He stands before you and is
   proclaimed, again, in the words, "Behold your King!" will you, also,
   cry, "Away with Him! Away with Him!"? Let us hope that there will not
   be found, here, hearts so evil as to imitate the rebellious nation and
   cry, "We will not have this Man to reign over us." Oh that each one of
   us may acknowledge the Lord Jesus to be his King, for beneath His
   scepter there is rest and joy! He is worthy to be crowned by every
   heart! Let us all unite in beholding Him with reverence and receiving
   Him with delight!

   Give me your ears and hearts while Jesus is evidently set forth as
   standing among you. And for the next few minutes let it be your only
   business to, "Behold your King."

   I. Come with me, then, to the place which is called The Pavement, but
   in the Hebrew, Gabbatha, and there, "behold your King." I shall first
   ask you to BEHOLD YOUR KING PREPARING HIS THRONE, yes, and making
   Himself ready to sit upon it. When you look, in answer to the summons,
   "Behold your King," what do you see? You see the "Man of Sorrows and
   acquainted with grief wearing a crown of thorns and covered with an old
   purple cloak which had been

   thrown about Him in mockery. You can see, if you look closely, the
   traces of His streaming blood, for He has just been scourged and you
   may, also, discover that His face is blackened with bruises and stained
   with shameful spit from the soldiers' mouths--

   "Thus trimmed forth they bring Him to the rout, Who, 'Crucify Him,' cry
   with one strong shout, God holds His peace at man, and man cries out."
   It is a terrible spectacle, but I ask you to gaze upon it steadily and
   see the establishment of the Redeemer's Throne. See how He becomes your
   mediatorial King. He was setting up a new Throne on Gabbatha, where He
   would reign as the King of pardoned sinners and the Prince of Peace! He
   was King before all worlds as Lord of all by right of His eternal power
   and Godhead. He had a Throne when worlds were made, as King of all
   kings by creation. He had, also, always filled the Throne of
   Providence, upholding all things by the Word of His power. On His head
   were many crowns and to Pilate's question, "Are You a king, then?" He
   did fitly answer, "You say that I am a king."

   But here before Pilate and the Jews, in His condition of shame and
   misery, He was about to ascend and, first of all, to prepare the Throne
   of the heavenly Grace which now is set up among the sons of men that
   they may flee to it and find eternal salvation! Mark how He is
   preparing this Throne of Grace--it is by pain and shame endured in our
   place. Sin was in the way of man's happiness--and a broken Law and
   justice required a penalty--and all this must be arranged before a
   Throne of Grace could be erected among men.

   If you look at our suffering Lord you see at once the ensigns of His
   pain, for He wears a crown of thorns which pierce His brow. Pain was a
   great part of the penalty due for sin and the great Substitute was,
   therefore, sorely pained. When Pilate brought forth our martyr Prince,
   He was the very mirror of agony. He was majesty in misery--misery
   worked up to its full height and stature. The cruel furrows of the
   scourge and the trickling rivulets of His blood down His face were but
   the tokens that He was about to die in cruel pangs upon the Cross! And
   these, together, were incumbent upon Him because there could be no
   Throne of Grace till first there had been a substitutionary sacrifice.
   It behooved Him to suffer that He might be a Prince and a Savior.
   Behold your King in His pains! He is laying the deep foundations of His
   Kingdom of mercy!

   Many a crown has been secured by blood and so is this--but it is His
   own blood! Many a throne has been established by suffering and so is
   this--but He Himself bears the pain! By His great sacrificial griefs
   our Lord has prepared a Throne upon which He shall sit till all the
   chosen race have been made kings and priests to reign with Him. It is
   by His agony that He obtains the royal power to pardon--by His stripes
   and bruises He wins the right to absolve poor sinners! We shall have no
   cause to wonder at the greatness of His mediatorial power if we
   consider the depth of His sacrificial sufferings! As His misery is the
   source of His majesty, so the greatness of His pains has secured to Him
   the fullness of power to save. Had He not gone to the end of the Law
   and honored Justice to the highest degree, He had not, now, been so
   gloriously able to dispense mercy from His glorious high Throne of
   mediatorial Grace. Behold your King, then, as He lays deep in His own
   pain and death the basis of His Throne of Grace.

   Nor is it only pain, for He wears, also, the tokens of scorn. That
   crown of thorns meant mainly mockery--the soldiers made Him a mimic
   monarch, a carnival king--and that scarlet robe, too, was cast upon His
   shoulders in bitter scorn--and thus did this world deride its God! The
   Evangelists give you the description in brief sentences, as if they
   stopped between each line to cover their faces with their hands and
   weep. So there He stands before the crowd, helpless, friendless, with
   none to declare His generation or give Him a good word. He is deserted
   by all who formerly called Him, Master, and He has become the center of
   a scene of rioting and ridicule. The soldiers have done their worst and
   now the chief men of the nation look at Him with contempt and are only
   kept back from the most ribald scorn by a hate too furiously eager for
   death to afford them leisure for their scoffs.

   His enemies had done everything in their power to clothe Him with scorn
   and they were asking for permission to do more, for they cried, "Let
   Him be crucified." Behold how He has left all the honor of His Father's
   house and His own Glory among the angels--and here He stands with a
   mock robe, a mimic scepter and a thorny crown--the butt of ridicule,
   scoffed at by all! Yet this must be, because sin is a shameful thing
   and a part of the penalty of sin is shame, as they will know who shall
   wake up in the Day of Judgment to everlasting contempt! Shame fell on
   Adam when he sinned

   and then and there he knew that he was naked. And now shame has come
   down in a tremendous hail upon the head of the Second Adam, the
   Substitute for shameful man, and He is covered with contempt.

   "All they that see Me laugh Me to scorn." It is hard to say whether
   cruelty or mockery had most to do with the Person of our Lord at
   Gabbatha, but by enduring these two things together He laid on an
   immovable Foundation the cornerstone of His dominion of love and Grace.
   How could He have been the King of a redeemed people if He had not thus
   redeemed them? He might have been Lord over a people doomed to die--the
   stern Ruler of a people who continued in sin and would so continue till
   they perished forever from His Presence. But He not seek such a
   kingdom. He sought a kingdom over hearts that should eternally be under
   obligation to Him. Hearts that, being redeemed from the lowest Hell by
   His atoning death, would forever love Him with the utmost fervency. His
   sorrow secured His power to save! His shame endowed Him with the right
   to bless! "Behold your King."

   Look at Him with steady eyes and see what a King He now is by right of
   benefit conferred. Behold, He has put away sin, forever, by the
   sacrifice of Himself and, therefore, all the ransomed ones agree that
   He should be king who smote the great dragon which devoured the
   nations. Behold, by His stooping to shame, He has dethroned Satan who
   was the prince of this world! And who should occupy the Throne but He
   who has won it and cast out the strong one who ruled before? Christ has
   done more for men than the Prince of Darkness could or would, for He
   has died for them and so He has earned a just supremacy over all
   grateful hearts.

   As for death, Jesus, by yielding to death, has conquered it. Let Him be
   crowned with the victor's wreath who has destroyed the world's
   destroyer! In His shame you also see the Lord Jesus Christ fulfilling
   the Law and making it honorable. He who could honor that Law which
   otherwise would have cursed us, deserves to have all honor and homage
   paid to Him by the sons of men whom He has rescued from the curse! You
   see, then, our Lord, when He put on the old red cloak and submitted His
   brow to be pierced with thorns, was really establishing for Himself an
   empire--the foundations of which shall never be shaken! He was
   performing that saving work which has made Him King among sinners whom
   He saves and Lord of the Kingdom of Grace which through His death is
   bestowed upon men!

   Note this, too, that men are kings among their fellows when they can
   show deep sympathy and give substantial succor. He who can sympathize
   wins power of the best sort, not coarse force, but refined spiritual
   influence. For this cause our Lord was afflicted, as you see Him
   afflicted, that He might have sympathy with you in your direst grief
   and in your most grievous dishonor. As the children were partakers of
   flesh and blood, He, Himself, also took part of the same. And as they
   must suffer, so the Captain of their salvation was made perfect by
   suffering. This gives Him His glorious power over us. He is a faithful
   High Priest, for He can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities.
   And this ability to enter into our infirmities and sorrows makes Him
   supreme over our hearts. Look at your King in pain and mockery-- and
   see how royal He is to your heart! How sovereignly He commands your
   heart to rejoice! With what regal power He commands your fears to lie
   still and how obediently your despondency yields to His Word!

   Now, as it is with you, so is it on a larger scale in the world. The
   suffering nations will yet see their true Deliverer in their suffering
   Lord. That scepter of a reed will secure Him power far greater than a
   rod of iron. His love to man is proved by His suffering to the death on
   their behalf and this, when the Holy Spirit has made men wise, shall be
   to the myriads of our race the reason for proclaiming Him Lord of all!
   The kings and princes who rule mankind by reason of their descent or by
   the force of arms, have but the names of kings. The true kings are the
   great benefactors. The heroes are our kings, after all. We look upon
   those as royal who can risk their lives for their fellow men to win
   them liberty, or to teach them truth. The race forgets its masters but
   it remembers its friends.

   Earth, but for Jesus, had been a vast prison and men a race of
   condemned criminals. But He who stands before us in Gabbatha, in all
   His shame and grief, has delivered us from our lost estate and,
   therefore, He must be King! Who shall say no to Him? If love must
   ultimately triumph--if disinterested self-sacrifice must obtain
   homage--then Jesus is and shall be King! If eventually, when the
   morning breaks and man's heart is purged from the prejudice and
   injustice occasioned by sin, the might shall be with the right and
   truth must prevail! Then Jesus must reign! The eternal fitness of
   things demands that the best should be highest, that he who does men
   most service should be most honored among them! In a word, that He who
   was made nothing of for man's sake should become everything to him.
   See, then, how the crown of thorns is mother to the crown which Jesus
   wears in His Church! The scarlet robe is the purchase price of the
   vesture of

   universal sovereignty and the mock scepter of reed is the precursor of
   the rod of nations with which the whole earth will yet be ruled!
   "Behold your King," and see the sources of His mediatorial power!

   II. O you who see in your bleeding and rejected Lord, "the King in His
   beauty," come here, yet again, and BEHOLD HIM CLAIMING YOUR HOMAGE. See
   in what way He comes to win your hearts. What is His right to be King
   over you? There are many rights, for on His head are many crowns--but
   the most commanding right which Jesus has over any of us is signified
   by that crown of thorns--it is the right of supreme love! He loved us
   as none other could have loved us. If we put all the loves of parents
   and of wives and children all together, we can never rival, even for a
   moment, the love of Christ to us! And whenever that love touches us, so
   that we feel its power, we crown Him King at once.

   Who can resist His charms? One look of His eyes overpowers us! See with
   your heart those eyes when they are full of tears for perishing sinners
   and you are a willing subject. One look at His blessed Person subjected
   to scourging and spitting for our sakes will give us more idea of His
   crown rights than anything besides. Look into His pierced heart as it
   pours out its life flood for us and all disputes about His Sovereignty
   are ended in our hearts. We acknowledge Him Lord because we see how He
   loved! How could we do otherwise? Love in action, or rather love in
   suffering, carries an Omnipotence about it! Behold what His love
   endured and so, "Behold your King."

   Jesus, in the garb of mockery, marred with traces of His pain, also
   reminds us of His complete purchase of us by His deeds and death. "You
   are not your own, you are bought with a price." Behold your King and
   see the price! It is the price of immense suffering, of most cruel
   shame! It is an incalculable price, for the Lord of All is set at
   nothing! It is an awful price, for He who only has immortality yields
   Himself to die! It is the price of blood. It is the scourging and
   bleeding and woe of Jesus--no, it is Himself! If you would see the
   price of your redemption, "Behold your King." 'Tis He that has redeemed
   us unto God by His blood! It is He that "made Himself of no reputation
   and took upon Him the form of a Servant; and being found in fashion as
   a Man, humbled Himself; and became obedient unto death, even the death
   of the Cross."

   You acknowledge that claim--the love of Christ demands it--you feel
   that from now on you live for Him, alone, and count it joy that in all
   respects He should reign over you with unlimited sway. Jesus, because
   He suffered, has acquired a power over us which is far superior to any
   which could be urged in courts of law, or enforced by mere power, for
   our hearts have voluntarily surrendered to Him and given Him the right
   of our free submission, charmed to give allegiance to such imperial
   love! Is it possible for a Believer to look at the Lord Jesus Christ
   without feeling that he longs to be more and more His servant and
   disciple? Do you not thirst to serve Him? Can yon behold Him in the
   depth of shame without pining to lift Him up to the heights of glory?
   Can you see Him stooping thus for you without pleading with God that a
   glorious high Throne may be His and that He may sit upon it and rule
   all the hearts of men?

   There is no need to argue out the right of King Jesus, for you feel
   it--His love has carried you by storm and it holds fast its capture.
   You cannot have a Savior without His being your King. And seeing such a
   Savior in such a condition, you cannot even think of Him without
   delighting to ascribe to Him all power and dominion! Could we escape
   His sway it would be bondage to us--and when we, at any time fail to
   admit it, it is our worst affliction! "Behold your King," then, for He
   Himself is His own claim to your obedience! See what He suffered for
   you, my Brothers and Sisters, and from now on never draw back from any
   labor, shame, or suffering for His dear sake.

   "Behold your King," and reckon to be treated like He. Do you expect to
   be crowned with gold when He was crowned with thorns? Shall lilies grow
   for you and briars for Him? Never again be ashamed to carry His
   glorious name, unless, indeed, you can be so vile as to prove a traitor
   to such a Lord! See to what shame He was put and learn from Him to
   despise all shame for His Truth's sake! Shall the disciple be above his
   Master, or the servant above his Lord? If they have thus maltreated the
   Master of the house, what shall they do to the household? Let us reckon
   upon our share of this treatment and, by accepting it, prove to all men
   that the despised and rejected of men is really the King over us and
   that the subjects blush not to be like their Monarch!

   Even though the cost is all the shame the world can possibly pour upon
   us, or all the suffering that flesh and blood can, in any condition,
   endure, let us be faithful in our loyalty and cry, "Who shall separate
   us? Shall persecution, or distress, or tribulation divide us from our
   King? No! In all these things we are more than conquerors! King of
   Griefs, you are King of my soul! O King of Shame, you are absolute
   Monarch of my heart! You are King by Divine right and King by my own
   voluntary choice! Other lords have had dominion over us, but now, since
   You have revealed Yourself

   after this fashion, Your name, only, shall govern our spirit!" Do you
   not see, then, that Jesus, before Pilate, reveals His claim in the
   appearance which He wears? "Behold your King."

   III. "Behold your King," for a third time, that you may see Him
   SUBDUING HIS DOMINIONS. Dressed in robes

   of scorn and with a visage marred with pain, He comes forth conquering
   and to conquer! This is not very apparent at a superficial glance, for
   He is not arrayed like a man of war. You see no sword upon His thigh,
   nor bow in His hand. No fiery threats fall from His lips, nor does He
   speak with eloquent persuasion. He is unarmed, yet victorious! He is
   silent, but yet conquering!

   In this garb He goes forth to war. His shame is His armor and His
   sufferings are His battle-axe. What do you think? How can it be so? I
   speak no fiction, but sober fact--and it shall be proven. Missionaries
   have gone forth to win the heathen for Christ and they have commenced
   with the uncivilized sons of sin by telling them that there is a God
   and that He is great and just. The people have listened unmoved, or
   have only answered, "Do you think we don't know this?" Then they have
   spoken of sin and its punishment and have foretold the coming of the
   Lord to judgment, but still the people stirred not, but coolly said,
   "'Tis true," and then went on their way to live in sin as before.

   At last these earnest men have let fall the blessed secret and spoken
   of the love of God in giving His only-begotten Son and they have begun
   to tell the story of the matchless griefs of Immanuel! Then have the
   dry bones stirred! Then have the deaf begun to hear! They tell us that
   they had not long told the story before they noticed that eyes were
   fastened on them and that countenances were beaming with interest which
   had been listless before. And they have said to themselves, "Why did we
   not begin with this?" Yes, why, indeed? For this it is that touches
   men's hearts--Christ Crucified is the Conqueror!

   Not in His robes of Glory does He subdue the heart, but in His
   vestments of shame! Not as sitting upon the Throne does He, at first,
   gain the faith and the affections of sinners, but as bleeding,
   suffering and dying in their place! "God forbid that I should glory,"
   said the Apostle, "save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." And
   though every theme that is connected with the Savior ought to play its
   part in our ministry, yet this is the master theme. The atoning work of
   Jesus is the great gun of our battery! The Cross is the mighty
   battering-ram to break in pieces the bronze gates of human prejudices
   and the iron bars of obstinacy! Christ coming to be our Judge alarms,
   but Christ, the Man of Sorrows, subdues! The crown of thorns has a
   royal power in it to compel a willing allegiance! The scepter of reed
   breaks hearts better than a rod of iron and the robe of mockery
   commands more love than Caesar's imperial purple! There is nothing like
   it under Heaven!

   Victories 10,000 times 10,000 have been achieved by Him whom Pilate led
   forth to the multitude-- victories distinctly to be ascribed to the
   crown of thorns and vesture of mockery! Are they not written in the
   book of the wars of the Lord? There will be more such as He is more
   frequently set forth in His own fashion and men are bid, in the Man of
   Sorrows to behold their King. Has it not been so at home as well as
   among the far-off heathen? What wins men's hearts to Christ today? What
   but Christ in shame and Christ in suffering? I appeal to you who have
   been newly converted-- what has bound you as captives to Jesus'
   chariot? What has made you, from now on, vow to be His followers,
   rejoicing in His name? What but this--that He bowed His head to the
   death for your sake and has redeemed you unto God by His blood? You
   know it is so!

   And oh, dear children of God, if ever you feel the power of Christ upon
   you to the fullest--till it utterly overcomes you--is it not the memory
   of redeeming grief which does it? When you become like harps and Jesus
   is the minstrel and lays His finger among your heartstrings and brings
   out nothing but praise for His dear name--what is it that charms you
   into the music of grateful love but the fact of His condescension on
   your behalf? Is not this your song, that He was slain and has redeemed
   you unto God by His blood? I confess I could sit down at the foot of
   His Cross and do nothing else but weep until I wept myself away, for
   His suffering makes my soul to melt within me. Then, if the call of
   duty is heard, I feel intensely eager to plead with others. At that
   time I am ready to make any sacrifice to bring others under my Lord's
   dominion! Then, by His Grace, I am full of a holy passion that even
   death could not quench--all this, I say, if I have but just come from
   gazing on the Redeemer's passion and drinking of His cup and being
   baptized with His Baptism!

   The scepter of reed rules as nothing else ever did, for it awakens
   enthusiasm. The crown of thorns commands homage as no other diadem ever
   did, for it braces men into heroes and martyrs. No royalty is so
   all-commanding as that which has for its insignia the crown of thorns,
   the reed, the red cloak and the five wounds! Other sovereignties are
   forced and

   feigned. They are hollow compared with the Sovereignty of "the despised
   of men!" Fear, or custom, or self-interest make men courtiers
   elsewhere, but fervent love crowds the courts of King Jesus! We do not
   merely say that the marred Countenance is the most majestic ever seen,
   but we have felt it to be so on many an occasions. Yes, and feel it to
   be so now.

   Do you want to make our hard hearts soft? Tell us of Jesus' grief!
   Would you make us, strong men, into children? Set the Man of Sorrows in
   our midst! There is no resisting Him. Look, also, at backsliders if you
   would see the power of the despised Nazarene. If they have gone away
   from Christ. If they have become lukewarm. If their hearts have become
   obdurate to Him who once could charm them--what can bring them back? I
   know but one magnet which, in the hands of the Holy Spirit, will
   attract these sadly fallen ones--it is Jesus in His shame and pains! We
   tell them that they crucified the Son of God afresh and put Him to an
   open shame--and they look on Him whom they have pierced and mourn for

   Him!

   O you, who, after having sipped of the communion cup, have gone to
   drink at the table of Bacchus! You, who, after having talked of love to
   Christ, have followed after the lusts of the flesh! You, who, after
   singing His praises, have blasphemed the sacred name with which you are
   named--may His Omnipotence of love be proven in you, also! What can
   ever bring you back but this sad reflection, that you, also, have
   twisted for Him a crown of thorns and caused Him to be blasphemed among
   His enemies? Still the merit of His death is available for you! The
   power and efficacy of His precious blood have not ceased, even for you!
   And if you come back to Him--and oh, may a sight of Him draw you--He
   will receive you graciously as at the first. I say to you, "Behold your
   King," and may the Sovereignty of His humiliation and suffering be
   proven, this morning, in some of you as you shall come bending at His
   feet, conquered by His great love and restored to repentance and faith
   by His marvelous compassion! A sight of His wounds and bruises heals
   us, so that we grieve at our rebellions and long to be brought home to
   God, never to wander more.

   Ah, dear Brothers and Sisters, we shall always find, as long as the
   world stands, that among saints, sinners, backsliders and all classes
   of men, Jesus Christ's power is most surely felt when His humiliation
   is most faithfully declared and most believingly known! It is by this
   that He will subdue all things to Himself. If we will but preach Jesus
   Christ to the Hindu, it will not be necessary to answer all his
   metaphysical subtleties--the sorrows of Jesus are as a sharp sword to
   cut the Gordian knot. If we will go down among the degraded inhabitants
   of Africa, we shall not need, first, to civilize them--the Cross is the
   great lever which lifts up fallen men--it conquers evil and establishes
   truth and righteousness.

   The most depraved and hardened learn of His great love and hearts of
   stone begin to beat--they see Jesus suffering to the death out of
   nothing else but love to them--and they are touched by it! And they
   eagerly enquire what they must do to be saved by such a Savior. The
   Holy Spirit works in the minds of many by setting forth the great love
   and grief of Jesus. May we who are His ministers have great faith in
   His Cross and from now on say, as we preach the suffering Jesus,
   "Behold your King."

   IV. In the fourth place I beg you to "Behold your King" SETTING FORTH
   THE PATTERN OF HIS KINGDOM. When you look at Him, you are struck, at
   once, with the thought that if He is a king He is like no other
   monarch, for other kings are covered with rich apparel and surrounded
   with pomp, but He has none of these. Their glories usually consist in
   wars by which they have made others suffer. But His Glory is His own
   suffering! No blood but His own has flowed to make Him illustrious!

   He is a King but He cannot be put in the list of sovereigns such as the
   nations of the earth are compelled to serve. When Antoninus Pius set up
   the statue of Jesus in the Pantheon as one of a circle of gods and
   heroes, it must have seemed strangely out of place to those who gazed
   upon its visage if the sculptor was at all true to life. It must have
   stood apart as one that could not be numbered with the rest! Neither
   can you set Him among the masters of the human race who have crushed
   mankind beneath their iron heels! He was no Caesar--you cannot make Him
   appear like one! Call Him not autocrat, emperor, or czar--He has an
   authority greater than all these--yet not after their kind. His purple
   is different from theirs and His crown, also. But His face differs more
   and His heart most of all. "My kingdom," He says, "is not of this
   world."

   For troops, He has a host of sorrows. For pomp, a surrounding of scorn.
   For lofty bearing, humility. For adulation, mockery. For homage, spit.
   For glory, shame. For a Throne, a Cross. Yet there was never a truer
   King! Indeed, all kings are but a name, save this King, who is a real
   Ruler in Himself and of Himself--and not by extraneous force. Right
   royal,

   indeed, is the Nazarene! But He cannot be likened unto the princes of
   earth, nor can His Kingdom be reckoned with theirs. I pray that the day
   may soon come when none may dream of looking upon the Church as a
   worldly organization capable of alliance with temporal sovereignties so
   as to be patronized, directed, or reformed by them. Christ's Kingdom
   shines as a lone star with a brightness all its own! It stands apart
   like a hill of light, sacred and sublime--the high hills may leap with
   envy because of it--but it is not of them nor like unto them. Is not
   this manifest even in the appearance of our Lord as Pilate brings Him
   forth and cries, "Behold your King!"?

   Now, as He sets before us in His own Person, the pattern of His
   Kingdom, we may expect that we shall see some likeness to Him in His
   subjects. And if you will gaze upon the Church, which is His Kingdom,
   from the first day of her history until now, you will see that it, too,
   is wearing its purple robe. The martyrs' blood is the purple vesture of
   the Church of Christ. The trials and persecutions of Believers are her
   crown of thorns. Think of the rage of persecution under Pagan Rome--and
   the equally inhuman proceedings of Papal Rome--and you will see how the
   ensign of Christ's Kingdom is a crown of thorns--a crown and yet
   thorns--thorns but still a crown! The bush is burning, but it is not
   consumed!

   If you, Beloved, are truly followers of Jesus, you must expect to take
   your measure of shame and dishonor. And you may reckon upon your
   allotment of griefs and sorrows. The "Man of Sorrows" attracts a
   sorrowful following. The Lamb of God's Passover is still eaten with
   bitter herbs. The child of God cannot escape the rod, for the elder
   Brother did not and to Him we are to be conformed. We must "fill up
   that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ for His body's sake,
   which is the Church" (Col. 1:24).

   Remember, however, that Christ's sufferings, as a pattern, were not for
   His own sins, nor brought upon Him as a chastisement for His own
   faults. The sufferings which belong to His Kingdom are those which are
   endured for His name and for His Glory's sake, and for the good of
   others. If men lie in prison for their own crimes, that has nothing to
   do with His Kingdom. If we suffer for our sins, that is no part of His
   Kingdom. But when a man loses of his substance for Christ's cause, lays
   out himself to toil even unto death, bears contempt and suffers
   hardness as a Christian--this is after the type of Christ's Kingdom.
   When the missionary goes forth with his life in his hand among the
   heathen, or when a Believer in any way divests himself of comfort for
   the good of others, it is then that he truly copies the pattern set him
   in Pilate's Hall by our great King.

   I say to you Christians who court ease, to you who are hoarding up your
   gold, to you who will do nothing that would bring you under the
   criticism of your fellow men, to you who live unto yourselves--would it
   not be irony of the severest kind if I were to point to Jesus before
   Pilate and say, "Behold your King"? Living in undue luxury, amassing
   wealth, rolling in ease, living to enjoy yourselves! Is that your King?
   Poor subjects, you--and very unlike your Lord! But if there are among
   us those who, for His sake, can make sacrifices, we may look upon our
   King without fear. You who are undaunted by contempt and who would give
   all that you have, yes, and give yourselves to know Jesus--and are
   doing so--to such I say, "Behold your King," for you are of His Kingdom
   and you shall reign with Him! In your conquest of yourselves you have
   already become kings! In reigning over your own desires and carnal
   inclinations for the sake of His dear love, you are already kings and
   priests unto God and you shall reign forever and ever!

   He who is ruled by his passions in any degree is still a slave. But he
   who lives for God and his fellow men has a royal soul. The insignia of
   a prince unto God are still shame and suffering--which adornments are
   readily worn when the Lord calls him to do so. In Christ's Kingdom
   those are peers of the highest rank who are most like their Lord and
   are the lowest and humblest in mind--and most truly the servants of
   all. The secondary princes of His Kingdom approximate less closely to
   Him and the lower you descend in the scale the less you are like He is
   in those respects. The Christian surrounded with every comfort who
   never endured hardness for Christ, who never knew what it was to be
   sneered at for Jesus' sake, who never made a sacrifice which went so
   far as to pinch him in the least--if, indeed, he is a Christian--is
   least in the kingdom of Heaven.

   Proud, rich men who give but trifles to Christ's cause are pariahs in
   His Kingdom! They who are who are willing to be least of all, are the
   chief--they are princes who make themselves the offscouring of all
   things for His name's sake, such as were the Apostles and first martyrs
   and others whom His love has greatly constrained.

   V. Our concluding remark shall be, "Behold your King"--PROVING THE
   CERTAINTY OF HIS EMPIRE--for if, Beloved, Christ was King when He was
   in Pilate's hands, after being scourged and spit upon, and while He was

   wearing the robe and crown of mockery, when will He not be King? If He
   were King at His worst, when is it that His Throne can ever be shaken?
   They have brought Him very low. They have brought Him lower than the
   sons of men, for they have made Him a worm and not a man, despised of
   the people, and yet He is King!

   Marks of royalty were present on the day of His death. He dispensed
   crowns when He was on the Cross--He gave the dying thief a promise of
   an entrance into Paradise. In His death He shook the earth, He opened
   graves, He split the rocks, He darkened the sun and He made men smite
   on their breasts in dismay! One voice after another, even from the
   ranks of His foes, proclaimed Him to be King, even when dying like a
   malefactor! Was He a King then? When will He not be King? And who is
   there that can, in any way, shake His Throne?

   In the days of His flesh, "the kings of the earth stood up and the
   rulers took counsel together, saying, Let us break His bonds asunder,
   and cast His cords from us," but He that sat in the heavens did
   laugh--the Lord did have them in derision and Christ on the Cross was
   acknowledged, in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, to be, still, the King of the
   Jews. When will He not be King? If He was King before He died and was
   laid in the grave, what is He, now, that He has risen from the dead?
   What is He, now, now that He has vanquished the destroyer of our race
   and lives no more to die? What is He now?

   You angels, tell what glories surround Him now! If He were King when He
   stood at Pilate's bar, what will He be when Pilate shall stand at His
   bar, when He shall come on the Great White Throne and summon all
   mankind before Him to judgment? What will be His acknowledged
   sovereignty and His dreaded majesty in the day of the Lord? Come, let
   us adore Him! Let us pay our humble homage in the courts of the Lord's
   house this day! And then let us go forth to our daily service in His
   name and make this our strong resolve, His Spirit helping us, that we
   will live to crown Him in our hearts and in our lives--in every place
   where our lot may be cast--till the day breaks and the shadows flee
   away and we behold the King in His beauty and the land that is very far
   off.

   None can overturn a kingdom which is founded on the death of its King!
   None can abolish a dominion whose deep foundations are laid in the
   tears and blood of the Prince, Himself. Napoleon said that he founded
   his empire by force and, therefore, it had passed away. "But," he said,
   "Jesus founded His Kingdom upon love and it will last forever." So it
   must be, for whatever may or may not be, it is written--"He must
   reign." As for us, if we wish to extend the Redeemer's Kingdom we must
   be prepared to deny ourselves for Christ. We must be prepared for
   weariness, slander and self-denial.

   In this sign we conquer! The Cross will have to be borne by us as well
   as by Him if we are to reign with Jesus. We must both teach the Cross
   and bear the Cross. We must participate in the shame if we would
   participate in the Glory! No thorn, no Throne! When again shall be
   heard the voice, "Behold your King," and Jew and Gentile shall see Him
   enthroned and surrounded with all His Father's angels--with the whole
   earth subdued to His power happy shall he be who shall then, in the
   exalted Savior, behold his King! The Lord grant us this day to be loyal
   subjects of the Crucified that we may be favored to share His glory.

All Things Are Ready, Come

   (No. 1354)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 13, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Come, for all things are now ready." Luke 14:17.

   THIS invitation was first of all made to the Jews, but it seems to me
   to have a peculiar appropriateness to ourselves. It is later in the day
   than when first the Lord was here and, therefore, the supper time is
   evidently closer at hand. The shadows lengthen, the sun of the present
   dispensation is nearing its setting--by nearly 1,900 years has its day
   been shortened since first the Lord sent forth His servants at supper
   time. The fullness of time for the marriage supper of the Lamb must
   speedily arrive and, therefore, it behooves us to be more than ever
   earnest in delivering the message to the invited guests. And if all
   things could be said to be ready, even in our Savior's day, we may say
   it with still greater emphasis now, for when He delivered this parable,
   the Holy Spirit was not yet given.

   But Pentecost has now passed and the Spirit of God abides with us to
   accompany the Word, to fill it with power and to bless our souls as we
   feed upon His Truth. Very emphatically, then, at this time all things
   are now ready and the supper awaits the guests! I pray you do not begin
   to make excuses, but be prepared to follow us when we bid you come, to
   go with us when we seek to bring you in, or at least to yield to our
   entreaties when, with all the sacred violence of love, we would compel
   you to come in. We will not grudge the use of all the three increasing
   modes of persuasion so long as you are but led to "Come, for all things
   are now ready."

   There are two things clearly in the text and these have a close
   relation to one another. A plain invitation--"Come," and then a
   forcible argument--"for all things are ready." The argument is fetched
   from the Divine preparations, gathered from among the dainty provisions
   of the royal feast. "My oxen and My fatlings are killed, come to the
   supper." The readiness of everything on God's part is the argument why
   men should come and partake of His Grace--and that is the point upon
   which we will dwell at this time--the readiness of the feast of mercy
   is the reason why men should come to it at once.

   I. We will begin our meditation by laying down the first statement
   which shall make our first division of discourse, namely that IT IS
   GOD'S HABIT TO HAVE ALL THINGS READY, whether for His guests or His
   creatures. You never discover Him to be behind in anything. When the
   guests come, there is not a scramble to get the table arranged and the
   food prepared, but the Lord has great forethought and every little
   point of detail is well arranged. "All things are ready." It was so in
   creation.

   He did not create a single blade of grass upon the face of the earth
   until the soil and the atmosphere had been prepared for it and until
   the kindly sun had learned to look down upon the earth. Imagine
   vegetation without a sun, or without the alternation of day and night!
   But the air was full of light, the firmament upheld the clouds and the
   dry land had appeared from out of the sea--and then all things were
   ready for herbs and plants and trees. Nor did God prepare one single
   creature that has life, nor fowl that flies in the midst of Heaven, nor
   fish that swim the seas, nor beast that moves on the dry land until He
   had prepared its habitat and made ready its appointed food.

   There were no cattle before there were meadows for their grazing. There
   were no birds till there were trees for their nests, no, nor even a
   creeping insect till its portion of meat had been provided. No creature
   had to wait in a hungry mood while its food was growing--all things
   were ready--ready, first, for vegetation, and then afterwards for
   animal life. As for Adam, when God came to make Him as His last and
   noblest work of creation, all things were ready. The garden was laid
   out upon the banks of flowing streams and planted with all kinds of
   trees. The fruits were ripe for his diet and the flowers in bloom for
   his delight.

   He did not come to an unfurnished house, but he entered into a home
   which his Father had made pleasant and agreeable for his dwelling. The
   world was first fitted up and then the man who was to govern that world
   was placed in it.

   "All things are ready," the Lord seems to say, "Spring up, O herbs
   yielding seed." And then, "All things are ready, come forth you roes
   and hinds of the field!" And then, "All things are ready, stand forth,
   O man, made in My own image!" In later times we may gather
   illustrations of the same Truth of God from the ways of God with men.
   The Ark was first of all built and the various creatures were gathered
   into it, with all their necessary food for that strange voyage which
   they were about to take. And then the Lord said to Noah, "Come you and
   all your house into the Ark." "All things are ready, come," was His
   voice to the chosen eight as they entered into the Ark. There was no
   need to tarry any longer. Every preparation was made and, therefore,
   God shut them in. Everything is done with punctuality and exactness by
   the only wise God. The same day that a thing is needed, it is prepared.

   Take another event in Providence, such as the going down of Israel into
   Egypt. God had determined that Jacob and his seed should sojourn,
   awhile, in the land of Ham, but how wisely He prepared the whole
   matter. He sent a man before them, even Joseph, and Joseph was there
   upon the throne of Egypt clothed with power to nourish them through the
   famine. He had been there years before, all in good time to store the
   wheat while the seven years of plenty lasted, that they might be well
   fed during the seven years of famine.

   Goshen, also, was at the disposal of Joseph, so that the flocks and
   herds of Israel might dwell in that fat land. Not into Egypt shall
   God's Israel go till all things are ready! And when all things are
   ready they will come out again with a high hand and an outstretched
   arm! So it was when the tribes migrated into Canaan itself. God took
   them not to the promised land until all things were ready. They were
   made to wait for the exact time, for the Lord said, "The iniquity of
   the Amorites is not yet full." Not till the inhabitants of the land had
   passed the bounds of mercy and were condemned to die, were the
   Israelites brought upon the scene to be, at once, their executioners
   and successors!

   And when the tribes came to the river Jordan, God had prepared
   everything for them, for He had sent the hornet before them to drive
   out the people and a pestilence, also, for the spies said, "It is a
   land that eats up the inhabitants thereof." The Lord God had gone
   before them to fight their battles before they came and to prepare a
   place for them, so that when they entered they dwelt in houses which
   they had not built and they gathered the fruit of olives which they had
   not planted. They came to a land that flowed with milk and honey, a
   land in a fine cultivated condition and not a wilderness which must be
   reclaimed with hard labor. Israel came to a country which was as the
   garden of the Lord, whose fruit might at once be enjoyed, for they ate
   of the old corn of the land almost as soon as they passed the Jordan.
   So you see, "All things are ready," is a proclamation which the Lord
   has often, in spirit, made to those whom He chooses to bless.

   Now the fact that in the great Gospel supper all things are ready
   teaches us, first, that God's thoughts go before men's comings. "Come,
   for all things are ready." Not, "If you come, all things will be
   ready," but, "they are ready and, therefore, come." Grace is first, and
   man at his best follows its footsteps. Long before we ever thought of
   God, He thought of us! Yes, before we had a being and time, itself,
   began, in the bosom of the Eternal there were thoughts of love towards
   those for whom the table of His mercy is now spread!

   He had planned and arranged everything in His august mind from of old.
   He had, indeed, foreknown and predestinated all the provisions and all
   the guests of His supper! All things were settled in His eternal
   Covenant and purpose before the earth was! Never think, oh Sinner, that
   you can outstrip the love of God! It is at the end of the race before
   you are at the beginning! God has completed before you have begun. His
   thoughts are before ours and so are His acts, for He does not say, "All
   things are planned and arranged," but, "All things are ready." Jesus,
   the great Sacrifice, is slain! The Fountain for our cleansing is filled
   with blood! The Holy Spirit has been given. The Word by which we are to
   be instructed is in our hands and the light which will illuminate that
   sacred page is promised us through the Holy Spirit.

   Things promised ought to encourage us to come to Christ, but things
   already given ought to be irresistible attractions. All things are
   already completed by the sacred Trinity before we come to cry for
   mercy. This should make us very hopeful and eager in our approaches to
   the Lord. Come, Sinner! Come at once! This ought to encourage you,
   since all that God has to do in your salvation is done before you have
   a thought of Him or turn one foot towards His abode. All things are
   ready. Come!

   This, also, proves how welcome those are who come. If you are invited
   to see a friend and when you reach the place, you find the door locked
   and, after knocking many times no one answers, for there is no one at
   home, you reckon that there is some mistake, or that the invitation was
   not a sincere one. Even if your host should come to the door and let
   you

   in, but should evidently be embarrassed, for there is no meal provided
   and he has made no arrangements for your rest, you soon detect it and
   like a wise man you quickly move off somewhere else, for if you had
   been welcome, things would have been prepared for you. But oh, poor
   Soul, if you come to God, all things are ready for your entertainment--

   "Spread for you the festive board, With His richest dainties stored."
   The couch of rest and quietness is prepared for you. All things are
   ready! How freely does Jehovah welcome you, how genuine is the
   invitation, how sincere the desire that you should come to feast with
   Him!

   So much upon our first remark. It is the habit of the Lord to have all
   things ready for His guests.

   II. Our second statement is that THIS READINESS SHOULD BE AN ARGUMENT
   THAT HIS SAINTS SHOULD COME continually to Him and find Grace to help
   in every time of need. O children of God, I will lift the parable away
   from the immediate use which the Savior made of it to employ it for
   your good. You know, Beloved, that whenever the Lord Jesus Christ
   invites His people to come to Him and to taste of His bounty, all
   things are ready.

   It was a beautiful scene by the sea of Tiberias when the Lord spoke to
   those who had been toiling on the lake at fishing and said to them,
   "Come and dine." They were willing enough to dine, but they were busy
   dragging to the shore those great fishes. Remember, when they did land,
   they found the invitation to be no vain one, for it is written, "They
   saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon, and bread." How the
   coals came there and the fish, and the bread, the Evangelist does not
   tell us, but our Lord would not have asked them to dinner if He had not
   been able to give them a warm reception. There were the fire of coals
   and the fish and bread laid on them.

   Whenever, therefore, your Lord and Master, by His blessed Spirit, calls
   you to come near to Him, you may be quite sure that all things are
   ready for your immediate enjoyment. You need never pause or hesitate,
   but approach Him without delay. I want to caution you against replying,
   "But, Lord, I do not feel ready." That is most true, but that is not an
   argument which you should use to excuse yourself in holding back. It is
   His readiness that is the main thing, not yours, and as all things are
   ready, come whether you feel ready or not!

   I have heard of some Christians who have said, "I do not feel in a
   proper frame of mind to pray." My Brothers and Sisters, pray till you
   do! Some have said, "I do not think I shall go up to the house of God
   today. I feel so unhappy, so cast down." When should you go so much as
   then, in order that you may find comfort? "Still," says one, "you would
   not have me sing a hymn when of heavy heart, would you?" Yes, I would,
   I would, indeed! I would have you sing yourself up from the depths of
   the sea when all God's billows have gone over you. David full often did
   so. When he began a Psalm in the deeps, he gradually rose and rose, and
   rose till he was in a perfect rapture of delight before the Psalm was
   over! All things are ready with your Lord, therefore come whether you
   happen to be ready or not!

   Note the times when this Truth of God ought to have power with you. All
   things are ready, therefore come to the storehouse of Divine promises.
   Are you in spiritual poverty? Come and take what God has provided for
   you, for all things are yours and all the blessings of the everlasting
   hills belong to all the people of God. Are you needing strength? There
   is a promise, "As your days so shall your strength be." It is ready,
   come and take it! Are you needing consolation? Do you not know that all
   things are ready for your comfort, that two immutable things, wherein
   it is impossible for God to lie, are already set before you? Come and
   take your solace! Yes, remember that all that God has promised belongs
   to all those who believe the promise and that you may, therefore, come
   at all times, however deep your need. And if you have but faith you
   shall find the special supply for the special need. All things are
   ready, therefore come with holy confidence and take what is ripe enough
   to gather, ripe for you.

   Come next to the Mercy Seat in prayer, all things are ready there. The
   Mercy Seat is sprinkled with the precious blood of Christ. The veil,
   also, is torn in two, and from between the cherubim Jehovah's Glory now
   shines forth with mildest radiance. Let us, therefore, come with
   boldness unto the Throne of the heavenly Grace, because everything
   there is ready for the pleading suppliant. You have no need to bring
   anything with you. You have no need of making preparations other than
   the Holy Spirit waits to give you in the form of groans which cannot be
   uttered! Come, child of God, notwithstanding your carelessness and
   indifference, or whatever it may be you have to complain of, for though
   you are unready, the Throne of Grace is ready and, therefore, draw near
   to it and find the Grace you need.

   If at this time we feel strong promptings towards communion with
   Christ, what a blessing it is that Christ is always ready to commune
   with His people. "Behold," He says, "I stand at the door and knock." We
   think that we stand at the

   door and knock, but it is scarcely so. The greater Truth, with regard
   to His people, is that Jesus asks for fellowship with us and tells us
   that if we open the door--and that is all He bids His people do--He
   will enter in and sup with them and they with Him. Suppose there is no
   supper, He will provide it--He has all things ready. The Master says,
   "Where is the guest chamber?" He does not say, "Where is the feast?" If
   Your heart will be the guest chamber, He will provide the supper and
   you shall sup with Him and He with you.

   At whose door did Christ knock according to the Scriptures? It was at
   the door of the Laodicean Church, at the door of the very Church
   concerning which He had said, "Because you are neither cold nor hot, I
   will spew you out of My mouth." Therefore you poor Laodicean Believers
   that are here this morning, if you have any promptings towards Christ,
   arise, for all things are ready and before you are aware, your soul
   shall be as the chariots of Amminadab! He is ready to receive us to His
   heart of hearts! How sweetly this ought to constrain us to fly into the
   arms of Jesus. I think the same thought ought to cross our minds with
   regard to every daily duty. We wake up in the morning, but we do not
   know exactly what lies before us, for God's Providence has constantly
   new revelations.

   But I like to think, in the morning, that all things are ready for my
   pathway through the day. That if I will go out to serve God in my
   ministry, He has prepared some ear into which I am to drop a gracious
   word and some heart in the furrows of which I shall effectually sow
   some blessed seed! Behold, all Providence with its mighty wheels is
   co-working with the servant of the living God! Only go forward in zeal
   and confidence, my Brother, and you shall find that every step of your
   way is ready for you! Your Master has trod the road and marked out for
   you the houses of refreshment where you are to tarry till you shall
   come to the Celestial City, itself, and the hallowed spots where you
   shall bring glory to His blessed name! For a useful life all things are
   ready for us.

   Yes, and if beyond the daily service of life we should feel a prompting
   to aspire to a higher degree of holiness--if we want to grow in Grace
   and reach the fullness of the stature of a man in Christ Jesus--all
   things are ready for us! No Christian can have a sacred ambition after
   holiness which the Lord is not prepared to fulfill. You that wish to be
   like Your Master, you that desire to make a self-sacrifice that will
   show the power of His Grace in you--the Holy Spirit waits to help
   you--all things shall work for you, for all things are ready! Come,
   therefore, without fear.

   One of these days it may be that you and I shall either be grown very
   old, or else disease will lay hold upon us and we shall lie upon the
   sick bed watching and waiting for our Master's coming. Then there shall
   suddenly appear a messenger from Him who will bring us this word, "All
   things are ready, come unto the supper," and closing our eyes on earth
   we shall open them in Heaven and see what He has done who so sweetly
   said, "I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go to prepare a place
   for you I will come again and receive you unto Myself, that where I am,
   there you may be also."

   Oh, it will be a joyous moment when we shall hear the summons, "All
   things are ready, quit your house of clay, your farm, your merchandise
   and even her who lies in your bosom, for the marriage of the Lamb has
   come and you must be there! Therefore, rise up, My love, My fair one
   and come away. The winter is over and past, the time of the singing of
   birds is come for you, all things are ready, come!"

   I feel tempted to linger here, but I must tear myself away from this
   point to pass on to the next.

   III. THE PERFECT READINESS OF THE FEAST OF DIVINE MERCY IS EVIDENTLY
   INTENDED TO BE A STRONG ARGUMENT WITH SINNERS WHY THEY SHOULD COME AT
   ONCE. To the sinner, then, do I address

   myself. Soul, do you desire eternal life? Is there within your spirit a
   hungering and a thirsting after such things as may satisfy Your spirit
   and make you live forever? Then hearken while the Master's servant
   gives you the invitation. "Come, for all things are ready"--all, not
   some--but all! There is nothing that you can need between here and
   Heaven but what is provided in Jesus Christ--in His Person and in His
   work.

   All things are ready--life for your death, forgiveness for your sin,
   cleansing for your filth, clothing for your nakedness, joy for your
   sorrow, strength for your weakness--yes, more than all that you can
   ever need is stored up in the boundless Nature and work of Christ. You
   must not say, "I cannot come because I have not this, or have not
   that." Are you to prepare the feast? Are you to provide anything? Are
   you the purveyor of even so much as the salt or the water? You know not
   your true condition or you would not dream of such a thing! The great
   Master of the house, Himself, has provided the whole of the feast--you
   have nothing to do with the provision but to partake of it! If you
   lack, come and take what you lack!

   The greater your need, the greater reason why you should come where all
   things that your needs can possibly lack will at once be supplied! If
   you are so needy that you have nothing good at all about you, all
   things are ready. What would you provide when God has provided all
   things? Superfluity of naughtiness would it be if you were to think of
   adding to His, "all things." It would be but a presumptuous competing
   with the provisions of the great King--and this He will not tolerate.
   All that you need--I can but repeat the words--between the gates of
   Hell, where you now lie, and the gates of Heaven, to which Grace will
   bring you if you believe--all is provided and prepared in Jesus Christ
   the Savior!

   And all things are ready, dwell on that. The oxen and the fatlings were
   killed. What is more, they were prepared to be eaten, they were ready
   to be feasted on, they smoked on the board. It is something when the
   king gives orders for the slaughter of so many bullocks for the feast,
   but the feast is not ready. And when, beneath the poleax, the victims
   fall and they are stripped and hung up ready for the fire, there is
   something done, but they are not ready. It is when the meat is served
   hot and steaming upon the table and all that is needed is brought forth
   and laid in proper order for the banquet-- it is then that all things
   are ready!

   And this is the case now. At this very moment you will find the feast
   to be in the best possible condition. It was never better and never can
   be better than it is now. All things are ready, just in the exact
   condition that you need them to be, just in such condition as shall be
   best for your soul's comfort and enjoyment. All things are ready!
   Nothing needs to be further mellowed or sweetened. Everything is at the
   best that eternal love can make it. But notice the word, "now." "All
   things are now ready"--just now--at this moment! At feasts, you know,
   the good housewife is often troubled if the guests come late. She would
   be sorry if they came half-an-hour too soon, but half-an-hour too late
   spoils everything! And in what a state of fret and worry is she if,
   when all things are now ready, her friends still delay.

   Leave food on the fire, awhile, and it does not seem to be, "now
   ready," but something more than ready and even spoiled. So does the
   great Master of the house lay stress upon this, "all things are now
   ready," therefore come at once. He does not say that if you will tarry
   for another seven years, all things will, then, be ready--God grant
   that long before that space of time, you may have got beyond the needs
   of persuasion by having become a taster of the feast--but He says that
   all things are ready now, just now. Just now that your heart is so
   heavy and your mind is so careless. Just now that your spirit is so
   wandering--all things are ready now!

   They are all ready just now though you have never thought of these
   things before and dropped in this morning to see this large assembly
   with no motive whatever as to your own salvation, yet all things are
   ready now. Though your sins are as the stars of Heaven and your soul
   trembles under an awful foreboding of coming judgment, yet, "all things
   are now ready." After all your rejections of Christ. After the many
   invitations that have been thrown away upon you, come to the supper!
   And if they are ready now, the argument is come, now, while still all
   things are ready. While the Spirit lingers and still strives with men.
   While mercy's gates still stand wide open that, "whoever will, may
   come." While life and health and reason still are spared to you and the
   ministering voice that bids you come can still be heard, come now, come
   at once--all things are ready--come! Delay is as unreasonable as it is
   wicked, now that all things are ready.

   Notice that all things were ready for those who were bid. They did not
   come, but they were not mocked when they were bid to come. The fact of
   all things being ready proved that the invitation was a sincere one,
   although it was a rejected one. There are some who will not have us
   give an invitation to any but to those whom we believe are sure to
   come, no, in a measure have come. That is to say, they make a minister
   to be a mere superfluity. Why need he come and invite those who have
   already begun to come?

   But we believe it to be our duty and our privilege to invite the whole
   mass of mankind! And even those who will not come--if we knew they
   would not come we should not, therefore, exempt them from the
   bidding--for the servant was sent to bid them to the wedding who,
   nevertheless, "all with one consent began to make excuse." They were
   invited and earnestly invited, and all things were ready, though they
   came not. O my dear Hearers, if you do not come to Christ you will
   perish! But you will never be able to say you were not invited and that
   there was nothing ready for you! No, there stands the feast all spread
   and you are sincerely and honestly bid to come. God grant that you may
   come and come at once!

   IV. Now I am going to pass on to my fourth and last point, which may
   God bless to the comfort of some seeking soul. THIS TEXT DISPOSES OF A
   GREAT DEAL OF TALK ABOUT THE SINNER'S READINESS OR UNREADINESS,

   because, if the reason why a sinner is to come is because all things
   are ready, then it is idle for him to say, "But I am not ready." It is
   clear that all the readiness required on man's part is a willingness to
   come and receive the blessing which God had provided. There is nothing
   else necessary. If men are willing to come, they may come. They will
   come when the Lord has been pleased to touch their wills so that man
   has a desire towards Christ. Where the heart really hungers and thirsts
   after righteousness, that is all the readiness which is needed.

   All the fitness He requires is that first you feel your need of Him,
   (and that He gives you), and that secondly, in feeling your need of
   Him, you are willing to come to Him. Willingness to come is everything!
   A readiness to believe in Jesus, a willingness to cast the soul on Him,
   a preparedness to accept Him just as He is, because you feel that He is
   just the Savior that you need--that is all. There was no other
   readiness. There could have been none in the case of those who were
   poor and blind, and crippled and maimed, yet came to the feast. The
   text does not say, "You are ready, therefore come." That is a legal way
   of putting the Gospel. No, the Gospel says, "All things are ready, the
   Gospel is ready, therefore you are to come." As for your readiness, all
   the readiness that is possibly needed is a readiness which the Spirit
   gives us, namely, willingness to come to Jesus.

   Now notice that the unreadiness of those who were bid arose out of
   their possessions and out of their abilities. One would not come
   because he had bought a piece of land. What a great heap Satan casts up
   between the soul and the Savior! What with worldly possessions and good
   deeds, he builds an earthwork of huge dimensions between the sinner and
   his Lord. Some gentlemen have too many acres to ever come to Christ!
   They think too much of the world to think much of Him. Many have too
   many fields of good works in which there are growing crops in which
   they pride themselves and these cause them to feel that they are
   persons of great importance. Many a man cannot come to Christ for all
   things because he has so much already!

   Others of them could not come because they had so much to do and could
   do it well--one had bought five yoke of oxen. He was going to test
   them. A strong man, quite able for plowing, did not come because he had
   so much ability. Thousands are kept away from Grace by what they have
   and by what they can do. Emptiness is more preparatory to a feast than
   fullness. How often does it happen that poverty and even inability help
   to lead the soul to Christ? When a man thinks himself to be rich he
   will not come to the Savior. When a man dreams that he is able to
   repent and believe at any time and to do everything for himself that is
   needed, he is not likely to come and by a simple faith repose in
   Christ. It is not what you have not, but what you have that keeps many
   of you from Christ! Sinful self is a devil, but righteous self is seven
   devils! The man who feels himself guilty may, for a while, be kept away
   by his guilt. But the man who is self-righteous will never come! Until
   the Lord has taken his pride away from him, he will still refuse the
   feast of Free Grace. The possession of abilities and honors and riches
   keep men from coming to the Redeemer.

   But on the other hand, personal condition does not constitute an
   unfitness for coming to Christ, for the sad condition of those who
   became guests did not debar them from the supper. Some were poor and
   doubtless wretched and ragged--they had not a penny to bless themselves
   with, as we say. Their garments were tattered, perhaps worse. They were
   filthy. They were not fit to be near respectable people--they would
   certainly be no credit to my Lord's table--but those who went to bring
   them in did not search their pockets, nor look at their coats--they
   fetched them in. They were poor, but the messengers were told to bring
   in the poor and, therefore, brought them. Their poverty did not prevent
   their being ready and oh, poor Soul, if you are literally poor, or
   spiritually poor, neither sort of poverty can constitute an unfitness
   for Divine mercy!--

   "The poorer the wretch the more welcome here."

   If you are brought to your last penny, yes, if that is spent. And if
   you have pawned all and are left in debt over your head and think that
   there is nothing for you but to be laid by the heels in prison forever,
   nevertheless you may come, poverty and all! Another class of them were
   maimed and so were not very comely in appearance--an arm had been
   lopped off, or an eye had been gouged out. One had lost a nose and
   another a leg. They were in all stages and shapes of dismemberment.
   Sometimes we turn our heads away and feel that we would rather give
   anything than look upon beggars who show their wounds and describe how
   they were maimed. But it did not matter how badly they were
   disfigured-- they were brought in and not one of them was repulsed
   because of the ugly cuts he had received!

   So, poor Soul, however Satan may have torn and lopped you, and into
   whatever condition he may have brought you, so that you feel ashamed to
   live, nevertheless this is no unfitness for coming! Just as you are,
   you may come to His

   table of Grace. Moral disfigurements are soon rectified when Jesus
   takes the character in hand. Come to Him, however sadly you are injured
   by sin. There were others who were halt, that is to say, they had lost
   a leg, or it was of no use to them, and they could not come except they
   had a crutch and crawled or hopped upon it. But nevertheless that was
   no reason why they were not welcome.

   Ah, if you find it difficult to believe, it is no reason why you should
   not come and receive the grand absolution which Jesus Christ is ready
   to bestow upon you! Lame with doubts and distrust? Nevertheless come to
   the supper and say, "Lord, I believe; help You my unbelief." Others
   were blind people and when they were told to come they could not see
   the way, but in that case the messenger was not told to tell them to
   come--he was commanded to bring them--and a blind man can come if he is
   brought. All that was needed was willingness to be led by the hand in
   the right direction. Now, you that cannot fully understand the Gospel
   as you desire to do. You that are puzzled and muddled, give your hand
   to Jesus and be willing to be led--be willing to believe what you
   cannot comprehend and to grasp in confidence that which you are not
   able yet to measure with your understanding. The blind, however
   ignorant or uninstructed they are, shall not be kept away because of
   that.

   Then there were the men in the highways. I suppose they were beggars.
   And the men in the hedges. I suppose they were hiding and were probably
   thieves. But nevertheless they were told to come and though they were
   highwaymen and hedge-birds, even that did not prevent their coming and
   finding welcome! Though outcasts, off casts, spiritual gypsies-- people
   that nobody cared for, yet, whatever they might be, that was not the
   question--they were to come because all things were ready! They could
   come in rags, come in filth, come maimed, come covered with sores, come
   in all sorts of filthiness and abomination, yet because all things are
   ready they were to be brought or to be compelled to come in.

   Now, lastly, I think it was the very thing which, in any one of these
   people, looked like unfitness, was a help to them. It is a great truth
   that what we regard as unfitness is often our truest fitness. I want
   you to notice these poor, blind and lame people. Some of those who were
   invited would not come because they had bought some land, or five yoke
   of oxen. But when the messenger went up to the poor man in rags and
   said, "Come to the supper," it is quite clear he would not say he had
   bought a field, or oxen, for he could not do it. He had not a penny to
   do the thing with, so that he was clean delivered from that temptation.

   And when a man is invited to come to Christ and he says, "I do not need
   Him, I have a righteousness of my own," he will stay away. But when the
   Lord Jesus came along to me, I never was tempted in that way, because I
   had no righteousness of my own and could not have made any if I had
   tried! I know some here who could not patch up a garment of
   righteousness if they were to put all their rags together--and this is
   a great help to their receiving the Lord Jesus. What a blessing it is
   to have such a sense of soul poverty that you will never stay away from
   Christ because of what you possess!

   Then, next, some could not come because they had married a wife. Now, I
   think it is very likely that these people who were maimed and cut about
   were so injured that they had no wife and perhaps could not get anybody
   to have them. Well then, they had not that temptation to stay away.
   They were too maimed to attract the eye of anybody who was looking for
   beauty and, therefore, they were not tempted that way. But they found
   at the ever-blessed supper of the Lamb an everlasting wedlock which was
   infinitely better! Thus do souls lose earthly joys and comforts and, by
   the loss, they gain supremely--they are thus made willing to close in
   with Christ and find a higher comfort and a higher joy! That maiming
   which looked like unfitness turned out to be fitness!

   One excuse made was, "I have bought five yoke of oxen and I go to test
   them." The lame could not do that. When the messenger touched the lame
   man on the shoulder and said, "Come," he could not say, "I am going out
   tonight to plow with my new teams." He had never been over the clods
   ever since he had lost his leg, poor soul, so that he could not make
   such an excuse. The blind man could not say, "I have bought a piece of
   land and I must go see it." He was free from all the lusts of the eyes
   and so far was all the more ready to be led to the supper! When a soul
   feels its own sinfulness, wretchedness and lost estate, it thinks
   itself unfit to come to Christ--but this is an assistance to it--since
   it prevents its looking to anything else but Christ! It kills its
   excuses and makes it free to accept salvation by Grace.

   But what about the men that were in the highway? Well, it seems to me
   that they were already on the road and at least out of their houses, if
   they had any. If they were out there begging, they were the more ready
   to accept an invitation to a meal of good food, for it was that they
   were singing for. A man who is out of the house of his own
   self-righteousness,

   though he is a great sinner, is in a more favorable position and more
   likely to come to Christ than he who prides himself in his supposed
   self-righteousness.

   As for those who were under the hedges, well, they had no house of
   their own and so they were all the more likely to come and fill God's
   House. Men do not take to hedges to sleep under them as long as they
   have, even, a hovel where they may rest their head. But oh, poor soul,
   when you are driven to such distress that you would gladly hide under
   any hedge-when you have nothing left but a fearful looking for of
   judgment! When you think yourself to be an outlaw and an outcast before
   God, left to wander like Cain, a waif and stray, lost to all good, you,
   I say, are the very man to come to Christ! Come out of your hedges,
   then!

   I am looking for you. Though you hide yourselves away, yet God's own
   Spirit will discover you and bring you, I trust, this very morning, to
   feed on Divine Love! Trust Jesus Christ, that is all, just as you are,
   with all your unfitness and unreadiness! Take what God has made ready
   for you, the precious blood to cleanse you, a robe of righteousness to
   cover you, eternal joy to be your portion! Receive the Grace of God in
   Christ Jesus! Oh receive it now! God grant you may for Jesus Christ's
   sake. Amen.

Our Lord's Question to the Blind Men

   (No. 1355)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, MAY 13, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying
   and saying, Son of David, ha ve mercy on us. And when He was come into
   the house, the blind men came to Him: and Jesus said unto them, Do you
   believe that I am able to do this? They said unto Him, Yes, Lord. Then
   touched He their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.
   And their eyes were opened." Matthew 9:27-30.

   [On this occasion the Members of the regular Congregation left their
   seats to strangers.)

   IN OUR own streets we meet, here and there, with a blind beggar, but
   they swarm in Eastern cities. Opthalmia is the scourge of Egypt and
   Syria and Volney declares that in Cairo, out of a hundred persons whom
   he met, 20 were quite blind, 10 had one eye, and 20 others were more or
   less afflicted in that organ. At the present day everyone is struck
   with the immense number of the blind in Oriental lands, but things were
   probably worse in our Savior's times. We ought to be very grateful that
   leprosy, opthalmia and certain other forms of disease have been
   wonderfully held in check among us in modern times, so that the plague
   which devastated our city 200 years ago is now unknown and our Lock
   hospitals are no longer crowded with lepers.

   Blindness is now often prevented, and frequently cured. And it is not,
   by any means, an evil of such frequent occurrence as to constitute a
   leading source of the poverty of the country. Because there were so
   many blind folk in our Savior's day and so many gathered around Him, we
   very commonly read of His healing the blind. Mercy met misery on its
   own ground. Where human sorrow was most conspicuous, Divine power was
   most compassionate. Now, in these days it is a very usual thing for men
   to be blind spiritually and, therefore, I have great hope that our Lord
   Jesus will act after His former manner and display His power amid the
   abounding evil.

   I trust there are some here at this hour who are longing to obtain
   spiritual sight, longing especially, like the two blind men in our
   text, to see Jesus, whom to see is everlasting life! We have come,
   tonight to speak to those who feel their spiritual blindness and are
   pining for the light of God--the light of pardon, the light of love and
   peace, the light of holiness and purity. Our eager desire is that the
   pall of darkness may be lifted, that the Divine Ray may find a passage
   into the soul's inner gloom and cause the night of Nature to pass away
   forever. O that the moment of day-dawn may be just at hand to many of
   you who are "only blind!"

   Immediate illumination is the blessing I implore upon you. I know that
   Truth of God may abide in the memory for years and, at last, produce
   fruit. But at this time our prayer is for immediate results, for such
   only will be in accordance with the nature of the light of which we
   speak. At the first, Jehovah did but say, "Let there be light," and
   there was light! And when Jehovah Jesus sojourned here below, He did
   but touch the eyes of the blind and straightway they received sight! O
   for the same speedy work at this hour! Men who were led by the hand to
   Jesus, or groped their way along walls to the place where His voice
   proclaimed His Presence, were touched by His finger and went home
   without a guide, rejoicing that Jesus Christ had opened their eyes!

   Such marvels Jesus is still able to perform and, depending upon the
   Holy Spirit, we will preach His Word and watch for the signs following,
   expecting to see them at once! Why should not hundreds of you who came
   into this Tabernacle in Nature's blackness go forth from it blessed
   with the light of Heaven? This, at any rate, is our heart's inmost and

   uppermost desire--and at this we aim with concentrated faculties. Come
   with us, then, to the text, and be at once friendly enough to
   yourselves to be willing to be affected by the Truths of God which it
   will bring before you.

   I. First, in explaining the passage before us, we must call your
   attention to THE SEEKERS themselves--the two blind men. There is
   something about them worthy of imitation by all who would be saved. We
   notice at once that the two blind men were in downright earnest. The
   word which describes their appeal to Christ is, "crying," and by this
   is not meant mere speaking, for they are represented as, "crying and
   saying." Now, crying implies earnest, energetic, pathetic imploring,
   pleading and beseeching. Their tones and gestures indicated that theirs
   was no holiday fancy, but a deep, passionate craving.

   Imagine yourselves in such a case. How eager you would be for the
   blessed light if for years you had been compelled to abide in what
   Milton called, "the ever-during dark." They were hungering and
   thirsting after sight. Now, we cannot hope for salvation till we seek
   it with equal vigor and yet, how few are in earnest about being saved!
   How earnest some men are about their money, their health, or their
   children! How warm they are upon politics and parish business! But the
   moment you touch them upon matters of true godliness they are as cool
   as the Arctic snows. O Sirs, why is this? Do you expect to be saved
   while you are half asleep? Do you expect to find pardon and Grace while
   you continue in listless indifference? If so, you are woefully
   mistaken, for "the kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent
   take it by force."

   Death and eternity, judgment and Hell are not things to play with! The
   soul's eternal destiny is no small matter and salvation by the precious
   blood of Christ is no trifle. Men are not saved from going down into
   the pit by a careless nod or a wink. A mumbled, "Our Father," or a
   hasty "Lord, have mercy upon me," will not suffice! These blind men
   would have remained blind had they not been in earnest to have their
   eyes opened. And so, many continue in their sins because they are not
   in earnest to escape from them. These men were fully awake. Dear
   Hearer, are you? Can you join with me in these verses?--

   "Jesus, who now are passing by

   Our Prophet, Priest, and King You are!

   Hear a poor unbeliever's cry,

   And heal the blindness of my heart

   Urging my passionate request,

   Your pardoning mercy I implore,

   Whoever rebuke I will not rest,

   Till You my spirit's sight restore." The blind men were thoroughly
   persevering in consequence of being in earnest, for they "followed"
   Christ and so continued to urge their suit. How did they manage to
   follow the movements of the Lord? We do not know. It must have been
   very difficult, for they were blind, but they, no doubt, asked others
   the way which the Master had taken and they kept their ears open to
   every sound. Doubtless they said, "Where is He? Where is Jesus? Lead
   us! Guide us! We must find Him." We do not know how far our Lord had
   gone, but we know this, that as far as He had gone they followed. They
   were so bravely persevering that having reached the house where He was,
   they did not stay outside waiting till He came out again, but they
   pressed into the room where He sat. They were insatiable for sight!

   Their earnest cries took Him off from His preaching. He paused and
   listened while they said, "Son of David, have mercy on us." Thus does
   perseverance prevail--no man shall be lost who knows the art of
   importunate prayer! If you will resolve never to leave the gate of
   Mercy till the porter opens to you, he will assuredly unbar the door.
   If you grasp the Covenant angel with this resolve, "I will not let You
   go except You bless me," you shall come forth from the place of
   wrestling more than a conqueror! A mouth open in never-ceasing prayer
   shall bring about eyes open in full vision of faith. Pray, therefore,
   in the darkness, even if there is no hope of light, for when God, who
   is Light, itself, moves a poor sinner to plead and cry out before Him
   with the solemn intent to continue to do so till the blessing comes, He
   has no thought of mocking that poor crying heart! Perseverance in
   prayer is a sure sign that the day of the opening of the eyes is near.

   The blind men had a definite object in their prayers. They knew what
   they wanted, they were not like children crying for nothing, or greedy
   misers crying for everything! They wanted their sight and they knew it.
   Too many blind souls are unaware of their blindness and, therefore,
   when they pray, they ask for anything except the one thing necessary.
   Many so-

   called prayers consist in saying very nice words, very pretty, pious
   sentences, but they are not prayers. Prayer, "to saved ones," is
   communion with God. And to persons seeking salvation, it is asking for
   what you need and expecting to receive it through the name of Jesus,
   whose name you plead with God.

   But what sort of prayer is that in which there is no sense of need, no
   direct asking, no intelligent pleading? Dear Hearer, have you in
   distinct terms asked the Lord to save you? Have you expressed your need
   of a new heart, your need of being washed in the blood of Christ, your
   need of being made God's child and adopted into His family? There is no
   praying till a man knows what he is praying for and sets himself to
   pray for it as if he cared for nothing else. If being already earnest
   and importunate, he is, also, instructed and full of definite desires,
   he is sure to succeed in his pleading. With a strong arm he draws the
   bow of desire and fits upon the string the sharp arrow of passionate
   longing. And then with the instructed eye of perception, he takes
   deliberate aim and, therefore, we may expect that he will hit the very
   center of the target.

   Pray for light, life, forgiveness, salvation--and pray for these with
   all your soul--and as surely as Christ is in Heaven, He will give these
   good gifts to you. Whom did He ever refuse? These blind men in their
   prayers honored Christ, for they said, "Son of David have mercy on us."
   The great ones of the land were loath to recognize our Lord as being of
   the royal seed, but these blind men proclaimed the Son of David right
   lustily! They were blind, but they could see a great deal more than
   some with sharp eyes, for they could see that the Nazarene was the
   Messiah, sent of God to restore the kingdom unto Israel!

   They gathered from this belief that, as the Messiah was to open blind
   eyes, Jesus, being the Messiah, could open their blind eyes. And so
   they appealed to Him to perform the tokens of His office, thus honoring
   Him by a real, practical faith! This is the manner of prayer which will
   always speed to Heaven, the prayer which crowns the Son of David! Pray,
   glorifying Christ Jesus in your prayers, making much of Him, pleading
   much the merit of His life and death, giving Him glorious titles
   because your soul has a high reverence and a vast esteem of Him.
   Jesus-adoring prayers have in them the force and swiftness of eagles'
   wings! They must ascend to God, for the elements of heavenly power are
   abundant in them.

   Prayer which makes little of Christ is prayer which God will make
   little of, but the prayer in which the soul glorifies the Redeemer
   rises like a perfumed pillar of incense from the Most Holy place and
   the Lord, Himself, smells a sweet savor. Observe, also, that these two
   blind men in their prayer confessed their unworthiness. "Son of David,
   have mercy on us." Their sole appeal was to mercy. There was no talk
   about merit, no pleading of their past sufferings, or their persevering
   endeavors, or their resolves for the future! No, nothing but, "Have
   mercy on us."

   He will never win a blessing from God who demands it as if he had a
   right to it. We must plead with God as a condemned criminal appeals to
   his sovereign, asking for the exercise of the royal prerogative of free
   pardon. As a beggar asks for alms in the street by pleading his need of
   it and requesting a gift for charity's sake, so must we apply to the
   Most High, appealing and directing our supplication to the loving
   kindness and tender mercy of the Lord. We must plead after this
   fashion--"O God, if You destroy me, I deserve it. If never a
   comfortable look should come from Your face to me, I cannot complain.
   But save a sinner, Lord, for mercy's sake! I have no claim upon You
   whatever, but oh, because You are full of Grace, look on a poor blind
   soul that gladly would look on You."

   My Brothers and Sisters, I cannot put fine words together. I have never
   occupied myself in the school of oratory. In fact, my heart abhors the
   very idea of seeking to speak finely when souls are in peril. No, I
   labor to speak straight home to your hearts and consciences. And if
   there is, in this listening throng, any who are listening in the right
   manner, God will bless the Word to them. "And what kind of listening is
   that?" you ask. Why, that in which the man says, "As far as I perceive
   that the preacher delivers God's Word, I will follow him, and I will do
   what he describes the seeking sinner as doing. I will pray and plead
   tonight and I will persevere in my entreaties, laboring to glorify the
   name of Jesus and, at the same time, confessing my own unworthiness.
   Thus, even thus, will I crave mercy at the hands of the Son of David."

   Happy is the preacher if he knows that such will be the case!

   II. Now, we will pause a minute and note, secondly, THE QUESTION WHICH
   WAS PUT TO THEM. They sought to have their eyes opened. They both stood
   before the Lord, whom they could not see, but who could see them and
   could reveal Himself to them by their hearing. He began to question
   them, not that He might know them, but that they might know themselves.
   He asked only one question--"Do you believe that I am able to do this?"
   That question touched the

   only thing which stood between them and sight. On their answer depended
   whether they should go out of that room seeing men or blind.

   "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" Now, I believe that between
   every seeking sinner and Christ there is only this one question--"Do
   you believe that I am able to do this?" And if any man can truly answer
   as the men in the narrative did, "Yes Lord," he will assuredly receive
   the reply, "According to your faith be it unto you." Let us look, then,
   at this very weighty question with very serious attention. It concerned
   their faith. "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" He did not ask
   them what kind of characters they had been in the past, because when
   men come to Christ the past is forgiven them. He did not ask them
   whether they had tried various means of getting their eyes opened,
   because whether they had, or had not, they were still blind.

   He did not ask them, even, whether they thought there might be a
   mysterious Physician who would effect a cure in a future state. No.
   Curious questions and idle speculations are never suggested by the Lord
   Jesus! His enquiries were all resolved into a trial upon one point--and
   that one point is faith. Did they believe that He, the Son of David,
   could heal them? Why does our Lord, everywhere, not only in His
   ministry, but in the teaching of the Apostles, always lay such stress
   upon faith? Why is faith so essential? It is because of its receptive
   power. A purse will not make a man rich and yet, without some place for
   his money, how could a man acquire wealth? Faith, of itself, could not
   contribute a penny to salvation, but it is the purse which holds a
   precious Christ within itself! Yes, it holds all the treasures of
   Divine Love.

   If a man is thirsty, a rope and a bucket are not, in themselves, of
   much use to him, but yet, Sirs, if there is a well near at hand, the
   very thing that is needed is a bucket and a rope, by means of which the
   water can be lifted. Faith is the bucket by means of which a man may
   draw water out of the wells of salvation and drink to his heart's
   content! You may, sometimes, have stopped a moment at a street fountain
   and have desired to drink, but you found you could not, for the
   drinking cup was gone. The water flowed, but you could not get at it.
   It was tantalizing to be at the fountainhead and yet to be thirsty,
   still, for lack of a little cup!

   Now faith is that little cup which we hold up to the flowing stream of
   Christ's Grace. We fill it and then we drink and are refreshed. Hence
   the importance of faith. It would have seemed to our forefathers an
   idle thing to lay down a cable under the sea from England to America.
   And it would be idle, now, if it were not that science has taught us
   how to speak by lightning--yet the cable, itself, is now of the utmost
   importance--for the best inventions of telegraphy would be of no use
   for purposes of transatlantic communication if there were not the
   connecting wire between the two continents! Faith is just that--it is
   the connecting link between our souls and God--and the living message
   flashes along it to our souls.

   Faith is sometimes weak and comparable only to a very slender thread,
   but it is a very precious thing for all that, for it is the beginning
   of great things. Years ago they were wanting to throw a suspension
   bridge across a mighty chasm, through which flowed, far down, a
   navigable river. From crag to crag it was proposed to hang an iron
   bridge aloft in the air, but how was it to be commenced? They shot an
   arrow from one side to the other and it carried across the gulf a tiny
   thread. That invisible thread was enough to begin with. The connection
   was established and, by-and-by, the thread drew a piece of twine. The
   twine carried after it, a small rope. The rope soon carried a cable
   across and all in good time came the iron chains and everything else
   that was needed for the permanent way.

   Now, faith is often very weak, but even in that case it is still of the
   utmost value, for it forms a communication between the soul and the
   Lord Jesus Christ. If you believe in Him, there is a link between Him
   and you. Your sinfulness rests on His Grace. Your weakness hangs on His
   strength. Your nothingness hides itself in His all-sufficiency! But if
   you believe not, you are apart from Jesus and no blessing can flow to
   you. So the question that I have to address, in my Master's name
   tonight, to every seeking sinner, has to do with his faith and nothing
   else. It does not matter to me whether you are a 100,000 pounds man, or
   whether you earn a few shillings a week. I care not whether you are a
   peer or a pauper, whether you are royal or rustic, learned or ignorant.
   We have the same Gospel to deliver to every man, woman and child--and
   we have to lay the stress upon the same point--"Do you believe?" If you
   believe, you shall be saved, but if you believe not, you can not
   partake of the blessings of Grace.

   Notice, next, that the question concerned their faith in Jesus. "Do you
   believe that I am able to do this?" If we were to ask the awakened
   sinner, "Do you believe that you can save yourself?" His answer would
   be, "No, that I do not. I know better. My self-sufficiency is dead." If
   we were, then, to put the question to him, "Do you believe that
   ordinances

   and means of Grace and sacraments can save you?" If he is an
   intelligent, awakened penitent, he will reply, "I know better. I have
   tried them, but in and of themselves they are utter vanity." Truly it
   is so! There remains in us and around us nothing upon which hope can
   build, even for an hour. But the enquiry passes beyond self and casts
   us upon Jesus only, by bidding us hear the Lord Himself say, "Do you
   believe that I am able to do this?"

   Now, Beloved, we are not talking concerning a merely historical Person
   when we speak about the Lord Jesus Christ. We speak of One who is above
   all others. He is the Son of the Highest and yet He came to this earth
   and was born a Baby at Bethlehem. He slept upon a woman's bosom and
   grew up as other children do. He became a Man in fullness of stature
   and wisdom, living here for 30 years or more, doing good. At the last,
   this glorious God in human flesh, "died, the Just for the unjust, that
   He might bring us to God," standing in the place of guilty man, that He
   might bear man's punishment--that God might be just and yet the
   Justifier of him that believes.

   He died and was buried, but only for a short time could the grave
   contain Him. Early in the morning of the third day He rose and left the
   dead, no more to die. He tarried here sufficiently long for many to see
   Him alive and really in the body. No event in history is so well
   authenticated as the Resurrection of Christ. He was seen by individuals
   and by twos and twenties, and by above 500 Brothers and Sisters at
   once. After having lived here a little while, He ascended up into
   Heaven in the presence of His disciples, a cloud receiving Him out of
   their sight. At this moment He is sitting at the right hand of God in
   human flesh--that same Man who died upon the Cross is now enthroned in
   the highest heavens, Lord of All--and every angel delights to do Him
   homage!

   The one question which He asks of you tonight, through these poor lips,
   is this, "Do you believe that I am able to save you--that I, the Christ
   of God now dwelling in Heaven, am able to save you?" Everything depends
   upon your answer to that question! I know what your answer ought to be.
   Surely, if He is God, nothing is impossible or even difficult for Him.
   If He has laid down His life to make atonement, and God has accepted
   that Atonement by permitting Him to rise from the dead, then there must
   be efficacy in His blood to cleanse me, even me! The answer ought to
   be, "Yes, Lord Jesus, I believe that You are able to do this."

   But now I want to lay stress on another word of my text and I want you
   to lay stress on it, too. "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"
   Now, it would have been of no use for these blind men to say, "We
   believe that You can raise the dead." "No," says Christ, "the matter at
   hand is the opening of your eyes. Do you believe that I am able to do
   this?" They might have replied, "Good Master, we believe that You did
   stop the woman's issue when she touched Your garment." "No," He says,
   "that is not the question. Your eyes have now to be attended to. You
   need sight and the question about your faith is, Do you believe that I
   am able to do this?"

   Ah, some of you can believe for other people, but we must bring the
   question more fully home to you and say, "Do you believe that Christ is
   able to save you--even you? Is He able to do this?" Possibly I address
   someone who has gone very far in sin. It may be, my Friend, you have
   crowded a great deal of iniquity into a short space. You went in for a
   short life and a merry one and according to your present prospects you
   are likely enough to have a short life. But the merriment is pretty
   nearly over with you, already, and as you look back upon your life, you
   reflect that never did a young man or a young woman throw life away
   more foolishly than you have done. Now then, do you desire to be saved?
   Can you say from your heart that you do? Answer me, then, this further
   question, Do you believe that Jesus Christ is able to do this, namely,
   to blot out all your sins, to renew your heart and to save you tonight?

   "Oh, Sir, I do believe He is able to forgive sin." But do you believe
   that He is able to forgive your sin? You, yourself are the case in
   hand! How is your faith on that point? Let the cases of others, alone,
   just now, and consider yourself! Do you believe that He is able to do
   this? This--this sin of yours, this misspent life--is Jesus able to
   cope with this? On your answer to that question everything depends. It
   is an idle faith which dreams of believing in the Lord's power over
   others, but then declares that it has no confidence in Him for itself.
   You must believe that He is able to do this--this which concerns
   you--or you are, for all practical purposes, an unbeliever.

   I know I am speaking to a great many persons who never did go into the
   vices of the world. I thank God on your behalf that you have been kept
   in the ways of morality and sobriety and honesty. Yet I know that some
   of you almost wish, or at least it has occurred to you that you might
   almost wish--that you had been great, open sinners--that you might be
   preached to as open sinners are and that you might see a change in
   yourself equal to what you have seen in some of them about whose
   conversion you can never doubt. Do not indulge in so unwise a wish, but
   listen while I put this

   question to you, also. Your case is that of a moralist who has obeyed
   every outward duty, but has neglected his God-- the case of a moralist
   who feels as if repentance were to him, impossible, because he has been
   so long eaten up with self-righteousness that he knows not how to cut
   out the gangrene!

   The Lord Jesus Christ can as easily save you from your
   self-righteousness as He can save another from his guilty habits! Do
   you believe that He is able to do this? Come now, do you believe that
   He is able to meet this, your own peculiar case? Give me a, "yes," or
   a," no," to this question. "Alas," cries one of you, "my heart is so
   hard." Do you believe that He can soften it? Suppose it is as hard as
   granite--do you now believe that the Christ of God can turn it into wax
   in a moment? Suppose your heart is as fickle as the wind and waves of
   the sea--can you believe that He can make you stable-minded and settle
   you upon the Rock of Ages forever? If you believe in Him, He will do
   this for you, for, according to your faith shall it be unto you.

   But I know the pinch lies here. Everybody tries to run away to the
   thought that he does believe in Christ's power for others, but he
   trembles for himself. But I must hold each man to the point which
   concerns himself! I must buttonhole you and bring you to the real test!
   Jesus asks each one of you--"Do you believe that I am able to do this?"
   "Why," says one, "it would be the most surprising thing that the Lord
   Jesus ever did if He were to save me tonight!" Do you believe that He
   can do it? Will you trust Him to do it now? "But it will be such a
   strange thing, such a miracle!" The Lord Jesus works strange things! It
   is the way of Him. He was always a miracle-worker! Can you believe Him
   able to do this for you, even this, which is now needed to save you?

   It is wonderful, the power which faith has--power over the Lord Jesus,
   Himself! I have often experienced, in my little way, how confidence
   will master you. Have you not frequently been conquered by the
   trustfulness of a tiny child? The simple request was too full of trust
   to be refused. Have you ever been grasped by a blind man at a street
   crossing who has said to you, "Sir, would you take me across the road?"
   And then, perhaps, he has said somewhat cunningly, "I know by the tone
   of your voice that you are kind. I feel I can trust myself with you."
   At such a time you have felt that you were in for it--you could not let
   him go. And when a soul says to Jesus, "I know You can save me, my
   Lord. I know You can, therefore in You do I trust," why He cannot shake
   you off! He cannot wish to do so, for He has said, "Him that comes to
   Me, I will in no wise cast out."

   I sometimes tell a story to illustrate this. It is a simple enough
   tale, but it shows how faith wins everywhere. Many years ago my garden
   happened to be surrounded by a hedge, which looked green, but was a
   poor protection. A neighbor's dog was very fond of visiting my garden
   and as he never improved my flowers I never gave him a cordial welcome.
   Walking along quietly one evening I saw him doing mischief. I threw a
   stick at him and advised him to go home. But how did the good creature
   reply to me? He turned round and wagged his tail! And in the merriest
   manner, he picked up my stick, brought it to me and laid it at my feet!
   Did I strike him? No, I am not a monster! I should have been ashamed of
   myself if I had not patted him on the back and told him to come there
   whenever he liked! Soon he and I were friends, because, you see, he
   trusted me and conquered me.

   Now, simple as the story is, that is just the philosophy of a sinner's
   faith in Christ. As the dog mastered the man by confiding in him, so a
   poor guilty sinner does, in effect, master the Lord, Himself, by
   trusting Him when he says, "Lord, I am a poor dog of a sinner and You
   might drive me away, but I believe You to be too good for that. I
   believe You can save me, and lo, I trust myself with You. Whether I am
   lost or saved, I trust myself with You." Ah, dear Heart, you will never
   be lost if you thus trust! He who trusts himself with Jesus has given
   the answer to the question, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"
   and there is nothing now left but for him to go his way and rejoice,
   for the Lord has opened his eyes and saved him!

   III. Now, thirdly, THAT QUESTION WAS A VERY REASONABLE ONE. "Do you
   believe that I am able to do

   this?" Just a minute, let me show that it was a very reasonable
   question for Christ to put--and equally reasonable for me to urge home
   upon many here present. Our Lord Jesus might have said, "If you do not
   believe that I am able to do this, why did you follow Me? Why did you
   follow Me more than anybody else? You have been after Me down the
   streets and you have come into this house after Me. Why have you done
   this if you do not believe that I am able to open your eyes?"

   So a large proportion of you who are here tonight attend a place of
   worship. You like to be there, but why, if you do not believe Jesus?
   Why do you go there? Do you go to seek a savior who cannot save you? Do
   you foolishly seek after one in whom you cannot trust? I have never
   heard of such madness as for a sick man to run after a doctor in whom
   he has no

   confidence. And do you come here, tonight, and attend your places of
   worship at other times without having any faith in Jesus? Then why do
   you come? What inconsistent people you must be! Again, these blind men
   had been praying to Jesus to open their eyes, but why did they pray? If
   they did not believe that Jesus could heal them, their prayers were a
   mockery. Would you ask a man to do a thing which you knew he could not
   do? Must not prayer always be measured by the quantity of faith that we
   put into it?

   I know that some of you have been in the habit of prayer ever since you
   were little children. You scarcely ever go to bed at night without
   repeating the form of prayer your mother taught you. Why do you do that
   if you do not believe that Jesus Christ can save you? Why ask Him to do
   what you do not believe He can do? What strange inconsistency--to pray
   without faith! Moreover, these two blind men had called Jesus Christ
   the "Son of David." Why had they thus confessed His Messiahship? The
   most of you do the same. I suppose that out of this congregation there
   are very few who doubt the Deity of Christ. You believe in the Word of
   God--you do not doubt that it is Inspired--you believe that Jesus
   Christ has lived and died and gone into His Glory.

   Well, then, if you do not believe that He is able to save you, what do
   you mean by saying that He is God? God and yet not able? A dying,
   bleeding, atoning, Sacrifice--and yet not able to save? Oh, man, your
   nominal creed is not your true one! If you were to write your true
   creed out it would run something like this--"I do not believe in Jesus
   Christ as the Son of God, or that He has made a full atonement for sin,
   for I do not believe that He is able to save me." Would not that be
   correct and all of a piece? Well, then, I charge you by your frequent
   hearings of the Word, by your habitual prayers and by your profession
   of being Believers in that grand old Bible, answer me--How is it that
   you do not believe in Jesus?

   Sirs, He must be able to save you! Do you know it is some 27 years or
   more since I put my trust in Him and I must speak of Him as I find. In
   every hour of darkness, in every season of despondency, in every time
   of trial I have found Him faithful and true! And, as to trusting Him
   with my soul, if I had a thousand souls I would trust them with Him!
   And if I had as many souls as there are sands upon the seashore, I
   would not ask for a second Savior, but would just put them all into
   those dear hands which were pierced with the nails, that He might grasp
   me and hold me fast forever.

   He is worthy of your trust and your trust is all He asks of you!
   Knowing that He is able--and you cannot doubt that He is willing,
   seeing that He has died--He asks you to act upon your belief that He is
   able to save you and trust yourself to Him.

   IV. Now, I must not detain you much longer and, therefore, I want you
   to notice THE ANSWER which these blind men gave to His question. They
   said to Him, "Yes, Lord." Well, now, I have been pressing that question
   upon you and I again repeat it. Do you believe that Christ is able to
   save you? Do you believe that He is able to do this, to touch your case
   in all its specialty? Now for your answer. How many will say, "Yes,
   Lord"? I am half inclined to ask you to say it aloud. But I will rather
   beg you to say it in your secret souls--"Yes, Lord." And now may God
   the Holy Spirit help you to say it very distinctly, without any holding
   back and mental reservation, "Yes, Lord. Blind eyes, dumb tongue, cold
   heart--I believe that You are able to change them all and I rest myself
   on You, to be renewed by Your Divine Grace."

   Say it and mean it! Say it decidedly and distinctly, with your whole
   heart, "Yes, Lord." Notice that the two men replied immediately. The
   question was no sooner out of Christ's mouth than they gave the answer,
   "Yes, Lord." There is nothing like being prompt in your answers, for
   when you ask a man a question and you say, "Do you believe that I am
   able to do this?" and he stops, rubs his forehead, strokes his head
   and, at last says--"Y-y-yes," does not such a, "yes," sound uncommonly
   like "no"? The best "yes" in the world is the "yes" which leaps forth
   at once!

   "Yes, Lord. Bad as I am, I believe You can save me, for I know Your
   precious blood can take away every stain. Though I am an old sinner,
   though I am an aggravated sinner, though I am one who has gone back
   from a profession of religion and have played the backslider's part.
   Though I seem to be an outcast from society, though I do not, at this
   time, feel as I could wish to feel, and am the very reverse of what I
   ought to be, yet I do believe that if Christ has died for sinners, that
   if the eternal Son of God has gone into Heaven to plead for sinners,
   then He must be 'able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God
   by Him.' And so I come to God tonight by Him, by His Grace, and I do
   believe that He is able to save even me."

   That is the kind of answer which I long to get from you all! May the
   Spirit of God produce it!

   V. Then see OUR LORD'S RESPONSE to their answer. He said, "According to
   your faith be it unto you." As much as if He had said--If you believe
   in Me there is light for your blind eyes. So true the faith, so true
   the sight. If you believe decidedly and fully, you shall not have one
   eye opened, or both eyes half opened, but all your sight shall be given
   to you. Decided faith shall clear away every speck and make your vision
   strong and clear. If your answer is quick, so shall My answer be. You
   shall see in a moment, for you at once believed.

   The Lord's power just kept touch with their faith. If their faith was
   true, His cure was true. If their faith was complete, His cure was
   complete. And if their faith said, "yes," at once, He give them sight
   at once. If you are a long while in saying, "yes," you will be a long
   while in getting peace. But if you say, tonight, "I will venture it,
   for I see it is so. Jesus must be able to save me. I will give myself
   up to Him." If you do that at once you shall have instantaneous
   peace--yes, in that very seat, young man, you who are burdened tonight
   shall find rest! You shall wonder where the burden has gone, and look
   round and find that it has vanished, because you have looked to the
   Crucified One and trusted all your sins with Him.

   Your bad habits, which you have been trying in vain to conquer, which
   have forged fresh chains to hold you fast-- you shall find them fall
   from off you, like spiders' webs. If you can but trust Jesus to break
   them and give yourself up to Him to be renewed by Him, it shall be done
   and done tonight! And Heaven's eternal arches shall ring with shouts of
   Sovereign Grace. Thus I have put the whole matter before you. My only
   hope is that God, the blessed Spirit, will lead you to seek as the
   blind men sought--and especially to trust as they trusted. This last
   word. There are some persons who are specially diligent in finding out
   reasons why they should not be saved. I have battled with some such by
   the half-hour together and they always finish up with, "Yes, that is
   true, Sir, but"--and then we try and chop that, "but," to pieces.

   But after a while they find another and say, "Yes, I now see that
   point, but"--so they buttress their unbelief with "buts." If anybody
   here should be willing to give you a thousand pounds, can you tell me
   any reason why he should not? Well, I fancy if he were to come to you
   and present you with a bank note for that amount you would not worry
   yourself to discover objections! You would not keep on saying, "I
   should like the money, but"--no, if there were any reason why you
   should not have it, you would let other people find it out. You would
   not labor and cudgel your brains to try and find out arguments against
   yourself--you are not so much your own enemy!

   And yet with regard to eternal life, which is infinitely more precious
   than all the treasures of this world, men act most absurdly and say, "I
   earnestly desire it and Christ is able to do it, but"--What folly is
   this to argue against yourself! If a man were in Newgate, condemned to
   die, and had to stand upon the drop tomorrow morning, and the sheriff
   came and said, "There is a free pardon for you," do you think that man
   would begin to object? Would he cry, "I should like another half-hour
   to consider my case and find out reasons why I should not be pardoned"?
   No, he would jump at it! Oh that you may, also, jump at the pardon
   tonight! The Lord grant that you may feel such a sense of danger and
   guilt that you may promptly cry, "I do believe; I will believe in
   Jesus!"

   Sinners are not half as sensible as sparrows. David said in one of the
   Psalms, "I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the housetop." Well,
   have you noticed the sparrow? He keeps his eyes open and the moment he
   sees a grain of wheat or anything to eat down in the road, he flies to
   get it. I never knew him wait for someone to invite him, much less to
   beg and beseech him to come and feed! He sees the food and he says to
   himself, "Here is a hungry sparrow and there is a piece of bread. Those
   two things go well together--they shall not be long apart." Down he
   flies and eats up all he can find as fast as he finds it!

   Oh, if you had half the sense of the sparrow, you would say, "Here is a
   guilty sinner and there is a precious Savior. These two things go well
   together--they shall not be long apart. I believe in Jesus and Jesus is
   mine." The Lord grant that you may find Jesus, tonight, before you
   leave this house! I pray you may. In these very pews and aisles may you
   look to Jesus Christ and believe! Faith is only a look, a look of
   simple trust! It is reliance, a believing that He is able to do this
   and a trusting in Him to do it and to do it now! God bless every one of
   you and may we meet in Heaven, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Heavenly Wind

   (No. 1356)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, MAY 27, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but
   cannot tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is everyone that
   is born of the Spirit." John 3:8.

   THE Holy Spirit is to be admired, not only for the great Truths of God
   which He teaches us in Holy Scripture, but also for the wonderful
   manner in which those Truths are balanced. The Word of God never gives
   us too much of one thing or too little of another. It never carries a
   doctrine to an extreme, but tempers it with its corresponding doctrine.
   Truth seems to run at least in two parallel lines, if not in three, and
   when the Holy Spirit sets before us one line He wisely points out to us
   the other. The truth of Divine Sovereignty is qualified by human
   responsibility and the teaching of abounding Grace is seasoned by a
   remembrance of unflinching Justice. Scripture gives us, as it were, the
   acid and the alkali--the rock and the oil which flows from it--the
   sword which cuts and the balm which heals.

   As our Lord sent forth His Evangelists two and two so does He seem to
   send out His Truths two and two, that each may help the other for the
   blessing of those who hear them. Now in this most notable third of John
   you have two Truths of God taught as plainly as if they were written
   with a sunbeam and taught side by side. The one is the necessity of
   faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and the fact that whoever believes in
   Him is not condemned. This is a vital doctrine, but there is a
   possibility of preaching it so baldly and so out of relation to the
   rest of God's Word that men may be led into serious error.
   Justification by faith is a most precious Truth of God. It is the very
   pith and heart of the Gospel and yet you can dwell so exclusively upon
   it that you cause many to forget other important practical and
   experimental Truths and so do them serious mischief.

   Salt is good, but it is not all that a man needs to live upon, and even
   if people are fed on the best of dry bread and nothing else they do not
   thrive. Every part of Divine teaching is of practical value and must
   not be neglected. Therefore, the Holy Spirit, in this chapter, lays
   equal stress upon the necessity of the new birth or the work of the
   Holy Spirit and He states it quite as plainly as the other grand Truth
   of God. See how they blend--"You must be born again," but, "whoever
   believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life." "Except a
   man is born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
   kingdom of God," but, "He that believes on Him is not condemned."

   Two great Truths are written in letters of light over the gate of
   Heaven as the requisites of all who enter there-- Reconciliation by the
   blood of Jesus Christ and Regeneration by the work of the Holy Spirit.
   We must not put one of these Truths of God before the other, nor allow
   one to obliterate or hide the other. They are of equal importance, for
   they are revealed by the same Divine Spirit and are both necessary to
   eternal salvation. He who cares to preach either of these ought, also,
   diligently to teach the other, lest he be found guilty of violating
   that salutary precept, "What God has joined together let no man put
   asunder."

   Avoid all neglect of faith and equally shun all undervaluing of the
   work of the Holy Spirit and so shall you find that narrow channel in
   which the way of the Truth of God lies. You must rest in Christ that
   you may be accepted before God, but the work of the Holy Spirit within
   you is absolutely necessary that you may be able to have communion with
   the pure and holy God. Faith gives us the rights of the children of
   God, but the new birth must be experienced that we may have the nature
   of children! Of what use would rights be if we had not the capacity to
   exercise them?

   Now, it is of the work of the Spirit of God and of the man in whom the
   Spirit of God has worked, that I shall speak this morning, according to
   the tenor of the text. The text may be read two ways. First it may
   evidently refer to the Holy Spirit Himself. Do you not expect the text
   to run thus--"The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of
   it, but cannot tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so, also,
   is the Spirit of God"? Is not that the way in which you,

   naturally expect the sentence to end? Yes, and I doubt not that such
   was really the Savior's meaning, but frequently, according to the New
   Testament idiom, the Truth of God is not stated as our English modes of
   speech would lead us to expect.

   For instance, "The kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that sowed good
   seed in his ground." Now the kingdom is not like the man, but like the
   whole transaction of the parable in which the man is the principal
   actor. "The kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchantman seeking goodly
   pearls," but the kingdom is not like the man, but the comparison runs
   into all that the man does. So here the Lord Jesus lays hold of one
   grand sphere of the Spirit's operations and puts it down, intending,
   however, a wider sense. There are certain readings of our text which
   would make this more clear if we could think them allowable, as, for
   instance, that which does not render the Greek word by, "wind," at all,
   but translates it "Spirit," and makes it run, "The Spirit blows where
   He wishes, and you hear the sound of Him." I do not adopt that reading,
   but there are several great authorities in its favor and this tends to
   show that our first head is correct.

   When we have spoken upon that, we will take the language in its second
   sense--in reference to the regenerate man--and then we read, "The wind
   blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell
   from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every man that is born of
   the Spirit." He himself, like the Spirit of which he is born, is free
   and is mysterious in his ways, but discerned by the sound of his works
   and life.

   I. Take the text in reference to THE HOLY SPIRIT HIMSELF. The figure is
   the wind and, as most of you know, the Hebrew word for, "wind," and
   for, "spirit," is the same. And it is interesting to note that the same
   is true with the Greek word, "pneuma," which signifies both, "breath,"
   and, "spirit," so that the figure which the Savior used might very
   naturally grow out of the word which He employed. The wind is air in
   motion and is, of course, material. But air is apparently more
   spiritual than any of the other elements, except fire, since it is not
   to be grasped by the hand nor seen with the eyes.

   It is certain that wind really exists, for we hear the sound of it and
   observe its various effects, but it is not to be touched, handled, or
   gazed upon. Men cannot traffic in it, or measure it in scales, or weigh
   it in balances. We may watch the clouds for hours as they hasten along
   like winged birds, but the wind which drives them is out of our sight.
   We observe the waves roused to fury in the tempest, but the breath
   which so excites them we cannot see. Therefore the word becomes all the
   more excellent a figure of that mighty power, the Holy Spirit, of whose
   existence no man ever doubts who has come under His influence, but who,
   nevertheless, is not to be tracked in His movements, nor to be seen as
   to His Divine Person. He is mysterious, incomprehensible and Divine.

   The metaphor of the wind cannot fully set forth the Holy Spirit, as you
   know, and, consequently, many other natural figures are employed, such
   as fire, dew, water, light, oil and so on, in order to exhibit all the
   phases of His influence. But still, the wind is a most instructive
   metaphor, as far as it goes, and as we cannot draw forth all its
   teaching in one sermon, let us be content to keep as closely as we can
   to the text. First, the wind is a figure of the Holy Spirit in its
   freeness--"the wind blows where it wishes." We speak of the wind as the
   very image of freedom. We say to those who would enthrall us, "go bind
   the winds." As for ourselves, we claim to be "free as the winds which
   roam at their own will." No one can fetter the wind.

   Xerxes threw chains into the Hellespont to bind the sea, but even he
   was not fool enough to talk of forging fetters for the winds! The
   breezes are not to be dictated to. Caesar may decree what he pleases,
   but the wind will blow in his face if he looks that way. The Pope may
   command the gale to change its course, but it will blow around the
   Vatican neither less nor more for the "holy father" and the cardinals.
   A conference of plenipotentiaries from all the powers of Europe may sit
   for a week and resolve unanimously that the east wind shall not blow
   for the next six months, but it will take no heed of the arrangement
   and will cast dust into the counselors' eyes and whistle at their
   wisdom!

   No proclamation nor purpose under Heaven will be able to affect the
   wind by so much as half a point of the compass. It will blow according
   to its own sweet will, where it pleases, when it pleases, how it
   pleases and as it pleases, for "the wind blows where it wishes." So is
   it, only in a far higher and more emphatic sense, with the Holy Spirit,
   for He is most free and absolute! You know that the wind is in the
   hands of God and that He ordains every breeze and each tornado-- winds
   arise and tempests blow by order from the supreme Throne, but as for
   the Holy Spirit, He is God Himself and absolutely free. He works
   according to His own will and pleasure among the sons of men.

   One nation has been visited by the Holy Spirit and not another--who
   shall tell me why? Why do the heathen lands lie in the dense darkness
   while on Britain, the Light of God is concentrated? Why has the
   Reformation taken root in England and among the northern nations of
   Europe, while in Spain and Italy it has left scarcely a trace? Why
   blows the Holy Spirit here and not there? Is it not that He does as He
   wills? "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have
   compassion on whom I will have compassion" is the declaration of the
   Divine Sovereignty--and the Spirit of God, in His movements, confirms
   it.

   Among the nations where the Spirit of God is at work, how is it that He
   blesses one man and not another? Why is it that of two men hearing the
   same sermon and subject to the same influences at home, one is taken
   and the other left? Two children nursed at the same breast and trained
   by the same parents grow up to different ends? He who perishes in sin
   has no one to blame but himself, but he who is saved ascribes it all to
   Divine Grace--why came that Grace to him and not to the other? We never
   dare to lay the fault of man's not repenting and believing upon
   God--that rests with the evil will which refused to obey the
   Gospel--but we dare not ascribe the saving difference in the case of
   the one who believes to any natural goodness in himself! We attribute
   it all to the Grace of God and believe that the Holy Spirit works in
   such to will and to do according to His own good pleasure.

   But why works He in us? Why in any of the chosen? Ah, why? "The wind
   blows where it wishes." So, too, is it with the blessing which rests
   upon ministries. One man wins souls to God and, as a joyous reaper,
   returns with full sheaves. But another who goes forth with strong
   desires and seems to be as earnest as his fellow, comes home with a
   scanty handful of ears which he has painfully gleaned. Why is one man's
   net full of fish and another's utterly empty? One servant of the Lord
   seems, whenever he stands up to preach the Gospel, to attract men to
   Jesus as though he had golden chains in his mouth which he did cast
   about men's hearts to draw them in joyful captivity to his Lord! But
   another cries in bitterness of soul, "Who has believed our report?"
   Truly, "the wind blows where it wishes."

   Yes, and these changes happen to each man differently. One day the
   preacher shall be all alive, his spirit shall be stirred within him and
   he shall speak evidently with the Holy Spirit sent down from Heaven.
   But tomorrow he shall find himself dull and heavy, even to his own
   consciousness and even more so to his people's experience, for the
   power rests not upon him. One day he speaks like the voice of God and
   another day he is but as a reed shaken of the wind. His fat time of
   years gone by are devoured by the lean cattle of the present! He has
   his famine as well as his plenty. You shall see him come forth today
   with the unction of the Lord upon him and his face shining with the
   Glory of fellowship with the Most High! And tomorrow he shall say,
   "Look not upon me, for I am evil," for the glory shall have departed.

   We know what it is to come forth like Samson when his locks were shorn
   and to shake ourselves as at other times and discover that the Lord is
   not with us. Why all this? Is it not because "the wind blows where it
   wishes"? The Holy Spirit, for His own wise reasons, puts not forth an
   equal power upon any man at all times. We cannot control nor command
   the Spirit of the living God! He is, in the highest sense, a free
   agent. "Your Free Spirit" is a name which David gave Him and a most
   appropriate name it is.

   Yet, Beloved, do not fall into a misapprehension. The Holy Spirit is
   absolutely free in His operations, but He is not arbitrary. He does as
   He wills, but His will is Infallible Wisdom. The wind, though we have
   no control over it, has a law of its own, but the Holy Spirit is a law
   unto Himself. He does as He wills, but He wills to do always that which
   is for the best. Moreover, we know, with regard to the wind, that there
   are certain places where you will almost always find a breeze--not
   here, in the teeming city, nor down in the valley shut in by the
   mountains, nor on yonder steaming marsh! But lift up your eyes to the
   hills and mark how the breeze courses along the downs and sweeps the
   summits of the mountain ranges!

   In the morning and the evening, when the inland air is hot as an oven,
   gentle winds come to and from the sea and fan the fishermen's cheeks.
   You may find places where the air seems always stagnant and men's
   hearts grow heavy amid the feverish calm, but there are elevated
   hillsides where life is easy, for the air exhilarates by its perpetual
   freshness. Brothers and Sisters among lively saints, in the use of the
   means of Grace, in private prayer, in communion with the Lord, you will
   find the wind that blows where it wishes always in motion! The wind,
   too, has, at least in some lands, its times and seasons. We know that
   at certain times of the year we may expect winds and if they come not
   to a day or two, yet, as a rule, the month is stormy. And there are,
   also, trade winds, monsoons which blow with remarkable regularity and
   are counted upon by mariners.

   And so with the Spirit of God. We know that at certain times He visits
   the Churches and under certain conditions puts forth His power. If, for
   instance, there is mighty prayer, you may be sure the Spirit of God is
   at work. If the people of God meet together and besiege the Throne of
   Grace with cries and tears, the spiritual barometer indicates that the
   blessed wind is rising. Besides, the Holy Spirit has graciously
   connected Himself with two things, truth and prayer. Preach the Truth
   of God, publish the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and it is the habit of the
   Holy Spirit to make the Word of God quick and powerful to the hearts of
   men. If we falsify His Word, if we keep back part of the Truth of God,
   if we become unfaithful--we cannot expect the Holy Spirit to bless us.

   But if our teaching is Christ Crucified, lovingly set forth, and if the
   Grace of God in its fullness is really declared, the Holy Spirit will
   attend the Truth and make it the great power of God. I will not say
   that it is always and without exception so, but I think exceptions must
   be rare. Almost invariably the Spirit bears witness with the Truth of
   God in the conversion of men. So, too, with prayer. The Holy Spirit is
   pleased to connect Himself with that, also, if it is believing prayer.
   Here the connection is exceedingly intimate because it is the Spirit of
   God who Himself gives the believing prayer and it is not only true that
   the Spirit will be given in answer to prayer, but the Spirit is already
   given or the believing prayer would never have been offered!

   The spirit of prayerfulness, the spirit of anxiety for the conversion
   of men is one of the surest indications that the Holy Spirit is already
   at work in the minds of His people. Coming back, however, to the great
   fact that we cannot command the Holy Spirit, what influence ought that
   Truth of God have upon us? Should it not be just this?--It should lead
   us to be very tender and jealous in our conduct towards the Holy Spirit
   so that we do not grieve Him and cause Him to depart from us. Vex not
   the Spirit! When you enjoy His gracious operations be devoutly grateful
   and walk humbly before God that you may retain them. And when He is at
   work, let not negligence on your part cause you to receive the Grace of
   God in vain.

   The wind blew, but the sailor was asleep. It was a favorable breeze but
   he had cast anchor and his boat moved not. If he had but known it, all
   through the night he would have spread his sail and have made good
   headway towards his port. But he slumbered and the blessed wind
   whistled through the cordage and the ship lay idle at its moorings! Let
   it not be so with us! Never suffer the Spirit of God to be with us and
   find us not aware of His Presence. In the olden times, when country
   people depended more than they do now on the use of windmills to grind
   their corn, some parishes would be half-starved when, week after week,
   there had been no wind. The miller would look up anxiously and
   everybody in the parish would become a watchman for his sails, hoping
   that they would soon be set in motion.

   If the breeze stirred at the dead of night and the miller was sound
   asleep, somebody or other would run and wake him up. "The wind is
   blowing, the wind is blowing, grind our corn." So it ought to be
   whenever the Spirit of God is vigorously working in His Church--we
   should eagerly avail ourselves of His power! We should be so anxious
   for His Divine operations that all should be on the watch, so that if
   some did not discover it, others would, and observant ones would cry,
   "The Holy Spirit is working with us! Let us arise and labor more
   abundantly." Hoist sail when the wind is favorable! You cannot command
   it, therefore carefully value it.

   But we must pass on. The Holy Spirit is described as being like the
   wind as to His manifestations. "You hear," says Jesus, "the sound of
   it." It has been suggested and some have enlarged upon it, that there
   are many other manifestations of the presence of wind--you can feel it,
   you can see its results upon the trees and the waves and sometimes you
   can be sure that the wind has been at work by the devastation which it
   has caused. But in this place our Savior was not so much alluding to a
   great wind as to the gentler breezes. The Greek word, "pneuma," is
   translated, "breath," and can hardly be made to mean a tempest! It was
   a gentle wind like a zephyr of which the Lord was here speaking.

   The great winds, as I have already said, can be somewhat calculated
   upon, but if you sit in the garden in the cool of the evening it is
   utterly impossible for you to tell from where the zephyrs come and
   where they go. They are so volatile in their movements and untrackable
   in their course! They are here, there, everywhere--the soft breezes of
   evening steal among the flowers. Our Lord tells us that such gentle
   zephyrs are heard. Nicodemus, in the stillness of the night could hear
   them. "You hear the sound of it." The leaves rustle and that is all.
   You hear a gentle movement of branch and stem and, as it were, the
   tinkling of flower-bells, and so you discover that the wind is flitting
   among the beds and borders.

   Now, Beloved, this shows us that the hearing ear is intended, by God,
   to be the discerner of the Spirit to men--to the most of men the only
   discerner that they have. "You hear the sound of it." What a wonderful
   dignity the Lord has

   been pleased to put upon this little organ, the ear! The Romish Church
   gives the preference always to the eyes. Her priests are always for
   astonishing men into grace with their wonderful "performances"! But
   God's way is, "Faith comes by hearing," and the first detector of the
   Holy Spirit is the ear. To some men this is the only revealer of His
   mysterious Presence, as I have already said--they hear the sound of it,
   that is to say, they hear the Gospel preached--they hear the Word of
   God read.

   Truth, when it is couched in Words of God, is the rustling of the holy
   wind, it is the footstep of the Eternal Spirit as He mysteriously
   passes along a congregation. Oh, what grief it is that some never get
   any further than this, but abide where Nicodemus was at the first--they
   hear the sound and nothing more. Some of you are now daily hearing the
   Truth of God which has saved thousands, but it does not save you! You
   are hearing the very Truth of God which peoples Heaven, but yet it
   leaves you without a hope of eternal life! Yet be you sure of this, the
   Kingdom of God has come near you. "You hear the sound of it," and that
   wind whose whispers you hear is not far off your own cheeks. When you
   hear the rustling among the branches of the trees, the breezes are not
   far to seek, nor is the Spirit of God far away when His sound is heard.

   Some hearers, however, go further, for they hear the sound of the
   Spirit in their consciences and it disturbs them. They would sleep as
   others do, but as the wind sometimes comes whistling through the
   keyhole or howls down the chimney and wakes the sluggard, or if the man
   is lying in a garden, asleep, the breezes play around his ears and face
   and startle him, so it is with many unconverted people! They cannot be
   quiet, for they hear the sound of the Holy Spirit in their consciences
   and are troubled and perplexed. There is a revival and they are not
   saved, but they are startled and alarmed by it. Their sister is
   converted, they are not, but still it comes very near them and they
   feel as if an arrow had gone whizzing by their own ear. It is hard
   living in a careless state in the midst of revival. "You hear the sound
   of it."

   But some of you, in your conscience, are hearing the sound, now, in
   your family circle, from the fact that one after another of your
   relatives have been brought to know the Lord. You cannot avoid feeling
   that there is something powerful abroad, though it has not yet exerted
   its regenerating power upon you. As for the man who is saved, he hears
   the Holy Spirit in the most emphatic sense and with what variety that
   sound comes to him! At first he heard it as a threatening wind which
   bowed him in sadness and seemed to sweep all his hopes to the ground,
   as the sere leaves of the forest are carried in the autumn's wind.

   When the Spirit's voice sounded in my ears at the first it was as a
   wail of woe, as a wind among the tombs, as a sigh among faded lilies!
   It seemed as if all my hopes were puffed away like smoke, or as the
   night mists in the morning breeze. Nothing was left for me but to mourn
   my nothingness. Then I heard a sound as of the hot south wind of the
   East, as if it issued from a burning oven. You know the text, "The
   grass withers and the flower thereof fades away, because the Spirit of
   the Lord blows upon it: surely the peoples are grass." In my soul there
   had bloomed a fair meadow of golden kingcups and fair flowers of many
   dainty colors, but the Spirit of God blew on them and withered them all
   and left a dry, brown, rusty plain where there was neither life nor
   comeliness.

   So far the sacred wind destroys that which is evil, but it ends not
   there, for we thank God we have heard the sound of the Spirit as a
   quickening wind. The Prophet cried, "Come from the four winds, O
   Breath, and breathe upon these slain that they may live," and the Wind
   came and the dead arose an exceedingly great army! The same miracle has
   been worked on us. The sere bones of our own death have crept together,
   bone unto his bone, and flesh has come upon them and now, because of
   the Divine Breath, we have begun to live! Now, also, when the Holy
   Spirit visits us, He renews our life and energy and gives us life more
   abundantly.

   The Holy Spirit has, since then, been to us full often a melting wind,
   "He causes His wind to blow and the waters flow." Locked up in the
   chains of ice all through the winter, the waters are still as a stone,
   but the spring winds come, the brooks find liberty and leap away to the
   rivers! And the rivers flow in all their free force to add their volume
   to the sea! So has the Spirit of God oftentimes broken up our frost and
   given our spirits joyous liberty. He melts the rocky heart and
   dissolves the iron spirit--at the sound of His goings men are moved to
   feeling. We know the sound of this wind, also, as a diffusive breath,
   drawing forth and diffusing our slumbering graces. "Awake, O north
   wind; and come, you south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof
   may flow out."

   Oh, what a sweet freeing of holy gratitude, love, hope and joy has
   there been in our heart when the Spirit of God has visited us! As sweet
   essences lie hidden in the flowers and come not forth until the loving
   wind does entice them to fly

   abroad and so do sweet Graces lie within renewed spirits until the Holy
   Spirit comes and speaks to them! And they know His voice and come forth
   to meet Him and sweet fragrances are shed abroad. Yes, my Brothers and
   Sisters, all this we know! And we have heard the sound of the Holy
   Spirit in another sense, namely, as going forth with us to the battle
   of the Lord. We have heard that sound of a going in the tops of the
   mulberry trees which David heard and, by God's Grace, we have bestirred
   ourselves and victory has been ours!

   If we have not heard that rushing mighty wind which came at Pentecost,
   yet have we felt its Divine effect, which ceases not, but still brings
   life, power, energy and all that is needed for the conversion of the
   sons of men to us who are bid to go forth and preach the Gospel among
   the nations. In all these respects the Holy Spirit has manifested
   Himself, as wind does, by His sound. "You hear the sound of it." "Their
   sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the
   world."

   A third likeness of the Spirit to the wind is set before us in the
   point of mystery. "You cannot tell from where it comes nor where it
   goes." Of the wind we may tell that it comes from such-and-such a
   quarter or point, but you cannot put your finger on the map and say,
   "The north wind began in this region," or, "here the west wind was
   born." Indeed, we know very little about the winds--their origin or
   their laws. One of the best and most accurate observers of the wind
   during 30 years, recorded every wind in his regions until, at the end
   of the term, he abandoned the few rules which he had laid down during
   the first two or three years, for he found that no rule held good. No
   man can say from where the wind leaps forth.

   The heathen dreamed of a certain cave where the winds were enclosed as
   in a prison and suffered to go abroad one by one--it was but a fable.
   We know not where the winds first spread their wings, or where they
   sleep when all is still. So is it with the Holy Spirit in the mind of
   man. His first movements are hidden in mystery. You know that you are
   converted, my dear Friend, and you know somewhere about the time. And
   you probably remember somewhat as to the means which the Lord used for
   your salvation. Those outward circumstances you know, but how the Holy
   Spirit operated upon you, you do not and cannot tell any more than you
   can tell how the life swells within the seed until it springs up and
   becomes the full corn in the ear, or how the sap in the trees first
   descends in the winter and afterwards climbs, again, in the spring.

   There are secrets which Nature does not reveal--the work of the Spirit
   is even more a secret--and no man can explain it to his fellow or to
   himself. Why is it, my Friend, that you obtained a blessing under one
   sermon but not under another? And why, when you spoke to your sister,
   was she more blessed under the second than the first? The power does
   not come from the preacher, then, it is clear--and "you cannot tell
   from where it comes." There are times in which you feel not only that
   you can pray but that you must pray--how do you come to be in that
   state?

   I know what it is to feel a very ecstasy of delight in the Lord, for
   which I can scarcely account. And, at another time, when I have been
   engaged in the same work and I think with the same earnestness, I have
   not been conscious of any such delight in God! At one time the heart
   will be full of penitence as if it would break because of sin. At
   another season it will overflow with such delight in Christ that the
   sin seems almost forgotten in the pardoning Sacrifice. Why these
   various operations? We know what it is, at times, to feel such a sense
   of death upon us as to be earnestly preparing for our last hours. At
   another time we seem to be altogether forgetful of death and to be
   living, as it were, the immortal life already, raised up together and
   made to sit together with Christ!

   But how these various modes and forms and workings of the Spirit come,
   who among us shall tell? Go trace the dewdrops, if you can, to the womb
   of the morning, and discover which way the lightning flashes went, or
   how the thunder rolled along the mountain tops! But you cannot tell nor
   can you guess from where comes the Spirit of God into your souls! Nor
   can we tell where He goes. Here, again, is another mystery. Oh, it
   charms me to think that when we let loose the Truth of God in the power
   of the Spirit we never know where it will fly! A child takes a seed,
   one of those little downy seeds which has its own parachute to bear it
   through the air. The little one blows it into the air, but who knows
   where that downy seed shall settle and in whose garden it shall grow?

   Such is the Truth of God, even from the mouths of babes and sucklings.
   Whole continents have been covered with strange flowers simply by the
   wind blowing foreign seeds there! Mariners have discovered sunny islets
   out there in the Southern Sea where foot of man has never trod, yet
   covered with abundance of vegetation which the wind has, by degrees,
   blown there! Scatter the Truth of God on all sides, for you cannot tell
   where the Spirit will carry it! Fling it to

   the winds and you shall find it after many days. Scatter the living
   Seed with both hands--send it north, south, east, and west--and God
   will give it wings!--

   "Float, float you winds the Story,

   And you, you waters roll,

   Till like a sea of Glory

   It spreads from pole to pole."

   I had a letter but the other day when I was sorely sick. It was written
   by a Sister in Christ in the very heart of the empire of Brazil. She
   said that she had met with a copy of my, "Morning Readings," and had
   found, thereby, the way of peace and, therefore, she wrote me such a
   loving, touching letter that, as I read it, it brought tears to my
   eyes. There was something more affecting yet, for at the end was
   written in another hand, some words to the effect that his dear wife
   who had written the above letter had died soon after finishing it, and
   with a bleeding heart the lone husband sent it on to me, rejoicing that
   the Word of God came to his wife's soul in the far-off land.

   Brethren, you do not know where the Word will go and the Spirit with
   it! In Bohemia the papists thought they had stamped out the Gospel and
   with cruel edicts they kept down all thought of Protestantism. But just
   lately, since the Toleration, the Gospel has been preached in that
   country and, to the surprise of everybody there, men and women have
   come forward from lone cottages in the woods and from different corners
   of the great cities of Bohemia, bringing with them ancient copies of
   the Word of God, themselves being eager to know the precious Truths of
   God for which they remember that their fathers died!

   A Truth of God will go down the centuries--like the river, it sings--

   "Men may come and men may go, But I go on forever."

   "You can not tell where it goes," it will travel on till the
   millennium! Send that saying abroad that the Truth of God cannot die!
   The persecutor cannot kill it, it is immortal like the God who sent it
   forth! The persecutor cannot even stay its course! It is Divine! Popery
   will always be in danger so long as there is one leaf of the Bible upon
   earth, or one man living who knows the Savior! Antichrist cannot
   triumph! The Holy Spirit wars against it with the sword of the Word of
   God and you cannot tell how far into the heart of error any Truth may
   be driven. To the overthrow of falsehood and the death of sin, the
   Spirit speeds on, but you know not how. "You cannot tell where it
   goes."

   If you have received the Holy Spirit into your heart, you cannot tell
   where He will carry you. I am sure that William Carey, when he gave his
   young heart to Christ, never thought the Spirit of God would carry him
   to Serampore to preach the Gospel to the Hindus! And when George
   Whitefield first drank of the life-giving Spirit, it never occurred to
   him that the pot-boy at the Bell Inn at Gloucester would thunder the
   Gospel over two continents and turn thousands to Christ! You know not
   to what blessed end this Wind will take you!

   Commit yourselves to it--be not disobedient to the heavenly vision. Be
   ready to be borne along as the Spirit of God shall help you, even as
   the dust in the summer's breeze. And O child of God, you do not know to
   what heights of holiness and degrees of knowledge and ecstasies of
   enjoyment the Spirit of God will bear you. "Eye has not seen nor ear
   heard the things which God has prepared for them that love Him," and
   though He has revealed them by His Spirit (for the Spirit searches all
   things, even the deep things of God), yet even to the best taught child
   of God it is not yet known, to the fullest, where the Spirit of God
   goes.

   "Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah there is
   everlasting strength," and He will bear you onward and upward, even to
   perfection, itself, and you shall be with Jesus, where He is, and
   behold His Glory!

   II. I have but a few minutes left for my second head, but I do not need
   many, since I do not wish to say much upon it.

   The text relates TO THOSE WHO ARE BORN OF THE SPIRIT. "The wind blows
   where it wishes, and you hear the

   sound of it, but cannot tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so
   is everyone that is born of the Spirit." The birth partakes of the
   nature of the parent. That which is born of the Spirit is like unto the
   Spirit of which it is born, even as that which is born of the flesh is
   flesh and is similar to the flesh by which it is begotten.

   The twice-born man is like the Holy Spirit who produced him, and he is
   like He in each of the points which we have already dwelt upon. As to
   freedom, you may say of him, "He blows where he wishes." The Spirit of
   God makes the Believer a free man, bestows on him the freedom of his
   will which he never had before. He gives him a delightful consciousness
   of liberty. "If the Son makes you free, you shall be free, indeed." I
   do not affirm that every spiritual man

   does as he wishes, because, alas, I see another law in our members
   warring against the law of our mind and bringing us into captivity to
   the law of sin and death. But still, "where the Spirit of the Lord is,
   there is liberty."

   Now you can pray, which you could not do before. Now you can praise,
   though before you could not extract a note of praise from your
   ungrateful heart. Now you can cry, "Abba, Father." Now you can draw
   near to God. You are no longer under man's control, you go where you
   wish. You are not now ruled by priestcraft, nor domineered over by the
   opinion of your fellow man. The Lord has set you free and you wish to
   go where God's Word bids you go. And you find the utmost liberty in
   going that way. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, I cannot tell you the change
   which is felt by a regenerate man in the matter of spiritual liberty!
   When you were under the bondage of the law of custom and of sin, and of
   fear of death and dread of Hell, you were like a man shut up in one of
   those cells in Venice which lie below the level of the water mark,
   where the air is foul and the poor prisoner can only stir half-a-dozen
   feet and then walk back again in the darkness.

   But when the Spirit of God comes, He brings the soul from darkness into
   light, from clammy damp into the open air! He sets before you an open
   door. He helps you to run in the ways of God's commands and, as if that
   were not enough, He even lends you wings and bids you mount as the
   eagle, for He has set you free! Again, the man who is born of the
   Spirit is somewhat manifested and is known by his sound. "You hear the
   sound of it." The most ungodly man, if he lives near a Christian, will
   hear the sound of him. The secret life within will speak words, for
   Christians are not dumb. But actions will speak more loudly, still! And
   even apart from actions, the very spirit and tone of the man who is
   really regenerated will speak and the ungodly man will be compelled to
   hear it. "You hear the sound of it."

   And now notice the mystery there is about a Christian. You know
   nothing, if you are unregenerate, about the life the Believer leads,
   for he is dead and his life is hid with Christ in God. You know not
   from where he comes forth in the morning--those beds of spices which
   have made his garments fragrant, you have not seen. That weeping in
   prayer or that rejoicing in fellowship with which he opened the morning
   you know nothing of--and you cannot know until you are, yourself--born
   of the Spirit! Neither can you tell where the spiritual man goes. In
   the midst of his trouble you see him calm. Do you know where he went to
   win that rare quietude? In the hour of death you see him triumphant! Do
   you know where he has been to learn to die so joyously?

   No, the unregenerate man knows not where the Believer goes. There is a
   secret place of the Most High and they shall abide under the shadow of
   the Almighty who have once learned to enter there, but carnal men come
   not into this secret chamber. The Christian life is a mystery all
   through, from its beginning to its end. To the worldling it is all a
   mystery and, to the Christian, himself, a puzzle. He cannot read his
   own riddle, nor understand himself. This one thing he knows, "Whereas I
   was once blind, now I see." This, also, he knows, "O Lord, I am Your
   servant! I am Your servant and the son of Your handmaid: You have
   loosed my bonds." This, also, he knows, that when his Lord shall be
   revealed, then will he, also, shine forth as the sun!

   The Life within him, in its coming and going, is all a mystery to him,
   but he blesses God that he has fellowship in it. He goes on his way
   feeling that though men know not from where he is, nor where he is
   going, yet the Lord knows him, and he, himself is sure that he is going
   to his Father and his God! O that every one of you had so delightful a
   hope! The Lord grant it to you, for Jesus' sake.

A Business-Like Account

   (No. 1357)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 3, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yet
   indeed, I also count all things loss for the excellency of the
   knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of
   all things, and count them but dung, that Imay win Christ, and be found
   in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that
   which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God
   by faith." Philippians 3:7-9.

   OUR Savior's advice to those who wished to be His disciples was, "Count
   the cost." He did not wish to entice any man to enlist in His army by
   keeping him in ignorance as to the requirements of His service. Again
   and again He tested professed converts Himself--and He frequently
   exhorted men to try themselves, lest they should begin a profession and
   be unable to maintain it. True religion is a matter of enthusiasm, but
   at the same time its Truths and precepts can endure the severest
   examination. The exercise of our judgments upon the Gospel is invited,
   yes, required! It is true that many persons are brought to Christ in
   earnest assemblies, where they are addressed in fervent language. But
   also, a man may sit down in his study or his counting house with his
   pen in his hand, and in the coolest possible manner he may calculate
   and, if under the Holy Spirit's guidance, he shall be led to calculate
   truthfully--he will come to the conclusion that the cause of the Lord
   Jesus is worthiest and best.

   Do not imagine, as some do, that religion consists in a wild fanaticism
   which never considers, calculates, judges, estimates, or ponders--for
   such an imagination will be the reverse of the truth. Ardor, fervor,
   enthusiasm--these are desirable and we cannot have too much of
   them--but at the same time, as I have already said, we can justify our
   attachment to Christ by the most calm logic, by the most patient
   consideration. We may make a lengthy and deliberate estimate, taking
   both things temporal and things eternal into review, and yet we may
   challenge all gainsayers while we declare that it is the wisest and the
   best thing in all the world to be a disciple of Jesus Christ!

   In our text the Apostle gives us the word, "count," three times over.
   He was skilled in spiritual arithmetic and very careful in his
   reckoning. He cast up his accounts with caution and observed with a
   diligent eye his losses and his gains. In his reckoning he does not
   ignore any losses that may be supposed to be sustained, or really may
   be sustained. But he does not, on the other hand, forget for a moment
   that blessed gain for which he counts it worthwhile to suffer
   surprising loss. Paul, here, seems to be in a mercantile frame of mind,
   adding and subtracting, counting and balancing, with much quiet and
   decision of mind.

   I commend the text to businessmen. I invite them to follow the
   Apostle's example, to use their best judgments upon eternal things, to
   sit down, take out their pen and figure as he did, and make out
   estimates and calculations as to themselves and Christ, their own works
   and the righteousness of faith. The subject this morning will be,
   first, the Apostle's calculations and, secondly, our own. The objective
   being, in the second part, to put questions to ourselves as to whether
   we estimate things after the Apostolic fashion.

   I. First, then, let us consider THE APOSTLE'S CALCULATIONS. Looking at
   the text, you will notice that he made three distinct counts. They all
   came to much the same thing, with this difference, that each one, as it
   succeeded its fellow, was more emphatic in its result. The result was
   the same, but it was more and more forcibly expressed. And, first, we
   have his counting at the outset of his Christian life. When he became a
   Believer, he says of himself, "what things were gain to me, those I
   counted loss for Christ." That is to say, at the first and earliest
   period when, from being Saul the Rabbi, the intense Pharisee, he became
   Paul the convert and the preacher of the faith which once he destroyed,
   those

   things which had seemed very splendid gains all dissolved into one
   great loss. At that time he says he made a calculation and formed a
   deliberate opinion that what had appeared to him to be most
   advantageous was really, so far as Christ was concerned, a positive
   disadvantage and hindrance to him--the gains were a loss.

   Now, you will notice that in this first calculation he dwelt upon the
   separate items, noting each with great distinctness. The list of the
   things of which he might glory in the flesh reads like a catalog.
   "Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of
   Benjamin, an Hebrew of Hebrews. As touching the Law, a Pharisee.
   Concerning zeal, persecuting the Church. Touching the righteousness
   which is in the Law, blameless." These are the things which were gains
   to him and the list is very comprehensive, beginning at his birth and
   circumcision and running right on to the date of his conversion.

   He dwells with a high degree of interest upon the items of his Jewish
   advantages. They had been as precious pearls to him, once, and while he
   freely renounces them, yet he remembers that they were once dear as the
   apple of his eye. They had been his pride, his patent of nobility and
   his daily boast. He felt himself to be, in these respects, far in
   advance of the most of mankind and second to none, even of his favored
   race, for even now he says, "If any other man thinks that he has
   whereof he might trust in the flesh, I have more." "Circumcised the
   eighth day"--the rite which introduced him to the outward Covenant of
   Abraham had been performed exactly when ordained by the Law--he was not
   one who had been circumcised as proselytes were, late in life, nor at
   an irregular season on account of ill health, traveling, or parental
   neglect. But to the moment as the Mosaic ritual required, he had, as a
   baby, been received into the congregation of Israel.

   Next, he was of "the stock of Israel." He was not one who had been
   converted to the Israelite faith, nor a descendant of Gibeonites or of
   proselyted parents--he was of the pure stock of Israel, descended by a
   clear line which, probably, he was able, genealogically, to trace from
   that Israel who was a prevailing prince with God. He was proud of this
   descent and well he might be, for every Jew is of noble lineage. Speak
   of ancient families who can match the seed of Israel! Theirs is the
   best blood in the universe, if one blood is better than another.

   Paul, also, boasted that he was "of the tribe of Benjamin"--the tribe
   which Moses called the Beloved of the Lord! The tribe within whose
   canton the temple stood! The tribe which was descended from the beloved
   wife of Jacob, even Rachel, and not from the sons of either of the
   bondwomen. The tribe of Benjamin was that from which the first king of
   Israel was chosen and he bore the same name as that by which Paul had
   been known among his Jewish brethren. Paul was, therefore, of the very
   choicest branch of that vine which the Lord, Himself, brought out of
   Egypt.

   He next adds that he was a "Hebrew of the Hebrews." He was the cream of
   the cream, the very pick and choice out of the choice nation and the
   elect people. If there was any benefit to be had by being of the seed
   of Abraham, the Hebrew, he had all that benefit in the highest possible
   degree. Then he had appended to all the advantages of birthright and of
   nationality that of entering into a peculiar sect, the most orthodox,
   the most devout--for "as touching the Law, he was a Pharisee," and
   belonged to the sect which attached importance to the minutest details
   of the Law and tithed its mint and its anise, and its cumin. What more
   could he be?

   He was a Jesuit among the Catholics, one who went to the extreme among
   extremists, one of those initiated into the innermost secrets of the
   faith! Then, as to personal character, he felt that here, in his
   natural state, he had something which was gain, for he was so full of
   zeal that those who appeared to speak against the Law of Moses by
   declaring the Gospel were counted as his enemies. He hunted them down
   with all his might--"concerning zeal, persecuting the Church." This he
   had done in all honesty of purpose as the result of his thorough
   self-righteousness. He finishes by saying that he, himself, was, as to
   every detail of the Law, every little point of ritual and every
   particular rubric, altogether blameless. This was no small thing to
   say, but he spoke no more than the truth. These things all put together
   are what he counted gains, (for the Greek word is in the plural), and I
   think he dwells somewhat lingeringly upon each separate point, as very
   well he might, for they had been very dear to him in former days. And
   these privileges were, in themselves, things of no mean worth.

   But now, what was to be set on the other side? Here is a long list on
   one side, what is to be placed per contra? He says, "What things were
   gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.''" What? What? Nothing on
   the other side but one item? One? Only one? And yet there were so many
   privileges on the other side! There was but one name, one Person in
   that scale, while in the other there were so many advantages! Why, one
   begins to think that the calculation will soon come to an end in favor
   of Saul's Israelite descent and the rest of it! But not so--the One
   outweighed the many! Here I

   want you to notice that Paul does not say that those he counted loss
   for Christianity, or for the Church, or for the orthodox faith. There
   would have been truth in such a statement, but the center of the truth
   lies here--he counted these things loss for Christ, that is, for the
   Lord Jesus Christ Himself! He thought of that Divine One, blessed be
   His name, that Brother of our souls who was born at Bethlehem, the
   Kinsman, Redeemer of His people--Christ! The living, loving, bleeding,
   dying, buried, risen, ascended, glorified Christ! This was the glorious
   Person whom he placed on the other side of the balance sheet!

   And now see the result. He says, "What things were gain to me, those I
   counted loss." An amazing result. Not only that after putting the one
   under the other and making a subtraction, he found that all his carnal
   advantages were less than Christ, but, far more than this! He found
   those gains actually transformed into a loss! They were not a plus on
   that side to stand in proportion to the plus on this side--but they
   were turned into a minus of actual deficit! He felt that his fleshly
   advantages, when he came to look at them in regard to Christ, were
   disadvantages and what he had reckoned to be gains operated rather
   against him than for him when he began to know Christ!

   My Brothers and Sisters, he does not mean that to be a "Hebrew of the
   Hebrews" was, in itself, a loss, nor that to be of the stock of Israel
   was a loss, for there was a natural advantage about all this. "What
   advantage, then, has the Jew?" he says in another place. And he
   replies, "Much every way." But he meant that with respect to Christ,
   those things which were naturally an advantage became a disadvantage
   because their tendency had been to keep him from trusting Christ. And
   their tendency was still to tempt him away from simple faith in Jesus.
   "Alas," he seemed to say to himself, "it was because I gloried that I
   was of the stock of Israel that I rejected the Christ of God! It was
   because I boasted that as touching the Law I was blameless that,
   therefore, I refused to accept the glorious righteousness of Jesus
   Christ by faith. These advantages were scales upon my eyes to keep me
   from seeing the beauty of my Lord! These privileges were stumbling
   blocks in my way to prevent my coming as a poor, humble, needy sinner
   and laying hold on the atoning Sacrifice of Jesus."

   My Brothers and Sisters, it is a grand thing to have led a virtuous
   life. It is a matter for which to praise God to have been kept in the
   very center of the paths of morality. But this blessing may, by our own
   folly, become a curse to us if we place our moral excellences in
   opposition to the righteousness of our Lord Jesus and begin to dream
   that we have no need of a Savior! If our character is, in our own
   esteem, so good that it makes a passable garment for us and, therefore,
   we reject the robe of Christ's righteousness, it would have been better
   for us if our character had been, by our own confession, a mass of
   rags--for then we should have been willing to be clothed with the
   vesture which Divine Love has prepared!

   Yes, it were better, so far as this matter is concerned, to be like the
   open sinner who will not readily be tempted that way because he is too
   foul, too bankrupt to pretend to be righteous before God! I say again,
   Paul does not say that these things are not advantages, but that for
   Christ--and when he comes to look at them in the light of Christ--he
   regards them as being a loss rather than a gain! If I had, this day a
   righteousness of my own, yet would I fling it to the winds to lay hold
   of the righteousness of Christ, fearing all the while lest so much as
   the smell of it should cling to my hands! Had I never sinned in one
   solitary open sin and if but one secret transgression of my heart had
   ever been committed, yet would I loathe my righteousness as filthy rags
   and only tremble lest my proud spirit should be so foolish as to cling
   to such a useless thing! Adam fell through one sin and lost Paradise,
   and lost us all--so that one sin suffices to curdle the purest
   righteousness into utter sourness. Away, then, with the very shadow of
   self and legal righteousness!

   But let us now proceed to notice that Paul gives us his second
   calculation, which is his estimate for the time then present. "Yet
   indeed," he says, "I also count"--not, "I counted"--as he said before,
   but, "I also count all things loss for the excellency of the knowledge
   of Christ Jesus my Lord." We are always anxious to hear what a man has
   to say about a thing after he has tried it. It is all very well to
   begin with eagerness, but how does the venture answer after a trial?
   After 20 years or more of experience, Paul had an opportunity of
   revising his balance sheet and, looking again at his estimates and
   seeing whether or not his count was correct.

   What was the result of his latest search? How do matters stand at his
   last stock-taking? He exclaims with very special emphasis, "Yet indeed,
   I also count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of
   Christ Jesus my Lord." The two words, "Yet indeed," are a very strong
   affirmation. He is speaking very positively as to his present confirmed
   assurance and established judgment. Look at him, then, again, making
   his estimate today, after he has been, for some time, a

   Christian and has been made to suffer as the result of his earnest
   service. You perceive that He has not forgotten the things that were
   gains, for, as we have already seen, he has given us a detailed list of
   them.

   On this second occasion he does not repeat the catalog, partly because
   there was no need for it and partly because he cares less for each
   item. But mainly because, for fear anything should have been omitted,
   he succinctly sums up the whole by saying, "all things." He as good as
   says--yet indeed, I also count as loss all the advantages of birth,
   nationality and self-righteousness which once I reckoned to be gains.
   If I have left out anything of which, as an Israelite I might have
   gloried, I beg you to insert it in the list, for I mean that all should
   be included when I say that I count all things loss for Christ's sake.

   So you see he has not altered the original summary. He has even made it
   more comprehensive--but he stands to the same estimate as always--the
   gain is still "loss." But we perceive that now he dwells longer and
   evidently with greater delight of expression upon the other side, for
   now he uses not barely the word, "Christ," but the fuller expression,
   "for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord." Now he
   has come to know the Christ in whom before he trusted. He spoke of Him,
   before, as one for whom he counted gain as loss, but now he perceives
   so great an excellency in Him that even to know Him he reckons to be a
   supereminent blessing! Our Divine Lord is better loved as He is better
   known! The closer our inspection, the greater is the manifest
   excellency of His Character.

   The words used by the Apostle show us the points upon which he had the
   fullest knowledge. He knew the Lord as Christ, or as the Messiah, sent
   and anointed of the Father. He understood more fully than at the first,
   the fullness, power and exceeding efficacy of the anointing of our Lord
   which He had received above His fellows. He saw Him to be the woman's
   promised Seed, the Coming One, the promised Light of Israel, the
   ordained Prince and Savior of the sons of men! And he saw all His
   qualifications for this wonderful Character! He perceived His anointing
   as Prophet, Priest and King. He delighted to see the Spirit of the Lord
   resting upon Him and descending from Him to His people, as the sacred
   oil from the head of Aaron distilled to the skirts of his garments.

   He saw great excellency in the knowledge of the Lord's Anointed, whose
   garments smell of myrrh, aloes and cassia. But this was not all, for he
   proceeds to call Jesus, Christ Jesus. "You shall call His name Jesus;
   for He shall save His people from their sins." Paul knew Him as the
   anointed Savior, yes, as the actual Savior who had saved him--saved him
   from the madness for his blasphemy and persecution, saved him from all
   his past guilt--saved him and made him to be an instrument of the
   salvation of others. He delights in the title of Savior, as we all do
   who know the savor of it. How sweetly musical is the name of Jesus! How
   fragrant is it, even as ointment poured forth! Excellent, indeed, is
   the knowledge of our Lord in this Character!

   How delicious are the Apostle's next words, "my Lord." Not merely the
   Lord, but, "my Lord." His knowledge was an appropriating knowledge. He
   knew the Redeemer as anointed for him, as saving him, as Lord over all
   for him and now, as Lord to him. The honey of the sentence lies in that
   word, "my." I do not know how it seems to your hearts, but to me it is
   one of the sweetest words that can possibly be used by mortal lips,
   "the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord." Whether He is your Lord or
   not, He is surely mine! Whether He is accepted as Lord by the sons of
   men or not, He is joyfully acknowledged as Lord to me and Master of my
   spirit, sole Monarch of my whole nature-- "Christ Jesus my Lord."

   You see, then, how truly, fully, practically and personally he knew the
   Lord Jesus. The text implies that he knew Him by faith. He had seen Him
   in the flesh, but in that he did not glory, for he had now come to
   value only the things of faith, desiring mainly that the righteousness
   which is of God, by faith, might be imputed unto him. He believed, and
   therefore he knew. There is no knowledge so gracious as the knowledge
   of faith, for a man may know a great deal in a natural way and yet
   perish, but that which comes of faith is saving. If a man only knows
   Christ in the head, but does not trust Him with the heart, what is the
   good of His knowledge? It will rather ruin than save him. So to know
   the Lord Jesus Christ as to lean your soul's full weight upon Him. To
   know Him as to experience peace because you trust in Him. To know Him
   as to feel that you can rest in Him more and more, from day to day,
   because He is all your salvation and all your desire-- this is to know
   Him, indeed!

   But Paul also knew the Lord by experience, for he speaks of knowing Him
   and "the power of His resurrection." This is excellent knowledge,
   indeed, when the power of a fact is realized within and shown in the
   life. When we are raised from the death of our sin and feel that we are
   so, then is our knowledge of the risen Christ excellent, indeed. When
   we feel a new life within us, quickening us unto spiritual things, and
   know that this springs from the Resurrection of our Lord

   and is worked in us according to the mighty power which raised Jesus
   Christ from the dead, then, indeed, can we rejoice in the excellency of
   the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord!

   More than that, Paul knew something of Christ and was aiming to know
   more by a growing likeness to Him. "That I may know Him and the
   fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable unto His death."
   He had entered, in some measure, into his Master's sufferings. He had
   been persecuted and despised of men for much the same reason as his
   Master. He had, in a degree, felt Christ's motives, Christ's love for
   man, Christ's zeal for God, Christ's self-sacrifice, Christ's readiness
   to die on behalf of the Truth of God. This is an excellent knowledge,
   indeed, and Paul might well esteem it as far more precious than all
   legal privileges. He spoke of it as supereminent knowledge, for such is
   his meaning, and he reckoned it to be beyond all price.

   Beloved, there is no knowledge in the world which can be compared with
   such a knowledge of Christ Jesus as I have tried to describe just now,
   for it is a knowledge which concerns the highest conceivable
   objective--even the Son of God! To know the science of Nature, to be
   familiar with rocks, to read the stars, to comprehend all things
   besides is a comparative trifle when we consider what it is to know God
   in the Person of the Lord Jesus! He in whom dwells all the fullness of
   the Godhead bodily is most worthy to be known--and angels and
   principalities unite with all the saints in thinking so! One truth
   about Christ is more precious than the total of all other knowledge!
   This is a knowledge which no man has unless it is given him by the Holy
   Spirit--and therefore is excellence.

   We may say to all who know Christ, "Flesh and blood has not revealed
   this unto you." Divinely taught must he be who has learned Christ. This
   science cannot be acquired in schools nor imparted by learned
   professors, nor even gathered by years of diligent research. To the
   heart, renewed by the Holy Spirit, the Lord Jesus must be revealed by
   the Spirit, Himself, for no man can say that Jesus Christ is Lord but
   by the Holy Spirit! That is a superlative knowledge which requires, in
   each case, to be communicated by God, Himself. If you would see the
   excellency of this knowledge, look at its effects. Some knowledge puffs
   up, but this knowledge makes us humble and the more we have of it the
   less are we in our own esteem.

   This knowledge sanctifies, purges and delivers from the love of sin. It
   saves the soul--saves it from present sin and from eternal woe. This
   knowledge elevates the motives, sweetens the feelings and gives
   nobility to the entire life, for the man who knows Christ lives after a
   loftier order of life than those who are ignorant of Him. This
   knowledge. indeed, Beloved, is excellent because it can never be
   lost--it is a knowledge which will continue to progress, even in
   eternity! The most of the subjects which mortals study here will be
   forgotten in the world to come. The most profound of them will be too
   trifling to be pursued amid angelic thrones. The honors of classical
   and mathematical attainments will shine but dimly amidst the glories of
   Heaven. But the knowledge of Christ Jesus will still be priceless and
   it will cause those who possess it to shine as the sun! He that knows
   Christ shall go on to sit at His feet and to learn--and as he learns,
   he will tell to principalities and powers the manifold wisdom of God in
   the Person of Jesus Christ!

   See, then, Beloved, that the Apostle, for the sake of the knowledge of
   Christ Jesus His Lord, still counted all the things that he had once
   gloried in to be but loss. This was his calculation when he was
   writing. It was not merely the estimate of his younger days, but it was
   his present renewed and confirmed judgment. My Friends, is it ours? The
   great Apostle gives us a third counting which may be regarded as his
   life estimate. Not of the past only, nor of the present merely, but of
   the past and present inclusively. Here it is, "For whom I have suffered
   the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win
   Christ, and be found in Him."

   Here, Beloved, you see that his estimate sets out with actual test and
   practical proof. He is sitting down, I suppose, in the guard room of
   the Praetorian at Rome where he was a prisoner. He has chains on his
   wrists and if he likes, he needs no blotting paper, but may powder his
   writing with the rust of his fetters. He has nothing in all the world.
   He has lost all his old friends. His relations disown him, His
   countrymen abhor him and even his Christian Brothers and Sisters often
   distress him. No name made the Jew gnash his teeth more maliciously
   than did the name of Saul of Tarsus who was adjudged to be the vilest
   of renegades! He has lost caste and lost all ground of glorying. He
   has, no longer, a righteousness of his own wherein to glory, but is
   stripped of every rag of legal hope.

   Christ is his All and he has nothing else. He has no worldly property.
   He has no provision for his most common needs and most true are his
   words as he writes--"For whom I have suffered the loss of all things."
   Let us enter the prison and put a personal question to the good man.
   Paul, your faith has brought you to absolute penury and friendlessness.
   What is

   your estimate of it now? Theory is one thing, but does practice bear it
   out? The sea looks smooth as glass, but seafaring is more pleasant to
   talk of than to practice. The embarking was a fine spectacle, but what
   do you think of a sea voyage when the storm rages? What about it, Paul?

   "Well," he says, "I confess I have suffered the loss of all things."
   And do you deeply regret it, Paul? "Regret it?" he asks, "regret the
   loss of my Phariseeism, my circumcision, my Israelite dignity? Regret
   it? No," he says, "I am glad that all these are gone, for I count it to
   be a deliverance to be rid of them." In his first and second counts he
   called his former gains loss, but now he sets them down as dung. He
   could not use a stronger word! He calls all his boasts in the flesh
   mere offal--something to get rid of and no loss when it is gone--but
   rather a subject for congratulation that it is removed from him. The
   word signifies that which is worthless and is used to express the lees
   and dregs of wine, the settlement which a man finds in his cup and
   drains out upon the ground when he has drunk his liquor, the refuse of
   fruit, the dross of metals and the chaff and stubble of wheat.

   In fact, the root of the word signifies things cast to dogs--dog's
   meat, bones from the plates, crumbs and stale pieces brushed from the
   table--and such things as one is anxious to be rid of. The Apostle puts
   down the whole of the fine things which he had enumerated as no better
   than dung. "Of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew
   of the Hebrews," he shakes out the whole lot for the dogs and is glad
   to be rid of it all for Christ's sake! It reminds me of a ship in a
   storm. When the captain leaves the harbor, he has a cargo on board of
   which he takes great care to protect. But when a tremendous wind is
   blowing and the ship labors, being too heavily laden--and there is
   great fear that she will not ride out the storm--see how eagerly the
   sailors lighten the ship!

   They bring up from the hold, with all diligence, the very things which
   before they prized! And they seem rejoiced to heave them into the sea!
   Never were men more eager to get, than these are to throw away! There
   go the casks of flour, the bars of iron, the manufactured goods.
   Overboard go valuable bales of merchandise. Nothing seems to be worth
   keeping! Why is this? Are these things not good? Yes, but not good to a
   sinking ship! Anything must go to save life, anything to ride out the
   storm. And so the Apostle says that in order to win Christ and to be
   found in Him, he flung the whole cargo of his beloved confidences
   overboard and was as glad to get rid of them as if they were only so
   much dung! This he did to win Christ--and that fact suggests another
   picture.

   An English warship of the olden times is cruising the ocean and she
   spies a Spanish galleon in the distance laden with gold from the
   Indies. Captain and men are determined to overtake and capture her, for
   they have a relish for prize money, but their vessel sails heavily.
   What then? If she will not move because of her load, they fling into
   the sea everything they can lay their hands on, knowing that if they
   can capture the Spanish vessel the booty will make amends for all they
   lose and vastly more! Do you wonder at their eagerness to lose the
   little to gain the great? Sailor, why cast overboard those useful
   things? "Oh," he says, "they are nothing compared with that prize over
   yonder. If we can but get side by side and board her we will soon make
   up for all that we now throw into the sea."

   And so it is with the man who is in earnest to win Christ and to be
   found in Him. Overboard go circumcision and Phariseeism and the
   blamelessness touching the Law and all that, for he knows that he will
   find a better righteousness in Christ than any which he foregoes, yes,
   find everything in Christ which he now, for his Lord's sake, counts but
   as the slag of the furnace! Now, Beloved, notice how much nearer Paul
   had got to Christ than he was before, for in his second estimate he
   spoke of knowing Him, but now he speaks of winning Him for his own. The
   word meant and should have been translated, "gain"--"that I may gain
   Christ"--for the Apostle keeps to the mercantile figures all the way
   through and means that I may gain Christ and know Him as my own. That I
   may have Him and hold Him and sing with the spouse "My Beloved is
   mine." For this cause we may wisely count all things but dung, that we
   may have the Lord Jesus in everlasting possession!

   Then Paul adds, "and be found in Him." He longs to be hidden in Jesus
   and to abide in Him as a bird in the air, or a fish in the sea. He
   pants to be one with Christ and so to be in Him as a member is in the
   body. He desires to get into Christ as a fugitive shelters himself in
   his hiding place. He aspires to be so in Christ as never to come out of
   Him, so that whenever anyone looks for Jesus, he may find him in Jesus,
   and that when the Great Judge of All calls for him at the Last Great
   Day, He may find him in Christ! It would be ill to be found where Adam
   was, shivering under the trees of the garden with his fig leaves. But
   to be found beneath the Tree of Life, wearing the robe of His
   righteousness--this will be

   bliss, indeed! We are lost out of Christ but we are found in Him! Once
   met with by the Great Shepherd, we are found by Him, but when safely
   folded in His love, we are found in Him.

   Notice how Paul sticks to what he began with, namely, the unrobing
   himself of his sins in the flesh and His aligning himself with Christ.
   He desires to be found in Christ, but he adds, "not having my own
   righteousness, which is of the Law." No, he will have nothing to do
   with that. He has already despised it as loss and thrown it overboard
   as dross. Now he will not have it or call it his own at all. It is
   strange for a man to say, "not having my own," but he does. He disowns
   his own righteousness as eagerly as other men disown their sins and he
   highly esteems the righteousness which Christ has worked out for us,
   which becomes ours by faith! He calls it "the righteousness which is of
   God by faith," and he sets great store by it. Yes, it is all he
   desires.

   My Brothers and Sisters, this is the thing we ought to be seeking
   after--to be more and more conscious that we have Christ, to abide in
   Him more continually, to be more like He is, even in His sufferings and
   in His death, and to feel the full power of His resurrection-life
   within ourselves. May God grant us Grace to do this, and the more we do
   it the more we shall coincide with the Apostle in his slight esteem for
   everything else. This matter is like a balance, if one scale goes down,
   the other must go up. The weightier Christ's influence, the lighter
   will be the world and self-righteousness--and when Christ is All in
   All--then the world and self will be nothing at all!

   II. I shall not weary you, I hope, by taking a few minutes for the last
   head, which is OUR OWN CALCULATIONS. First, do we join in Paul's
   earliest estimate? At the outset of his spiritual life he saw all his
   own natural advantages and excellences and he counted them loss for
   Christ. Every true Christian here remembers the time when he, also,
   counted all in which he had formerly trusted to be of no value whatever
   and betook himself to Jesus. But perhaps I speak to some who have never
   done so. You are, at this time, my Friend, still confident that you
   never did anybody any harm. You think that your life has been amiable
   and upright, that you have been just, charitable and kind. And you
   think that all this certainly qualifies you for Heaven.

   You count your natural virtues to be great gains. I spoke but three
   days ago to an old man, more than 80, and when he told me of his great
   age I said, "I hope that when you die you will go to Heaven." "Ah,
   Master," he said, "I never did anything why I should go anywhere else."
   There are multitudes who believe that creed--they do not speak it out
   quite so plainly as the aged peasant did--but they mean it, all the
   same. Ah, dear Friends, you must be brought out of that delusion and
   all these moral excellences and virtues must be loss to you, that
   Christ's righteousness may be your only gain! May the Holy Spirit teach
   you this distasteful Truth of God! I wish your heart would sing--

   "No more, my God, I boast no more

   Of all the duties I have done!

   I quit the hopes I held before,

   To trust the merits of Your Son.

   Yes, and I must and will esteem

   All things but loss for Jesus' sake!

   O may my soul be found in Him,

   And of His righteousness partake." You will never be saved till you
   lose all your legal hopes.

   Now, secondly, after years of profession which many of you have made,
   do you still continue in the same mind and make the same estimate? I
   have known, I am sorry to say, some professors who have, by degrees,
   settled down upon something other than Christ. Beloved, are you
   resting, right now, upon your years of manifest improvement since
   conversion? Are you beginning to depend upon the regularity of your
   attendance at the means of Grace, upon your private prayer, upon what
   you have given, or upon your preaching or anything else? Ah, it will
   not do! We must continue to stand where we stood at first, saying, "Yet
   indeed, I also count all things but loss for the excellency of the
   knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord."

   Come now, Christian, if you could go back, would you begin at the
   Cross? If you could retrace your steps, would you begin, again, by
   resting upon Christ and by taking Him to be your All in All? I will
   tell you my answer--I have no other Foundation upon which I could
   begin, I must rest on my Lord--

   "To whom or where should I go If I should turn from You?"

   Lone Refuge of my spirit, sole Port of my poor laboring boat, to you I
   fly today, if never I did so before! Or if before, to you I fly anew!
   Do you say the same, Brothers and Sisters? I am sure you do! Now,
   again, you cannot join Paul in the third calculation and say, "For whom
   I have suffered the loss of all things," but still, I must put it to
   you--do you think you could have suffered the loss of all things if it
   had been required of you for Christ's sake?

   If it had come to this, that you must be banished or renounce your
   Savior, would you go into banishment? If the alternative were the
   spoiling of your goods, would you let all go rather than renounce your
   Lord? Your forefathers did so and, what the Spirit worked in them, I
   doubt not He would have worked in you had the times been of a severer
   character. But I will ask you a more practical question--since you have
   not had to suffer the loss of all things, do you hold all things at
   God's disposal? Are you ready to part with comfort and honor for Him?
   Can you take up the social Cross and join with the most despised sect
   for the Truth of God's sake?

   Can you lose the respectability which attaches to popular creeds and
   can you cast in your lot with the despised Redeemer when religion no
   more walks in her silver slippers, but travels barefooted through the
   mire? Can you be content to share with the, "despised and rejected of
   men"? If you can, then you could, also, suffer the loss of all
   things--but see to it that it is, indeed, so. Let me ask another
   practical question. You have not suffered the loss of all things, but
   seeing God has left your worldly comforts to you, have you used all
   things for His sake? Have you given to His cause all that cause might
   fairly ask? I hope you can say, "Yes, I hope I have and, as the world
   judges, vastly more, for I have said in my soul--

   'And if I must make some reserve, And duty did not call, I love my God
   with zeal so great That I would give Him all."'

   Well, then, you, also, may make your estimate as the Apostle did.
   Though you have not had, practically, to endure the loss of all things,
   yet you do count them but dung for Christ's sake. But one thing more.
   Beloved, if Christ is so to you that all things else in comparison to
   Him are dross and dung, do you not want Him for your children? Do you
   not desire Him for your friends? Do you not wish all your kinsfolk to
   have Him? Whatever a man values for himself, he values for others. You
   want your boy to follow your trade if you believe it to be a very good
   one. You desire to see your children well placed in life--but what
   position in life can be equal to being found in Christ--and what under
   Heaven can be compared with winning Christ?

   You may judge your own sincerity by the measure of your desire for the
   salvation of others and I earnestly entreat you be not afraid to tell
   others the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus your Lord! And
   be not slow to impress upon them the absolute necessity of being found
   in Him. Loathe the idea of having a righteousness of your own, but
   grasp with all your faith the righteousness of Jesus Christ! I commend
   to you Christians that you give your whole selves to Christ, that from
   this day forward you serve Him with spirit, soul and body, for after
   all, there is nothing worth living for, nothing worth even giving a
   single tear for if you lose it, nor worth a smile if you gain it, save
   only that which comes from Christ, and can be used for Christ, and is
   found in Christ. Christ is ALL! May He be so to you. Amen.

All the People at Work for Jesus

   (No. 1358)

   DELIVERED ON WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 9, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON, AT

   CHRIST CHURCH, WESTMINSTER BRIDGE ROAD.

   [On Behalf of the London Missionary Society.]

   I HAVE taken two texts from two successive chapters of the book of
   Joshua. The first is from Joshua the seventh, at the third verse. The
   spies who were sent to Ai returned to Joshua and said to him, "Let not
   all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and
   smite Ai." This policy led to a disastrous defeat and our other text
   gives us the Lord's command concerning the new attack. You will find it
   in the eighth of Joshua and the first verse--"The Lord said unto
   Joshua, Fear not, neither be dismayed: take all the people of war with
   you, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king
   of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land."

   The two texts may be condensed into--first, the advice of the spies, to
   employ only a part of the people in the assault upon Ai--"Let not all
   the people go up." And, secondly, the command of God to let every
   fighting man go forth to the war--"Take all the people of war with
   you." Brethren, like Israel, we are called to war and we have a greater
   than Joshua at our head, in whose name we conquer! There is an
   inheritance which as yet has been held by the adversary and in the name
   of God we have to drive him out. We are likely to experience
   difficulties very similar to those which were met with by the tribes
   and I doubt not that their history, (is it not written for our
   learning?), will prove exceedingly interesting to us if we have a mind
   to consider it.

   We shall meet with the same defeats as they did if we fall into the
   same sins. And we shall win like victories if we are obedient to the
   commands which God has given us, which are very similar to those
   addressed to Israel of old. As in a glass we see ourselves in the 12
   tribes, from the first day even until now, and in the texts before us
   there is a lesson for us, which may God, by His Grace, enable us to
   learn. I pray the Holy Spirit to illuminate our minds while we read in
   the book of the wars of the Lord and as soldiers of Christ learn from
   warriors of old time.

   I. Let us consider THE ADVICE OF THE SPIES which led to such a shameful
   defeat. And here we shall have to deal with the error of supposing that
   only a part of the Church will be sufficient to perform the work of the
   whole--that a large proportion may be idle--and that the rest will be
   quite enough to fight the Lord's battles. I feel it to be an error
   which, though not perhaps theoretically held by any of us, is
   practically to be seen abroad in our Churches and needs to be met and
   put to an end.

   In Joshua's day this error sprang up among the Israelites because, on
   account of their sins, God was displeased with them. The commencement
   of the chapter tells us that the Lord God was angry because the
   children of Israel had committed a trespass in the accursed thing.
   Because of the sin of Achan, the anger of the Lord was kindled against
   the people. That was the real reason of their defeat before Ai, but out
   of that secret cause grew the more manifest source of defeat--because
   God was displeased with them, they were left to themselves and,
   therefore, they adopted a fatal policy. When God is in the midst of a
   Church, He guides its counsels and directs the hearts of men to go
   about His work in the wisest manner.

   Is it not an old saying that, "Whom the gods wish to destroy they first
   make mad?" And is not the heathen proverb the shadow of the fact that
   men become foolish when they have broken the commands of God and thus
   they are chastened for one fault by being permitted to fall into
   another? Even upon the Lord's own people a measure of judicial
   blindness may come. You may depend upon it that when it becomes a
   doctrine that only special classes of men are to be expected to work in
   the Church, there is some great wrong in the background!

   It is that Church which most of all has fallen into this fallacy and
   has drawn the sharpest line between those called the clergy and the
   poor unfortunate laymen, who, perhaps, may do something for God, but
   who cannot be expected, or, indeed, allowed to do anything in
   particular. In that Church, I say, the deadliest errors have found a
   home! We, too, may take it for granted that when we begin to leave
   Christian work to be performed by a minister, or the visitation of the

   poor to be solely done by a paid missionary, we have some Achan in the
   camp with a goodly Babylonian garment hidden in his tent.

   There must be an accursed thing somewhere or other which has caused us
   to be left to so gross a folly! Either worldliness, or lukewarmness, or
   love of ease, or deep declension of heart must lie at the root of this
   slovenly and sluggish policy. It is not God's mind that it should be so
   and He has evidently left us to ourselves when this fatal method is
   adopted. When the Holy Spirit rests upon the Church, this folly is
   practically avoided. No, it is not even thought of! God grant to the
   Churches represented here today that they may walk in such soundness of
   doctrine and have such spirituality of life that they may be full of
   the Divine Presence and never dream for a moment of sending only a
   portion of their members out to war and leave the rest to sit still! We
   cannot leave the battles of our Lord to be fought by mercenary troops!
   The whole army of men made willing in the day of the Lord's power must
   go out under the command of our Divine Joshua to meet the foe!

   Furthermore, this evil policy arose out of presumption engendered by
   success. Just a little while ago all Israel had marched around Jericho
   for seven days and on the seventh day, when they shouted, the city
   walls fell flat to the ground! Perhaps they began to say, "Did those
   massive walls fall when we compassed them about? O Israel, you are a
   great nation! And did they fall with nothing but a shout? Then the
   Hittite and the Hivite and every other enemy shall flee before us like
   chaff before the wind! Why, can there be any reason to carry all our
   baggage up the hill to Ai? What need to march so many men? Two or three
   thousand will be quite sufficient to carry that small city by storm. We
   can do wonders and, therefore, we need not put forth all our strength!"

   Brethren, many dangers surround success! It is not much of it that any
   of us can bear. The full sail needs much ballast lest the boat is
   swamped. When in this, or any other part of the world, the Church sees
   many converts as the fruit of her labors--when there are great
   gatherings and a good deal of shouting, great interest excited and
   multitudinous conversions, it is very natural to calculate that the
   work has been easily done and needs no very severe or general effort.
   The idea is fostered that there is no need, now, for continued
   house-to-house visitation. There is no need for more missionaries. No
   need for regular plodding service in school and house meetings. No need
   to set our young men and women to work for Christ! The drill and
   organization of the regular army is in danger of being lightly
   esteemed. Blow the trumpet and the walls will come down easily enough!
   Jericho has fallen with shouts and marching--let us gather ourselves
   together and show that we are a mighty people who no longer need to go
   up unanimously and laboriously in rank and order to fight the fight as
   our fathers did!

   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, this evil spirit must be exorcised, for it
   comes from the devil! God will not bless us if we tolerate this spirit.
   Why, some of us are altogether too great for our Lord Jesus to use in
   His work! Like Saul's armor, we are unfit for our David to put on if
   Goliath is to be slain. We must be more sensible of weakness, more
   mindful that the conversion of souls is the work of Omnipotence, or we
   shall see but little done. We must, ourselves, believe more fully in
   the need of earnest work for God and put forth all our strength and
   strain every sinew for Him, knowing that it is His power that works in
   us mightily when we strive with all our hearts. We must learn that our
   great Leader means us not only to shout and blow rams' horns, but to
   employ all the strength of every man in our ranks in His glorious
   cause. May we be delivered from the presumption which leads to the
   foolish course which Israel pursued.

   Let us not forget that these children of Israel were forgetting their
   commission and violating the command of God. It is a terrible Truth of
   God that the tribes had been brought out of Egypt that they might be
   the executioners of Divine Vengeance upon races which had committed
   capital crimes for which the Lord had condemned them to be rooted out.
   The reward of the ministers of justice was to be the land which the
   infamous ones had polluted. They were charged to make no alliances with
   them, nor to intermarry with them--but to execute them for their
   crimes--and the commission was not given to some of the Israelites, but
   to all of them, for all were to be rewarded by a portion of the land.
   The charge was not given to Joshua and to the elders only, but to all
   the tribes.

   As they all expected to have a dwelling place in Canaan, so they were
   all expected to conquer the territory by their own exertions. They were
   all an enlisted host for God and He never ordained that only a part
   should go forth in His great controversy with the condemned Canaanites.
   If we ever neglect to render universal service as a Church in the cause
   of Christ, we shall depart from our trust and call, for the Lord has
   sent all His disciples to testify of Him and contend

   against sin. He has sent us all to make known, everywhere, according to
   our ability, the glad tidings of His salvation! And He has not given
   this command to this or that man, or to this or that body of men, but
   to all His chosen!

   Every member of the body has its own office and no part of it can be
   allowed to lie dormant. To none has He said, "Go your way, eat the fat
   and drink the sweet and find fault with those who do the work." But to
   all His saints our Lord Jesus says--"As My Father has sent me, even so
   I send you." Every Christian is described in Scripture as being a
   light, a light not to be hidden, but seen of men. Every child of God is
   described as forming a part of that "city set on a hill which cannot be
   hid." It is not only the ministers who are the salt of the earth and
   the light of the world--but "you are the salt of the earth." "Fou are
   the light of the world"--all of you without exception!

   Each one, in his own proportion and in his own place, is to be used as
   a vessel in the great house of the Lord and we shall get away from our
   true position and our high calling if we excuse ourselves or our
   brethren from personal service and then go and take part in public
   meetings and thank God for what other people have done on our behalf!
   These Israelites, in the new fashion which they were trying to set up,
   were departing from their own model. That model was, doubtless, the
   siege of Jericho. In that siege there was much dependence upon God, but
   there was no neglect of instrumentality! And, though all they did was
   to go round the city and shout, yet in so doing they were literally
   fulfilling orders and doing all that was commanded.

   Yes, if this would bring down the walls they did it thoroughly--they
   marched as bid and shouted as desired. They all went round Jericho!
   They did not, some of them, sit in their tents and look on while the
   others paraded--they all filed out in order. It might seem to be a
   perfectly needless procession, but it was commanded by God and they all
   united in it. In martial array they all compassed the city and all gave
   the shout--and down came the walls--and then and there every man went
   up to them, leaping over the ruined walls to strike his foe in the name
   of the Lord! That was their precedent and pattern and they were
   departing from it very sadly when they said, "Let not all the people
   labor there."

   What, then, is our model as a Church? Is it not Pentecost? Is it not
   those earliest days, that dawn of Christianity, that golden era to
   which we always look back as the heroic age of our holy faith? In that
   day did they not break bread from house to house, all of them? Did they
   not sell their lands and lay the price of them at the Apostles' feet?
   Was there not a burning enthusiasm throughout the entire company of
   disciples? We know it was so! And if we are to see, again, the triumphs
   of those primitive times, we must go back to primitive practice and
   every man and woman and child in the Church must be consecrated to the
   Divine service!

   "Child," did I say? Yes, verily, for, "out of the mouths of babes and
   sucklings you have perfected praise." I suppose there is not one person
   present who heard that famous sermon by Matthew Wilks upon the
   universal service rendered by idolaters to their false gods, from the
   text, "The children gathered wood, and the fathers kindled the fire,
   and the women kneaded their dough to make cakes to the queen of
   Heaven." The preacher's argument on that occasion was that which I
   would now press upon you, that all should take part in the work of the
   Lord! Distinct offices but united aims! Diverse operations but the same
   spirit! Many and yet one--so let it be! Would to God that the Church
   would recognize this more fully and so come back to the great
   precedents of her warfare.

   Again, this error which we are carefully to avoid was, no doubt, the
   dictate of carnal wisdom. Spies were never of much use to Israel--two,
   only, of the first 12 were faithful--what did Israel want with spies?
   Better far had it been to walk by faith! To Ai they must send spies
   instead of going up at once in the confidence of faith? Evil came of
   it, for these spies counseled that only part of the people need labor
   up the hill. And, Brothers and Sisters, the best ministers of Christ,
   worthy of all honor, would be the cause of great mischief if once their
   carnal wisdom should make them think that they can supersede primitive
   plans with wiser inventions! I dare say the men-at-arms would have said
   that Israel's numbers were a hindrance to efficient fighting and that
   the common sort were in the way of trained warriors and encumbered the
   battle.

   I know that some able Brethren are of this mind. Have they not said in
   acts, if not in words, "That young man is preaching--we wish he would
   be quiet! He makes such blunders in the Queen's English! He has a great
   deal of zeal, but there is no little danger in it. And those good
   Sisters--we know they do a good deal of work which was never done
   before, but--"and they shake their heads at them." That is often the
   main contribution of the more prudent sort to the service of God! They
   generously lavish upon the younger folks their grave looks and their
   shakes of the head at

   innovation and zeal. There is the Sunday school--well, that is a proper
   thing because it is a recognized agency--but if it were started today
   for the first time, many would shake their heads at that, also!

   City mission work, again, is a tried and proved mode of operation, but
   in days gone by there was thought to be peril in lay agency, especially
   as the men were not college trained. Well, my Brothers and Sisters,
   there are many more holy agencies yet to be invented and though they
   will, none of them, be perfect, our wet blankets will not improve them!
   Better far will it be to help the good and, as for the little mischief
   which may come of imperfect agencies, let the wise men supply the
   antidote and rectify the blunders. Anything is better than lethargy and
   death! Thank God that our people have a mind to do good! If their zeal
   is inclined to wildfire, let us not quench it, but try to use it for
   holy purposes! After all, fire, wild or otherwise, is what we need!

   If we have the fire from Heaven in the form of zeal for God's Glory, it
   can easily be regulated, but the most terrible calamity is to have no
   fire at all. "But," says one, "may not the ignorant and indiscreet
   advocacy of the Truth of God, by unqualified persons, do a great deal
   of harm to the cause we love?" It may. But is the Truth of God you
   believe so weak as to be in any serious danger from such an occurrence?
   Is not the Truth of God invincible and fully able to take care of
   herself? All she has to fear is the cramping and imprisoning agency of
   excessive prudence! With Weakness for her guardian, and Folly for her
   defender, she is yet safe! The God who protects her from her foes can
   assuredly save her from her friends! The danger lies in our carnal
   wisdom which would cover the light with a bushel to prevent its being
   blown out--and wrap the talent in a napkin because it is only one.

   We very frequently hear it said that there is no need for so much
   excitement and exertion and this, too, has come from our prudent men.
   We ought to take it coolly, they say--the thing went rightly enough in
   our grandfather's days-- the great men of the past did very well
   without all this stir! Well, we have observed those wet blankets are
   still on sale and may be had at wholesale prices! Now, Brothers and
   Sisters, I do not know what you think about it, but I, for one, feel
   that there is much work to be done and very little time to do it in. If
   I plunge into the work with all my might, I shall do none too much,
   but, at any rate, all my little might is demanded by such a cause.
   There is a blessed leisure of the heart which sits at Jesus' feet, but
   I am sure that it is not inconsistent with that violence which the
   kingdom of Heaven suffers--"and the violent take it by force."

   There were people who complained, in the days of Wesley and Whitefield,
   because their zeal caused a great deal of fanaticism. But, thank God,
   the blessed fanaticism spread throughout the land and it is not
   extinct, even now, nor shall it be, by God's Grace, but it shall go on
   increasing till Christ shall come! Let us bring up our men, the whole
   of the tribes, weak though they are--and though their weapons are no
   better than the axes and coulters with which Israel fought the
   Philistines! Let us spring upon our foe as one man, even as in the days
   of old! Let us all go up to Ai and, as surely as God was with His
   people, then, so surely will He be with our compacted hosts today--and
   the world shall learn, again, that there is a God in Israel!

   Only once more upon this point. These children of Israel, in sending to
   the war only part of the men, were breaking in upon the Divine design.
   The Lord never intended to have two peoples, but one. And so we read
   that the Reubenites and the Gadites came over Jordan to the war,
   although their portion was already conquered. It was the Divine intent
   that they should be one army of the living God, each separate son of
   the seed of Abraham belonging to that army and fighting in it. He meant
   that not some, only, but all should see the mighty works of His hands
   working with them to overthrow their adversaries. When Jericho fell,
   all saw it. And if Ai should fall before the Divine power, they must
   all be there to see, with their own eyes, the glory of the Lord!

   I am sure it is so with the Church of God today. Our Lord means to keep
   all His chosen ones as one army and to instruct them all as one unit.
   And when are we most manifestly one? When we get to work! If you come
   to declamation upon your own peculiar points, I shall wish you good
   morning. But if you are going to work for Jesus, suffer me to go with
   you. I have marked the history of organizations formed for no practical
   purpose and they have invariably come to an end--and I do not know that
   we need weep over the fact! But work to be done for Jesus is a mighty
   bond of union. Our God does not mean that His ministers should, alone,
   see all the deathbeds and be the sole spectators of the dying triumphs
   of His people. No, our Brothers and Sisters must visit, too, and have
   their faith strengthened and their prospects brightened!

   He does not wish that preachers, alone, should see all the converts and
   encourage all the desponding ones. No, His wisdom perceives that it is
   good for all His servants to behold the trophies of His Grace and know
   how to use the encouragements of His promises! The Lord does not ordain
   that one or two, alone, should mourn over the evil of the hearts of men
   and do battle with sinners. No, He means all His servants, in their
   measure, to learn the lessons which holy warfare would teach them. Not
   to deal practically with souls is perilous to ourselves! Men who spend
   their time providing us with marvelous essays and papers in the reviews
   are, most of them, unsound in the faith. But if they went out into the
   world of real life to save men. If they had to battle personally with
   hard hearts and evil passions in actual conversion work, they would
   find that their fine-spun theories are of no use.

   They would learn that the Puritan faith of our forefathers is the
   sturdiest of all weapons and the best adapted for the world as it
   is--and that the old Truth of God is the sword with which, alone, you
   can pierce the hearts of men. Work for Jesus is an education for a
   Christian! What an education it would be for the philanthropist to see
   what the agricultural laborer eats, or rather does not eat! What a
   lesson for the sanitary reformer to see with his own eyes where the
   people lodge! What an education for a man of wealth to spend a night or
   two in the crowded chambers where our London workmen dwell!

   And in the same way, holy service is a training for us. In order to
   really know man's Fall and the way of redemption we must go among the
   people and labor for their conversion. Therefore our Lord will not
   excuse any of us from service in this war because it would be to our
   great damage to be away from it! It is for our encouragement and growth
   that we should take our share in it. I will finish this part of my
   subject with a parable. In the days of chivalry a certain band of
   knights had never known defeat. In all battles their name was terrible
   to the foe. On their banners was emblazoned a long list of victories.

   But in an evil hour the leader of the knights summoned them in chapter
   and said--"My Brothers, we cause ourselves too much toil. We have a
   band of skilled warriors versed in all the arts of battle. These are
   quite sufficient for ordinary conflicts and it will be wise for the
   many, that they tarry in the camp and rest, or furbish their weapons
   for extraordinary occasions. Let the champions go alone. Yonder knight
   with his sword can cleave a man in two at a single stroke. And his
   comrade can break a bar of iron with his axe! Others among us are
   equally powerful, each one being a host in himself. With the terror of
   our name behind them, the chosen champions can carry on the war while
   the rest divide the spoil."

   The saying pleased the warriors well, but from that hour the knell of
   their fame was rung and defeat defiled their standard. When they came
   together they complained of the champions because they had not
   sustained the honor of the order and they bade them exert themselves
   more heroically. They did so, but with small success. Louder and louder
   were the notes of discontent and the demands for new champions. Then
   one of the oldest of the knights said--"Brothers, why do you blame us?
   The mistake lies here--in the old time, when the enemy assailed us, a
   thousand men were up in arms and we who led the van knew that a gallant
   army followed at our heels. But now you have made us solitary champions
   and the adversary takes heart to defy us, finding us unsustained. Come,
   all of you, with us to the fray, as before, and none shall stand
   against us."

   Brothers and Sisters, you need not that a man interpret this for you.

   II. In the second place, my text contains THE COMMAND THAT ALL ISRAEL
   SHOULD GO FORTH TO THE FIGHT. "Take all the men of war with you." I
   will mainly address myself to my Brothers in Christ and what I have to
   say to them I say humbly, speaking mainly to myself. Brothers, we must
   have all our Church members go to the war. I know this is our theory,
   but in practice we do not accomplish it. The baggage of our army is too
   heavy. The camp followers are too many. We need to turn out the drones
   and we need an increase of true working bees. How is it to be done? We
   must be, ourselves, deeply impressed with the evil brought upon idle
   Christians by their idleness and the evil which they bring upon the
   rest of the Church.

   Only suppose a Christian--I will treat it as a mere supposition--living
   an idle life. Give him nothing to do and he will become morbid with
   introspection, or he will grow quarrelsome, contending with all who
   hold opinions contrary to his own. Or he will dishonor the name of
   Christ by sin. You know when it was that David fell with regard to
   Bathsheba. It was at the time when kings go forth to battle and he
   tarried at Jerusalem. He had not fallen into that sin if he had not
   played the sluggard at home. Where was his duty as commander-in-chief?
   Was it not in the camp? Indolence is temptation! Certain of our
   Churches are suffering from unsound teaching, but they are suffering as
   much from lack of

   work. The moss is growing upon them, the rust is eating them up. The
   gold is becoming dim, the silver is losing its brightness and all for
   lack of use!

   Oh, Brothers, if we stand at the foot of a barren tree in the vineyard
   of Christ, we know what must happen. As we look upon it and see no
   fruit, our emotions ought to be those of bitterest sorrow for the axe
   is prepared for those that bear no fruit! Alas, that we should have
   Church members, not inconsistent in moral character, but excellent in
   many ways and yet cumberers of the ground! There is a great deal of
   charity about, of an evil sort, because it does not face the truth in
   honest desire for men's good. Let us be too truly charitable to indulge
   in such fatal charity! Let us sigh and cry when we think of our useless
   Church members as branches of the vine that bear no fruit, of whom the
   Master has said that they shall be taken away--"For every branch in Me
   that bears not fruit He takes away." "Men gather them and cast them
   into the fire and they are burned."

   What sorrow will fill our hearts if we reflect upon this! If we regard
   fruitless professors in this light, it will go further than anything
   else to make us successful in exciting all our Brothers and Sisters to
   active service! We need to be impressed with the mischief which idlers
   cause to others. One sickly sheep infects the flock! One member who
   does nothing lowers the tone of the whole body! The indolence of
   prominent professors is not merely the waste of their own labor, but of
   that of scores of others. Leading persons are looked upon as a sort of
   model for the rest and if So-and-So is content merely to fill his place
   in the pew and subscribe so much or, rather, so little, per annum, then
   others will say, "We shall be up to the standard if we do the same."

   Every man in an army who is not efficient and really serviceable is on
   the enemy's side. What can the enemy more desire than that the opposite
   army may be encumbered with the sick? What can be better news for them
   than to hear that the hospitals are crowded, for then they know that a
   large number of men are occupied with the sick and detained from the
   fight. The enemy claps his hands and cries, "These sick men are worth
   many a gun to us." Oh, useless professor! You cannot serve the devil
   better than by joining a Church and doing nothing! I want my Brothers
   to feel all this most keenly. I doubt not they do feel it, but I want
   to feel it more vividly myself, for when we get into a truly sensitive
   condition-- when we who are ministers are alive upon this point--we
   shall stir up the people of God, all of them, and we shall see greater
   things than these!

   Moreover, Brothers, we must hunt out the sin which leads to the evil
   against which we contend and I believe it is lack of vital godliness in
   many cases. I do not know how my friend, Mr. Newman Hall, finds it--I
   suppose he does not suffer much from it. But I know pastors who say
   they have very respectable members but nothing can be done with them.
   In some cases, Prayer Meetings are given up because the rich members
   come home from the city and dine at the hour which is usually selected
   for the Prayer Meeting and so they cannot attend. Dining is a most
   important business--it would seem to be more important than praying!
   Businessmen are so fatigued! It is a fact that we find carpenters and
   bricklayers and other workmen delighting in our Prayer Meetings. Is
   this because they do not work so hard as your city men?

   In some quarters it is found impossible to carry on Church work
   effectively because the very persons who should be workers and officers
   are resolved that their liberal giving and Sunday worship shall be the
   whole of their assistance to the cause of Christ. As to laying
   themselves out for holy work, they look in your face with wonder--as if
   they thought you had lost your senses when you propose any very arduous
   service to them! Now, this shirking of prayer and service is to be
   exposed and denounced in all faithfulness! It is often the sin which
   grows out of too much ease, self-indulgence and luxurious living. It
   seems as if the more God gives a man, the less return he is inclined to
   offer. Whatever the secret sin of the Church may be, let us try to
   discover it and then, by the aid of the Holy Spirit, endeavor to
   educate all our members to work for the Lord. There must be a continual
   insisting upon the personal obligations of Christians.

   We who are known as Baptists are of opinion that Baptism, as the
   personal act of a Believer, is a good lesson to our people as to their
   personal responsibilities. But I will not, for a moment, suppose that
   my Paedobaptist Brethren are less earnest in enforcing the same Truth
   of God. You, also, believe firmly in the personality of true religion.
   You teach the need of personal faith and consecration. Then we are
   agreed upon the great benefit of urging upon each man the duty of
   personal work for Christ. "What are you doing for Christ?" is a
   question to be asked of all! We must make every Believer feel that he
   is not his own, but bought with a price--that no amount of giving can
   compensate for personal labor for his Lord--that even he who, by
   sickness and infirmity, cannot actually work should render his
   contribution to the general

   effort by continual prayer. No one must appear before the Lord empty,
   but either by active or passive service must prove his gratitude to
   God!

   And then, while each is responsible, neglect by one is injurious to the
   common service of the whole. I saw a cart standing, this morning, on
   the roadside with one wheel chained--there was no fear of its moving
   with that one wheel fast. Sometimes one chained wheel in a Church will
   hinder all. We are all parts of a great machine and the stopping of one
   part does not simply mean the one stoppage, but the hindering of the
   whole organization! If a piece of bone in the body becomes dead, it is
   not simply useless, but it becomes the focus of mischief and the cause
   of pain. It begins to decay, disease forms and serious evil comes of it
   to the entire frame. A dead professor who is content to enjoy the
   doctrines without fulfilling the precepts of the Gospel becomes a
   source of serious danger in the Church of Jesus Christ--and we know it,
   indeed, to be so!

   My Brothers, dwell upon the importance of the enterprise in which we
   are engaged and so act as to make others feel its importance. Why take
   all that trouble about furbishing up a doubtful point of divinity,
   which is of no earthly use when it is furbished up? Why all that Sunday
   morning spent in discussing far-fetched points of belief? What is this
   but sheer trifling? Some are greatly given to what they call,
   "thinking"--"dreaming" is the truer word! Better by half, plunge the
   old Gospel sword at once into men's hearts and slay their sins in the
   name of the Lord, than stand quibbling about certain characters upon
   the hilt of the weapon! One sermon about nothing will do more harm than
   all your speculations will do good!

   Men come to forget that the Gospel is meant to save souls and look upon
   it as a mass of interesting subjects. Certain sermons are said to be
   "intellectual treats"--I think that is what I have heard them called.
   Our religion does not mean that! It means fighting with sin! It is, if
   anything at all, one of real downright practical work for Jesus Christ
   and we must show that it is so. Our teaching nothing in elaborate
   language will make our people think that practical godliness is a small
   matter and that intellect is better than piety! We must make men feel
   that to save a soul is better than to possess all knowledge, or even to
   gain the whole world! While others are making a new gospel with a
   little "g," let us labor to save souls by the old one. May God enable
   us to preach in awful earnest and by this means, God the Holy Spirit
   quickening us, we shall get all our people to march forward to the
   battle of their God!

   Above all, let us pray for more Divine Grace. We must never read the
   story of old times and say, "What a splendid denomination ours has
   been! Can we not rest on our laurels?" Impossible! You must win fresh
   ones! Napoleon used to say, "Conquest has made me what I am, and
   conquest must maintain me." And it is so with Christians. You must
   advance! You must outdo the exploits of the past and eclipse the deeds
   of your sires, or you will show yourselves unworthy of them. The battle
   thickens, and how shall we meet the growing demands upon us except by
   seeking for sevenfold Grace? Our spiritual stamina needs to be
   increased!

   If we were to collect a number of men all wheezing and coughing and
   only fit for the Consumption Hospital, and set them to work upon a
   railway, we might commend them for their diligence, but they would
   never accomplish much. On the other hand, gather together a company of
   burly, brawny men and they will say, "Who are you, O strong mountain?"
   and, before it can answer, it will be turned to a plain! See how they
   use the pick and the shovel! Vital strength is their motive force. O
   God, strengthen us! We are willing, some of us, but our strokes are
   feeble! Grant us, we beseech You, more of Your Holy Spirit and we shall
   accomplish great things! Strength delights in work, feebleness is
   afraid of it. Spiritual strength will produce universal spiritual
   service for the Lord Jesus Christ.

   I have done when I have looked into the future for a moment. If it
   should ever come to pass that the minister and all his people went
   forth to the war for King Jesus, what would happen? I seem to be in
   Paradise when I think of it! If all, without exception, who name the
   name of Jesus, went earnestly into His vineyard, what life there would
   be and what unity in all the Churches! There would be no longer a name
   to live, but real living! There would be no divisions if all were,
   alike, zealous for the Glory of the common Master! You would not hear
   of Church meetings which are scenes of disturbance and Churches where
   pastors are unhappy--such things would be regarded as extinct animals
   of the ages gone by! Then we should hear no complaints of our not being
   strong enough to do the work of our great cities and scattered hamlets.
   The most feeble Church, if everyone did his share, would be strong
   enough for its position.

   Moreover, there would be no lack of funds for any holy enterprise. Ah,
   if God's treasure received from all as it receives from some, we should
   almost have to tell the people to stay their hands because we should
   scarcely know how to

   use all their gifts! But the wealth which belongs to Christ and the
   service kept back from Him canker in men's coffers-- and the amount of
   which the Lord is robbed is almost beyond computation! The Missionary
   Societies, very well sustained on the whole, do not receive more than a
   tenth or a hundredth part of what God's people ought to give to so
   wonderful a work! If the merchant prince who contributes what is
   thought to be a handsome sum to Christ, only gave in the same
   proportion as many a pious girl who has to earn her living at so many
   stitches for a penny--and if all gave as the few are giving--we should
   soon supply all nations with missionaries!

   And if this were the case, what enterprises would be undertaken? What
   overflowing of Christian zeal should we perceive? We should be sending
   out messengers to discover every region which remained unconquered and
   we should at once be up and doing it, too! Then the mission field would
   be strong with men of most noble fitness. I do not know what you think
   about it, but it seems strange to me that we, here in this little
   island, are so closely packed together and yet a few scores or hundreds
   only go into the mission field. "Some of us have large spheres here and
   we cannot be expected to go, can we?" I answer, the ablest preacher
   that ever lived is not too good for missionary work! The most useful
   man at home is probably the fittest for the foreign field.

   Let us each question his own heart as to the claims of the heathen. For
   my own part, I dare not sleep till I have honestly considered whether I
   ought to go or not. We tell our young men in the College that they must
   prove that they have not to go, or else their duty is clear. If some of
   the men of Israel had said to Joshua, "We cannot go to Ai," Joshua
   would have replied, "You must prove that you cannot go or you may not
   be excused." All other things being equal, ministers should take it for
   granted that it is their duty to invade new territory unless they can
   prove to the contrary. When I think of the number of young men who are
   well educated and can read a capital paper at the Mechanics'
   Institution and profess to be regenerated by the Holy Spirit, it
   grieves me to see their talents dedicated so largely to meaner ends!

   Oh, bleeding Lamb, it does seem strange that we have a greater passion
   for literature than for You! We care more for fleeting than for
   enduring things! France is needing the Gospel. See what one beloved
   Brother in Paris has been able to do--are there none who can do the
   same for other cities in that neighbor country? Here and there a good
   man can say, "I have made a competency"--why not live and employ it
   where you can lay it out personally for the spread of the Redeemer's
   Kingdom? Such a thing is being done by a few--it is not, therefore,
   impossible--and you who follow the grand example shall have your
   reward.

   Look what Pastor Harms did in the village of Hermansburg, how he
   stirred up all the people until they gave themselves and their property
   to the Lord and built a ship for the mission and went forth in it to
   Africa--company after company--to evangelize! Should it not be the
   ambition of a minister to feel that if he stays at home he will at
   least, by the Holy Spirit's help, produce missionaries by the scores in
   the village where he labors! I know the day comes that he will be
   thought most happy who suffered and labored most for Christ. When this
   great fight is over, he who is most scarred will be most honored, and
   he who dwelt at home at ease will think himself but sparsely blessed
   because he did not do his share in the war.

   Let us be all at work for Christ and His redeemed Church! All at work,
   at all times and in all ways for Christ! It is for that I plead--and
   then we will take another motto and say--The world for Christ and
   Christ for every nation under Heaven! This will be accomplished when
   the Spirit has awakened us all. O blessed Spirit, convert the Church
   and it will convert the world!

Happiness--the Privilege and Duty of Christians

   (No. 1359)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 10, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE. NEWINGTON.

   "Happy are you, O Israel; who is like unto you? Opeople saved by the
   Lord, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your excellency!
   And your enemies shall be found liars unto you; and you shall tread
   upon their high places." Deuteronomy 33:29.

   THESE are the last recorded words of Moses and they are significant,
   for they show us that he found comfort, in his dying moments, in
   considering the happiness of the people for whom he had labored all his
   life. From the day when, by God's power, he led them up out of Egypt
   and brought them into the wilderness, they had never ceased to lie near
   his heart. They had been a very heavy burden to him at times, but with
   marvelous meekness and patience he had borne with their many rebellious
   provocations and only once spoken bitterly of them. Oftentimes had he
   stood in the gap and made intercession for them, when otherwise they
   would have been destroyed. He had, for their sakes, given up the most
   glorious prospect that was ever proposed to the mind of man, for the
   Lord had said to him in secret, "Let Me alone, that I may destroy them;
   and I will make of you a greater nation."

   But no, even such a proposal could not divert him from his patriotic
   zeal for his people! He loved Israel, erring Israel, ungrateful Israel,
   as a mother loves her child, and family aggrandizement was relinquished
   for love of the nation. Still he continued to instruct, lead and guide
   the stiff-necked race, having no thought but God's Glory in the midst
   of Israel, and no ambition but to see the tribes brought, at length,
   into the promised land. When about to die, the ruling passion was
   strong upon him and from it he draws his consolation. He seems to say
   to himself, "I can no more go out and come in. The Lord has said unto
   me, You shall not go over this Jordan, but though I must leave the
   beloved nation, yet they are a happy people and are safe in Jehovah's
   hands."

   He looks with sparkling eyes at the privileges with which God had
   enriched them and he feels that he may quietly go up to the mountain
   and fall asleep, for they would be blessed when he was gone, and saved
   of the Lord. Ah, my dear young Friends, you who are children of godly
   families, you cannot tell what joy you will give to your parents if you
   are converted to God! When they come to die, they will find it one of
   their sweetest consolations to see their children walking in the Truth
   of God. They have loved you dearly and they will feel a pang in leaving
   you, but if they can feel that God has blessed you and saved you, they
   will die in peace!

   I have heard saints, when dying, say, "There is but one thing that I
   want and for which I could wish to be spared a little longer. I could
   wish to live to see all my family believing in the Lord. O that all my
   offspring were lovers of Jesus." I have heard dying saints express
   themselves in language somewhat similar to that of David--"The Lord has
   made with me an Everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure,
   although my house is not so with God as I could desire." That,
   "although my house is not so with God," has been a thorn in their
   pillow and they have felt it painful to quit their household while yet
   their children were so unhappy as to be out of Christ and unreconciled
   to God. Think of this, dear young people, I pray you, and, perhaps,
   natural affection may be blessed in the hand of God to lead you to seek
   after eternal salvation.

   Thus you see how Moses consoled himself. But why was not this
   expression of the great Lawgiver left as a soliloquy unrecorded? Moses
   had cheered himself with this reflection, "Happy are you, O Israel,"
   what need to write it down, or to utter it before the people? It is
   frequently an unwise thing to tell a man of his propitious
   surroundings, for he may become vain of them. You may commend a man's
   estate until he foolishly dreams that you are commending him. When you
   praise a man's position, it is the next thing to flattering the man,
   for the most of men do not divide between

   themselves and their condition, but read a commendation of their
   condition as a commendation of themselves though it is not so!

   Therefore, one has sometimes to be very leery of calling men happy--and
   all the more so because we cannot generally be sure that they are
   happy--external circumstances being but a poor means of judgment. The
   fairest apple may be rotten at the core! The finest linen may be a
   cover for a corpse! Moreover, according to the truthful rule of the
   ancients, no man is to be counted happy till he is dead, seeing that
   you do not know the whole of his life and it may happen that the
   circumstances which now appear to be the foundation of a happy life may
   turn out to be a preparation for increased bitterness in the later part
   of existence.

   Yet Moses speaks thus openly to Israel without a word of qualification
   or caution--"Happy are you, O Israel; who is like unto you?" Now, we
   are quite certain that Moses did not err in this. It would be great
   self-conceit to imagine such a thing! We may confide in the clearness
   of his judgment, in the maturity of his experience and in the fidelity
   of his spirit. We are sure that he did not speak with rashness, for he
   was of a meek and gentle disposition and somewhat slow in speech and,
   not likely, therefore, to warm into unreasonable enthusiasm and go
   beyond the sober truth. Above all, the Holy Spirit has adopted the
   Lawgiver's words, for He had Himself inspired them--and we have them
   here in the Infallible Word of God, so that it is quite certain that
   Israel was happy, even as our text declares.

   The people were favored and it was right for them to be told so. A wise
   design led to their being reminded of the blessed fact. I think that
   Moses thus eulogized the nation by way of consoling them for his
   departure. He did as much as say, "I climb the mount to go away to God,
   but happy are you, O Israel! Whether Moses is with you or not, God is
   with you." No doubt many would say, as the great Lawgiver departed, "My
   father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof," but
   Moses reminds them that the shield of their help and the sword of their
   excellency would still be with them and they would still be a people
   saved of the Lord. What better comfort can be offered to bereaved
   hearts?

   I think, also, that he had in his mind's eye the fact that they were
   now about to face new difficulties. Under Joshua they were to cross the
   Jordan and fight the Canaanites. They had known occasional brushes in
   the wilderness with Amalek and Bashan, but for the most part they had
   led peaceable lives. Now, however, each man was to be a soldier. From
   the day in which his foot pressed the promised land, each man was to
   contend for the mastery and, therefore, Moses sustains them with rich
   and nourishing meat to strengthen them for the new service.

   "Happy are you, O Israel; you are about to throw yourself into the
   midst of ferocious tribes who will all conspire to cut you off; but you
   are a people saved of the Lord; your enemies shall be found liars unto
   you, and you shall tread upon their high places."--

   "My never-ceasing songs shall show

   The mercies of the Lord,

   And make succeeding ages know

   How faithful is His Word.

   The sacred Truths His lips pronounce

   Shall firm as Heaven endure;

   And if He speak a promise once,

   The eternal Grace is sure.

   How long the grace of David held

   The promised Jewish Throne!

   But there's a nobler Co venant sealed

   To David's greater Son.

   His seed forever shall possess

   A Throne above the skies;

   The meanest subject of His Grace

   Shall to that glory rise."

   So, then, I gather from the example of Moses that to commend a man's
   condition, if you have a wise motive for it, and can either console him
   under trouble or inspire him for future service, is a right thing to
   do.

   This morning we are going to repeat the experiment. Whatever was said
   about the happy condition of the natural Israel is emphatically true of
   the spiritual Israel! The tribes were our types and what was true of
   them is true of us. Without any sort of wresting of the text, we shall,
   this morning, apply to all Believers--to all who rest in Christ Jesus

   and have no confidence in the flesh--the words of Moses to the tribes,
   "Happy are you, O Israel; who is like unto you? O people saved by the
   Lord." We are the true Israel, the spiritual seed of the father of the
   faithful, and to us unbounded happiness belongs. This shall be our
   point this morning.

   First, let us consider the happy condition of God's people. And then,
   secondly, let us consider the result of our fully realizing this
   happiness. May the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, fill us with all joy and
   peace while we commune upon this subject. May the blessed God now bless
   all His children!

   I. Let us dwell upon THE HAPPY CONDITION OF GOD'S PEOPLE. The
   Israelites were so favored that Moses,

   himself, was astonished at the eminently desirable condition in which
   they were placed. We may readily imagine that we see him lifting up his
   hands with surprise and saying, "Happy are you, O Israel; who is like
   unto you?" He considered the nation to be incomparably favored and,
   therefore, enquired in astonishment, "Who is like unto you?" He had
   seen Egypt with all its wisdom and its wealth--and the desert tribes in
   all their rustic simplicity--and doubtless he knew the condition of
   most of the nations under Heaven. But having his eyes upon them all,
   he, nevertheless, looks upon the chosen race which God had brought up
   out of Egypt and he says, "Who is like unto you?"

   Beloved, you who are in Christ are favored by God beyond all others!
   None in the whole universe are so happily placed as you are--"you are a
   chosen generation, a peculiar people." If you have been born again and
   saved, you are the pick and choice of all God's creatures and He has
   indulged you with a measure of love and kindness such as He has shown
   to none else! I address Believers as a body and I ask you, would you
   change your estate with the rich of this world? Would you barter Grace
   for gain? Surely not! There is much that is comfortable connected with
   the possession of wealth, but if you look at the opulent, as such,
   there is no reason to believe that they are the possessors of any great
   amount of happiness.

   Gold cannot lighten the heavy heart or cool the burning brow--far more
   often it cankers the soul and lies like a weight upon the spirit. It is
   a heavy metal and has weighed many down to Hell. You, even though you
   are the poor of the flock, the despised and rejected of men--you are a
   people infinitely favored beyond those who possess the treasures of
   this fleeting world! Select even a company of princes and let them
   stand before you in all their pomp, half worshipped by their subjects,
   but they will not excite your envy, for, "uneasy lies the head that
   wears a crown," and those who climb to the high places of the earth
   commonly confess that there is little peace of mind to be found there.
   You who believe in Jesus are kings of a nobler sort, already, and enjoy
   honors and blessings which emperors might covet!

   You reign in Christ after a far higher manner than princes and
   emperors, for you rule in a superior realm, since the spiritual far
   exceeds the material. Who is like unto you, O Believer, among the
   mighty ones of the earth? The Lord Jehovah is your strength and your
   song, your portion and your praise, your comfort and your crown! Turn,
   if you will, to those who are famous for knowledge, men of skill, wit
   and research, yet among these there are none to be found comparable in
   happiness to Christians! To know yourself forgiven, to know yourself
   eternally saved, to know yourself ordained unto eternal life--to be
   assured that you will enjoy unspeakable bliss when yonder sun turns to
   a coal and the moon is black as sackcloth of hair--to know all this is
   to be unspeakably favored! The utmost learning cannot compare with it.

   Nor if you take the sons of pleasure with their wine and their music
   and their sensual joys, can you find any rivals for our happiness.
   Solomon tells us concerning laughter that it is mad and sums up all
   earthly joy with--"Vanity of vanities, all is vanity." Our consecrated
   pleasures are not such! Our holy joy has no delusion in it. It is solid
   and real and can never be taken from us and, therefore, those who
   possess it are a people unparalleled for blessedness! Wealth, rank,
   learning, fame, pleasure and all else that man holds dear, we would
   gladly renounce for the joy of our Lord! He has satisfied us with favor
   and filled us to the brim with content now that He has given us Himself
   for our portion. Blessed are our very dwellings and the beds we lie
   upon and the tables at which we sit. "How goodly are your tents, O
   Jacob, and your tabernacles, O Israel!"

   Am I speaking to some Believers who are not enjoying this happiness? Is
   it not strange that men should be in a position which angels might envy
   and yet they fail to realize their blessed estate? Just as some men
   with thousands a year will live like paupers, so are there others who,
   with a boundless income of eternal love at their disposal, nevertheless
   starve their souls with small delights. Just think for a minute, O
   downcast Believers, of this singular fact and chide yourselves into a
   more joyful frame of mind. There was a time when yon would have given
   your eyes to be what you now

   are! Do you remember when sin lay heavy on your conscience and a dread
   of death and Hell brooded over you? What would you have given, then, to
   have been able to say, "By Grace I am forgiven"?

   You know you used to envy the very least and poorest and most afflicted
   of God's saints in those days! And you were apt to think that if you
   could lie in a dungeon and be fed on bread and water all your life, yet
   if you could but once get rid of the burden of sin, you would never
   murmur again! Yet here you are, accepted in the Beloved and conscious
   of being adopted into the family of Heaven--and for all that your joy
   is at a low ebb! Should it be so? Do you remember, also, the time of
   your espousals, the season of your first love? Why, in those days you
   wondered how a Christian could be unhappy! As for yourself, you were so
   full of intense delight that when you heard some older Christian
   lamenting over anxiety, doubt, fear and the like, you looked at him as
   a prodigy--you could not comprehend his speaking after that fashion!

   You felt that to say, "My Beloved is mine and I am His," was the very
   essence of Heaven to you and you could not make out how a man could be
   an heir of Glory and not be as overflowing with delight as you were!
   Therefore, I say, chide yourself to think that you should have fallen
   from your eminency and come away from those sweet delights. Beloved, if
   we are not as happy as the days are long in these summer months, it is
   entirely our own fault, for there is plenty of reason for being so!
   Come, Christians, why are you cast down? Why are you so disquieted?
   Have you forgotten your redemption, forgotten your adoption, forgotten
   your justification and forgotten your safety in Christ?

   Have you not, also, somewhat neglected to survey your hopes? What if
   you have little of this world? Look at what is laid up in store for you
   hereafter! Within a few years, at the outside, you are to be with the
   angels where no dust of toil shall ever stain your garments! Where no
   sweat of labor shall stand upon your brow! Where no care shall scourge
   the heart and no sorrow dim the eyes! Grief, loss, bereavement, or need
   shall never approach you there! You are of the imperial blood and you
   are soon to be acknowledged as a peer of Heaven's own realm! The day of
   your accession to sacred honors hastens on. It may be but a week or two
   that the bliss will tarry--even a few hours may be the only interval
   and we shall stand beatified among the perfected ones who see God's
   face without a veil between!

   We have every reason to be happy and if we are not so, it must be
   because we fail to remember the privileges which our Lord has bestowed
   upon us. Let me stir you up, my Brothers and Sisters, to happiness this
   morning--

   "Why should the children of a King Go mourning all their days? Come,
   cease to groan, and loudly sing A Psalm of gladsome praise."

   What a blessed task is mine--to urge my Brothers and Sisters to be
   happy! How highly favored are you to be exhorted to so delicious a
   privilege! When happiness becomes a duty, who will not be glad? What a
   blessed people are they to whom to be delighted is but to obey the
   Divine command to rejoice in the Lord--an obligation as well as a
   privilege! My Brethren, I would urge you to rejoice, this morning,
   because if you are, indeed, believers in Christ, you are "a people
   saved by the Lord."

   If you only read as far as the word, "saved," and there pause, what
   music there is in the words--"a people saved"! Not a people who may be
   saved, who are in process of being saved, but a people saved! He that
   believes in Jesus is saved! The work is done. "There is therefore now
   no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus." "Unto us who are
   saved," says the Apostle, not speaking of salvation as a future gift,
   but as a deed accomplished! It is ours at this very moment, for in
   Christ Jesus we are "a people saved."

   The Israelites were saved from Pharaoh's domination. With a high hand
   and an outstretched arm did Jehovah bring them forth, even as at this
   day you and I are saved from the reigning power of sin. We are no
   longer held spell-bound by Satan so that we cannot bestir ourselves and
   seek after holiness. We are saved from the bondage of evil, even from
   the iron furnace of our ruling passions. The Israelites were saved,
   also, from the destroying angel. On that night when the avenger flew
   through the land and smote all the firstborn of Egypt, the blood mark
   on the lintel saved the families of Israel and even so are we saved by
   the precious blood of Christ! No angel of vengeance can smite the man
   who is sheltered beneath the atoning blood! He shall feast securely
   when Egypt sends up her mighty cry.

   The chosen tribes were saved when Pharaoh pursued them and his hosts
   overtook them at the sea, even at the Red Sea. Then came the fiery
   cloudy pillar between Israel and Egypt, brightness to Israel but
   darkness to their foes! They could not come near them all that night
   and in the morning Israel was safe, for the Lord's redeemed marched on
   foot

   through the Red Sea and saw their enemies no more--they were drowned in
   the midst of the sea--for God had saved His people! Even so has He
   saved us from being overtaken and overthrown by temptation. He has
   rescued us from the renewed attacks of the old, corrupt Nature combined
   with the cunning of Satan--He has saved us up to this hour from
   besetting sin and its fierce pursuits!

   When the people came into the wilderness they thought they were to
   perish of thirst, but He saved them by bidding the crystal stream leap
   from the Rock! They were ready to die of hunger, but He saved them, for
   the manna fell from Heaven round about their camp! They were attacked
   by Amalek when they were weary, but He saved them, for Joshua's sword
   and Moses' outstretched hands brought victory for them till their foes
   were utterly defeated. Israel knew what it was to be saved in many
   ways--and so do we. We have been blessed with all spiritual blessings
   in Christ Jesus, fed with the Bread of Heaven and made to drink of
   water from the Rock of Ages. And as for our adversaries, they have not
   been able to harm us, for the Lord has saved us unto this day.

   Mark the emphasis which Moses puts here, "A people saved by the Lord."
   You and I know that if we are saved, at all, it is of the Lord! We
   cannot talk of merit. We abhor the very word! Nor dare we attribute our
   salvation to our own free will--Free Grace must wear the crown if ever
   we are saved! I think, Brothers and Sisters, what a blessing it is to
   have a salvation which is altogether Divine! If you had saved yourself,
   that poor work of yours would, like all man's work, one day pass away!
   But salvation is of the Lord and, therefore, it will stand forever! It
   is God that appointed and arranged it, even the Father who is the God
   of our election, it is Jesus who worked it out, even the Son who is the
   God of our redemption! And it is the Holy Spirit who applies it, even
   the Holy Spirit, who is the God of our regeneration and our
   sanctification.

   The Triune God has worked all our works in us and for us, glory be to
   His name! "Who is like unto you, O people saved by the Lord?" I wish I
   could speak as I feel this morning--I would fire your hearts with
   enthusiasm towards Him who loved you before the earth was--who, having
   chosen you, purchased you with an immense price, brought you out from
   among the rest of mankind by His power, separated you unto Himself to
   be His people forever and who now loves you with a love that will never
   weary nor grow cold, but will bring you unto Himself and seat you at
   His right hand forever and ever! You are saved! Remember that, O
   Believer!

   You are not half-saved, but completely saved! You are saved in the Lord
   with an everlasting salvation! You shall not be ashamed nor confused,
   world without end! Why, that one word, "saved," is enough to make the
   heart dance as long as life remains. "Saved!" Let us hang out our
   banners and set the bells ringing. Saved! What a sweet sound it is to
   the man who is wrecked and sees the vessel going down and at that
   moment discovers that the lifeboat is near and will rescue him from the
   sinking ship. To be snatched from the devouring fire, or saved from
   fierce disease just when the turning point has come and death appears
   imminent--these, also, are occasions for crying, "Saved!" But to be
   rescued from sin and Hell is a greater salvation, still, and demands a
   louder joy! We will sing it in life and whisper it in death and chant
   it throughout eternity--saved by the Lord! "Happy, indeed, are you, O
   Israel"!

   Another source of joy for the Israelite is found in the grand Truth of
   God that the Lord's Beloved are, also, shielded by God--"who is the
   shield of your help." God's people are a warring people and yet a happy
   people, for though dangers surround them, Omnipotence preserves them!
   No sooner are we saved than we have to contend with foes. Now, these
   foes are very good at warfare and ready to smite us even to the death.
   Therefore the necessity for this blessed word, "The shield of your
   help." The sword shall be lifted against you, but God, Himself, will
   interpose between you and that sword! The arrows shall fly winged with
   malicious design, but God shall hold His sacred protection over you and
   protect you from even the thought of harm! He is "the shield of your
   help." Think of this and rejoice!

   Many evils would injure you and even destroy you, if they could, but
   Jehovah Jesus interposes between you and them--

   "Many times since days of youth,

   May Israel truly say,

   Foes devoid of love and truth

   Afflict me day by day.

   Yet they never can prevail,

   God defends His people still!

   Jesus 'power can never fail

   To save from all that's ill."

   See how the Lord our God has interposed, already, on innumerable
   occasions. We have been laid low by sickness, but it has worked our
   spiritual health. We have experienced losses, but we have been enriched
   by them in the highest sense. We have even endured calumny, but our
   character is still as bright as ever through the gracious protection of
   our God. We have been assailed by temptation, but the evil influence
   did not enter our spirit, so as to pollute it, for just then Divine
   Grace came in to prevent our yielding to the vile suggestion. We have
   been the subjects of much doubt and skepticism, but always, when these
   have flown at us like vultures, God, Himself, in infinite love, has
   turned aside their fierce attacks.

   We have been preserved in Christ Jesus, for He is our shield. We have
   been strengthened by Him, for He is our help. And being helped, we have
   escaped every assault, for He is our help and our shield. Brothers and
   Sisters, you shall be shielded throughout the entire battle of life. If
   all the quivers of Hell are to be emptied out against you, behold, the
   Lord God is your salvation! You may trust and not be afraid, for the
   Lord says to each one of His chosen, even as unto Abraham, "Fear not, I
   am your shield and your exceedingly great reward." This, also, is true
   today. As you have been protected, so are you now shielded by the Lord.
   Your present troubles are only like a shower rattling upon the window
   pane--you shall not so much as be dampened by them.

   Your adversaries appear to be let loose against you, but their fiery
   darts will stop short upon that wondrous shield of God which will blunt
   their points. "Trust in the Lord forever, for in the Lord Jehovah there
   is everlasting strength." "No weapon that is formed against you shall
   prosper and every tongue that rises against you in judgment you shall
   condemn." "He shall cover you with His feathers and under His wings
   shall you trust. His truth shall be your shield and buckler." Will you
   not be happy after that? As you cower down beneath those mighty wings,
   even as the little chickens shelter under the hen, are you not happy?
   As you hide behind that mighty shield, do you not feel restful and
   content? If not, pray that you may be, for so you ought to be!

   Besides defensive armor we need offensive weapons and we ought to be
   happy, in the next place, because we are divinely armed--"Who is the
   sword of your excellency!" This wondrous Word of God, when blessed by
   the Holy Spirit, is our sword with which to fight the battles of life!
   Does sin invade us? The precept smites it and the story of Calvary
   slays it! Does the flesh rebel? The Word of God smites the flesh and
   helps us to mortify it! Does Satan come against us? With, "It is
   written," we meet him as our Master met him in the wilderness of old!
   There is no weapon like the Word of God! This is the true Jerusalem
   blade that will cut through bone and marrow! It has never been known to
   bend or break, yet, in the hour of conflict. Take good heed that you
   have it by you. Gird it on your thigh and wield it well, for victory
   always goes with it.

   We are armed with the Word of God, not only that we may smite our own
   spiritual foes, but that we may win men for Christ. As the Israelites
   had to conquer Canaan, so have we to conquer the world for Jesus! Go up
   against the ramparts of error! Go up against the hosts of evil with no
   weapon in your hand but the story of the Cross, the Revelation of the
   Most High, the declaration of the Gospel of Jesus--for by this sign we
   conquer--it is impossible that we should fail with the Gospel in our
   hands. How happy God's people ought to be when they think of this!
   Armed with an invincible weapon, ought we not to rejoice in
   anticipation of victory?

   A man who has a Bible of his own--I mean not the paper and the
   letterpress, but all that is in the Inspired Volume--is there anything
   more that he can desire? He finds, from Genesis to Revelation, every
   promise his, every dear assurance of almighty power and love all his
   own--what more does he need? He who can use this two-edged sword may
   defy doubt, fear, anxiety, care, temptation, worldliness--yes, death
   and the devil! At the very sight of this sword our adversaries tremble,
   for it cuts through joints and marrow and leaves a deadly wound
   wherever it cuts. Be happy, Christian! May the Lord help you to be
   happy as you see this sword of the Spirit to be yours.

   The fourth thing which is mentioned as a great privilege is that we
   have security of victory--"Your enemies shall be found liars unto you."
   Now I ask any Christian of experience here whether he has not found
   this true? What a shameless liar the devil is! "Ah," he says, "in this
   trouble the hand of the Lord has gone out against you! He has forsaken
   you and He will be gracious no more. He has deserted you as He did Saul
   the king, and from now on dark and brooding thoughts will overshadow
   you which no musician's hand shall be able to charm away. The Lord will
   no more answer you from His holy oracle, for behold, He has cast you
   away!"

   But, Brothers and Sisters, we are not deserted, after all, for here we
   are, this morning, to sing of Divine loving kindness and to tell of all
   our past troubles as trials and proofs of eternal faithfulness! We are
   not in the asylum, nor the prison, though the arch-enemy has threatened
   us with the one or the other. God has enabled us to triumph over all
   difficulties, though the enemy has predicted our utter defeat. The
   devil came to us once, and he said, "Now you will assuredly fall!
   Already your heart is beginning to go back to sin. You are not
   faithful. You have been treacherous in your inmost thoughts and you
   will apostatize, altogether, and bring great disgrace upon your
   profession. You are a fool to have ever joined the Church--there is no
   stability about you. You are a mere flash in the pan. You blazed like a
   firebrand, but you will die out into black ashes."

   But, Beloved, we have not died out yet, blessed be Jehovah's name! Year
   after year has passed and the faint are still pursuing, the feeble
   still hold on their way and utter weakness still triumphs over strong
   temptations! Satan has been a liar to us and so has that wicked
   unbelief of ours, which is rather worse than the devil, for, at any
   rate, it has less excuse for its existence. Unbelief has whispered a
   thousand accursed falsehoods in our ears--this labor was to be too
   difficult, that trial was to consume us--that adversary would swallow
   us up! Nothing of the kind has happened, but so our enemies said and
   they have all been liars! What fools we were to have believed them and
   what greater fools we shall be if, in days to come, we shall lend an
   ear to them. Let us not listen to anything which opposes itself to the
   sure Truth of God.

   He cannot forsake us. Leave His chosen to perish? Cast away the people
   whom He foreknew? Renounce the purchase of His blood, the darlings of
   His heart? Impossible! He may sooner cease to be than cease to be the
   Father of His own-begotten! He may sooner quench the sun and moon, and
   bid the whole universe pass away as the sere leaves fall from the
   forest trees, than He can ever say unto His children, " I have loved
   you, but not now. I have chosen you, but have cast you away. I have
   brought you thus far to put you to shame." No, Beloved, His mercy
   endures forever and never does He turn from His Covenant! What a God
   you have to deal with! There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun!

   In the chapter from which our text is taken we see a singular God and a
   singular people. There is none like Jehovah and none like His people.
   He is blessed forever and they are blessed forever in Him and by Him.
   Therefore let us be happy this morning! O you mourners, take down your
   harps from the willows and tune them afresh! Put away the sackbut and
   take the dulcimer and upon an instrument of ten strings praise the
   Lord. Let your heart be glad in His name and rejoice, yes, exceedingly
   rejoice!

   II. Secondly and briefly, LET US CONSIDER THE RESULT OF REALIZING OUR
   BLESSED ESTATE. Upon this subject there ought to be no need to dilate,
   for each heir of Heaven should live in the hourly enjoyment of his
   Divine inheritance, but, alas, few are doing so! Surely spiritual
   blessings are the only ones which men decline to enjoy! Bring a thirsty
   man near a brimming cup and see how long he will linger. See how he
   hastens to enjoy the draught! Bring a poor man near an estate and tell
   him that he has but to sue the court to gain it and tomorrow morning he
   will be asking where he has to go! Alas, Christian people seem to be
   stupid about their privileges! They are not so wise as the ass which
   knows its master's crib. They have great blessings, but they do not
   always enjoy them. The good which the Lord provides is set before them,
   but they do not grasp it as they should. May the Holy Spirit teach us
   wisdom!

   Now, there are many reasons why you should enjoy your privileges and be
   happy. The first is because it tends to keep our allegiance to God
   unshaken. Israel would never seek after another god while she knew that
   none could bless her as Jehovah had done! Those who were happy with
   Jehovah would not be likely to wander off to Baal. God's people will
   not go astray from Him when their hearts are thoroughly happy with Him.
   It is because you lose the sweet flavor of the waters of the flowing
   fountain that you dabble in those muddy, stagnant gatherings which
   linger in the broken cisterns. If you would delight yourself in the
   Lord, all the world could not tempt you from Him.

   A man will never be dazzled with gold who has his heart satiated with
   God. Unhappy Christians, when tempted, are very apt to seek pleasure
   away from the Lord. But those who rejoice in the Lord always shall find
   the joy of the Lord to be their strength, for it shall be cords of love
   and bands of a man to hold them fast to their King. When your joy
   begins to slacken, say to yourself, "There is something wrong here. I
   must get back to where I was in my earlier days. I must return to my
   God and to the sunlight, for now that I am in the cold shade, my love
   may soon cool." Beloved, if you will be happy, it will create warm
   enthusiasm and a grateful love within your bosom.

   Have you begun to be lukewarm? Has your heart declined in affection?
   Nothing can make your soul return to its first love like the Lord's
   return and the restoration of the old happiness. Yes, I am saved. Yes,
   I am shielded. Yes, I bear His

   sword with which to smite my foes. Yes, I shall triumph through the
   blood of the Lamb and there is a portion for me at His right hand.
   Well, then, the next thought is therefore blessed be His dear name, I
   do love Him! I thought I did not, but when I begin to see what He has
   done for me and what He has given me and provided for me, I find my
   sluggish heart beating at a quicker rate--

   "Yes, Ilove Him and adore, Oh for Grace to love Him more." That is a
   good result to come of being happy. "Therefore comfort you, comfort you
   My people, says the Lord; speak you comfortably unto Jerusalem."

   Joy, also, will have another effect. It will give you confidence to
   expect other blessings. Because God has dealt so well with us in the
   past, we are persuaded that goodness and mercy will follow us all our
   days. If now, today, Beloved, you will survey the goodness of God to
   you in the past, you will feel confidence that when new troubles arise
   you will be helped in them and when new mercies are needed, they shall
   be supplied, "new every morning." Gratitude for the past inspires us
   with courage for the future. And so, too, you will gain strength for
   bearing all your burdens and courage for facing all your enemies. Has
   the Lord done so much to make us happy? Then He will not deny us
   anything! He who has given us so much, already, will be sure to sustain
   us and supply our needs out of His all-sufficiency until we have
   trampled down every foe and shall rest forever at His right hand.

   Lastly, for Christians to be happy is one of the surest ways to set
   them seeking the salvation of others. If we found religion to be a
   bondage and a deception, we should be inhuman if we wished to introduce
   others to it. He who enters upon a tyrant's service, with little food
   and no pay and much misery, ought not to stand at the door and invite
   others to come in! He should, rather, warn them to seek some happier
   service. Now, we have found religion to be true happiness. I am sure I
   speak the sentiments of all here who know the Lord when I say that if
   we have not been perfectly happy it has not been the fault of God's
   Grace, but entirely our own, for had we lived up to our calling and our
   privileges we should have been as happy as the birds of the air and our
   lives would have been one perpetual song!

   Despite our shortcomings, blessed be God, we have been supremely happy.
   If we could begin life again we would only ask to begin it with Jesus,
   by the power of His Spirit. If we had our choice of all the various
   positions and conditions of our fellow men, we do not know one that we
   prefer to our own, so long as we can say, "Christ is mine." Because we
   have found this honey, we desire our friends and kinsfolk to partake of
   it. Oh, my Hearers, I would you were all happy! I would you were, every
   one of you, supremely happy! And especially I wish it for some of you
   into whose faces I have looked these many years and see that you are
   still not clear of your anxieties. I see that you are not sure about
   your souls yet, and you still hesitate and linger in the border land.

   O come and rest where God has provided rest for sinners' souls!
   Beloved, trust in Jesus Christ this morning! Make no more delay! May
   His Divine Spirit enable you to do so--then shall your peace be like a
   river and you shall confess that we did not deceive you. You will cry,
   "The half has not been told me," when you perceive the deep peace, the
   holy calm, the blessed restfulness and sometimes the ecstatic,
   overflowing delight which is the portion of the child of God! If I had
   to die like a dog and there were no hereafter, I would still choose to
   be a Christian, for of all lives that can be lived there is none that
   can compare with this! We drink the wine on the lees well-refined and
   are satisfied with marrow and with fatness!

   But as for worldlings, they desire the husks that swine eat, with which
   their bellies cannot be filled. The Lord grant His people Grace to be
   happy in Him and may He also bring in the wanderers, for Jesus' sake.
   Amen.

The Good Samaritan

   (No. 1360)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 17, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him, saying,
   Master, whiat shiall I do to inhierit eternal life? He said unto Aim,
   Whiat is written in he Law? How Do you read it? And hie, answering,
   said, You shiall love the Lord your God with all your hieart, and with
   all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and
   your neighbor as yourself And He said unto hiim, You have answered
   right; do this, and you shiall live. But hie, willing to justify
   himself said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbor? And Jesus, answering,
   said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among
   thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and
   departed, leavinghim half dead. And by chance there came down a certain
   priest that way; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
   And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on
   him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he
   journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion on
   him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine,
   and sethim on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care
   of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and
   gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and
   whatever you spend more, when I come again, I will repay you. Which now
   of these three, do you think, was neighbor unto him that fell among the
   thieves? And he said, he that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto
   him, Go, and do you likewise." Luke 10:25-37.

   [On behalf of the Hospitals of London.]

   OUR text is the whole story of the Samaritan, but as that is very long,
   let us, for our memories' sake, consider the exhortation in the 37th
   verse to be our text. "Go, and do you likewise." There are certain
   persons in the world who will not allow the preacher to speak upon
   anything but those doctrinal statements concerning the way of salvation
   which are known as "the Gospel." If the preacher shall insist upon some
   virtue or practical Grace, they straightway say that he is not
   preaching the Gospel, that he has become legal and is a mere moral
   teacher. We do not stand in any awe of such criticism, for we clearly
   perceive that our Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, would very frequently
   have come under it.

   Read the Sermon on the Mount and judge whether certain people would be
   content to hear the likes of it preached to them on the Sabbath. They
   would condemn it as containing very little Gospel and too much about
   good works. Our Lord was a great practical Preacher. He frequently
   delivered addresses in which He made answer to questioners, or gave
   direction to seekers, or upbraided offenders--and He gave a prominence
   to practical truth such as some of His ministers dare not imitate!
   Jesus tells us over and over again the manner in which we are to live
   towards our fellow men and He lays great stress upon the love which
   should shine throughout the Christian character.

   The story of the good Samaritan, which is now before us, is a case in
   point, for our Lord is explaining, there, a point which arose out of
   the question, "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?" The question
   is legal and the answer is to the point. But let it never be forgotten
   that what the Law demands of us, the Gospel produces in us. The Law
   tells us what we ought to be and it is one objective of the Gospel to
   raise us to that condition. Therefore our Savior's teaching, though it
   is eminently practical, is always evangelical. Even in expounding the
   Law He has always a Gospel design. Two ends are

   served by His setting up a high standard of duty. On the one He slays
   the self-righteousness which claims to have kept the Law by making men
   feel the impossibility of salvation by their own works.

   And, on the other hand, He calls Believers away from all content with
   the mere decencies of life and the routine of outward religion and
   stimulates them to seek after the highest degree of holiness--indeed,
   after that excellence of character which only His Grace can give! This
   morning I trust that though I keep very much to practical points, I
   shall be guided by the Spirit of Holiness and shall not be guilty of
   legality, nor will any of you be led into it. I shall not hold up the
   love of our neighbor as a condition of salvation, but as a fruit of it.
   I shall not speak of obedience to the Law as the road to Heaven, but I
   shall show you the pathway which is to be followed by the faith which
   works by love. Let us proceed to the parable at once.

   I. Our first observation will be that THE WORLD IS FULL OF AFFLICTION.
   This story is but one among a thousand based upon an unhappy
   occurrence. "A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and
   fell among thieves." He went upon a short journey and almost lost his
   life on the road. We are never secure from trouble--it meets us around
   the family hearth and causes us to suffer in our own persons or in
   those of the dearest relatives. It walks into our shops and
   counting-houses and tries us--and when we leave home it becomes our
   fellow traveler and communes with us on the road.

   "Although affliction comes not forth of the dust, neither does trouble
   spring out of the ground; yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks
   fly upward." Frequently the greater afflictions are not occasioned by
   the fault of the sufferer. Nobody could blame the poor Jew, that when
   he was going down to Jericho about his business, the thieves beset him
   and demanded his money, and that when he made some little resistance
   they wounded him, stripped him and left him half dead. How could he be
   blamed? It was to him a pure misfortune. Believe me, there is a great
   deal of sorrow in the world which does not arise out of the vice or
   folly of the persons enduring it--it comes from the hand of God upon
   the sufferer, not because he is a sinner above others--but for wise
   ends unknown to us.

   Now, this is the kind of distress which, above all others, demands
   Christian sympathy and the very kind which abounds in our hospitals.
   The man is not to blame for lying there beaten and bruised--those
   gaping wounds from which his life is oozing are not of his own
   inflicting, nor received in a drunken brawl or through attempting a
   foolhardy feat. He suffers from no fault of his own and, therefore, he
   has a pressing claim upon the benevolence of his fellow men. Still,
   very much distress is caused by the wickedness of others. The poor Jew
   on the road to Jericho was the victim of the thieves who wounded him
   and left him half dead. Man is man's worst enemy!

   If man were but tamed to peace, the wildest beast in the world would be
   subdued. And if evil were purged from men's hearts, the major part of
   the ills of life would cease at once! The drunk's wastefulness and
   brutality, the proud man's scorn, the oppressor's cruelty, the
   slanderer's lie, the trickster's cheat, the heartless man's grinding of
   the faces of the poor--these, all put together, are the roots of almost
   all the poisonous weeds which multiply upon the face of the earth to
   our shame and sorrow. If dominant sins could be taken away, as blessed
   be God they shall when Christ has triumphed through the world, much of
   human sorrow would be relieved.

   When we see innocent persons suffering as the result of the sin of
   others, our pity should be awakened. How many there are of little
   children starving and pining into chronic disease through a father's
   drunkenness which keeps the table bare! Wives, too, who work hard, are
   brought down to pining sickness and painful disease by the laziness and
   cruelty of those who should have cherished them. Laborers, too, are
   often sorely oppressed in their wages and have to work themselves to
   death's door to earn a pittance. Those are the people who ought to have
   our sympathy when accident or disease bring them to the hospital gates,
   "wounded and half dead."

   The man in the parable was quite helpless. He could do nothing for
   himself. There he must lie and die--those huge wounds must bleed his
   very soul away unless a generous hand shall interfere. It is as much as
   he can do to groan. He cannot even dress his wounds, much less arise
   and seek shelter! He is bleeding to death among the pitiless rocks on
   the descent to Jericho and he must leave his body to be fed upon by
   hawks and crows unless some friend shall come to his help. When a man
   can help himself and does not, he deserves to suffer. When a man flings
   away opportunities by his idleness or self-indulgence, a measure of
   suffering ought to be permitted to him as a cure for his vices.

   But when persons are sick or injured and are unable to pay for the aid
   of the nurse and the physician, then is the time when true-hearted
   philanthropy should promptly step in and do its best. So our Savior
   teaches us here. Certain paths of

   life are peculiarly subject to affliction. The way which led from
   Jerusalem to Jericho was always infested by robbers. Jerome tells us
   that it was called the "bloody way" on account of the frequent highway
   robberies and murders which were committed there. And it is not so long
   ago as to be beyond the memory of man that an English traveler met his
   death on that road, while even very recent travelers tell us that they
   have been either threatened or actually attacked in that particularly
   gloomy region--the desert which goes down to the city of palm trees.

   So, also, in the world around us there are paths of life which are
   highly dangerous and fearfully haunted by disease and accident. Years
   ago there were many trades in which, from lack of precaution, death
   slew its thousands. I thank God that sanitary and precautionary laws
   are better regarded and men's lives are thought to be somewhat more
   precious. Yet there are still ways of life which may each be called
   "the bloody way"--pursuits which are necessary to the community, but
   highly dangerous to those who follow them. Our mines, our railways and
   our seas show a terrible roll of suffering and death. Long hours in
   ill-ventilated workrooms are accountable for thousands of lives and so
   are stinted wages, which prevent a sufficiency of food from being
   procured. Many a needlewoman's way of life is truly a path of blood!

   When I think of the multitudes of our working people in this city who
   have to live in close, unhealthy rooms, crowded together in lanes and
   courts where the air is stagnant, I do not hesitate to say that much of
   the road which has to be trod by the poor of London is as much
   deserving of the name of the way of blood as the road from Jerusalem to
   Jericho. If they do not lose their money it is because they never have
   it! If they do not fall among thieves, they fall among diseases which
   practically wound them and leave them half dead.

   Now, if you have not to engage in such avocations. If your pathway does
   not lead you from Jerusalem to Jericho, but takes you, perhaps, full
   often from Jerusalem to Bethany where you can enjoy the sweetnesses of
   domestic love and the delights of Christian fellowship, you ought to be
   very thankful and be all the more ready to assist those who, for your
   sakes, or for the benefit of society at large, have to follow the more
   dangerous roads of life. Do you not agree with me that such persons
   ought to be among the first to receive our Christian kindness? Such
   abound in our hospitals and elsewhere. Let that stand. It is clear that
   there is a great deal of affliction in the world and much of it is of
   the sort which deserves to be relieved at once!

   II. Secondly, THERE ARE MANY WHO NEVER RELIEVE AFFLICTION. Our Savior
   tells us of two, at least, who "passed by on the other side" and I
   suppose He might have prolonged the parable so as to have mentioned two
   dozen if He had chosen to do so--and even then He might have been
   content to mention but one good Samaritan, for I hardly think that
   there is one good Samaritan to two heartless persons. I wish there
   were, but I fear the good Samaritans are very few in proportion to the
   number who act the part of the priest and the Levite.

   Now, notice who the persons were that refused to render aid to the man
   in distress. First, they were brought to the spot by God's Providence
   on purpose to do so. What better thing could the Lord, Himself, do for
   the poor half-dead man than to bring some man to help him? An angel
   could not well have met the case. How could an angel, never wounded,
   understand binding up wounds and pouring in wine and oil? No, a man was
   needed who would know what was necessary! Someone was needed who would,
   with brotherly sympathy, cheer the mind while doctoring the body. In
   our English version we read, "By chance there came down a certain
   priest that way," but learned Greek scholars read it, "By a
   coincidence."

   It was in the order of Divine Providence that a priest should come
   first to this afflicted person, so that he might go and examine the
   case as a man of education and skill. And then when the Levite came
   afterwards, he would be able to carry on what the priest started--and
   if one could not carry the poor man--the two might, between them, be
   able to carry him to the inn, or one might remain to guard him while
   the other ran for help. God brought them to this position, but they
   willfully refused the sacred duty which Providence and humanity
   demanded of them! Now, you that are wealthy are sent into our city on
   purpose that you may have compassion upon the sick, the wounded, the
   poor and the needy. God's intent in endowing any person with more
   substance than he needs is that he may have the pleasurable office, or
   rather let me say, the delightful privilege, of relieving need and woe!

   Alas, how many there are who consider that store which God has put into
   their hands on purpose for the poor and needy to be only so much
   provision for their excessive luxury--a luxury which pampers them but
   yields them neither benefit nor pleasure! Others dream that wealth is
   given them that they may keep it under lock and key, cankering and
   corroding, breeding covetousness and care. Who dares roll a stone over
   the well's mouth when thirst is raging all

   around? Who dares keep the bread from the women and the children who
   are ready to gnaw their own arms for hunger? Above all, who dares allow
   the sufferer to writhe in agony uncared for, and the sick to pine into
   their graves unnursed?

   This is no small sin! It is a crime to be answered to the Judge when He
   shall come to judge the quick and dead! Those people who neglected the
   poor man were brought there on purpose to relieve him, even as you are,
   and yet they passed by on the other side. They were both of them
   people, too, who ought to have relieved him, because they were very
   familiar with things which should have softened their hearts. If I
   understand the passage, the priest was coming down from Jerusalem. I
   have often wondered which way he was going--whether he was going up to
   the Temple and was in a hurry to be in time for fear of keeping the
   congregation waiting--or whether he had fulfilled his duty and had
   finished his month's course at the temple and was going home.

   I conclude that he was going from Jerusalem to Jericho, because it
   says, "By chance there came down a certain priest that way." Now to the
   metropolis it is always, "going up"--going up to London, or up to
   Jerusalem--and as this priest was coming down, he was going to Jericho.
   It was quite literally going down, for Jericho lies very low. I
   conclude that he was going home to Jericho, after having fulfilled his
   month's engagements in the Temple where he had been familiar with the
   worship of the Most High. He had been, in that month, as near to God as
   man could be, serving amidst sacrifices and holy Psalms and solemn
   prayers! And yet he had not learned how to make a sacrifice, himself!
   He had heard those prophetic words which say, "I will have mercy, and
   not sacrifice," but he was entirely forgetful of such teaching! He had
   often read that Law, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," but he
   regarded it not.

   The Levite had not been quite so closely engaged in the sanctuary as
   the priest, but he had taken his share in holy work and yet he came
   away from it with a hard heart. This is a sad fact. Both men had been
   near to God, but were not like He. Dear people, you may spend Sabbath
   after Sabbath in the worship of God, or what you think to be so, and
   you may behold Christ Jesus set forth visibly crucified among you--and
   themes which ought to turn a heart of stone to flesh may pass before
   your minds and, nevertheless, you may return into the world to be as
   miserly as ever--and to have as little feeling towards your fellow men
   as before! It ought not to be so. I beseech you suffer it not to be so
   in any case again.

   These two persons, moreover, were bound by their profession to have
   helped this man, for though it was originally said of the high priest,
   yet I think it could be said of any priest, that he was taken from
   among men that he might have compassion. If anywhere there should be
   compassion towards men, it should be in the heart of the priest who is
   chosen to speak for God to men and for men to God. No stone should ever
   be found in his bosom. He should be gentle, generous-hearted kindly,
   full of sympathy and tenderness. But this priest was not so, nor was
   the Levite who ought to have followed in his wake.

   And oh, you Christian ministers and all of you who teach in schools, or
   who undertake any service of Christian ministry--and you ought all to
   do so for the Lord has made all His people to be priests unto
   Him--there ought to be in you from your very profession, a readiness of
   heart towards kind actions for those who need them! And there is one
   thing to be mentioned, also, against this priest and Levite--they were
   very well aware of the man's condition. They came close to him and saw
   his state. It is a narrow track way down to Jericho and they were
   obliged to go almost over his wounded body. The first comer looked at
   him, but he hurried on. The second appears to have made a further
   investigation, to have had sufficient curiosity, at any rate, to begin
   to examine the state of the case. But his curiosity being satisfied,
   his compassion was not awakened and he hurried away.

   Half the neglect of the sick poor arises from not knowing that there
   are such cases, but many remain willfully in ignorance and such
   ignorance is no available excuse! In the case of the hospitals for
   which we plead today, you know that there are persons in them at this
   moment suffering--persons suffering grievously for no fault of their
   own--and you know that these need your aid. As I rode, the other
   evening, by that noble building on our side of the water, St. Thomas'
   Hospital, I could not help meditating upon what a mass of pain and
   suffering was gathered within those walls. But then I thanked God that
   it was within those walls where succor would be most surely rendered to
   it to the best of human ability. So you know that there is poverty and
   sickness around you. And if you pass by on the other side you will have
   looked at it, you will have known about it--and on your heads will be
   the criminality of having left the wounded man unhelped!

   Yet the pair had capital excuses! Both the priest and the Levite had
   excellent reasons for neglecting the bleeding man. I never knew a man
   refuse to help the poor who failed to give at least one admirable
   excuse! I believe there is no man on earth, who wickedly rejects the
   plea of need, who is not furnished with arguments that he is right.
   They are arguments eminently satisfactory to himself and such as he
   thinks should silence those who press the case. For instance, the
   priest and Levite were both in a hurry. The priest had been away for a
   month at Jerusalem from his wife and dear children--he naturally wanted
   to get home. If he lingered, the sun might go down--it was an awkward
   place to be after sundown and you could not expect him to be so
   imprudent as to stay in such a with darkness coming on.

   Had he not spent a very laborious month in the temple? You do not know
   how exhausting he had found it to act as a priest for a whole month!
   And if you did, you would not blame him for wanting to get home to
   enjoy a little rest! Besides, he had promised to be home at a certain
   hour and he was a man of punctuality--he would, by no means, cause
   anxiety to his wife and children who would be looking from the housetop
   for him. A very excellent excuse was this! But he also felt that he
   really could not do much good. He did not understand surgery and could
   not bind up a wound to save his life! He shrank from it--the very sight
   of blood turned his stomach! He could not bring himself to go near a
   person who was so frightfully mangled.

   If he did try to bind up a wound, he is sure he would make a muddle of
   it. If his wife had been with him, she could have done it, or if he had
   brought some plaster, liniment, or strapping, he would have tried his
   best--but as it was, he could do nothing. The poor man, moreover, was
   evidently half dead and would be quite dead in an hour or two and,
   therefore, it was a pity to waste time on a hopeless case. Then the
   priest was only one person and could not be expected to carry a
   bleeding man--and yet it would be idle to begin with the case and leave
   him there all night. True, He could almost hear the sound of the
   Levite's feet--indeed, he hoped he was coming up behind, for he felt
   very nervous at being alone with such a case. But then that was all the
   more reason for leaving the matter, since the Levite would be sure to
   attend to it.

   Better still was the following line of excuse--you would not have a
   person stop in a place where another man had been half killed by
   thieves! The thieves might be back again--they were scarcely out of
   hearing, even then--and a priest, after a month's service, ought to
   have some fees in his purse! And it was important not to run the risk
   of losing the support of his family by stopping in a place which was
   evidently swarming with highwaymen. He might be wounded, too, and then
   there would be two people half dead and one of them a valuable
   clergyman! Really, philanthropy would suggest that you take care of
   yourself, as you could not possibly do any good to this poor man.

   And then the man might die and the person found near the body might be
   charged with the murder. It is always awkward to be found alone in a
   dark spot with the corpse of one who has evidently suffered from foul
   play. The priest might be taken up upon suspicion--did not all the
   principles of prudence suggest that the very best thing that he could
   do was to get out of the way as quickly as possible? Moreover, he could
   pray for the man, you know, and he was glad to find that he had a tract
   with him which he would leave near him--and what with the tract and the
   prayer, what more could a good man be expected to do?

   With this pious reflection he hastened on his way. It is just possible,
   also, that he did not wish to be defiled. A priest was too holy a
   person to meddle with wounds and bruises. Who would propose such a
   thing? He had come from Jerusalem in all the odor of sanctity! He felt
   himself to be as holy as he could conveniently be and, therefore, he
   would not expose such rare excellence to worldly influences by touching
   a sinner. All these powerful reasons put together made him content to
   avoid trouble and leave the doing of kindness to others.

   Now, this morning, I shall leave you to make all the excuses you like
   about not helping the poor and aiding the hospitals. And when you have
   made them, they will be as good as those which I have set before you.
   You have smiled over what the priest might have said, but if you make
   any excuses for yourselves whenever real need comes before you and you
   are able to relieve it, you need not smile over your excuses--the devil
   will do that--you had better cry over them, for there is the gravest
   reason for lamenting that your heart is hard toward your fellow
   creatures when they are sick and, perhaps, even sick unto death.

   III. In the third place THE SAMARITAN IS A MODEL FOR THOSE WHO HELP THE
   AFFLICTED. He is a

   model, first, if we notice who the person was that he helped. The
   parable does not say so, but it implies that the wounded man was a Jew,
   and, therefore, the Samaritan was not of the same faith and order. The
   Apostle says, "As we have

   opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are
   of the household of faith." This man was not of the household of faith,
   as far as the Samaritan's judgment went, but he was one of the "all
   men." The Jew and he were as much apart in religious sympathy as they
   well could be.

   Yes, but he was a man--whether he was a Jew or not, he was a man--a
   wounded, bleeding, dying man. And the Samaritan was another man and so
   one man felt for another man and came to his aid. Do not ask whether a
   sick man believes in the 39 Articles, or the Westminster Assembly's
   Catechism. Let us hope that he is sound in the faith, but if he is not,
   his bleeding needs stopping just as much as if he held a perfect creed.
   You need not enquire whether he is a sound Calvinist, for an Arminian
   smarts when he is wounded, too! A Churchman feels as much pain as a
   Dissenter when his leg is broken and an infidel needs nursing when he
   is crushed in an accident. It is as bad for a man to die with a
   heterodox creed as with the orthodox faith. Indeed, in some respects it
   is far worse and, therefore, we should be doubly anxious for his cure.

   We are to relieve real distress irrespective of creed, as the Samaritan
   did. Moreover, the Jews were great haters of the Samaritans and, no
   doubt, this Samaritan might have thought, "If I were in that man's
   case, he would not help me. He would pass me by and say, 'It is a
   Samaritan dog, let him be accursed.'" The Jews were accustomed to curse
   the Samaritans, but it did not occur to the good man to remember what
   the Jew would have said. He saw him bleeding and he bound up his
   wounds. Our Savior has not given us, for a golden rule, "Do you to
   others as others would do to you," but "as you would they should do to
   you." The Samaritan went by that rule and though he knew of the enmity
   in the Jewish mind, he felt that he must heap coals of fire upon the
   wounded man by loving help--therefore he went straight away to his
   relief.

   Perhaps at another time the Jew would have put off the Samaritan and
   refused even to be touched by him, but the tender-hearted sympathizer
   does not think of that. The poor man is too sick to hold any crotchets
   or prejudices and when the Samaritan bends over him and pours in the
   oil and wine, he wins a grateful glance from the son of Abraham. That
   poor wounded man was one who could not repay him. He had been stripped
   of all that he had, even his garments were taken from him. But charity
   does not look for payment, otherwise it were not charity! The man was a
   total stranger, too. The Samaritan had never seen him before. What did
   that matter? He was a man and all men are kin. "God has made of one
   blood all nations that dwell upon the face of the earth."

   The Samaritan felt that touch of Nature which makes all men kin and he
   bent over the stranger and relieved his pains. He might have said, "Why
   should I help? He has been rejected by his own people--the priest and
   the Levite have left him--his first claim is upon his own countrymen."
   So have I known some say, "These persons have no claim! They ought to
   go to their own people." Well, suppose they have gone and failed? Now
   comes your turn! And what the Jew would not do for the Jew, let the
   Samaritan do and he shall be blessed in the deed. He had been neglected
   by the officials and neglected by the saints--the best, or those who
   ought to be the best, the priest and the Levite--had deserted him and
   left him to die. The Samaritan is neither saint nor official, but yet
   he steps in to do the deed! Oh, Christian Brothers and Sisters, take
   care that you are not put to shame by this Samaritan!

   He is a model to us, next, in the spirit in which he did his work. He
   did it without asking questions. The man was in need. He was sure of
   that and he helped him at once. He did so without hesitation and made
   no compact nor agreement with him, but at once proceeding to pour in
   the oil and wine. He did it without attempting to shift the labor from
   himself to others. Charity, nowadays, means that A asks B to help him
   and B, in his wonderful charity, does him the great favor of sending
   him on to C. That is to say, the common run of benevolent persons,
   nowadays, put their hands but seldom into their own purses, but send
   people on to a few individuals who find cash for all. It seems to me to
   be a very mean way of getting rid of a case by saving your own pocket
   and passing the applicant on to another who is no better off than
   yourself, but far more generous.

   The Samaritan was personally benevolent and therein he is a mirror and
   model to us all. He did it without any selfish fear. The thieves might
   have been upon him, but he cared nothing for thieves when a life was in
   danger. Here is a man in need and the man must be relieved--thieves or
   no thieves--and so he does it. He does it with self-denial, for he
   finds oil and wine and money at the inn--and everything, though he was
   by no means a rich man, for he gave two pence--a larger sum than it
   looks, but still a small sum. He did not fling his alms about because
   he was rich. He is not said to have

   given a handful of pence, but two, for he had to count his pence as he
   expended them. It was a poor Samaritan who did this rich and noble act!

   The poorest can help the poor--even those who feel distress,
   themselves, may manifest a generous Christian spirit and give their
   services. Let them do so as they have opportunity. This man helped his
   poor neighbor with great tenderness and care. He was like a mother to
   him. Everything was done with loving thought and with whatever skill he
   possessed. He did the best he could. Brothers and Sisters, let what we
   do for others always be done in the noblest style! Let us not treat the
   poor like dogs to whom we fling a bone, nor visit the sick like
   superior beings who feel that they are stooping down to inferiors when
   they enter their rooms. But in the sweet tenderness of real love,
   learned at Jesus' feet, let us imitate this good Samaritan!

   And what did he do? Well, first, he came to where the sufferer was and
   put himself into his position. Then he put forth all his skill for him
   and bound up his wounds, no doubt tearing his own garments to get the
   bands with which to bind up the wounds. He poured in oil and wine, the
   best healing mixture that he knew of, and one which he happened to have
   with him. He then set the sick man on his mule and, of course, he had
   to walk, but this he did right cheerfully, supporting his poor patient
   as the mule proceeded. He took him to an inn, but he did not leave him
   there and say, "Someone else will take care of him now." No, he went to
   the manager of the establishment, gave him money and said, "Take care
   of him."

   I admire that little sentence, because it is first written, "He took
   care of him," and next he said, "Take care of him." What you do,
   yourself, you may exhort other people to do. He said, "I leave this
   poor man with you, pray do not neglect him. There are a great many
   people in the inn, but take care of him." "Is he a brother of yours?"
   "No, I never saw him before." "Well, are you at all under obligation to
   him?" "No!--Yes, yes, I feel under obligation to everybody that is a
   man. If he needs help, I am obliged to help him." "Is that all?" "Yes,
   but do take care of him. I feel a great interest in him." The Samaritan
   did not cease till he had gone through with his kindness. He said,
   "This money may not be sufficient, for it may be a long time before he
   is able to move. That leg may not soon heal. That broken rib may need
   long rest. Do not hurry him away. Let him stay here and if he incurs
   additional expense, I will be sure to pay it when I come back from
   Jerusalem."

   There is nothing like the charity which endures even to the end! I wish
   I had time to enlarge on all these things, but I cannot do so. Exhibit
   them in your lives and you will best know what they mean. Go and do
   likewise, each one of you, and thus reproduce the good Samaritan.

   IV. But now, fourthly, WE HAVE A HIGHER MODEL than even the
   Samaritan--our Lord Jesus Christ. I do not think that our Divine Lord
   intended to teach anything about Himself in this parable, except so far
   as He is the great Exemplar of all goodness. He was answering the
   question, "Who is my neighbor?" and He was not preaching about Himself
   at all. There has been a great deal of straining of this parable to
   bring the Lord Jesus and everything about Him into it, but this I dare
   not imitate. Yet by analogy we may illustrate our Lord's goodness by
   it.

   This is a picture of a generous-hearted man who cares for the needy.
   But the most generous-hearted man that ever lived was the Man of
   Nazareth and none ever cared for sick and suffering souls as He has
   done. Therefore, if we praise the good Samaritan, we should much more
   extol the blessed Savior whom His enemies called a Samaritan and who
   never denied the charge, for what cared He if all the prejudice and
   scorn of men should vent itself on Him? Now, Brothers and Sisters, our
   Lord Jesus Christ has done better than the good Samaritan because our
   case was worse. As I have already said, the wounded man could not blame
   himself for his sad estate--it was his misfortune, not his fault.

   But you and I are not only half dead, but altogether dead in trespasses
   and sins! And we have brought many of our ills upon ourselves. The
   thieves that have stripped us are our own iniquities! The wounds which
   we bear have been inflicted by our own suicidal hands! We are not in
   opposition to Jesus Christ as the poor Jew was to the Samaritan from
   the mere force of prejudice, but we have been opposed to the blessed
   Redeemer by nature--we have, from the first, turned away from Him.
   Alas, we have resisted and rejected Him! The poor man did not ignore
   his Samaritan friend, but we have done so to our Lord.

   How many times have we refused Almighty Love! How often, by unbelief,
   have we pulled open the wounds which Christ has bound up! We have
   rejected the oil and wine which in the Gospel He presents to us. We
   have spoken evil of Him to His face and have lived, even for years, in
   utter rejection of Him! And yet in His infinite love He has not given
   us

   up, but He has brought some of us into His Church where we rest as in
   an inn, feeding on what His bounty has provided! It was wondrous love
   which moved the Savior's heart when He found us in all our misery and
   bent over us to lift us out of it though He knew that we were His
   enemies!

   The Samaritan was akin to the Jew because he was a man, but our Lord
   Jesus was not originally akin to us by nature. He is God, infinitely
   above us, and if He were "found in fashion as a man" it was because He
   chose to be so. If He journeyed this way, via Bethlehem's manger, down
   to the place of our sin and misery, it was because His infinite
   compassion brought Him here. The Samaritan came to the wounded one
   because, in the course of business, he was led there and, being there,
   he helped the man. But Jesus came to earth on no business but that of
   saving us and He was found in our flesh that He might have sympathy
   with us. In the very existence of the Man, Christ Jesus, you see
   manifested the noblest form of pity!

   And being here, where we had fallen among robbers, He did not merely
   run risks of being attacked by thieves Himself, but He was attacked by
   them--He was wounded, He was stripped--and He was not half dead, but
   altogether dead, for He was laid in the grave! He was slain for our
   sakes, for it was not possible for Him to deliver us from the mischief
   which the thieves of sin had worked upon us except by suffering that
   mischief in His own Person--and He suffered it that He might deliver
   us. What the Samaritan gave to the poor man was generous, but it is not
   comparable to what the Lord Jesus has given to us! He gave him wine and
   oil, but Jesus has given His heart's blood to heal our wounds! "He
   loved us and gave Himself for us."

   The Samaritan lent himself with all his care and thoughtfulness, but
   Christ gave Himself even to the death for us. The Samaritan gave two
   pence, a large amount out of his slender store--and I do not depreciate
   the gift--but, "He that was rich for our sakes became poor that we,
   through His poverty might be rich." Oh, the marvelous gifts which
   Christ has bestowed upon us! Who is he that can reckon them! Heaven is
   among those blessings, but His own self is the chief gift! The
   Samaritan's compassion did but show itself for a short time. If he had
   to walk by the side of his mule it would not be for many miles. But
   Christ walked by the side of us, dismounted from His Glory, all through
   His life! The Samaritan did not stop long at the inn, for he had his
   business to attend to and he very rightly went about it.

   But our Lord remained with us for a lifetime, even till He rose to
   Heaven--yes, He is with us even now--always blessing the sons of men.
   When the Samaritan went away, he said, "Whatever you spend more I will
   repay you." Jesus has gone up to Heaven and He has left behind Him
   blessed promises of something to be done when He shall come again. He
   never forgets us! The good Samaritan, I dare say, thought very little
   of the Jew in later years. Indeed, it is the mark of a generous spirit
   not to think much of what it has done. He went back to Samaria and
   minded his business and never told anybody, "I helped a poor Jew on the
   road." Not he.

   But of necessity our Lord Jesus acts differently, for because we have a
   constant need, He continues to care for us and His deed of love is
   being done, and done, and done again upon multitudes of cases--and will
   always be repeated so long as there are men to be saved, a Hell from
   which to escape and a Heaven to win! I have thus set before you the
   highest example and I shall conclude when I have said two things. Judge
   yourselves, all of you, my Hearers, if you are hoping for salvation by
   your own works.

   Look to what you must be throughout an entire life if your works are to
   save you. You must love God with all your heart and soul and strength,
   and your neighbor, in this Samaritan's fashion, even as yourself. And
   both of these without a single failure! Have you done this? Can you
   hope to do it perfectly? If not, why do you risk your souls in this
   frail skiff--this leaky, sinking craft of your poor works--for you will
   never get to Heaven in it. Lastly, you who are Christ's people are
   saved, already, and you are not going to do these things in order to
   save yourselves. The greater Samaritan has saved you--Jesus has
   redeemed you, brought you into His Church, put you under the care of
   His ministers, bid us take care of you--and promised to reward us if we
   do so in the day when He comes.

   Seek, then, to be true followers of your Lord by practical deeds of
   kindness and if you have been backward in your gifts to help either the
   temporal or the spiritual needs of men, begin, from this morning, with
   generous hearts, and God will bless you. O Divine Spirit, help us all
   to be like Jesus! Amen.

The Final Perseverance of the Saints

   (No. 1361)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JUNE 24, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The righteous, also, shall hold on his way." Job 17:9.

   THE man who is righteous before God has a way of his own. It is not the
   way of the flesh, nor the way of the world. It is a way marked out for
   him by the Divine command in which he walks by faith. It is the King's
   highway of holiness-- the unclean shall not pass over it--only the
   ransomed of the Lord shall walk there and these shall find it a path of
   separation from the world. Once entered upon the way of life, the
   pilgrim must persevere in it or perish, for thus says the Lord, "If any
   man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him." Perseverance in
   the path of faith and holiness is a necessity of the Christian, for
   only, "He that endures to the end, the same shall be saved." It is in
   vain to spring up quickly like the seed that was sown upon the rock and
   then, by-and-by, to wither when the sun is up. That would but prove
   that such a plant has no root in itself.

   But "the trees of the Lord are full of sap" and they abide and continue
   and bring forth fruit, even in old age, to show that the Lord is
   upright. There is a great difference between nominal Christianity and
   real Christianity and this is generally seen in the failure of the one
   and the continuance of the other. Now, the declaration of the text is
   that the truly righteous man shall hold on his way--he shall not go
   back, he shall not leap the hedges and wander to the right hand or the
   left--he shall not lie down in idleness, neither shall he faint and
   cease to go upon his journey. He "shall hold on his way." It will
   frequently be very difficult for him to do so, but he will have such
   resolution, such power of inward Grace given him, that he will "hold on
   his way" with stern determination, as though he held on by his teeth,
   resolving never to let go.

   Perhaps he may not always travel with equal speed. It is not said that
   he shall hold on his pace, but he shall hold on his way. There are
   times when we run and are not weary and at other times, when we walk,
   we are thankful that we do not faint. Yes, and there are periods when
   we are glad to go on all fours and creep upward with pain. But still we
   prove that "the righteous shall hold on his way." Under all
   difficulties the face of the man whom God has justified is steadfastly
   set towards Jerusalem--nor will he turn aside till his eyes shall see
   the King in His beauty. This is a great wonder! It is a marvel that any
   man should be a Christian at all, and a greater wonder that he should
   continue so!

   Consider the weakness of the flesh, the strength of inward corruption,
   the fury of Satanic temptations, the seductions of wealth and the pride
   of life, the world and the fashions thereof--all these things are
   against us and yet behold, "greater is He that is for us than all they
   that are against us!" Defying sin, Satan, death and Hell, the righteous
   holds on his way. I take our text as accurately setting forth the
   doctrine of the Final Perseverance of the Saints. "The righteous shall
   hold on his way."

   Years ago, when there was an earnest and even bitter controversy
   between Calvinists and Arminians, it was the habit of each side to
   caricature the other. Very much of the argument was not directed
   against the real sentiment of the opposite party, but against what had
   been imputed to them. They made a man of straw and then they burned
   him, which is a pretty easy thing to do! But I trust we have left these
   things behind. The glorious Truth of the Final Perseverance of the
   Saints has survived controversy and, in some form or other, is the
   cherished belief of the children of God. Take care, however, to be
   clear as to what it is. The Scripture does not teach that a man will
   reach his journey's end without continuing to travel along the road. It
   is not true that one act of faith is all--that nothing is needed of
   daily faith, prayer and watchfulness. Our doctrine is the very
   opposite, namely, that the righteous shall hold on his way! Or, in
   other words, shall continue in faith, in repentance, in prayer and
   under the influence of the Grace of God.

   We do not believe in salvation by a physical force which treats a man
   as a dead log and carries him, whether he wills it or not, towards
   Heaven. No, "He holds on." He is personally active about the matter and
   plods on up hill and down

   dale till he reaches his journey's end. We never thought, nor even
   dreamed, that merely because a man supposes that he once entered on
   this way he may, therefore, conclude that he is certain of salvation,
   even if he leaves the way immediately. No, but we say that he who truly
   receives the Holy Spirit, so that he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ,
   shall not go back, but persevere in the way of faith.

   It is written, "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved," and
   this he cannot be if he were left to go back and delight in sin as he
   did before! And, therefore, he shall be kept by the power of God
   through faith unto salvation. Though the Believer, to his grief, will
   commit many a sin, still, the tenor of his life will be holiness to the
   Lord and he will hold on in the way of obedience. We detest the
   doctrine that a man who has once believed in Jesus will be saved even
   if he altogether forsakes the path of obedience. We deny that such a
   turning aside is possible to the true Believer and, therefore, the idea
   imputed to us is clearly an invention of the adversary. No, Beloved, a
   man, if he is, indeed, a Believer in Christ, will not live after the
   will of the flesh!

   When he does fall into sin, it will be his grief and misery--and he
   will never rest till he is cleansed from guilt. But I will say this of
   the Believer, that if he could live as he would like to live, he would
   live a perfect life. If you ask him if, after believing, he may live as
   he wishes, he will reply, "Would God I could live as I wish, for I
   desire to live altogether without sin! I would be perfect, even as my
   Father in Heaven is perfect." The doctrine is not the licentious idea
   that a Believer may live in sin, but that he cannot and will not do so!
   This is the doctrine and we, first, will prove it. Secondly, in the
   Puritanical sense of the word, we will briefly improve it by drawing
   two spiritual lessons from it.

   I. LET US PROVE THE DOCTRINE. Please follow me with your Bibles open.
   You, dear Friends, have, most of you, received as a matter of faith the
   Doctrines of Grace and, therefore, to you the doctrine of Final
   Perseverance cannot require any proving, because it follows from all
   the other doctrines. We believe that God has an elect people whom He
   has chosen unto eternal life and that Truth of God necessarily involves
   the perseverance in Grace. We believe in special redemption and this
   secures the salvation and consequent perseverance of the redeemed.

   We believe in effectual calling, which is bound up with
   justification--a justification which ensures glorification. The
   Doctrines of Grace are like a chain--if you believe in one of them you
   must believe the next, for each one involves the rest--therefore I say
   that you who accept any of the doctrines of Grace must receive this,
   also, as involved in them. But I am about to try to prove this to those
   who do not believe the Doctrines of Grace. I would not argue in a
   circle and prove one thing which you doubt by another thing which you
   doubt, but, "to the Law and to the Testimony," to the actual Words of
   Scripture we shall refer the matter.

   Before we advance to the argument, it will be well to remark that those
   who reject the doctrine frequently tell us that there are many cautions
   in the Word of God against apostatizing and that those cautions can
   have no meaning if it is true that the righteous shall hold on his way.
   But what if those cautions are the means, in the hand of God, of
   keeping His people from wandering? What if they are used to excite a
   holy fear in the minds of His children and so become the means of
   preventing the evil which they denounce? I would also remind you that
   in the Epistle to the Hebrews, which contains the most solemn warnings
   against apostasy, the Apostle always takes care to add words which show
   that he did not believe that those whom he warned would actually
   apostatize.

   Turn to Hebrews 6:9. He has been telling these Hebrews that if those
   who had been once enlightened should fall away, it would be impossible
   to renew them again into repentance and he adds, "But, Beloved, we are
   persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation,
   though we thus speak." In the 10th chapter he gives an equally earnest
   warning, declaring that those who should do despite to the Spirit of
   Grace are worthy of worse punishment than those who despised Moses'
   Law, but he closes the chapter with these words, "Now the just shall
   live by faith; but if any man draws back, My soul shall have no
   pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition;
   but of them that believe to the saving of the soul." Thus he shows what
   the consequences of apostasy would be, but he is convinced that they
   will not choose to incur such a fearful doom.

   Again, objectors sometimes mention instances of apostasy which are
   mentioned in the Word of God, but on looking into them it will be
   discovered that these are cases of persons who did but profess to know
   Christ, but were not really possessors of the Divine Life. John, in His
   first Epistle, 2:19, fully describes these apostates--"They went out
   from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they
   would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out, that they
   might be made manifest that they were not all of us." The same is true
   of that memorable passage in John, where our

   Savior speaks of branches of the vine which are cut off and cast into
   the fire--these are described as branches in Christ that bear no fruit!
   Are those real Christians? How can they be so if they bear no fruit?
   "By their fruits you shall know them." The branch which bears fruit is
   purged, but it is never cut off! Those which bear no fruit are not
   figures of true Christians, but they fitly represent mere professors.
   Our Lord, in Matthew 7:22, tells us concerning many who will say in
   that day "Lord, Lord," that He will reply, "I never knew you." Not, "I
   have forgotten you," but, "I never knew you"-- they were never really
   His disciples.

   But now to the argument itself. First, we argue the Perseverance of the
   Saints most distinctly from the nature of the life which is imparted at
   regeneration. What does Peter say concerning this life? In 1 Peter 1:23
   he speaks of the people of God as "being born again, not of corruptible
   seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which lives and abides
   forever." The new life which is planted in us, when we are born again,
   is not like the fruit of our first birth, for that is subject to
   mortality. No, it is a Divine principle which cannot die nor be corrupt
   and, if it is so, then he who possesses it must live forever! He must,
   indeed, be evermore with the Spirit of God--regeneration has made him
   so!

   In 1 John 3:9 we have the same thought in another form. "Whoever is
   born of God does not commit sin, for His seed remains in him and he
   cannot sin because he is born of God." That is to say, the bent of the
   Christian's life is not towards sin. It would not be a fair description
   of his life that he lives in sin--on the contrary, he fights and
   contends against sin because he has an inner principle which cannot
   sin. The new life sins not--it is born of God and cannot
   transgress--and though the old nature wars against it, yet does the new
   life so prevail in the Christian that he is kept from living in sin.
   Our Savior, in His simple teaching of the Gospel to the Samaritan
   woman, said to her (John 4:13), "Whoever drinks of this water shall
   thirst again; but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him
   shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him
   a well of water springing up into everlasting life."

   Now, if our Savior taught this to a sinful and ignorant woman at His
   first interview with her, I take it that this doctrine is not to be
   reserved for the inner circle of full-grown saints, but to be preached
   among the common people and to be held up as a most blessed privilege!
   If you receive the Grace which Jesus imparts to your souls, it shall be
   like the good part which Mary chose--it shall not be taken away from
   you! It shall abide in you, not as the water in a cistern, but as a
   living fountain springing up unto everlasting life.

   We all know that the life given in the new birth is intimately
   connected with faith. Now, faith is, in itself, a conquering principle.
   In the First Epistle of John, which is a great treasury of argument (1
   John 5:4) we are told, "Whatever is born of God overcomes the world.
   And this is the victory that overcomes the world--our faith. Who is he
   that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of
   God?" See, then, that which is born of God in us, namely, the new life,
   is a conquering principle--there is no hint given that it can ever be
   defeated! And faith, which is its outward sign, is, also, in itself,
   triumphant forevermore! Therefore, because God has implanted such a
   wondrous life in us in bringing us out of darkness into His marvelous
   light, He has begotten us, again, unto a lively hope by the
   resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. And because the eternal and
   ever-blessed Spirit has come to dwell in us, we conclude that the
   Divine Life within us shall never die. "The righteous shall hold on his
   way."

   The second argument to which I shall call your attention shall be drawn
   from our Lord's own express declarations. Here we shall look to the
   Gospel of John, again, and in that blessed third of John, where our
   Lord was explaining the Gospel in the simplest possible style to
   Nicodemus, we find Him laying great stress upon the fact that the life
   received by faith in Himself is eternal. Look at that precious verse,
   the fourteenth--"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
   so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that whoever believes in Him
   should not perish, but have eternal life." Do men, therefore, believe
   in Him and yet perish? Do they believe in Him and receive a spiritual
   life which comes to an end? It cannot be, for, "God gave His only
   begotten Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish." But he
   would perish if he did not persevere to the end and, therefore, he must
   persevere to the end!

   The Believer has eternal life--how then can he die so as to cease to be
   a Believer? If he does not abide in Christ, he evidently does not have
   eternal life--therefore he shall abide in Christ, even to the end. "For
   God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
   whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
   To this, some reply that a man may have everlasting life and lose it.
   To which we answer, the words cannot mean that! Such a statement is a
   self-evident contradiction! If the life is lost, the man is dead! How,
   then, did he have everlasting life? It is

   clear that he had a life which lasted only for a while--he certainly
   did not have everlasting life, for if he had it, he must live forever!
   "He that believes on the Son has everlasting life" (John 3:36).

   The saints in Heaven have eternal life and no one expects them to
   perish! Their life is eternal--and eternal life is eternal
   life--whether the person possessing it dwells on earth or in Heaven! I
   need not read all the passages in which the same Truth of God is taught
   but further on, in John 6:47, our Lord told the Jews, "Verily, verily,
   I say unto you, he that believes on Me has everlasting life." Not
   temporary life, but, "everlasting life." And in the 51st verse He said,
   "I am the living bread which came down from Heaven. If any man eats of
   this bread, he shall live forever." Then comes that famous declaration
   of the Lord Jesus Christ, which, if there were no other at all, would
   be quite sufficient to prove our point-- John 10:28--"And I give unto
   My sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall
   anyone" (the word, "man," is not in the original) "pluck them out of my
   hand. My Father, which gave them to Me, is greater than all, and no one
   is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand."

   What can He mean but this, that He has grasped His people and that He
   means to hold them securely in His mighty

   hand?--

   "Where is the power can reach us there, Or what can pluck us from
   there?" Over and above the hand of Jesus which was pierced comes the
   hand of the Omnipotent Father as a sort of second grasp. "My Father,
   which gave them to Me, is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck
   them out of My Father's hand." Surely this must show that the saints
   are secure from anything and everything which would destroy them and,
   consequently, safe from total apostasy. Another passage speaks to the
   same effect--it is to be found in Matthew 24:24, where the Lord Jesus
   has been speaking of the false prophets that should deceive many.
   "There shall arise false christs and false prophets, and they shall
   show great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, to
   deceive the very elect."

   This shows that it is impossible for the elect to be deceived by them.
   Of Christ's sheep it is said, "A stranger will they not follow, for
   they know not the voice of strangers," but by Divine instinct they know
   the voice of the Good Shepherd and they follow Him. Thus has our Savior
   declared, as plainly as words possibly can express, that those who are
   His people possess eternal life within themselves and shall not perish
   but shall enter into everlasting happiness. "The righteous shall hold
   on his way."

   A very blessed argument for the safety of the Believer is found in our
   Lord's intercession. You need not turn to the passage, for you know it
   well, which shows the connection between the living intercession of
   Christ and the perseverance of His people--"Therefore, also, He is able
   to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever
   lives to make intercession for them" (Heb. 7:25). Our Lord Jesus is not
   dead! He has risen! He has gone up into Glory and now, before the
   eternal Throne, He pleads the merit of His perfect work! And as He
   pleads there for all His people whose names are written on His
   heart--as the names of Israel were written on the jeweled breastplate
   of the high priest--His intercession saves His people even to the
   uttermost!

   If you would like an illustration of it you must turn to the case of
   Peter which is recorded in Luke 22:31 where our Lord said, "Simon,
   Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as
   wheat; but I have prayed for you that your faith fail not; and when you
   are restored, strengthen your brethren." The intercession of Christ
   does not save His people from being tried, or tempted, or tossed up and
   down like wheat in a sieve. It does not save them, even, from a measure
   of sin and sorrow. But it does save them from total apostasy. Peter was
   kept and though he denied his Master, yet it was an exception to the
   great rule of his life. By Grace he did hold on his way, because not
   only then, but many a time beside, though he sinned, he had an Advocate
   with the Father--Jesus Christ the Righteous!

   If you desire to know how Jesus pleads, read at your leisure at home
   that wonderful 17th of John--the Lord's prayer. What a prayer it is!
   "While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name; those
   that You gave Me I have kept and none of them is lost, but the son of
   perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled." Judas was lost, but
   he was only given to Christ as an Apostle and not as one of His sheep.
   He had a temporary faith and maintained a temporary profession--he
   never had eternal life or he would have lived on. Those groans and
   cries of the Savior which accompanied His pleas in Gethsemane were
   heard in Heaven and answered. "Holy Father, keep through Your own name
   those whom You have given Me." The Lord keeps them by His Word and
   Spirit--and will keep them!

   If the prayer of Christ in Gethsemane were answered, how much more that
   which now goes up from the eternal Throne itself!--

   "With cries and tears He offered up

   His humble suit below.

   But with authority He asks,

   Enthroned in Glory, now.

   For all that come to God by Him,

   Salvation He demands.

   Points to their names upon His breast,

   And spreads His wounded hands." Ah, if my Lord Jesus pleads for me, I
   cannot be afraid of earth or Hell! That living, intercessory Voice has
   power to keep the saints and so has the living Lord Himself, for He has
   said--"Because I live you shall live also" (John 14:19).

   Now for a fourth argument. We gather sure confidence of the
   perseverance of the saints from the Character and work of Christ. I
   will say little about that, for I trust my Lord is so well known to you
   that He needs no word of commendation from me to you. But if you know
   Him, you will say what the Apostle does in 2 Timothy 1:12-- "I know
   whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that
   which I have committed unto Him against that day." He did not say, "I
   know in whom I have believed," as most people quote it, but, "I know
   whom I have believed." He knew Jesus! He knew His heart and His
   faithfulness! He knew His Atonement and its power! He knew His
   intercession and its might and he committed his soul to Jesus by an act
   of faith--and he felt secure.

   My Lord is so excellent in all things that I need give you but one
   glimpse of His Character and you will see what He was when He dwelt
   here among men. At the commencement of John 13 we read, "Having loved
   His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the end." If He had
   not loved His disciples to the end when here, we might conclude that He
   was changeable now as then--but if He loved His chosen to the end while
   yet in His humiliation below--it brings us the sweet and blessed
   confidence that now that He is in Heaven He will love to the end all
   those who confide in Him. Fifthly, we infer the perseverance of the
   saints from the tenor of the Covenant of Grace.

   Would you like to read it for yourselves? If so, turn to the Old
   Testament, Jeremiah 32, and there you will find the Covenant of Grace
   set forth at some length. We shall only be able to read the 40th verse:
   "And I will make an Everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not
   turn away from them, to do them good; but I put My fear in their
   hearts, that they shall not depart from Me." He will not depart from
   them and they shall not depart from Him--what can be a greater
   assurance of their perseverance even to the end?

   Now that this is the Covenant of Grace under which we live is clear
   from the Epistle to the Hebrews, for the Apostle, in the 8th chapter,
   quotes that passage to this very end. The question runs thus--"Behold,
   the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new Covenant with the
   house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the
   Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by
   the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continued
   not in My Covenant, and I regarded them not, says the Lord. For this is
   the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those
   days, says the Lord; I will put My Laws into their mind, and write them
   in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a
   people."

   The old Covenant had an "if" in it, and so it suffered shipwreck. It
   was--"If you will be obedient, then you shall be blessed" and,
   therefore, there came a failure on man's part and the whole Covenant
   ended in disaster. It was the Covenant of Works and under it we were in
   bondage until we were delivered from it and introduced to the Covenant
   of Grace, which has no "if" in it, but runs upon the strain of promise.
   It is, "I will," and, "you shall," all the way through. "I will be your
   God and you shall be My people." Glory be to God, this Covenant will
   never pass away, for see how the Lord declares its enduring character
   in the book of Isaiah (54:10)--"For the mountains shall depart, and the
   hills be removed; but My kindness shall not depart from you, neither
   shall the Covenant of My peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy
   on you."

   And again in Isaiah 55:3: "I will make an Everlasting Covenant with
   you, even the sure mercies of David." The idea of falling utterly away
   from Grace is a relic of the old legal spirit. It is a going away from
   Grace to come under Law, again, and I charge you who have once been
   emancipated slaves and have had the fetters of legal bondage struck
   from off your hands, never consent to wear those bonds again! Christ
   has saved you, if, indeed, you are believers in Him. He has

   not saved you for a week, or a month, or a quarter, or a year, or 20
   years, but He has given you eternal life and you shall never
   perish--neither shall any pluck you out of His hands. Rejoice in this
   blessed Covenant of Grace!

   The sixth most forcible argument is drawn from the faithfulness of God.
   Look at Romans 11:29. What does the Apostle say there, speaking by the
   Holy Spirit? "For the gifts and calling of God are irrevocable," which
   means that He does not give life and pardon to a man and call him by
   Grace and afterwards repent of what He has done and withdraw the good
   things which He has bestowed. "God is not a man, that He should lie;
   neither the son of man, that He should repent." When He puts forth His
   hands to save, He does not withdraw them till the work is accomplished.
   His Word is, "I am the Lord, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob
   are not consumed" (Mal. 3:6). "The Strength of Israel will not lie nor
   repent" (1 Sam. 15:29).

   The Apostle would have us ground our confidence of perseverance upon
   the confirmation which Divine faithfulness is sure to bestow upon us.
   He says in 1 Corinthians 1:8, "Who shall, also, confirm you unto the
   end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God
   is faithful, by whom you were called unto the fellowship of His Son
   Jesus Christ our Lord." And again he speaks to the same effect in 1
   Thessalonians 5:24, "Faithful is He that calls you, who, also, will do
   it." It was of old the will of God to save the people whom He gave to
   Jesus and from this He has never turned, for our Lord said, "And this
   is the Father's will which has sent Me, that of all which He has given
   Me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day"
   (John 6:39). Thus you see from these passages, and there are numbers of
   others, that God's faithfulness secures the preservation of His people
   and, "the righteous shall hold on his way."

   The seventh and last argument shall be drawn from what has already been
   done in us. I shall do little more than quote the Scriptures and leave
   them to sink into your minds. A blessed passage is that in Jeremiah
   31:3--"The Lord has appeared of old unto me, saying, yes, I have loved
   you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness have I
   drawn you." If He did not mean that His love should be everlasting, He
   would never have drawn us at all! But because that love is everlasting,
   therefore with loving kindness has He drawn us. The Apostle argues this
   in a very elaborate manner in Romans 5:9, 10--"Much more then, being
   now justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.
   For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of
   His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."

   I cannot stop to show how every word of this passage is emphatic, but
   it is--if God reconciled us when we were enemies, He certainly will
   save us, now we are His friends. And if our Lord Jesus has reconciled
   us by His death, much more will He save us by His life, so that we may
   be certain He will not leave nor forsake those whom He has called. Do
   you need me to bring to your minds that golden chapter, the 8th of
   Romans, the noblest of all language that was ever written by human pen?
   "Whom He did foreknow, He, also, did predestinate to be conformed to
   the image of His Son. Moreover, whom He did predestinate, them He,
   also, called; and whom He called, them He, also, justified; and whom He
   justified, them He, also, glorified."

   There is no break in the chain between Justification and Glory! And no
   supposable breakage can occur, for the Apostle puts that out of all
   possibility, by saying, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's
   elect? It is God that justifies. Who is he that condemns? It is Christ
   that died, yes, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right
   hand of God, who, also, makes intercession for us. Who shall separate
   us from the love of Christ?" Then he heaps on all the things that might
   be supposed to separate, and says, "For I am persuaded, that neither
   death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
   present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
   creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
   Christ Jesus our Lord."

   In the same manner the Apostle writes in Philippians 1:6--"Being
   confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you
   will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." I cannot stay to
   mention the many other Scriptures in which what has been done is made
   an argument that the work shall be completed, but it is after the
   manner of the Lord to go through with whatever He undertakes. "He will
   give Grace and glory," and perfect that which concerns us. One
   marvelous privilege which has been bestowed upon us is of peculiar
   significance--we are one with Christ by close, vital, spiritual union.
   We are taught of the Spirit that we enjoy a marriage union with Christ
   Jesus our Lord--shall that union be dissolved?

   We are married to Him! Has He ever given a bill of divorce? There has
   never been a case where the heavenly Bridegroom divorced from His heart
   a chosen soul to whom He has been united in the bonds of Grace! Listen
   to these words from the prophecy of Hosea 2:19, 20--"And I will betroth
   you unto Me forever; yes, I will betroth you unto Me in righteousness,
   and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and in mercies. I will even
   betroth you unto Me in faithfulness; and you shall know the Lord." This
   marvelous union is set forth by the figure of the head and the body--we
   are members of the body of Christ. Do the members of His body rot away?
   Is Christ amputated? Is He fitted with new limbs as old ones are lost?

   No, being members of this body, we shall not be divided from Him. "He
   that is joined unto the Lord," says the Apostle, "is one spirit," and
   if we are made one spirit with Christ, that mysterious union does not
   allow for the supposition, even, of a separation! The Lord has worked
   another great work upon us, for He has sealed us by the Holy Spirit.
   The possession of the Holy Spirit is the Divine seal which sooner or
   later is set upon all the chosen. There are many passages in which that
   seal is spoken of and is described as being an earnest, an earnest of
   the inheritance. But how can it be an earnest if after receiving it, we
   do not attain the purchased possession? Think over the words of the
   Apostle in 2 Corinthians 1:21, 22--"Now He who establishes us with you
   in Christ and has anointed us is God, who also has sealed us and given
   us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee."

   To the same effect the Holy Spirit speaks in Ephesians 1:13, 14--"In
   whom you, also, trusted, after that you heard the Word of Truth, the
   Gospel of your salvation, in whom, also, after that you believed, you
   were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of
   our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto
   the praise of His glory." Beloved, we feel certain that if the Spirit
   of God dwells in us, He that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead will
   keep our souls and will, also, quicken our mortal bodies and present us
   complete before the Glory of His face at the last.

   Therefore we sum up the argument with the confident expression of the
   Apostle when he said (2 Tim. 4:18), "The Lord shall deliver me from
   every evil work and will preserve me unto His heavenly kingdom. To Him
   be glory forever and ever. Amen."

   II. Now, how shall we IMPROVE THE DOCTRINE OF THE FINAL PERSEVERANCE OF
   THE SAINTS

   PRACTICALLY? The first improvement is for encouragement to the man who
   is on the road to Heaven. "The righteous shall hold on his way." If I
   had to take a very long journey, say from London to John o' Groats,
   with my poor tottering limbs to carry me, and such a weight to carry,
   too, I might begin to despair and, indeed, the very first day's walking
   would knock me out. But if I had a Divine assurance unmistakably
   saying, "You will hold on your way and you will get to your journey's
   end," I feel that I would brace myself up to achieve the task.

   One might hardly undertake a difficult journey if he did not believe
   that he would finish it. But the sweet assurance that we shall reach
   our home makes us pluck up courage. The weather is wet, rainy,
   blusterous--but we must keep on, for the end is sure. The road is very
   rough and runs up hill and down dale. We pant for breath and our limbs
   are aching--but as we shall get to our journey's end, we push on. We
   are ready to creep into some cottage and lie down to die of weariness,
   saying, "I shall never accomplish my task." But the confidence which we
   have received sets us on our feet and off we go again! To the
   right-hearted man the assurance of success is the best stimulus for
   labor.

   If it is so, that I shall overcome the world, that I shall conquer sin,
   that I shall not be an apostate, that I shall not give up my faith,
   that I shall not fling away my shield, that I shall come home a
   conqueror--then will I play the man and fight like hero! This is one of
   the reasons why British troops have so often won the fight, because the
   drummer boys did not know how to beat a retreat and the rank and file
   did not believe in the possibility of defeat! They were beaten
   oftentimes by the French, so the French tell us, but they would not
   believe it and, therefore, would not run away! They felt like winning
   and so they stood like solid rocks amidst the dread artillery of the
   foe till victory was declared on their side.

   Brothers and Sisters, we shall do the same if we realize that we are
   preserved in Christ Jesus--kept by the power of God through faith unto
   salvation! Every true Believer shall be a conqueror and, therefore, the
   reason for warring a good warfare. There is laid up for us in Heaven a
   crown of life that fades not. The crown is laid up for us and not for
   chance comers. The crown reserved for me is such that no one else can
   wear it! And if it is so, then will I battle and strive to the end,
   till the last enemy is overcome and death, itself, is dead.

   Another improvement is this--what an encouragement this is to sinners
   who desire salvation. It should lead them to come and receive it with
   grateful delight. Those who deny this doctrine offer sinners a poor two
   penny-halfpenny salvation not worth having--and it is no marvel that
   they turn away from it. As the Pope gave England to the Spanish
   king--if he could get it--so do they proffer Christ's salvation if a
   man will deserve it by his own faithfulness. According to some, eternal
   life is given to you, but then it may not be eternal! You may fall from
   it. It may last only for a time.

   When I was but a child I used to trouble myself because I saw some of
   my young companions who were a little older than myself, when they
   became apprentices and came to London, become vicious. I have heard
   their mother's laments and seen their tears. I have heard their fathers
   expressing bitterest sorrow over the boys whom I knew in my class to be
   quite as good as ever I had been--and it used to strike me with horror
   that perhaps I might sin as they had done! They became
   Sabbath-breakers--in one case there was a theft from the till to go
   into Sunday pleasuring. I dreaded the very thought!

   I desired to maintain an unsullied character and when I heard that if I
   gave my heart to Christ, He would keep me, that was the very thing
   which won me! It seemed to be a celestial life assurance for my
   character, that if I would really trust Christ with myself, He would
   save me from the errors of youth, preserve me amid the temptations of
   manhood and keep me to the end. I was charmed with the thought that if
   I was made righteous by believing in Christ Jesus I should hold on my
   way by the power of the Holy Spirit.

   That which charmed me in my boyhood is even more attractive to me in
   middle life! I am happy to preach to you a sure and everlasting
   salvation! I feel that I have something to bring before you, this
   morning, which is worthy of every sinner's eager acceptance. I have
   neither an, "if," nor a, "but," with which to dilute the pure Gospel of
   my message! Here it is--"He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved." I dropped a piece of ice upon the floor yesterday and I said to
   one who was in the room, "Is not that a diamond?" "Ah," he said, "you
   would not leave it on the floor, I guarantee you, if it were a diamond
   of that size."

   Now I have a diamond here--eternal life, everlasting life! I pray you
   will be in haste to take it up at once, to be saved now, to be saved in
   living, to be saved in dying, to be saved in rising again, forever and
   ever, by the eternal power and infinite love of God! Is not this worth
   having? Grasp at it, poor Soul! You may have it if you but believe in
   Jesus Christ, or, in other words, trust your soul with Him. Deposit
   your eternal destiny in this Divine bank--then you can say--"I know
   whom I have believed and I am persuaded that He is able to keep that
   which I have committed to Him against that day." The Lord bless you,
   for Christ's sake. Amen.

Mourning For Christ

   (No. 1362)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 1, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of
   Jerusalem, the Spirit of Grace and of supplications. And they shall
   look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, as
   one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for Him, as one
   that is in bitterness for his firstborn." Zechariah 12:10.

   Look, Beloved, from where every good thing flows--"I will pour upon the
   house of David the Spirit of Grace." The starting point is the Lord's
   sovereign act in giving the Spirit! Every work of Grace begins with
   God! No gracious thought or act ever originates in the free will of
   unregenerate man. The Lord is first in all things which are acceptable
   in His sight. It is God that "works in us to will and to do of His own
   good pleasure." "You have worked all our works in us." Then notice how
   exceedingly effectual the work of the Lord is. Men may persuade and
   even inspired Prophets may warn without effect, but when the Lord puts
   His hand to the work, He never fails! As soon as He says, "I will
   pour," the next sentence is, "and they shall look."

   When He works, who shall hinder? His people shall be willing in the day
   of His power! "They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and they
   shall mourn." This is effectual calling, indeed! In such results we see
   what is the exceeding greatness of His power to usward who believe
   according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ
   when He raised Him from the dead. Observe, thirdly, the dignity and the
   prominent position which is occupied by faith. "I will pour upon them
   the Spirit of supplication and they shall look." Faith is evidently
   intended here, for faith is always that glance of the eyes which brings
   us the blessing which Christ has to bestow. "As Moses lifted up the
   serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
   that whoever believes in Him should not perish." A look at the bronze
   serpent healed Israel and, according to the figure, believing in Jesus
   Christ is a saving look.

   Now, this look of faith is mentioned as the first fruit of the
   Spirit--before they mourn, they look. When the Spirit of Grace and
   supplication is given, its principal result is looking unto Jesus. But
   now see what a choice fruit follows upon faith--a soft, sweet, mellow
   fruit of the Spirit--"They shall mourn for Him as one that mourns for
   his only son." This sorrow is a sweet bitter, a delicious grief full of
   all manner of rare excellencies! It is a peculiar order of mourning and
   differs greatly from the sorrow of the world which works death. Those
   who mourn in this fashion are made sorry after a godly manner, for
   godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be lost forever.

   Mark, it is godly sorrow or repentance towards God. Its specialty is
   that it looks Godward and weeps because of grieving Him. The
   lamentation described in the text is a mourning for Christ. "And I will
   pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
   the Spirit of Grace and of supplications. And they shall look upon Me
   whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him as one mourns for
   his only son, and shall be in bitterness for Him, as one that is in
   bitterness for his firstborn."

   This is a very remarkable peculiarity of true Spirit-worked repentance.
   It fixes its eyes mainly upon the wrong done to the Lord by its sin. No
   other repentance but that which is evangelical looks in that direction.
   The repentance of ungodly men is a horror at their punishment, an alarm
   at the dire result of their transgressions. They repent like Esau, not
   of eating the pottage, but of losing the birthright. They see sin only
   in reference to themselves and their fellow men--its higher bearings in
   reference to the Lord they quite ignore. The ungodly, at times, and
   especially in the hour of death, feel remorse, but it has nothing to do
   with God unless it is that they tremble at His justice and fear the
   punishment which He executes. It is, after all, pure selfishness! They
   are sorry because they are about to suffer the consequences of their
   rebellion.

   Evangelical repentance sympathizes with the Great Father and grieves
   that He should have been so sadly provoked. See it in David--"Against
   You only have I sinned, and done this evil in Your sight." See it in
   the prodigal--"Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you, and
   am no more worthy to be called your son." See how it was worked in Saul
   of Tarsus, for the voice from Heaven said, "Saul, Saul, why do you
   persecute Me?" It was sin as against the exalted Savior which struck
   home to Paul's heart and laid him low at the feet of his Lord. All true
   repentance has this for its special mark, that it is attended with
   evident reconciliation to God since it now regrets the wrongs done to
   Him. One sure seal of its genuine spirituality is that it is a
   lamentation on account of the dishonor which sin has done to God and to
   His Christ.

   We are going to view the special case before us from that point of view
   and work it out in three or four ways. I. First, according to our text,
   when the Spirit of Grace is given, THERE WILL BE A SPECIAL MOURNING FOR
   CHRIST ON THE PART OF ISRAEL. You must take the text in its primary
   significance, for we must treat the Word of God fairly. There will come
   a day when the ancient people of God, who have so long rejected Jesus
   of Nazareth, will discover Him to be the Messiah and then one of their
   first feelings will be that of deep humiliation and bitter regret
   before God. They will mourn as at the mourning of Hadadrimmon, when the
   Beloved Josiah fell in battle, and all good men knew that the light of
   the nation was quenched. "The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of
   the Lord, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, under his shadow we
   shall live among the heathen."

   They justly mourned for pious Josiah, for he was the last of their
   godly kings and the full shower of wrath from the evil to come began to
   fall upon Judah when he was taken. Right well, also, will it be for
   them to mourn bitterly as a nation, when they discern the Lord whom
   they have pierced, for is there not a cause? They had a peculiar
   interest in the Messiah, for it was to them and almost to them, only,
   that His coming was clearly revealed. God spoke of Him to Abraham,
   Isaac, Jacob and the fathers. It was from their race that the Messiah
   was to come. It is no small honor to Abraham's seed that the Man,
   Christ Jesus, is one of them!

   It was a Judean virgin of whom He was born and to Israel He is, indeed,
   bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh. When He came on earth, He
   confined His ministry to them. Of them He said, "I am not sent except
   to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." He healed their sick. He
   opened the eyes of their blind ones and raised their dead. It was in
   their streets that He delivered His gracious messages of love. And when
   He was gone, it was in their chief city that the preaching of the
   Gospel began and the Holy Spirit was poured out. "Go you and teach all
   nations," He said, "beginning at Jerusalem."

   It was from among the Jews that the first vanguard of the Church's host
   was chosen. The first to preach the Gospel were of the house of Israel
   and they might have been to this day in the very front of the army,
   peculiarly adapted as they are, in many respects, to lead the way in
   the teaching of a pure faith--but they judged themselves unworthy and,
   therefore, the ministers of Christ, though chosen from them, were
   obliged to say--"We turn unto the Gentiles." Then came their casting
   away, for a time, during which season their own Messiah was despised
   and blasphemed by the nation which ought to have received Him with
   exultation. "He came unto His own, and His own received Him not."

   Their rejection of the Lord Jesus was most determined and carried to
   the utmost length. It was not sufficient for that generation in which
   Jesus lived to turn a deaf ear to His admonitions--they must seek His
   life! Once they would have cast Him headlong from the brow of a hill.
   At another time they took up stones to stone Him and, at last, they did
   take Him and bear false witness against Him, fiercely seeking His
   blood. By their malice He was given over to the Romans and put to
   death, not because the Romans desired to slay Him, but because the
   clamor of the multitude was, "Crucify Him, crucify Him!" and their
   voices prevailed with Pilate. They imprecated on their heads His blood,
   saying, "His blood be on us and on our children."

   They pushed the rejection of the King of the Jews to the utmost
   possible extreme, for they rested not till He hung upon the shameful
   tree and life remained no more in Him. Peter said, "And now, Brethren,
   I know that through ignorance you did it, as did, also, your rulers."
   How bitterly, then, will they lament when that ignorance is removed!
   They will mourn as one who has lost his firstborn and only child, as
   for a loss never to be repaired. Worse still was this, that their
   ignorance was, to a large extent, willful, for Jesus was rejected by
   them against the clearest possible light. John came as a voice crying
   in the wilderness and all men knew that John was a Prophet. Those who
   most hated Jesus of

   Nazareth were yet afraid to say that John was not sent of God. Yet he
   bore witness of Jesus and said, "Behold the Lamb of God, which takes
   away the sin of the world."

   Moreover, Jesus Himself spoke as never any man spoke--His teachings
   carried their own evidence within themselves, so that He justly said,
   "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now
   they have no excuse for their sin." His words were accompanied, also,
   with signs and wonders by which He proved His Deity and His Father's
   pleasure in Him, so that He said, "If I had not done among them the
   works which no other man did, they had not had sin; but now have they
   both seen and hated both Me and My Father." In memory of this He stood
   and wept over Jerusalem, saying, "How often would I have gathered your
   children together as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and
   you would not." What agony will tear their hearts when they perceive
   how blinded they were and how they despised their own mercies!

   One great reason for the bitter mourning of restored and believing
   Israel will be the long ratification of this rejection of Christ by
   generation after generation. Nearly 1,900 years have passed since
   Calvary's Cross was erected, but they still reject the Nazarene. Alas,
   poor Israelites! The veil is still upon their faces though Moses is
   read in their synagogues every Jewish Sabbath. Alas for the sorrowing
   seed of Jacob, still waiting with their wailing hymns, for the coming
   of the Messiah who has already come, but who was "despised and
   rejected" of His own people and made by them "a Man of Sorrows and
   acquainted with grief! They will mourn as over the grave of an only
   child when they come to know that Jesus of Nazareth was, indeed, the
   virgin-born Emmanuel, God With Us! They will wring their hands and seek
   to blot out the pages of their history with tears because they did so
   despitefully maltreat and so obstinately reject their Lord, the Prince
   of the house of David! If another Jeremiah shall be found to lead the
   singing men and singing women in their lamentations, he will have no
   need to look long for subjects for his laments. Looking to Him whom
   they pierced, the whole house of Israel will weep bitterly!

   And now, dear Brothers and Sisters, it will tend to increase the
   blessed sorrows which will then sweep over Israel to think how the Lord
   has had patience with them and still has never cast them away! To this
   day they are as distinct a people as ever they were! They dwell
   alone--they are not numbered among the people. Persecuted almost beyond
   conception, poor Israel, for many a century, has been the butt and jest
   of those--I am ashamed to say it--who called themselves Christians and
   yet despised the chosen people of the Lord! Alas, the precious sons of
   Zion, comparable to fine gold, have been esteemed as earthen pitchers,
   the work of the hands of the potter! "How has the Lord covered the
   daughter of Zion with a cloud in His anger and cast down from Heaven
   unto the earth the beauty of Israel!"

   They have, for centuries, endured a terrible chastening! They have been
   turned upside down and wiped as when a man wipes a dish, but still they
   stand waiting for a vainly expected king. They would not have their
   true King, Jesus the Son of David, and they have no other--where is
   there any king of the Jews? The scepter has departed from Jacob and the
   lawgiver from between his feet, for Shiloh has come, even He who, as He
   hung upon the Cross, was thrice named, "King of the Jews." JESUS is the
   only King of the Jews! And they are preserved and kept alive
   notwithstanding a thousand influences which threatened to make them
   lose their nationality.

   They shall yet be gathered again and their restoration shall be the
   fullness of the Gentiles--and we and they shall rejoice together in Him
   who has made both one, and broken down the middle wall or partition, so
   that there is now neither Jew nor Gentile, barbarous Scythian, bond nor
   free--but we are all one in Christ Jesus!

   II. I now come to more personal matters. In the second place THERE IS A
   GENERAL MOURNING WHICH GOD

   GIVES TO HIS CHURCH ON BEHALF OF CHRIST--a mourning which is only known
   and manifested when the

   Spirit of Grace and supplication is fully poured out. I wish we might
   have a large measure of that mourning at this present hour. Let us
   deplore at this time, beloved Brothers and Sisters, that Jesus Christ,
   by the great mass of men, is treated with utter indifference, if not
   with contempt!

   Where are the multitudes, even, of our own city at this present moment?
   There are many gathered in places of worship to sing hymns in the
   Redeemer's praise, but there are many, many thousands in this city--I
   have even heard it said that there are millions of people who seldom,
   if ever, enter within the walls of a House of God. Jesus has suffered
   and bled to death for men who, when they hear of it, treat His loving
   Sacrifice as an idle tale. He is not quite unknown, I hope, to any of
   our city--some tidings of Him must have reached their ears--but they
   scarcely have enough curiosity to enquire more about it.

   Their little children go home from school and sing to them on the
   Lord's Day and so they have sweetly sounded in their ears the "old, old
   story" of redeeming love, but ah, they break the Sabbath--they make it
   a day of amusement and pleasure, or they spend it in sloth! The Bible
   is left unread, or read without interest in its Divine message. They
   have no care for the bleeding Lamb, no regard for their best Friend. If
   they do not sorrow about this, we ought to sorrow for them, for they
   are men and women like ourselves and they are living in contempt of our
   Lord Jesus! Some of them have many amiabilities--there is so much,
   indeed, of human excellence about them that we have deplored that the
   "one thing" which they lacked was not sought after by them! Yet they
   continue as they are and it is to be feared many of them will continue
   so till they perish!

   Weep not so much because Jesus suffered on the Cross, but because He is
   practically crucified every day by this carelessness and contempt! The
   Crucifixion at Calvary is over, now, and it is but the visible token of
   a crucifixion to which careless men and women are putting the Redeemer
   every day! They care nothing about Him--dead or alive He is nothing to
   them! At the thought of such unkindness will you not cry, "For these
   things I weep; my eyes, my eyes run down with water." Reflect
   sorrowfully, too, how the Lord Jesus has been ill treated and pierced
   and wounded by His opponents--and I mention here as among the chief of
   them, those who deny His Deity. At this moment there are men of great
   attainments and abilities who will extol our Lord's manhood and even
   profess to be in love with His Character, but they will not yield Him
   Divine honors!

   Oh, Son of God, to whom the Father bore witness by an audible voice out
   of Heaven, saying, "This is My Beloved Son, hear Him"--they reject the
   witness of God and so dishonor You! You did not count it robbery to be
   equal with God, but they gladly would pierce You in Your divinity and
   make you nothing but a man! Men, also, reject our Lord's Atonement. By
   many that Truth of God is obscured or utterly denied! I still hear the
   cry in many quarters, "Let Him come down from the Cross and we will
   believe on Him." Modern philosophers will accept anything except the
   bleeding Substitute for guilty man! When I think of the false doctrine
   which is preached about the Lord Jesus and how His Glory is tarnished
   by the lips of His professed ministers who think His Gospel a worn-out
   tale, I see that there is, indeed, occasion for us to get to our
   chambers and pour out our hearts in lamentation!

   Alas, my Lord, why are You thus blasphemed by the worldly wise? Why is
   Your Truth despised among the learned and ridiculed by the scribes? I
   do not know when my grief has been more stirred for my Lord and Master
   than when brought actually to see the superstition by which our holy
   faith is impregnated and His blessed name blasphemed! Turning from
   skepticism, where He is wounded in the house of His enemies, you come
   to superstition, where He is wounded in the house of His professed
   friends--and what wounds they are! I have felt, sometimes as if I could
   tear down the baby image held in the Virgin's hands when I have seen
   men and women prostrate before it!

   What? O you sons of Antichrist, could you not make an idol, like the
   Egyptians, out of your cats and dogs, or find your gods in your
   gardens? Could you not make a golden calf, as Israel did in the
   wilderness, or borrow the fantastic shapes of India's deities? Could
   nothing content you till the image of the holy Child Jesus should be
   made into an idol and Christ upon the Cross uplifted should be set up
   as an image for men to bow before? The idolatry which worships the
   image of the devil is less blasphemous than that which worships the
   image of Christ! It is an awful sacrilege to make the holy Jesus appear
   to be an accomplice in the violation of the Divine Commandment--yes,
   and to turn that blessed memorial of death into an idolatrous rite in
   which Divine honors are given to a piece of bread!

   Was there ever sin like unto this sin? O You, innocent Savior, it is
   grief, indeed, to think that You should be set up in the idol temple,
   among "saints," and that men should think that they are honoring Your
   Father by breaking His First and Second commandments! This must be to
   our Lord the most loathsome of all things under Heaven! How does He, in
   patience, bear it? Let not His people behold it without a mourning like
   the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon, because our
   blessed Christ is so blasphemed by Antichrist that the image of the
   Incarnate Son of God is set up as an object of idolatrous worship it
   its churches!

   There should be great sorrow and mourning when we read the history of
   the past and look, even, at the present, at the fearful wrongs which
   have been done in the name of Jesus. Jesus is all love and tenderness
   and yet they place His Cross upon the blood-stained banners of accursed
   war! Jesus, who said, "Put up your sword into its sheath, for they that
   take the sword shall perish with the sword," is, nevertheless, adjured
   to go forth with armed hosts to blow men to pieces with guns, or pierce
   them with bayonets! When the Spanish nation captured Peru and Mexico,
   it makes one's blood boil to

   read that while they murdered the defenseless people for their gold,
   they set up in every town the images of the holy Cross! What had the
   Cross to do with their murders and robberies?

   They tortured their victims in the name of Jesus and when they put them
   to death they held up before them the image of the crucified Jesus!
   What horrors have been worked in Your name, O Christ of God! Men have,
   indeed, pierced You and they who take Your name and call themselves,
   "the Society of Jesus," [Jesuits] have been chief enactors of these
   abominations! Your Crucifixion at Calvary is a small part of the
   matter, for the sons of men have gone on piercing You by maligning You
   infamously! You, Lord, of boundless love! And now, today, what is done
   in our land? I can scarcely stay to enlarge, but there are multitudes
   of things done in the name of the religion of Christ which are a
   dishonor to it!

   Under the pretense of guarding the interests of His Church, a certain
   community of professing Christians beg that their fellow Christians may
   not be buried within the same enclosure as themselves--indeed, Christ's
   name must sanction such un-Christly bigotry! One section of the Church
   must, also, be patronized and made dominant in the land--and this wrong
   is done in the name of Jesus! It is to honor Him that this crying
   injustice is perpetrated! Hear it, you heavens! There are multitudes of
   other things which I shall not mention for which the Christian Church
   ought perpetually to sorrow. That she does wrong is enough to make her
   humble--but that she has dared to do wrong often, in the very name of
   Jesus, is worst of all!

   Still, Brothers and Sisters, the worst sorrow, probably, for us all is
   that there should be so many professing Christians who act in a manner
   the very opposite to what Christ would have them do. The heathens
   everywhere point to our countrymen, who are supposed to be Christians,
   and they say of us that we are the most drunken race of men upon the
   face of the earth--and I suppose we are. Charges are brought against us
   which are supported by the conduct of our sailors and soldiers and
   others who go abroad which make the followers of Mohammed and the
   disciples of Brahmanism to think their religion superior to our own.
   These Englishmen are supposed to be Christians, though they are not!
   This is a great scandal and a grievous sorrow under the sun.

   And then in the very heart of it all lies this, that true Christians,
   those who are truly Christ's blood-bought, regenerated people,
   nevertheless do not sufficiently bring glory to His name. Where is the
   zeal of the Church--the all-consuming zeal of other days? Where is the
   consecration which ought to rest upon all members of Christ's
   blood-bought body? Where, I say, is that mightiness in prayer and
   supplication which, at the first, so gloriously prevailed? Where is
   that spirit of hearty love and unity, of brotherly kindness and
   compassion which ought to be seen in all Christians? The first Church
   brought great honor to the name of Christ--does the Church of today do
   the same? Do even the most spiritual portions of the Church bring to
   the Lord Jesus such honor and glory as He ought to have?

   You judge what I say! Are we not all unprofitable servants? Is there
   not cause for mourning and for great mourning, too, to think that Jesus
   should thus have been ill-treated by friends and foes? For Him, our
   best Beloved, perpetually pierced, the Church may well proclaim a fast
   and mourn before the Lord, as in the day of Hadadrimmon in the valley
   of Megiddon!

   III. Suffer, now, a word or two upon the third point, for THE TEXT
   SPEAKS OF A FAMILY MOURNING. It will be a very blessed day, indeed,
   when we see this--when the Spirit of Grace and supplication shall be
   largely poured out and the land shall mourn, every family apart. Have
   you ever seen this in your households? Where the Spirit of God really
   rests upon a family, there will be much of it and, surely, there is
   cause enough for it in some families where there is none at all. We
   ought to grieve to think that there has been such formality and
   coldness in family devotion. There is so little love to Jesus
   manifested in the morning and evening worship. I fear that there are
   professing families where daily prayer is altogether neglected!

   The individuals, I trust, pray in their chambers, but they have given
   up the assembling of themselves as families to worship in the name of
   Jesus. As families they are prayerless and dishonor the Lord. Herein is
   serious cause for sorrow, because our Lord loses, by this neglect, that
   which He delights in, namely, family praises. Families should, also,
   mourn because the Lord is not so regarded as He should be in family
   management. Christ is not made first and chief in family matters.
   Fathers look to the worldly prosperity of their boys in placing them
   out, rather than to their moral and spiritual advantage.

   Many a time marriages for the daughters are sought, not in the Lord,
   but solely in reference to pecuniary considerations. How much of the
   arrangement of the household ignores the existence of the Savior? As,
   for instance,

   much work done on the Sabbath which might be spared by a little care
   and thought and, consequent inability to go out to worship the Savior
   with the rest of God's people. There is a way of setting the Lord
   always before us in the management of household matters and, on the
   other hand, there is a way of so acting as to prove that God is not in
   the least considered. Family quarrels, family pride, family
   covetousness and family sins of all kinds bring shame upon our
   profession and dishonor upon the name with which we are named! This
   ought to cause great sorrow.

   If there are any members of a family unconverted, this should cause the
   whole household deep regret. If there is but one child unsaved, the
   whole should plead for him with tears. Happy are you who have all your
   household walking in the faith! But if there is one left out, weep not
   for the dead, neither bewail him, but weep for the living who is dead
   unto his Lord! Wife, be grieved in your heart if you have a worldly
   husband! O husband, mourn for your unconverted wife! If you have
   brothers or sisters not yet brought to Jesus, fail not to lament
   concerning them! I would to God that families did, sometimes, come
   together to pay their vows with special care and that the father would
   confess family faults and family sins in the name of them all and so
   acknowledge each wound given to the Lord in their house.

   I am not alluding to those private rebukes which every wise parent must
   give, but I would have a common confession from all, uttered by the
   voice of the head of the household. Oh, Lord Jesus Christ, how blessed
   it is to think that You are the God of all the families of Israel and
   that You love the tents of Jacob so well! Grant that our households, as
   households, inasmuch as they sin and transgress, may, also, walk before
   You in all humbleness! Let all families mourn! Let the house of David
   mourn, for there is sin in royal and noble families! Let the house of
   Levi repent, for, alas, there are sins in ministers' families which
   greatly provoke the Lord our God!

   The house of Shimei, of whom we know nothing, may represent the private
   families which are unknown and of the humbler order. Let these, also,
   draw near to God in penitential grief. The house of Nathan may be
   regarded as the prophetic, or perhaps as the princely house--but be
   they what they may, let them all come before the Most High--each with
   the language of confession! It will be a grand thing for England when
   we shall see more family piety and family mourning for sin. They tell
   us that in Cromwell's day if you went down Cheapside at a certain hour
   in the morning, every blind of every house was down because the
   residents were at family prayer. It was, then, a standing ordinance of
   all professors of religion and it was the great buttress against
   Popery.

   Modern Ritualists want us to go to Church every morning and night to
   pray--the Church is opened all day long, so I see by a notice on one of
   our Churches, for private prayer. It strikes me as being rather a place
   for public prayer and well adapted for the display of devotion. The
   idea that prayer is more acceptable in the parish Church than in your
   own houses is a superstition and ought to be treated with no respect!
   If we will pray with our families and make every house into a Church
   and consecrate every room by private supplication, we shall not be
   fascinated by the foolish idea of the holiness ofplaces or priests--and
   we shall so be guarded against the seductions of Popery. The Lord pour
   out the Spirit of Grace upon all the families of His people!

   IV. But now, lastly, and more personally. According to the text, when
   the Spirit of God is given, there will be PERSONAL, SEPARATE AND
   SALUTARY MOURNING ON THE PART OF EACH ONE. "Every family apart, and
   their wives apart," these words, often repeated, bring out vividly the
   individuality of this holy sorrow before the Lord. Let us now endeavor
   to enter into it. First, dear Brothers and Sisters, let us mourn that
   our sins occasioned our Lord's death. And when we have done this, which
   would naturally be the first thought from the text and, therefore, will
   naturally occur to you without my needing to urge it, let us go on to
   mourn our sins before our regeneration.

   To me it will ever cause regret that I was unbelieving towards One who
   could not lie. Now, as I know my Lord and have proved His faithfulness
   so well, it looks so strangely cruel that I should have doubted
   Him--that I should have thought He could not cleanse me, or that He
   would not receive me. He is the most tender of all hearts--the most
   loving of all beings--and yet there was a day when I thought Him a
   severe tyrant who expected a preparation of me which I could not
   produce in myself! I did not know that He would take me just as I was
   and blot out my sin. I know it now, but I mourn that I so grievously
   belied Him. Ought we not to grieve over our long carelessness?

   You used to hear the Gospel, dear Friend, and you understood its plan
   and scope, but you did not wish to feel its power. The Son of God, in
   pity, came to die for you, and yet you thought it an everyday matter to
   be attended to at your convenience--and you went your way to mind
   earthly things. O Lord, how could I shut the door of my heart against
   You so long when Your head was wet with dew and Your locks with the
   drops of the night? You did gently knock and

   knock again, my God, and yet I would not let You in for many a year!
   Sorrowfully do I repent for this! Think, then, dear Friends, of the
   contempt which we cast upon Christ while we were living in that state
   of carelessness--for did we not as good as say in our heart, " Pleasure
   is to be found in the world and not in Christ. Rest is to be had in
   wealth, not in Jesus"? Did we not deliberately choose, when were young,
   to follow the devices of our own hearts instead of the will of Jesus?

   Now that we know Him, we think ourselves fools that we should have seen
   any charms in the painted face of that Jezebel world when Jesus stood
   by with all His matchless beauties! Forgive us, dear Redeemer, that we
   ever thought of these trifles, these transitory toys, these mockeries
   and let You go, though it were but for an hour. Alas, this base
   contempt of You was no error of an hour, but a crime which lasted many
   years! Pardon us, O Lord! Let us reflect, again, with great regret upon
   the resistance which we offered to Christ. In some of us, the Spirit
   strove mightily. I do confess that under sermons I was oftentimes
   brought to my knees and driven to my chamber with tears--but the next
   morning saw those tears evaporate and I was as stubborn as before.

   Did Jesus persuade us to come to His wedding feast? Did He put His arms
   about our neck and say, "Come and receive My love?" By His tenderness
   did He not persuade us and by His terrors did He not threaten us? And
   yet did we not resist Him? What a crime is this! Look at Him now! Oh,
   look at Him with His dear wounds and His face marred more than any man!
   Did we push Him aside? Did we contend with Him who only meant our good?
   Did we not, by this conduct, pierce our Lord? It was even so! Alas, for
   those dark days! Let the whole of our life before conversion be counted
   as but a breathing death! Write down its days as nights and let the
   nights perish and be forgotten forever!

   But we have more than this to reflect upon, namely, our sins since
   conversion. Do I address any, this morning, who have grievously
   backslidden since they professed faith in Christ? Have you committed
   great and open sins? Has it even been found necessary to remove you
   from the Church of God as the leper is put out from the camp? Then do
   not think of it without feeling your eyes swim in tears! What is justly
   bound by the Church on earth is bound in Heaven and, therefore, do not
   despise the censure of the Church of God. And if others of us have been
   kept--as I trust we have--from the great transgression, yet, Beloved,
   what shall we say?

   Are there not with us, even with us, many sins against the Lord? We,
   too, have often been guilty of mistrust. We have doubted the Lord, who
   is Truth itself! What a stab at His heart is this! What a reopening of
   His veins! We have been gloomy, sometimes, and full of murmuring until
   men have said that Christians are miserable and they have taken up a
   proverb against our holy faith because we have been despondent and have
   not felt the joy of the Lord. This is wounding Him in the house of His
   friends and for this evil let us mourn! Might not our Beloved charge
   lukewarmness upon very many who would be unable to deny the accusation?
   Lukewarm towards the bleeding Lamb--towards the dear Lover of our
   souls!

   Have we not been disobedient, too, leaving undone certain duties
   because they were unpleasant to the flesh and doing other things which
   we know we ought not to have done because we chose to please ourselves?
   This is a sad state of things to exist between our hearts and our
   Beloved. Has there not been in us a very great lack of self-denial?
   What little we have given to Him! Did we ever pinch ourselves for Him?
   Might He not say to us, "You have bought Me no sweet cane with money,
   neither have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices. You have
   made Me to serve with your sins, you have wearied Me with your
   iniquities." And how little zeal we have shown for Him! Zeal has just
   lingered on, unquenched like a spark in the flax. And how little flame
   has there been! How little love for God--how little love for perishing
   sinners! How little love, even, for Christ's own people! How scant has
   been our fellowship with Jesus.

   I know some who, I hope, love Him. They go from day to day without
   hearing His voice and some will even live a month in that condition.
   Shame! Shame! To live a month in the same house with our heart's
   Husband and not to have a word with Him? It is sad, indeed, that He,
   who should be All in All to us, should often be treated as if He were
   second best, or nowhere in the race! Alas, alas! Christ is all
   excellence and we are all deficiency. In Him we may rejoice, but as to
   ourselves, we ought to mourn like doves because of the griefs we must
   have caused to His Holy Spirit through the ill estate of our souls.

   We have asked you and I pray the Spirit of God to enable you, to mourn
   over the past, but what shall we say as to the present? Take stock,
   now, of last week. I invite myself and you, for we are one in Christ if
   we are Believers, to look

   through last week. Did you make any survey of the days as they passed?
   If so, I think you might have said with Dr. Watts--

   "What have I done for Him that died

   To save my guilty soul? How are my follies multiplied, Fast as my
   minutes roll!"

   Has it been a week of real service for Christ? You have done
   something--did you do your best? Did you throw your heart into it? Did
   you feel that tenderness, when you were trying to bring others to
   Christ, which a Christian ought to feel? You had some little contention
   with another--did you act in a Christian spirit? Did you show the
   mildness and gentleness of Jesus? You were offended--did you freely
   forgive? For His dear sake did you cast it all behind your back? You
   have been somewhat in trouble--did you take your burden to Him as
   naturally as a little child runs to its mother with a cut finger? Did
   you tell Him all and leave it all to Him? You had a loss--did you
   voluntarily resign all to His

   will?

   Has there been no pride this week? Pride grieves Him very much, for He
   is not a proud Master and is not pleased with a proud disciple. Has
   there not been much to mourn over? And now, at this very moment, what
   is the state of our feeling toward Him? Must we not confess that though
   there is a work of Grace in our souls, yet there is much about us at
   this moment which should make us bow down in grief before the Lord?
   Dear Savior, You know there is not one in this house who has more cause
   to mourn for You than he does who speaks for You now, for he feels that
   these poor lips are not able to tell what his heart feels--and his
   heart does not feel what it ought. A preacher should be like a seraph.
   One who speaks for Christ and tries to praise Him should be a very
   Niobe when he sees the sins of men and his own. Where are my tears? The
   spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak.

   I think what I have now said of myself will suit most of you who are
   engaged in my Master's service. Do you not feel that you blunder at it?
   Do you not feel that when you would paint Him, you make a daub of His
   likeness? When you would set Him forth visibly crucified among the
   people, do you not obscure Him with the very words with which you wish
   to reveal Him? You must have such feelings and if you have them, let me
   close by reading these words to you. They are, assuredly, true when
   there is a time of hearty, sincere mourning for Jesus--"In that day
   there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness."

   So let us plunge into the sacred bath! Believing in the precious blood,
   let us wash and be clean! Glory be to His name, those whom He has
   washed are clean every whit! Amen!

   ERROR--To our intense regret we perceive that in the last sermon, the
   Printer has inserted a verse from the First Epistle to the Corinthians
   instead of from the Second. This entirely spoils our argument. Will the
   reader kindly correct his copy? Put 2 Corinthians for 1 Corinthians and
   mark out the misquoted words. The error was occasioned by a slip of our
   pen. [By His Grace, the verse is corrected.--EOD]

Sudden Sorrow

   (No. 1363)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 8, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON

   "Suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment." Jeremiah
   4:20.

   "And when you are spoiled, what will you do?" Jeremiah 4:30.

   JEREMIAH was describing the havoc of war, a war which was devastating
   his country and bringing untold miseries upon the people. He says of
   it, "My soul, my soul! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a
   noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul,
   the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. Destruction upon
   destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled; suddenly are my
   tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment. How long shall I see the
   standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?"

   How grateful we ought to be that war is not raging in our own land. We
   should read those terrible stories which come to us concerning the
   destruction of human life by the two armies in the East with the utmost
   regret. On whichever side the victory may turn, it is still to be daily
   lamented that men should slaughter men and glory in wholesale murder!
   How true it is neither the elements in their fury, nor wild beasts in
   their rage, have ever been such terrible enemies to man as men! We
   should thank God that we dwell apart and see our harvests ripening
   without the dread of their being reaped by invaders. We walk our
   streets without the fear of bursting shells and seek our chambers
   without the apprehension of being awakened in the dead of night by the
   shouts of advancing adversaries.

   Blessed be the Lord who has given centuries of peace to the fertile
   hills and valleys of His chosen isle--

   "O Britain, praise your mighty God, And make His honors known abroad!
   He bade the ocean round you flow; Not bars of brass could guard you
   so." Let the name of Jehovah our God be praised, this morning, for
   giving peace in our borders and filling us with the finest of the
   wheat. There are, however, in this land, and in all lands, whether at
   war or peace, many calamities which come suddenly upon the sons of men
   concerning which they may bitterly lament, "How suddenly are my tents
   spoiled, and my curtains in a moment." This world, at its best, is not
   our rest. There is nothing settled below the moon. We call this terra
   firma, but there is nothing firm about it--it is tossed to and fro like
   a troubled sea forevermore. We are never, for any long time, in one
   stay--change is perpetually operating.

   Nothing is sure but that which is Divine. Nothing is abiding except
   that which comes down from Heaven. All things change as they pass
   before us and perish in the using. At this moment your ship lies
   becalmed--be not too secure, for within the next few minutes you may be
   driving before a hurricane with bare poles. Today your garden is
   planted with blooming flowers which are loading the air with their
   perfume--rejoice not too much in their sweetness, for within a short
   time nothing may remain--the spoiler may tear them up by the roots and
   your garden may become a desolation. There is nothing bright,
   beautiful, fair, lovely, or desirable beneath the sun which may not be
   speedily withered!

   Even as a vision are all these things--they are, and lo, they are not!
   They flash upon us as the meteor which blazes in the midnight sky and
   then leaves the darkness to be blacker than before. "Boast not yourself
   of tomorrow," yes, boast not yourself of today, lest haply on that
   morrow, or even in this very day, you may have to cry with Jeremiah,
   "How suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment!"

   This expression may be, without any straining, very readily applied to
   many matters and to three especially. First, to the sudden spoiling of
   all human righteousness. Secondly, to the sudden spoiling of all
   earthly comfort. And, thirdly--

   and this is by no means an unusual thing--to the sudden spoiling of
   human life, itself. May the Holy Spirit bless our meditations upon the
   instability of all earth-born things so that we may despise the things
   which are seen and temporal, and follow after the things unseen and
   eternal!

   I. A SUDDEN SPOILING HAPPENS TO HUMAN RIGHTEOUSNESS. Beloved, when I
   put those two words together--"human righteousness"--I inwardly smile.
   It sounds like a comedy or a satire, I scarcely know which! "What is
   man that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman that he
   should be righteous?" Mere human nature and righteousness are two
   things not easily joined together--and when they are united for a time,
   they soon separate--for they agree no better than oil and water. There
   is a Divine righteousness, worked out by our dear Redeemer and imputed
   to all His believing people, which will remain--

   "That glorious robe the same appears Then ruined nature sinks in years.
   No age can change its glorious hue, The robe of Christ is ever new."

   But the righteousness which comes of man is a dream--how suddenly does
   it vanish from our view! Lighter than the spider's web, more subtle
   than the mist, more fleeting than the wind--the very name of it is
   vanity! Let us look at the history of human righteousness and begin in
   the garden of Eden and lament the Fall. Human righteousness existed in
   the bowers of Paradise and man was happy with his God. Adam was created
   sinless. His mind was upon an equal balance and without tendency to
   evil. He was placed in a garden of delights, with but one commandment
   to test him, and that a very simple one, costing but slight self-denial
   to obey.

   We do not know how long Adam was in the garden, but we know that man,
   being in honor, continues not, and in a very short time he and our
   mother, Eve, were spoiled of all they had. The serpent crept in and
   beguiled them. He who was a murderer from the beginning plundered them!
   How suddenly were their tents spoiled and their curtains in a moment,
   for their eyes were opened and they perceived that they had lost all!
   The righteousness which covered them much better than a vesture had
   been taken from them so that they were utterly naked before the eyes of
   the living God. He is a cruel spoiler, indeed, who strips a man of
   every garment. But thus completely were our first parents robbed and
   despoiled!

   They found that they had lost the garden wherein they had lived in such
   content, lost peace, lost happiness, lost themselves, lost their
   posterity, lost all! Everything was taken from them except that which
   Infinite Mercy stepped in to give them in the form of a gracious
   promise concerning the restoring Seed of the woman. Whenever we think
   of the Fall we ought to be humbled and to be restrained from all idea
   of self-righteousness, for if Adam, in his perfection, could not
   maintain his righteousness, how can you and I, who are imperfect from
   our very birth, hope to do so? If the thieves broke in and stole our
   ancestor's righteousness when his tent was pitched amid the sunny
   glades of Eden, how much more will our curtains be spoiled in this land
   of the Ishmaelite and the Amalekite? If the old, wily serpent found a
   way into the unfallen hearts of our first parents when they had no
   surroundings to mislead them, how vain is it for us to hope to overcome
   the Evil One so as to attain to everlasting life by the works of the
   Law?

   A second instance of this very commonly occurs in the failure of the
   moralist's resolutions. See yonder young people tutored from their
   childhood in everything that is good! Their character is excellent and
   admirable, but will it so abide? Will not the enemy despoil their
   tents? Often it is so. The young man starts in life with the conviction
   that he is not of the common herd of sinners and will never descend to
   their level. He has heard of other youths who have fallen into
   temptation and destroyed themselves by dissipation, but he feels
   certain that he shall do nothing of the kind. Like Hazael, he cries,
   "Is your servant a dog that he should do this thing?"

   He fancies that his ship can weather all storms and he plumes himself
   upon the idea that the record of his life will be very different from
   that of other men. How truly lovely, at first sight, he seems! How
   honest, generous and true! Even looking upon him with the eyes of
   Jesus, we might love him and only mourn that he lacks one thing. The
   righteousness which he wears is merely an human one and it is
   altogether in his own keeping, but he believes that he shall hold it
   fast and never let it go. His tent is so well pitched that no wind from
   the wilderness will ever overturn it!

   Have not these delusions been sadly dispelled in hundreds of instances?
   A fierce temptation arises and the man's resolutions are carried along
   like thistle in the wind! The young man did not think that such a
   temptation could ever happen to him. He had been kept by his parents
   and friends like a flower in a conservatory and he could not believe
   that the nights could be so bitterly frosty in the cold world outside.
   But now he has to feel the nipping influence of sin and he

   withers speedily. Satan, discovering his weakness, takes him at a
   tender point. He brings before him that lust to which he has the
   greatest tendency, sets before him that dainty delicacy of sin to which
   he has the sweetest tooth and, by-and-by, the hopeful youth can no
   longer talk of his virtues nor boast of his purity, for he has fallen
   low.

   The ship Boastful has struck on a rock and is going down! The
   self-confident young man now finds himself to be human--being human, to
   be liable to temptation! Being tempted--to be ready to yield to sin. "I
   saw the tents of Cushan in affliction, and the curtains of the land of
   Midian did tremble," for the cords of resolution are broken and the
   stakes of principle are loosed. Alas, poor human righteousness, you are
   soon smitten on the forehead and speedily rolled in the dust! How soon
   does the comeliness of human nature pass away in the hour of trial!
   Many a young man and young woman, opening their eyes all of a sudden
   after temptation, have had to cry," How suddenly are my tents spoiled
   and my curtains in a moment!"

   Ah, you that think yourselves beyond all danger of falling into sin!
   But you know not yourselves--you understand not the plague of your own
   hearts, for if you did, you would see that you carry within your souls
   all manner of iniquity which only waits for an opportunity to develop
   itself! And when it finds a fit occasion, it will display its deadly
   nature and then you will mourn that you did not seek a new heart and a
   right spirit at the hands of Christ.

   My second text asks, "And when you are spoiled, what will you do?" And
   I would earnestly answer it for any of you who have gone through this
   experience. Do not try to reestablish that righteousness of yours which
   has been so thoroughly spoiled, but look for something better! Quit the
   tent for a mansion! Flee from the curtains of self to the walls of
   salvation! Your own resolutions have failed you, therefore leave such a
   sandy foundation and build upon the Rock of Divine Strength! Go and
   confess your sins with deep contrition--ask the Lord Jesus to wash you
   in His precious blood--and then desire Truth in the inward parts and
   ask that in the hidden parts the Holy Spirit may make you to know
   wisdom. So shall it come to pass that you shall no longer build upon
   the sand, nor yet with wood and hay and stubble, but on the Rock with
   gold and silver and precious stones!

   Another liability of human righteousness is one which I must not call a
   calamity, seeing it is the commencement of the greatest blessing. I
   mean when the Spirit of God comes to deal with human righteousness, by
   way of illumination and conviction. Here we can speak of what we know
   experimentally. How beautiful our righteousness is and how it
   flourishes like a comely flower till the Spirit of God blows upon
   it--and then it withers quite away, like the grass in the hot sun! The
   first lesson of the Holy Spirit to the heart is to lay bare its
   deceivableness and to uncover before us its loathsomeness, where we
   thought that everything was true and acceptable. What a different
   character you gave yourself, dear Friend, before the Spirit of God
   dealt with you! To what were you compelled to give yourself afterwards!

   Truly, your beauty consumed away like a moth. You began to mourn over
   your holiest things, for you saw the sin which polluted them. And as
   for your transgressions, which you thought so little of, when the
   Spirit of God set them in a true light, you found them to be hideous
   and horrible offenses against the God of Love. Before you emblazoned
   your name in letters of gold, but when you learned the truth, you chose
   a black inscription and, with a heavy hand, you wrote out your own
   condemnation, feeling that you were bound to do so.

   Now, it is a great mercy when the Spirit of God brings home the truth
   to the heart and makes a man see the deceptiveness of outward
   appearances. I pray that it may happen to you all if it has never done
   so. May your tents be spoiled until you see yourselves to be utterly
   undone--for you are so by nature whether you see it or not! I would ask
   all who are under conviction of sin to answer this question, "When you
   are spoiled, what will you do?" May you reply, "We know what we will
   do. We will flee away from self to Jesus! Our precious things are
   removed and our choice treasure is taken from us, therefore we take the
   Lord Jesus to be our All in All."

   If such is your resolve, you are fulfilling the end and design of the
   ever blessed Spirit who works in order to wean us, for then we turn to
   Jesus and seeks for that clothing which the matchless righteousness of
   Christ Jesus, alone, can afford. But there will come to all human
   righteousness one other time of spoiling if neither of those should
   happen which I have mentioned before. Remorse will come and that very
   probably in the hour of death, if not before. Apart from the Holy
   Spirit, conscience often does its work in a very terrible fashion and
   tears to pieces, before a man's eyes, the curtains of righteousness
   which he had so laboriously woven.

   Have you ever seen a sinner happy and contented, because he is
   self-deluded? But all of a sudden he has found out that his lies and
   hypocrisy were known to God and would be all exposed and punished. At
   such a time, instead of turning

   to God, he has despaired and said, "I am lost, there is no hope for
   me," and therefore he has plunged into deeper sin and become worse! And
   all the while, like the vulture at Prometheus' liver--conscience has
   continued tearing away at his heart, eating into his very soul and
   drinking the blood of joy out of his life till he has been dried up by
   an anguish from which he could not escape! I have seen men die so--the
   consolations of the Gospel have been sounded into a deaf ear! They have
   lifted up their hands as though they would thrust the minister away!

   When he talked of mercy, they replied that there was none for them. And
   when he spoke of cleansing, they declared that their sin was of more
   than scarlet hue and never could be washed away. Oh, how suddenly are
   their tents spoiled and their curtains in a moment! And when spoiled
   thus, what does a man do? What, but give himself up to that everlasting
   despair, which has, at last, overtaken him! While any man is yet alive
   I would exhort him to apply to Christ--though it were the last breath
   he breathed. I would still hold up the Redeemer before his expiring
   gaze! But when remorse has fully set in, this is seldom of any use.
   They cry, "Too late, too late!" They continue to refuse their Savior
   and pass away naked, poor and miserable to stand before God's righteous
   bar to hear the sentence of their conscience confirmed forever by the
   mouth of the Eternal Judge!

   In that dreadful day their overthrow will be terrible, indeed! God save
   us from this. I hope, dear Friends, that all of us know what it is to
   have seen all our tents spoiled of all the precious things in which our
   pride boasted itself--and that we have now become rich in the riches of
   the Lord Jesus and secure in the cleft of the Rock which was opened in
   His side. If we have done so, we shall not regret, but greatly rejoice,
   that our tents were suddenly spoiled and our curtains in a moment!

   II. The words of our text are exceedingly applicable to THE SPOILING OF
   ALL EARTHLY COMFORTS. Sudden destruction to all our earthly comforts is
   common to all sorts of men. It may happen to the best, as well as to
   the worst. Did it not so occur to Job, who on a certain morning was
   amazed by messenger after messenger hastening to tell him that all his
   property was swept away? Last of all came one who told him that his
   entire family had been destroyed! Sudden sorrow happened, also, to
   rebellious Pharaoh as well as to pious Job, for at the dead of night he
   was awakened to bewail the firstborn of him that sat upon the throne
   and heard throughout all the land of Egypt a chorus of lamentations on
   account of a similar calamity which had happened to every household.

   Neither the just nor the unjust can tell when tribulation will befall
   them! David returns from among the Philistines and he finds Ziklag
   burned with fire and his wives and his children carried away captive.
   Yet not to the righteous, only, are such trials, for Belshazzar feasts
   in his palace in Babylon and that same night he was slain! An arrow
   pierces the heart of wicked Ahab, but gracious Josiah fell in the same
   manner--with impartial feet does calamity come to the door of all kinds
   of men! As darts the hawk upon its prey, so does affliction fall upon
   the unsuspecting sons of Adam. As the earthquake all of a sudden
   overthrows a city, so does adversity shake the estate of mortals.

   Sudden trial comes in various forms. Sometimes it is the loss of
   property as in the instance of Lot when the kings came and took him
   captive and all that he had. Then was he utterly spoiled! The same
   thing has happened in ordinary commerce, as in the case of Jehoshaphat
   when he made ships to go to Tarshish and they were broken at
   Eziongaber. His letters were opened one morning and the merchant, who
   thought himself rich as a prince, found that he had become a bankrupt!
   These are but common things in days of panic and convulsion.

   Frequently the calamity comes in the form of the loss of one dear to
   us. So came it to the Shunammite, whose child had been such a comfort
   to her. He fell on a day that he went into the field unto the reapers
   and he said, "My head, my head," and very soon the little gift from
   Heaven had left a childless mother to weep over his little lifeless
   form. So happened it to Jacob, who sent his darling son away with a
   kiss, but before many hours had passed, he saw his garment covered with
   blood and exclaimed, "An evil beast has devoured him! Joseph is,
   without doubt, torn in pieces." You cannot be sure of child, or wife,
   or husband. The fondest love may be torn from your side and the dearest
   babe may be taken from your bosom. Here below nothing is certain but
   universal uncertainty. One way or another God knows how to bring the
   rod home to us and to make us smart till we cry out, "How suddenly are
   my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment."

   Now, this might well be expected. Do we wonder when we are suddenly
   deprived of our earthly comforts? Are they not fleeting things? When
   they came to us, did we receive a lease with them, or were we promised
   that they should last forever? Jonah sat under his withered gourd
   wringing his hands and complaining of God, but if you and I had been
   there

   we might have said, "What ails you, Man? Are you surprised that gourds
   wither?" "I murmur," he says, "because I have lost the shade which
   screened me from the sun." "But, Man, is it not the nature of a gourd
   to die? It came up in a night! Do you marvel that it perished in a
   night? A worm at the root of a gourd surely is no novelty. O Prophet,
   be not angry with your God--this is what you should look for from such
   a growth."

   If our tents are spoiled, we should remember that they are tents and
   not fortresses. They are curtains and not bulwarks. The thief can
   readily enough enter and spoil the habitation which is made of such
   frail material. Do you wonder that your offspring die? Why so? Across
   your children's brows, if you read aright there is written the word,
   "mortal." Did you expect a mortal mother to bring forth an immortal
   son? Did you, a dying father, expect to be the parent of a daughter who
   would never see death? Your love is astonishing, but your reason is
   not! Your affection counts it strange, but your understanding judges it
   to be according to the frequent course of Nature.

   Your children came to you and you received them into your home and
   heart with the knowledge that they were mortal and, therefore, you are
   not deceived. Bow, therefore, to the Divine will and say, "The Lord
   gave, and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord."
   You lament that you have lost your riches. Are you surprised at that?
   Do you keep birds? Do you wonder when they fly away? What are riches
   but birds of a golden feather? They take to themselves wings, we are
   told, and fly away! It is not the most marvelous thing in the world, if
   your boy has a tame bird, and he comes to you and says, "Father, my
   bird has taken wings and fled away." "Dear child," you say, "I always
   wondered that it did not do so before now."

   So may you say to the merchant who has lost his property in
   trading--the marvel is not that wealth departs but that it stays with
   any man, seeing it is the nature of winged things to fly away! Clouds
   dissolve, bubbles burst, snowflakes melt and even so do this world's
   treasures waste away! Moreover, our earthly comforts were never given
   to us to be held forever by a Covenant of Salt. They are always loans
   and never gifts! All that we possess here below is God's property! He
   has only loaned it out to us and what He lends, He has a right to take
   back again. We hold our possessions and our friends, not upon freehold,
   but upon a lease terminable at the Supreme Owner's option! Do you
   wonder when the holding ceases?

   Do you know the parable of the wise Jewish woman? When her husband, the
   Rabbi, had gone out to teach, his disciples, certain neighbors in great
   sorrow, brought home to her the corpses of her only children, two sweet
   boys who had been drowned. She took them upstairs, laid them upon a bed
   and covered them with a sheet. She then waited in her deep affliction
   till her husband came home, grieving most of all for the sorrow which
   would overwhelm him. She stood at the door and mournfully said, "My
   husband, do you know that a great tribulation has happened unto me? A
   Friend had lent me a treasure and, while I have had it, it has been a
   great joy to me, but this day He has taken it back, again, and I know
   not what to do."

   "My Beloved," said the Rabbi, "Speak not so! Can it be a sorrow to you
   to return that which you have borrowed? O daughter of Abraham, you
   cannot harbor dishonesty in your soul! If the treasure has been lent,
   be grateful to him who permitted you the loan and send it back with
   cheerfulness." "Is this what you say?" she asked. "Come here." Then she
   turned back the coverlet and he gazed upon the cold faces of his two
   children. And he said "You have spoken wisely, O Woman, for I
   understand that God has lent these children to me and that I must not
   complain because He has taken back His own."

   Don't you see how natural it is that loans should be returned to their
   lender in due season? Say not, "I am the man that has seen affliction
   by the rod of His wrath," as though you were the chief or the only
   sufferer, for in this thing there has no trial happened to you but such
   as is common to men. Cry not in dismay, "How suddenly are my tents
   spoiled, and my curtains in a moment!" for when war is raging, it is
   little surprising that tents should be spoiled! It is according to the
   nature of things that in a world which brings forth thorns and briars
   in all its furrows, some of the sharp points should pierce your flesh!

   Once more, we live in a world that is full of thieves, and it is no
   wonder if our joys are stolen. Our Master has warned us that our
   habitations here below are not thief-proof. He forbids us, therefore,
   to lay up our treasure where thieves break through and steal. The mud
   houses of the East are very soon entered by burglars. They break a hole
   wherever they please and steal a man's wealth while he sleeps. And this
   present life is of the same fashion. This world swarms with thieves
   such as false friends and deceivers, slanderers and cavilers, losses in
   business and crosses in our expectations,

   unkindness of enemies and fickleness of acquaintances and especially
   sickness and death! We must not marvel, therefore, if some thief or
   other should take away the dear delight which makes our tent so happy.

   Beloved, since these calamities may be expected, let us be prepared for
   them. "How?" you ask. Why, by holding all earthly things loosely--by
   having them as though you had them not--by looking at them as fleeting
   and never expecting them to abide with you. Love the creature in the
   measure in which the creature may be loved and no more! Mortal things
   may only be loved in their proportion--never make them your gods, nor
   suffer your heart to live upon them or stay itself upon them--for if
   you do, you are preparing sorrow for yourself and, "When you are
   spoiled, what will you do?"

   You will cry with Micah, "They have taken away my gods." If you suffer
   your heart to be filled with earthly things while you have them, you
   will have your heart broken when they are taken away! Let us take care
   to make good use of our comforts while we possess them. Since they
   hastily fly by us, let us catch them on the wing and diligently employ
   them for God's Glory. Let us be careful to place our chief treasure in
   Heaven, for, as old Swinnock says, "A worldling's wealth lies in the
   earth. Therefore, like wares laid in low damp cellars, it corrupts and
   molds. But the godly man's treasure is in Heaven and, like commodities
   laid up in high rooms, it continues sound and safe."

   Treasure in the skies is treasure, indeed! Where moth and rust and
   thief can reach is no fit place for us to store our treasures! Let us
   commit our all to the custody of God who is our All in All. Such a
   blessed thing is faith in God that if the Believer should lose
   everything he possesses here below, he would have small cause for
   sorrow so long as he kept his faith. If a rich proprietor with
   thousands of acres of land, in walking down the street were robbed of
   his handkerchief, he would not lie down in despair, nor even make a
   great noise over his loss. "Ah," he would say, "they could only steal a
   mere trifle! They could not rob me of my parks and farms and yearly
   incomes."

   Believers invest their true wealth in a bank which never breaks. And as
   for their earthly substance, it is not theirs at all, but their
   Lord's--and they desire only to employ it for His cause so that if He
   takes it away they are bound to look upon themselves as not losers--but
   as, in some measure, released from responsibility! And they may thank
   their Lord for such relief. Be sure you use this world as not abusing
   it and fix all your joy and love and hope and trust in the eternal
   God--and then, happen what may--you will be safe. "You will keep him in
   perfect peace whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You."

   But let me solemnly remind you that in times when we meet with sudden
   calamity, God is putting us to the test and trying the love and faith
   of those who profess to be His people. "When you are spoiled, what will
   you do?" You thought you loved God--do you love Him now? You said He
   was your Father, but that was when He kissed you! Is He your Father now
   that He chastens you? The ungodly kick against God--they can only
   rejoice in Him while He gives them sweet things. But His true children
   learn to kiss the rod! Can you believe in Jesus when distress is upon
   you and when need assails you as an armed man? You talked of your faith
   in summer weather--have you faith, now, in the long, wintry nights?

   Can you trust the Lord when the fierce winds from the wilderness
   threaten to overturn your tent? Has the Holy Spirit given you the faith
   of God's elect which can bear a strain? That faith which cannot endure
   trial is no faith at all! If the death of a child, or the loss of
   wealth, or being struck down by disappointment or sickness shall make
   you doubt your God, what will you do when you come to die? If, in
   running with footmen you are wearied, what will you do when you contend
   with horses? If these minor trials overwhelm you, what will you do in
   the last dread day when all things pass away from your sight? This is a
   trying time for your heart--a testing time for your faith.

   If all things are right within us when our tents are spoiled, we shall
   live closer to God than ever and thus we shall be gainers by our losses
   because they have increased our spirituality and our peace. It would be
   a blessed thing to be like the planet Venus, of which it is certain
   that the earth can never come between her and the sun. The world often
   hides our God from us and when our comforts are swept away there is all
   the less likelihood of its doing so. If our bereavements bring us into
   the clear and ever-abiding sunlight of the Lord's own face, we may be
   thankful to lose that which before caused the eclipse--

   "Nearer, my God, to You! Nearer to You! What, though it is a cross
   Thatraises me,

   This, still, my cry shall be, Nearer to Thee, Nearer to Thee!"

   Blessed is he who is resolved with Job and, by God's Grace, is enabled
   to abide by it, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." We should
   learn to give up everything that is dear to us in this present life and
   find our comfort in the hopes of the next world! So that, like David,
   when his darling child had been taken away, we may say, "I shall go to
   him. He shall not return to me." Happy and blessed is the man who acts
   thus! He shall not be cast down in the cloudy and dark day. "He shall
   not be afraid of evil tidings. His heart is fixed, trusting in the
   Lord." Oh, you worldlings, what will you do in the time of trouble? How
   will you comfort your hearts in the day of visitation?

   Most of you young people are full of fun and mirth and I am glad you
   have happy times. But the holidays of youth are not forever! Your tents
   will be spoiled, one of these days, as surely as you live--and what
   will you do then? All the joy which you can draw from this world's
   wells will turn to brackish water before long and you will loathe
   it--what will you do, then? Nothing will remain of all this momentary
   mirth when the heyday of your youth is over and the evil days come! And
   the days draw near when you shall say, I have no pleasure in them. Why,
   then, are you so taken up with fickle, fleeting joys? I beseech you
   seek substantial happiness! Ask for eternal blessings! Draw near to God
   by Jesus Christ and seek unfading bliss in His abiding love.

   III. In the third place there may come A SUDDEN SPOILING OF LIFE,
   ITSELF. In a moment, prostrated by

   disease and brought to Death's door, frail man may well cry out, "How
   suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment!" It is by
   no means unusual for men to die very suddenly. One does not wish to
   suggest an unhappy thought, but this is so salutary a consideration
   that it ought never to be absent from us--we are but dust and may be
   dissolved in an instant by death! We are continually surprised that one
   and another have suddenly been called away--yet it is more strange that
   so many remain!--

   "Our life contains a thousand springs, And fails if one is gone,
   Strange that a harp of a thousand strings Should keep in tune so long."

   In this large congregation, Death's work is very manifest to one who
   stands upon this central tower of observation! During the last few days
   we, as a Church and congregation, have lost several from our midst. I
   will not point out the seats which are, today occupied by others, where
   old friends have sat for many years. But so it is, that some have gone
   quite suddenly from us and their graves are scarcely filled in. Who
   will be next? It frequently happens that those who are apparently very
   healthy and strong are among the first to fall. Our friends who are
   continual invalids remain with us, some of them, many months and even
   many years after we have sorrowfully given them up.

   Consumption keeps many for long months lingering slowly into
   everlasting life, while strong, hearty persons are in an instant taken
   away! It is therefore no new thing for men to die suddenly. Not one man
   or woman here has a guarantee that he or she shall live till tomorrow.
   It is almost a misuse of language to talk about life insurance, for we
   cannot insure our lives--they must forever remain uninsured as to their
   continuance here. If I could be a prophet, this morning, and point out
   one and another and say, "That man will be dead before next Sunday."
   Or, "That woman will not live a week," I should feel I had a very
   painful duty to discharge.

   But is it not wise for us to reflect that it may happen to any one of
   us? There are no reasons by which we can prove that we shall escape the
   mighty Hunter for another day! We are ready enough to think of this for
   others, for all men think all men mortal but themselves--but practical
   wisdom would lead us to suggest to ourselves that we are mortal and
   that, perhaps, the death arrow which has just left the bow of God may
   be aimed at our hearts. The question is, "When you are spoiled, what
   will you do?" When all of a sudden the curtains of our tent shall tear
   in two and the tent pole shall be snapped and the body shall lie a
   desolate ruin, what will we do?

   I will tell you what some of us know that we would do. We know that
   when the earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we have a
   building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens!
   As poor, guilty sinners, we have fled to Christ for refuge and He is
   ours and we know that He will surely keep what we have committed to Him
   until that day! Therefore we are not afraid of all that the Spoiler can
   do. We are not afraid of you, O Death, for you are the porter that
   shall open the gates of immortality! And you, you worms, we are not
   afraid of you, for though you devour

   this body, yet you shall not destroy it, for in our flesh we shall see
   God! O Grave, we are not dismayed at your gloom, for what are you but a
   refining pot out of which this poor earthly body shall arise free from
   all corruption?

   Time, we fear not your trials! Eternity, we dread not your terrors! Our
   soul shall dwell at ease, come what may! Glory be to the blessed name
   of the Lord Jesus, we shall rise because He has risen! We shall live
   because He lives and reign because He reigns! We are not afraid of the
   Spoiler! But O, Worldling, when you are spoiled, what will you do? Rich
   men, your acres will be yours no longer--no parks for you to roam over,
   no fine trees to boast of, no ancestral halls in which to glorify
   yourselves! You will have nothing left--no barns, no ripening harvests,
   no noble horses or fattened sheep--you must leave them all and if these
   are your treasures, what will you do when God requires your soul of
   you?

   Then the largeness of the amount invested will only make it all the
   harder to die and palaces and gardens will make the pang of separation
   yet more keen! You will find it a dreadful wrench to be torn away from
   that in which your heart so much delighted. "When you are spoiled, what
   will you do?" Your money bags will not ease your conscience. All the
   leases, title deeds and mortgages that you can heap upon yourself will
   not warm your dying heart into the life of hope! What will you do?
   Alas, what will you do? And you, you worldlings who have no wealth, but
   live for present pleasure-- where, then, will be your wine cups and
   your dances? Where your draughts of mighty ale, your oaths and
   blasphemies?

   Where, then, your midnight revelry and wantonness? When you shall
   appear before the Judge of all the earth, what will be left to you?
   When all these unhallowed pleasures are swept away, what remains? Yes,
   you lover of pleasure, make merry and rejoice today, but "when you are
   spoiled, what will you do?" With your children about you, rejoice in
   your home and live at ease without God but, "when you are spoiled, what
   will you do?" Despise religion if you will--and count it all a dream
   invented to make men sour and wretched--but when you are dying and your
   pulse is faint and failing, what will you do?

   What can you do? Opportunities over and space for repentance nearly run
   out--what will you do? The thought perhaps, will seize you, then, "Too
   late, too late! I cannot enter now." The voice which says, "Behold the
   Bridegroom comes," will startle you in the midnight of your ignorance
   just as you are about to die--and then you will wring your hands in
   everlasting despair because you did not, in due time, seek Him who can
   save you from the wrath to come! Awake, I beseech you, your sluggish
   hearts, and look forward to your latter end! I pray that I may leave
   one or two solemn thoughts upon the minds of the careless. Better
   still, I pray God the Holy Spirit to lead them, now, to believe on the
   Lord Jesus to the saving of their souls! Amen.

Nevertheless, Hereafter

   (No. 1364)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Jesus said unto him, You have said (or said so), nevertheless, I say
   unto you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of Man sitting on the right
   hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of Heaven." Matthew 26:64.

   Our Lord, before His enemies, was silent in His own defense, but He
   faithfully warned and boldly avowed the Truth of God. His was the
   silence of patience, not of indifference--of courage, not of cowardice.
   It is written that "before Pontius Pilate He witnessed a good
   confession," and that statement may, also, be well applied to His
   utterances before Caiaphas, for there He was not silent when it came to
   confession of necessary Truths of God. If you will read the chapter now
   open before us, you will notice that the High Priest commanded Him to
   speak the truth, saying, "Are You the Christ, the Son of God?" to which
   He replied at once, "You have said it."

   He did not disown His Messiahship. He claimed to be the Promised One,
   the Messenger from Heaven, Christ the Anointed of the Most High.
   Neither did He, for a moment, disavow His personal Deity! He
   acknowledged and confessed that He was the Son of God. How could He be
   silent when such a vital point as to His Person was in question? He did
   not hold them in suspense, but openly declared His Godhead by saying,
   "I am," for so are His words reported by one of the Evangelists.

   He then proceeded to reveal the solemn fact that He would soon sit at
   the right hand of God, even the Father. In the words of our text He
   declared that those who were condemning Him would see Him glorified
   and, in due time, would stand at His bar when He would come upon the
   clouds of Heaven to judge the quick and dead according to our Gospel.
   See, then, dear Brothers and Sisters, in a few words, the great Truths
   of our holy religion clearly set forth by our Lord Jesus! He claimed to
   be the Christ of God and the Son of God! And His brief statement, by
   implication, speaks of Jesus dead, buried and risen, and now enthroned
   at the right hand of God in the power of the Father, and Jesus soon to
   come in His glorious Second Advent to judge the world in righteousness.

   Our Lord's confession was very full and, happy is he who heartily
   embraces it! I intend to dwell upon three catchwords around which there
   gathers a world of encouraging and solemn thought. The first is,
   "nevertheless," and the second is, "hereafter." What the third is you
   shall know later, but not just now.

   I. "NEVERTHELESS," said Christ, "hereafter shall you see the Son of Man
   sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of
   Heaven." This, then, is the string from which we must draw forth music.
   "Nevertheless," which, being interpreted by being pulled in pieces,
   signifies that the Truth of God is never-the-less sure because of
   opposition. "Nevertheless," not one atom the less is the Truth of God
   certain to prevail for all that you say or do against it. Jesus will
   surely sit at the right hand of the Power and come in due season, upon
   the clouds of Heaven.

   Let us dwell for a little time upon this important fact, that the Truth
   of God is none the less certain because of the opposition of men and
   devils. Observe, first, that the Savior's condition when He made use of
   that, "nevertheless," was no proof that He would not rise to power.
   There He stood, a poor, defenseless, emaciated Man, newly led from the
   night watch in the garden and its bloody sweat. He was a spectacle of
   meek and lowly suffering led by His captors like a lamb to the
   slaughter, with none to speak a word on His behalf. He was surrounded
   by those who hated Him and He was forsaken by His friends.

   Scribes, Pharisees, priests were there, all thirsting for His heart's
   blood. A lamb in the midst of wolves is but a faint picture of Christ
   standing there before the Sanhedrim in patient silence. And yet, though
   His present condition seemed to contradict it, He who was the faithful
   and true Witness spoke truly when He testified, "Nevertheless,
   hereafter you shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of Heaven.
   Despite My present shame and suffering, so it shall be." He gives

   Himself that lowly, humble title of Son of Man, as best indicating
   Himself in His condition at that time. "Hereafter you shall see the Son
   of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds
   of Heaven."

   The humiliation of Christ did not in the least endanger His later
   Glory. His sufferings, His shame, His death, even, did not render it
   any the less certain that He would climb to His Throne. Nor did the
   caviling of His opposers keep Him, for one instant, from His place of
   honor. I want you to remember this, for there is a great principle in
   it. There are many poor weak-minded people who cannot take sides with a
   persecuted Truth of God, nor accept anything but the most popular and
   fashionable form of religion. They dare not be with the Truth of God
   when men spit in its face, or buffet it, or pour contempt upon it--but
   it will be victorious, none the less, although cowards desert it and
   false-hearted men oppose it.

   If it stands alone at the bar of the world, a culprit to be
   condemned--if it receives nothing but a universal hiss of human
   execration--yet, if it is the Truth of God, it may be condemned, but it
   will be justified! It may be buried, but it will rise! It may be
   rejected, but it will be glorified, even as it has happened to the
   Christ of God! Who would be ashamed of the Truth of God at any time
   when he knows the preciousness of it? Who will tremble because of
   present opposition when he foresees what will yet come of it? What a
   sublime spectacle--the Man of Sorrows standing before His cruel judges
   in all manner of weakness and poverty and contempt--and at the same
   time heir of all things and appointed, nevertheless, to sit at the
   right hand of the Power and to come on the clouds of Heaven!

   Nor may we think only of His condition as a despised and rejected Man,
   for He was, in His trial, charged with grievous wrong and about to be
   condemned by the ecclesiastical authorities. The scribes, most learned
   in the Law, declared that He blasphemed. And the priests, familiar with
   the ordinances of God, exclaimed, "Away with Him! It is not meet that
   He should live." The High Priest, himself, gave judgment that it was
   expedient for Him to be put to death. It is a very serious thing, is it
   not, when all the ecclesiastical authorities are against you--when they
   are unanimous in your condemnation? Yes, verily, and it may cause great
   searching of heart, for no peaceable man desires to be opposed to
   constituted authority, but would sooner have the good word of those who
   sit in Moses' seat.

   But this was not the last time in which the established ecclesiastical
   authorities were wrong, grievously wrong! They were condemning the
   innocent and blaspheming the Lord from Heaven! Nor, I say, was this the
   last time in which the miter and the gown have been upon the side of
   cruel wrong--yet this did not un-Christ our Savior or rob Him of His
   Deity or His Throne! On the same principle, human history brings before
   us abundance of instances in which, nevertheless, though scribes,
   priests, bishops, pontiffs and popes condemned the Truth of God, it was
   just as sure and became as triumphant as it had a right to do! There
   stands the one lone Man and there are all the great ones around
   Him--men of authority and reputation, sanctity and pomp--and they
   unanimously deny that He can ever sit at the right hand of God!

   "But, nevertheless," He says, "hereafter you shall see the Son of Man
   at the right hand of the Power." He spoke the Truth of God! His
   declaration has been most gloriously fulfilled up to now. Even thus,
   over the neck of clergy, priests, pontiffs, popes, His triumphant
   chariot of salvation shall still roll and the Truth of God--the simple
   Truth of His glorious Gospel--shall, despite them all, win the day and
   reign over the sons of men! Nor is this all. Our Lord, at that time,
   was surrounded by those who were in possession of earthly power. The
   priests had the ear of Pilate and Pilate had the Roman legions at his
   back. Who could resist such a combination of force? Craft and authority
   form a dreadful league!

   One disciple had drawn a sword, but just at the time when our Lord
   stood before the Sanhedrim that one chivalrous warrior had denied Him
   so that all the physical force was on the other side. As a Man He was
   helpless when He stood bound before the council. I am not speaking, now
   of that almighty power which faith knows to have dwelt in Him--but as
   to human power, He was weakness at its weakest. His cause seemed at the
   lowest ebb. He had none to stand up in His defense--no, none to speak a
   word on His behalf, for, "Who shall declare His generation?" And yet,
   for all that, and even because of it, He did rise to sit at the right
   hand of the Power and He shall come on the clouds of Heaven!

   So if it ever comes to pass, my Brother, that you should be the lone
   advocate of a forgotten Truth of God--if your Master should ever put
   you, in all your weakness and infirmity, in the midst of the mighty and
   the strong, do not fear or tremble, for the possession of power is but
   a trifle compared with the possession of the Truth of God! And he that
   has the right may safely defy the might of the world. He shall win and
   conquer, let the princes and powers that betake to

   themselves what force and craft they choose. Jesus, nevertheless, wins,
   though the power is all against Him--and so shall the Truth which He
   represents--for it wears about it a hidden power which baffles all
   opponents.

   Nor was it merely all the power--there was a great deal of furious rage
   against Him. That Caiaphas, how he spoke to Him! "I command you," he
   sad, "by God." And after he has spoken, he tears his garments in
   indignation! His anger burns like fire, but the Christ is very quiet.
   The Lamb of God is still and, looking His adversary in the face, He
   says, "Nevertheless, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting at
   the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of Heaven." He
   was strong and, therefore, calm. He was confident and, therefore,
   peaceful. He was fully assured and, therefore, patient. He could wait,
   for He believed--and His prophecy was true, notwithstanding the High
   Priest's rage!

   So, if we meet with any man at any time who gnashes his teeth at us,
   who foams in passion, who dips his pen into the bitterest gall to write
   down our holy faith, who is indefatigable in his violent efforts
   against the Christ of God--what does it matter? "Nevertheless, you
   shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power." "Yet
   have I set My king upon My holy hill of Zion," said Jehovah--and He
   declared the decree though the heathen raged and the people imagined a
   vain thing! Well may He smile at rage who is so sure of victory!

   Yes, but it was not merely one person that raged! The people of
   Jerusalem and the multitudes that had come up to the Passover, bribed
   and egged on by the priests and the Pharisees, were all hot after our
   Savior's death, clamoring, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" And yet there He
   stood and, as He heard their tumult and anticipated its growing demand
   for His blood, He lost not His confidence, but He calmly said,
   "Nevertheless, hereafter shall you see the Son of Man sitting at the
   right hand of the Power." Behold His perfect inward peace and see how
   He manifests it by a bold confession in the very teeth of all His
   adversaries! "You may be as many as the waves of the sea and you may
   foam and rage like the ocean in a storm, but the purpose and the decree
   of God will, nevertheless, be fulfilled. You cannot delay or hinder it
   one whit. You, to your everlasting confusion, shall see the Son of Man
   sitting at the right hand of the Power."

   Beloved, you know that after He had said this, our Lord was taken
   before Herod and Pilate and at last was put to death. He knew all this,
   foreseeing it most clearly, and yet it did not make Him hesitate. He
   knew that He would be crucified and that His enemies would boast that
   there was the end of Him and of His Kingdom. He knew that His disciples
   would hide themselves in holes and corners and that nobody would dare
   to say a word concerning the Man of Nazareth. He foreknew that the name
   of the Nazarene would be bandied about amid general opprobrium and
   Jerusalem would say, "That cause is crushed out! That egg of mischief
   has been broken."

   But He, foreseeing all that and more, declared, "Nevertheless,
   hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the
   Power, and coming on the clouds of Heaven." I cannot help harping upon
   the text--I hope I shall not weary you with it, for to me it is music!
   I do not like running over the word, "nevertheless," too quickly. I
   like to draw it out and repeat it as, "never-the-less." No, not one jot
   the less will His victory come! Not in the least degree was His royal
   power endangered or His sure triumph imperiled! Not even by His death
   and the consequent scattering of His disciples was the least hazard
   occasioned! But, indeed, all these things worked together for the
   accomplishment of the Divine purpose concerning Him! The lower He
   stooped the more sure He was to rise ultimately to His Glory!

   And now, Beloved, it is even so. The man, Christ Jesus, was despised
   and rejected of men, but at this moment He sits at the right hand of
   the Power! All power is given to Him in Heaven and in earth and,
   therefore, does He bid us proclaim His Gospel. There is not an angel
   but does His bidding. Providence is arranged by His will, for, "the
   government shall be upon His shoulders and His name shall be called
   Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The
   Prince of Peace." Atoning work is done and, therefore, He sits. His
   work is well done and, therefore, He sits at the right hand of God, in
   the place of honor and dignity!

   Before long He will come. We cannot tell when. He may come tonight, or
   He may tarry many a weary year--but He will surely come in Person, for
   did not the angels say to the men of Galilee, as they stood gazing into
   Heaven--"This same Jesus shall so come in like manner as you have seen
   Him go into Heaven"? He shall come with blast of trumpet and with
   thousands of angelic beings, all doing Him honor! He shall come with
   flaming fire to visit the trembling earth. He shall come with all His
   Father's glories! Kings and princes shall stand before Him and He shall
   gloriously reign among His ancients. The tumults of the people and the
   plotting of their rulers shall be remembered in that day, but it shall
   be to their own eternal shame!

   His Throne shall be none the less resplendent. I beg you to learn the
   spiritual lesson which comes out of this. I have already indicated it
   and it is this--never be afraid to stand by a losing cause. Never
   hesitate to stand alone when the Truth of God is to be confessed. Never
   be overawed by sacerdotalism, or daunted by rage, or swayed by
   multitudes. Unpopular Truth is, nevertheless, eternal--and that
   doctrine which is ridiculed and cast out as evil, today, shall bring
   immortal honor to the man who dares to stand by its side and share its
   humiliation! Oh, for the love of the Christ who thus threw a,
   "nevertheless," at the feet of His foes, follow Him wherever He goes.
   Through flood or flame, in loneliness, in shame, in obloquy, in
   reproach--follow Him! If it is outside the camp, follow Him!

   If every step shall cost you abuse and scorn, still follow! Yes, to
   prison and to death still follow Him, for as surely as He sits at the
   right hand of the Power, so shall those who love Him and have been
   faithful to His Truth sit down upon His Throne with Him. His overcoming
   and enthronement are the pledges of the victory both of the Truth of
   God and of those who courageously espouse it. Thus have we sounded our
   first great bell--"NEVERTHELESS." Let its music ring through the place
   and charm each opened ear!

   II. The second bell is "HEREAFTER." "Nevertheless, hereafter." I like
   the sound of those two bells together! Let us ring them again.
   "Nevertheless, hereafter." The hereafter seems, in brief, to say to me
   that the main glory of Christ lies in the future. Not today, perhaps,
   nor tomorrow will the issue be seen! Have patience! Wait a while! "Your
   strength is to sit still." God has great leisure, for He is the
   Eternal. Let us partake in His restfulness while we sing,
   "Nevertheless, hereafter." O for the Holy Spirit's power at this
   moment, for it is written, "He will show you things to come."

   It is one great reason why the unregenerate sons of men cannot see any
   Glory in the kingdom of Christ because to them it is such a future
   thing. Its hopes look into eternity! Its great rewards are beyond this
   present time and state--and the most of mortal eyes cannot see so far.
   Unregenerate men are like Passion in John Bunyan's parable--they will
   have all their good things now--and so they have their toys and break
   them and they are gone! And then their hereafter is a dreary outlook of
   regret and woe. Men of faith know better and, like Patience in the same
   parable, they choose to have their best things last, for that which
   comes last, lasts on forever. He whose turn comes last has none to
   follow him and his good things shall never be taken away from him.

   The poor, almost-blind world cannot see beyond its own nose and so it
   must have its joys and riches at once. To them, speedy victory is the
   main thing and the Truth of God is nothing. Is the cause triumphant
   today? Off with your caps and throw them up and cry, "Hurrah!" no
   matter that it is the cause of a lie! Do the multitudes incline that
   way? Then, Sir, if you are worldly-wise, run with them! Pull off the
   palm branches, strew the roads and shout, "Hosanna to the hero of the
   hour!" though he is a despot or a deceiver. But not so--not so with
   those who are taught of God. They take eternity into their estimate and
   they are content to go with the despised and rejected of men for the
   present, because they recollect the hereafter! They can swim against
   the flood for they know where the course of this world is tending.

   O blind world, if you were wise, you would amend your line of action
   and begin to think of the hereafter, too, for the hereafter will soon
   be here! What a short time it is since Adam walked in the Garden of
   Eden! Compared with the ages of the rocks, compared with the history of
   the stars, compared with the life of God it is as the winking of an
   eye, or as a flash of lightning! One has but to grow a little older and
   years become shorter and time appears to travel at a much faster rate
   than before--so that a year rushes by you like a meteor across the
   midnight heavens. When we are older, still, and look down from the
   serene abodes above, I suppose that centuries and ages will be as
   moments to us, for to the Lord they are as nothing!

   Suppose the coming of the Lord should be put off for 10,000 years--it
   is but supposition--but if it were, 10,000 years will soon be gone and
   when the august spectacle of Christ coming on the clouds of Heaven
   shall be seen, the delay will be as though but an hour had intervened.
   The space between now and then, or rather the space between what is
   "now," at this time, and what will be, "now," at the last--how short a
   span it is! Men will look back from the eternal world and say, "How
   could we have thought so much of the fleeting life we have lived on
   earth when it was to be followed by eternity? What fools we were to
   make such count of momentary, transient pleasures when now the things
   which are not seen and are eternal, have come upon us and we are
   unprepared for them!"

   Christ will soon come and, at the longest, when He comes, the interval
   between today and then will seem to be just nothing at all--so that,
   "hereafter," is not as the sound of a far-off cannon, nor as the boom
   of distant thunder--but it is the rolling of rushing wheels hastening
   to overtake us. "Hereafter!" "Hereafter!" Oh, when that hereafter
   comes, how

   overwhelming it will be to Jesus' foes! Now where is Caiaphas? Will he
   now command the Lord to speak? Now, you priests, lift up your haughty
   heads! Utter a sentence against Him, now! There sits your Victim upon
   the clouds of Heaven! Say now that He blasphemes and hold up your torn
   rags and condemn Him again! But where is Caiaphas? He hides his guilty
   head! He is utterly confused and begs the mountains to fall upon him!

   And, oh, you men of the Sanhedrim who sat at midnight and glared at
   your innocent Victim with your cold, cruel eyes and afterwards gloated
   over the death of your martyred Prince--where are you now--now that He
   has come with all His Father's power to judge you? They are asking the
   hills to open their caverns and conceal them! The rocks deny them
   shelter. And where, on that day, will you be, you who deny His Deity,
   who profane His Sabbaths, who slander His people and denounce His
   Gospel--oh, where will you be in that terrible day which as surely
   comes as comes tomorrow's rising sun?

   Oh, Sirs, consider this word--"Hereafter!" I would gladly whisper it in
   the ears of the sinner fascinated by his pleasures. Come near and let
   me do so--"Hereafter!" I would make it the alarm of the sleeping
   transgressor who is dreaming of peace and safety while he is slumbering
   himself into Hell. Hereafter! Hereafter! Oh, yes, you may suck the
   sweet and eat the fat, and drink as you will, but hereafter! Hereafter!
   What will you do hereafter, when that which is sweet in the mouth shall
   be as gall in the belly and when the pleasures of today shall be a
   mixture of misery for eternity? Hereafter! Oh, hereafter! Now, O Divine
   Spirit, be pleased to open careless ears that they may listen to this
   prophetic sound. To the Lord's own people there is no sound more sweet
   than that of, "hereafter." "Hereafter you shall see the Son of Man
   coming on the clouds of Heaven."

   Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, Redeemer, Savior! Welcome in every
   Character in which You come! What acclamations and congratulations will
   go up from the countless myriads of His redeemed, when first the
   ensigns of the Son of Man shall be seen in the heavens! On one of
   earth's mornings, when the children of men shall be "marrying and
   giving in marriage," while saints shall be looking for His appearing,
   they shall, first of all, perceive that He is actually coming! Long
   desired and come at last! Then the trumpet shall be heard, waxing
   exceedingly loud and long--ringing out a sweeter note to the true
   Israel than ever trumpet heard on the morn of Jubilee!

   What delight! What lifting up of gladsome eyes! What floods of bliss!
   Oppression is over! The idols are broken! The reign of sin is ended!
   Darkness shall no more cover the nations! He comes! He comes! Glory be
   to His name!--

   "Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all."

   O blessed day of acclamations! Heaven's vault shall be opened with them
   when His saints shall see for themselves what was reserved for Him and
   for them in the "hereafter!" "You shall see the Son of Man at the right
   hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of Heaven." That word,
   "hereafter," my Brothers and Sisters, is, at this moment, our grandest
   solace, and I wish to bring it before you in that light. Have you been
   misunderstood, misrepresented, slandered because of fidelity to the
   right and to the true? Do not trouble yourself! Vindicate not your own
   cause. Refer it to the King's Bench above and say, "Hereafter,
   hereafter."

   Have you been accused of being mad, fanatical and I know not what,
   besides, because to you, party is nothing, ecclesiastical pride nothing
   and the stamp of popular opinion nothing? Have you been ridiculed
   because you are determined to follow the steps of your Master and
   believe the true and do the right? Then be in no hurry--the sure
   hereafter will settle the debate! Or are you very poor, very sick and
   very sad? But are you Christ's own? Do you trust Him? Do you live in
   fellowship with Him? Then the hope of the hereafter may well take the
   sting out of the present. It is not for long that you shall suffer--the
   Glory will soon be revealed in you and around you. There are streets of
   gold symbolic of your future wealth and there are celestial harps
   emblematical of your eternal joy! You shall have a white robe, soon,
   and the dusty garments of toil shall be laid aside forever! You shall
   have a far more exceeding and an eternal weight of Glory and,
   therefore, the light affliction which is but for a moment may well be
   endured with patience.

   Have you labored in vain? Have you tried to bring souls to Christ and
   had no recompense? Fret not, but remember the hereafter! Many a
   laborer, unsuccessful in the eyes of man, will receive a, "Well done,
   good and faithful servant," from his Master on that day! Set little
   store by anything you have and wish but lightly for anything that you
   have not. Let the present be to you as it really is--a dream, an empty
   show--and project your soul into the hereafter which is solid and
   enduring! Oh, what music there is in the hereafter!--what delight to a
   true child of God! "Nevertheless, hereafter."

   I feel half inclined to have done and to send you out, singing all the
   way, "Nevertheless, hereafter." The people outside might not understand
   you, but it would be a perfectly justifiable enthusiasm of delight!

   III. Now, thirdly. Where am I to look for my third bell? Where is the
   third word I spoke of? In truth, I cannot find it in the version which
   we commonly use and there is no third word in the original. And yet the
   word I am thinking of is there. The truth is that the second word,
   which has been rendered by, "hereafter," bears another meaning. I will
   give you what the Greek critics say. As nearly as can be, the meaning
   of the word is, "FROM NOW ON." "From now on you shall see the Son of
   Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of
   Heaven." "From now on."

   That is another word and the teaching gathered out of it is this--even
   in the present there are tokens of the victory of Christ. "But," says
   one, "did Christ say to those priests that from now on they should see
   Him sitting at the right hand of the Power?" Yes, yes, that is what He
   meant. He meant, "You look at Me and scorn Me, but, Sirs, you shall not
   be able to do this any longer, for from now on you shall see for
   yourselves that I am not what I appear to be, but that I sit at the
   right hand of the Power. From now on, and as long as you live, you
   shall know that galling Truth of God."

   And did that come true? Yes, it came true that night--for when the
   Savior died, there came a messenger unto the members of the Sanhedrim
   and others and told them that the veil of the Temple was torn in two!
   In that moment, when the Man of Nazareth died, that splendid piece of
   tapestry seemed to tear itself asunder from end to end as if in horror
   at the death of its Lord! The members of that council, when they met
   each other in the street and spoke of the news, must have been dumb in
   sheer astonishment. And while they looked upon each other, the earth
   they stood upon reeled and reeled again--and they could scarcely stand
   up!

   This was not the first wonder which had startled them that day, for the
   sun had been beclouded in unnatural darkness. At midday the sun had
   ceased to shine and now the earth ceases to be stable. Lo, also, in the
   darkness of the evening, certain members of this council saw the
   sheeted dead, newly arisen from their sepulchers, walking through the
   streets! The rocks split, the earth shook, the graves opened and the
   dead came forth and appeared unto many! Thus, early, they began to know
   that the Man of Nazareth was at the right hand of the Power! Early on
   the third morning, when they were met together, there came a messenger
   in hot haste who said, "The stone is rolled away from the door of the
   sepulcher. Remember that you placed a watch and that you set your seal
   upon the stone! But early this morning the soldiers say that He came
   forth! He rose, that dreaded One whom we put to death and at the sight
   of Him the keepers did quake and became as dead men."

   Now, these men--these members of the Sanhedrim--believed that fact! We
   have clear evidence that they did, for they bribed the soldiers and
   said, "Say, 'His disciples came and stole away His body while we
   slept.'" Then did the word, also, continue to be fulfilled and they
   plainly saw that Jesus, whom they had condemned, was at the right hand
   of the Power! A few weeks passed over their heads and, lo, there was a
   noise in the city and an extraordinary excitement. Peter had been
   preaching and 3,000 persons in one day had been baptized into the name
   which they dreaded so much! And they were told and heard it on the best
   of evidence, that there had been a wonderful manifestation of the Holy
   Spirit, such as was spoken of in the Book of the Prophet Joel. Then
   they must have looked one another in the face and stroked their beards
   and bit their lips, and said to one another, "Did He not say that we
   should see Him at the right hand of the

   Power?"

   They had often to remember that word and, again and again, to see its
   truth, for when Peter and John were brought before them it was proven
   that they had restored a lame man. And these two unlearned and ignorant
   men told them that it was through the name of Jesus that the lame were
   made to leap and walk! Day after day they were continuously obliged,
   against their will, to see, in the spread of the religion of the Man
   whom they had put to death, that His name had power about it such as
   they could not possibly imagine or resist. Lo, one of their number,
   Paul, had been converted and was preaching the faith which he had
   endeavored to destroy! They must have been much amazed and chagrined,
   as in this, also, they discerned that the Son of Man was at the right
   hand of the Power!

   Yes, you say, but did they see Him coming on the clouds of Heaven? I
   answer, yes. From now on they saw that, also, for they began to have
   upon their minds forebodings and dark thoughts. The Jewish nation was
   in an ill state. The people were getting disquieted. Imposters were
   rising and the leading men of the nation trembled as to what the Romans
   would do. At last there came an outbreak and the imperial power was
   defied--and then, such of them as still survived, began to realize the
   words of Christ. When they saw the comet in the sky and the drawn sword
   hanging over Jerusalem. When they

   saw the city compassed about with armies. When they watched the legions
   dig the trenches and throw up the earthworks and surround the devoted
   city while all around was fire and famine--when from every tower upon
   the walls they could see one of their own countrymen nailed to a cross,
   for the Romans put the Jews to death by crucifixion by hundreds and
   even by thousands--then they must have begun to see the coming of the
   Son of Man!

   And when, at last, the city was destroyed and a firebrand was hurled
   even into the holy place and the Jews were banished and sold for slaves
   till they would not fetch the price of a pair of shoes, so many were
   they and so greatly despised--then they saw the Son of Man coming on
   the clouds of Heaven to take vengeance on His adversaries. Read the
   text as meaning, "From now on you shall see the Son of Man at the right
   hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of Heaven." It is not the
   full meaning of the passage, but it is a part of that meaning, beyond
   all question. Beloved, even at the present time we may see the tokens
   of the power of Christ among us! Only tokens, mark you! I do not want
   to take you off from the hereafter, but from now on and even now there
   are tokens of the power of our Lord Jesus!

   Look at revivals. When they break out in the Church, how they stagger
   all the adversaries of Christ! They said--yes, they dared to say--that
   the Gospel had lost all its power! They dared to say that since the
   days of Whitefield and Wesley there was no hope of the masses being
   stirred! Yet when they see, even in this house, from Sabbath to
   Sabbath, vast crowds listening to the Word of God and, when, some few
   months ago no house could be built that was large enough to accommodate
   the thronging masses who sought to hear our American Brothers, then
   were they smitten in the mouth, so that they could speak no more, for
   it was manifested that the Lord Christ still lives and that, if His
   Gospel is fully and simply preached, it will still draw all men to Him
   and souls will be saved, and that not a few!

   And look in the brave world outside, apart from religion--what
   influences there are abroad which are due to the power of the Christ of
   God! Would you have believed it, 20 years ago, that in America there
   should be no more slaves? That united Italy should be free of her
   despots? Could you have believed that the Pope would be pulling about
   his being a prisoner in the Vatican and that the power of antichrist
   would be shorn away? No, the wonders of history, even within the last
   few years, are enough to show us that Christ is at the right hand of
   the Power! Come what will in the future, mark this, my Brothers and
   Sisters, it will never be possible to uphold tyranny and oppression
   long, for the Lord Christ is to the front for the poor and needy of the
   earth.

   O despots, you may do what you will and use your craft and policy if
   you please, but all over this world the Lord Jesus Christ has lifted up
   a plummet and set up a righteous standard! He will draw a straight line
   and it will pass through everything that offends, that it may be cut
   off. And it will, also, pass over all that is good and lovely and right
   and just and true--and these shall be established in His reign among
   men. I believe in the reign of Christ! Kings, sultans, czars-- these
   are puppets, all of them--and your parliaments and congresses are but
   vanity of vanity! God is great and none but He! Jesus is the King in
   all the earth! He is the Man, the King of men, the Lord of all. Glory
   be to His name! As the years progress we shall see it more and more,
   for He has had long patience, but He is beginning, now, to cut the work
   short in righteousness.

   He is baring His right arm for war and that which denies manhood's just
   claims--that which treads upon the neck of the humanity which Christ
   has taken--that which stands against His Throne and dominion must be
   broken in pieces like a potter's vessel, for the scepter in His hand is
   a rod of iron and He will use it mightily! The Christ, then, still
   gives tokens of His power. They are only tokens, but they are sure
   ones, even as the dawn does not deceive us, though it is not the
   noontide. And oh, let me say, there are some of you present who are
   enemies of Christ, but you, also, must have perceived some tokens of
   His power! I have seen Him shake the infidel by the Gospel till he has
   said, "You almost persuade me to be a Christian." He has taken him in
   the silence of the night and probed his conscience--in His gentleness,
   love and pity He has led the man to think--and though he has not
   altogether yielded, yet he has felt that there is a solemn power about
   the Christ of God.

   Some of the worst of men have been forced to acknowledge that Christ
   has conquered them. Remember how Julian, as he died, said, "The
   Nazarene has overcome me! The Nazarene has overcome me"? May you not
   have to say that in the article of death, but, oh, that you may say it
   now! May His love overpower you! May His compassion win you and you
   will see in your own salvation tokens of His power! But I must have
   done, for my time has fled. But I desire to add that it will be a
   blessed thing if everyone here, becoming a Believer in Jesus, shall,
   from now on see Him at the right hand of the

   Power and coming on the clouds of Heaven! Would to God we could live
   with that vision in full view, believing Jesus to be at the right hand
   of the Power, trusting Him and resting in Him!

   Because we know Him to be the Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord mighty
   in battle, we ought never to have a doubt when we are doing what is
   right. We ought never to have a doubt when we are following Jesus, for
   He is more than a conqueror and so shall His followers be! Let us go on
   courageously, trusting in Him as a child trusts in his father, for He
   is mighty upon whom we repose our confidence. Let us, also, keep before
   our mind's eyes, the fact that He is coming. Be not as the virgins that
   fell asleep! Even now my ears seem to hear the midnight cry, "Behold,
   the Bridegroom comes!" Arise, you virgins, sleep no longer, for the
   Bridegroom is near!

   As for you, you foolish virgins, God grant that there may yet be time
   enough left to awake even you, that you may yet have oil for your lamps
   before He comes. He comes, we know not when, but He comes quickly! Be
   ready, for in such an hour as you think not, the Son of Man comes. Be
   as men that watch for their Lord and as servants that are ready to give
   in their account because the master of the house is near. In that
   spirit let us come to the Lord's Table, as often as we gather there,
   for He has said to us, "Do this until I come." Outward ordinances will
   cease when He comes, for we shall need no memorial when the Lord,
   Himself, will be among us!

   Let us here pledge Him in the cup, that He is coming, we do verily
   believe! That He is coming, we do joyfully proclaim! Is it a subject
   ofjoy for you? If not--

   "You sinners seek His face, Whose wrath you cannot bear! Bow to the
   scepter of His Grace, And find salvation there."

   God bless you for Christ's sake.

The Trees in God's Courts

   (No. 1365)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Those that are planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the
   courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they
   shall be fat and flourishing; to show that the Lord is upright; He is
   my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him." Psalm 92:13-15.

   THESE verses occur at the close of a Psalm for the Sabbath over which
   there rests a Sabbatic glory of perfect calm, of hallowed peace. Amidst
   the business and bustle of daily life the great trouble of the Psalmist
   was the prosperity of the wicked, but it does not trouble him at all
   when he enters the sanctuary to keep the holy day. He then looks upon
   the ungodly who prosper in the world as so much flowering grass in
   their beauty and he beholds them cut down and utterly destroyed. And it
   is meet that a Psalm for the Sabbath should be calm and peaceful,
   cloudless and far-seeing. If on any day we see things in their right
   light and our views extend farther than at other times, surely it
   should be on the day of sacred rest.

   I know a friend who wished to take a house in Newcastle. It stood on an
   elevated position and the landlord, who wished to have him for a
   tenant, took him to the attic of the house and said, "What a view there
   is from this window! Do you know," he asked, "that on Sundays you can
   see Durham Cathedral?" "On Sundays!" said my friend, with a look of
   surprise, "And why not on other days?" "Well," said the landlord, "on
   Sundays there is less smoke and so you can see farther." And, as it is
   in the natural world, so it should always be in the spiritual--less of
   the smoke of this world--less of the dust and the care of life and,
   therefore, a clearer vision of the things which are beyond--things
   which God reveals to spiritual eyes! Read and sing this Psalm often and
   may your heart constantly be in that sweet restful state.

   David, having here put aside this trouble which he so often brings up
   in the Psalms--the frequent prosperity of the wicked as they exult in
   power and spread themselves like a green bay tree, while the righteous
   are plagued all the day long and chastened every morning--after putting
   that aside, he dwells upon the delightful condition of the man of God
   and he describes him as a tree that is planted in the courts of God's
   house, growing, flourishing and bearing fruit even in old age. It is of
   such we are now going to speak and we shall call your attention to the
   planting of the trees, the promise that they shall flourish, the
   continued fertility they exhibit and the conclusive proof they show of
   God's faithfulness. "Those that are planted in the house of the Lord
   shall flourish in the courts of our God."

   I. THE PLANTING. It sounds odd to you to hear of planting a tree in a
   house and of its flourishing in courts, but you will please remember
   that an Oriental house is a sort of quadrangle. It is a four-square
   building with the middle open to the sky and generally there is a small
   garden in which a palm tree, or an olive, or some other evergreen tree
   (for they generally prefer that sort) will be found planted. So what
   seems strange to us--a tree planted in a house--was not at all strange
   to David or to anybody else who lived in the city of Jerusalem. And it
   is a very beautiful figure--this being planted within the four courts
   of God's house that we might grow right in the middle of the place
   where God, with His family, deigns to dwell.

   What, then, is it to be planted? Well, we are planted in God's house in
   two respects. First, in regeneration, when we are born into the house
   and, secondly, at our profession of faith, which should be by Baptism,
   when we are publicly brought into the house and planted in the likeness
   of Christ's death by being buried, after His commandment, in the water.
   We are really planted in the courts of the Lord's house by the new
   birth. Then we become the children of God, for "as many as received Him
   (that is to say, Him who is the Divine Word, the true Light, the
   Savior), to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them
   that believe on His name which were born, not of blood, nor of the will
   of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."

   Every man, the world over, who has been born of the Holy Spirit, is
   really planted in the Lord's house. But we become manifestly and
   visibly so on confessing to the world this inward and spiritual Grace,
   for the Lord has thus put it, you know, "He that with His heart
   believes, and with His mouth makes confession, shall be saved," so that
   when I come to join God's people and ask to be admitted to their
   fellowship--when I come to the Lord's Table with them and publicly
   acknowledge myself to be one of the Master's servants--then I, am in a
   public manner, planted in the house of the Lord. Well, this being the
   fact, let us follow the figure a little more closely.

   Planting implies, first, that there has been something done for us that
   that we could not do for ourselves. A tree cannot plant itself! There
   are self-sown trees, but such are not spoken of in the text. It is,
   "those that are planted in the house of the Lord." And you know it is
   necessary that there should be a work of Grace upon our souls, which
   shall come, not from ourselves, but distinctly from God, for, "every
   plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up." It
   cannot plant itself and, if it could, it must be rooted up, because it
   would not be planted by the heavenly Father. There must be worked upon
   us, in order to our being truly in the courts of the Lord's house, a
   work of Grace infinitely beyond the power of the will or all the power
   that dwells in human nature.

   We must, in fact, be new-created. We must be born again! We must have
   as great a work worked upon us as was worked upon the body of Christ
   when He was raised from the dead! The eternal power and Godhead of the
   Divine Spirit must put forth the fullness of His strength to raise you
   up from your death in sin, or, otherwise you will be like sear branches
   and cast off pieces of wood--and you will never be as trees planted,
   made to live and to grow in the courts of the Lord's house. There must
   be something done for us if we are planted. That implies, too, that
   there must be a great change in our position, for a tree that is
   planted has been growing somewhere else.

   It has to reach a certain height in the nurseryman's garden, if we are
   speaking of England, and then it is planted where it is meant to be
   permanently fixed. So must it have been in the East. The tree grew
   somewhere else. After a time it was dug up, its roots were loosened and
   it was taken away from the place where it had been accustomed to stand.
   Many a tender rootlet was made to bleed and it was then carried and put
   in another place altogether and, from being outside the court, it came
   to be inside the court of the house of the Lord. So, Brothers and
   Sisters, if we are to answer the condition described in the text, we
   must have been dug up and transplanted. This is to have undergone a
   great and wonderful change.

   Are we conscious of it? Do we know ourselves to be new creatures in
   Christ Jesus? If you are what you always were, you are what I pray you
   may not always be! But if you are new, changed, transformed, or, to
   come back to the text, transplanted, then I trust you may continue to
   thrive according to the promise, "They that are planted in the house of
   the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God." Ah me, that
   transplanting business is often very painful and, while it is being
   undergone, we almost think that we are going to be destroyed! What
   anxiety it causes, for how is the plant to know why it is being taken
   up by the roots?

   Perhaps it fancies--or rather, if it had any intellect it would fancy
   that it was taken up to be destroyed--just as when the Law put a big
   spade down to our roots and began to loosen all our soil about us, we
   thought, "Now we are going to be cut down." But we were not--we were
   going to be transplanted from the field of Nature into the garden of
   Grace! Blessed be God, we know what this means! Planting means not only
   that something has been done for us that we could not do for ourselves
   and that a great change has taken place in our position, but it implies
   that there is life in us!

   I suppose that if we speak of planting a post or planting a pillar, we
   hardly use correct language. We plant a thing that has life in it and
   we do not consider that a thing has been planted unless it is a living
   thing. Most certainly the promise of the text could not be fulfilled to
   any but a living tree, for it is said--"They that are planted shall
   flourish and they shall bring forth fruit." God does not intend to have
   dead stumps standing in His court--

   "That little garden walled around, Chosen and made peculiar ground,
   That little spot enclosed by Grace Out of the world's wild wilderness/'
   is not intended to be occupied by dead trees! If there is such in it He
   will come and say, "Cut it down! Why does it cumber the ground?" It is
   a living tree that He desires to have there.

   Beloved, are you conscious of an inner life? Does there beat within you
   another pulse--the pulse of strong desire and love to God--besides that
   which betokens natural life? Is there within you the heaving of another
   breath than that which

   keeps body and soul together? Is there the breath of prayer that keeps
   the soul and God together and so keeps the man in spiritual life? Are
   you quickened? Have you had breathed into your nostrils the breath of
   the Life of God? Is there within you the incorruptible Seed which lives
   and abides forever? God's people are a living people and if we do not
   know the life of God we do not know God at all! There must be a life in
   us. And then, to complete the figure, it seems to me that the fact of
   our being planted implies that we, ourselves, have taken hold of the
   soil where we have been placed. A tree that is rightly planted, so as
   to flourish, begins to send out its roots--to drink in moisture--to
   select from the earth around it those portions which are fit food for
   vegetable life.

   Now, Beloved, are you so incorporated with the Church of God that you
   have got a grip of the fellowship of the saints, that you have
   effectually laid hold of the citizenship of our Lord's faithful
   disciples? Are you seeking for vital Truths of God to sustain your
   soul's vitality? Do you, in the ordinances, send out the rootlets of
   your desire to seek after what God has prepared for you? Is there
   flowing in you a living sap, which sap is being fed by what you draw in
   from the soil in which God has placed you? Surely you know what this
   means! Sundays are often feeding times to you and your visits to the
   Lord in prayer are building-up times to your spirit!

   And when you search the Word of God in private and when the Holy Spirit
   communes with you in your quiet retirement--yes, and when, even in the
   midst of business, your soul breathes her swift utterances up to
   Heaven--then are the roots of your soul taking hold of Christ and
   drawing out of Him the vital element which you need! You are of the
   right kind if this is the case--and you shall flourish in the courts of
   our God! You see, then, the figure, and what is meant by this planting
   in the house of the Lord.

   II. Now, secondly, LET US ENDEAVOR TO GRASP THE PROMISE. "Those that
   are planted shall flourish." "Flourish" they well may. Let us be sure
   of their welfare. They shall flourish because God has said that they
   shall! His promises are sure to be fulfilled. If He plants a tree, He
   will cause it to flourish. There seems to be very much against the
   Christian. He is exposed to many perils when he is first planted.
   Indeed, in the early childhood of Christian life, we undergo a world of
   trial. Such was our weakness and such our exposure to the bleak
   atmosphere of this present evil world--the chances were all against us.

   But there is no chance with God! What He plants is sure to take root.
   If He says it shall flourish, flourish it will! Satan may seek to tear
   it up. The foxes may try to spoil the vines. There may be chilling
   winds. There may be long droughts. The sun may seek to smite it by day
   and the moon by night, but God has promised that it shall flourish and
   flourish it must! Therefore I invite you, young Christians, to be very
   hopeful. See to it that you are rightly planted and then you may depend
   upon it that you will really flourish! God, who has been pleased to
   give you Divine Grace, will bestow on you more Grace and then more
   Grace--Grace upon Grace--Grace for every crisis and every emergency!

   As your needs arise, those needs shall be supplied. Just as you require
   spiritual health, spiritual health shall be vouchsafed to you if you
   seek it at His hands, knowing that it is at His disposal. You shall not
   be a half-starved Christian--a sort of living skeleton of a Believer,
   but you shall flourish! You shall be peaceful, happy, strong, useful.
   Set your heart upon this and ask the Lord to make you thrive, bloom and
   bear fruit. Your leaf shall not wither and He will cause you to prosper
   if you are planted in the courts of the Lord.

   Some of you, perhaps, are Christian men who have received the Word with
   gladness and believed to the saving of your souls and, so far, you
   appear to be in the courts of God's house. But you have never joined
   the Church, or made a profession of your faith, which, though it may be
   very sincere, is not very apparent! As, however, you have not gone in
   for the whole of the planting, you cannot reasonably expect to realize
   the whole of the flourishing! I like to know that I have given myself
   wholly up to the Lord according to His commands--not having merely
   embraced one part of the Gospel, but the whole of it. When one has
   sought to obey it in its entirety, then he may come and expect to have
   the promise in its entireness, too. If you are altogether Christians,
   planted in His house--not merely in His garden, but in His house--then
   you shall flourish, for you have the promise that you shall!

   And flourish you well may, because of the goodness of the soil. They
   are quite sure to have good soil in the little garden enclosed by the
   house. It may be rocky outside, but when a man has built the four walls
   of his house in the East, he generally takes all the soil that is in
   the middle away. It may be very bad and poor, but then he has brought
   in baskets of the richest soil that he can possibly get, for he must
   have a good tree in the middle of his house. It would not do every

   moment of the day to look out, or rather to look in and to see a little
   scrubby tree, half alive. No, he procures the best soil he can get and
   those that are planted in the house of the Lord are planted in the best
   soil possible!

   They are planted where the means of Grace abound! They are planted
   where Christians help one another with mutual fellowship. They are
   planted where the ordinances of the Gospel are freely enjoyed by all
   who dwell there. They are planted where the Holy Spirit has promised to
   abide. They are planted where the Word of God does not return void.
   They are planted where the eyes and the heart of Christ perpetually
   rest. They are planted in His Church--the Church that He has redeemed
   with His most precious blood! The soil is good and they ought to
   flourish--and they shall.

   And then they are planted in a sheltered position. You know that trees,
   even if they have good soil, are sometimes a great deal kept back by
   having a cold northerly aspect. They may be very much bitten by the
   frost. But a tree that is planted right in the middle of the forecourt,
   surrounded by the walls, is sheltered. There is the natural warmth of
   the house round about it and it is sheltered from that which other
   trees out in the vineyard, or out in the garden, may have to endure.
   Oh, how sheltered some of us have been from our first profession of
   faith! I know that I can speak to some here who began Christian life in
   a class in the Sunday school where a loving teacher looked after their
   spiritual interests.

   There are others of you that began your Christian life in the midst of
   a warm-hearted, earnest Church. You were no sooner seen as a member
   than two or three friends took hold of you and they did all they could
   to encourage you, guide you and sympathize with you. Whenever they may
   have observed a little lukewarmness or backsliding in your manner, they
   have looked after you as a mother anxious for her child--so tenderly
   have you been nursed by those who watched for your souls! And you
   surely cannot forget how, on Sundays, the Word of God has been a
   wonderful shelter to you! When your feet had almost slipped, there has
   been the very Word to hold you up.

   When you felt dispirited there has been a promise to encourage you.
   When you have been ready to turn back, there has been an exhortation
   that has stimulated you once more to go forward--and so you have lived
   inside four walls. The cold could not get at you. You scarcely had
   enough of the cold of the world to do you any injury! The warm sun of
   righteousness was reflected upon you--not only did it come at once upon
   you by Divine favor--but it was reflected upon you with grateful
   sympathy by the walls of the house of the Lord in which you had been
   planted. You know it has been so! Is it any wonder, then, that you
   flourish?

   There is a little wonder, sometimes, that you do not flourish more and
   that you do not bring forth more fruit, for what more could God do than
   He has done for some of you who have been planted in the house of the
   Lord? Are you not like a vineyard on a very fruitful hill which He has
   hedged about and walled? And does it not seem as if He has watered you
   every morning, and, lest any should hurt you, has kept you night and
   day? How sour the grapes and how few the clusters fit for the Great
   Vinedresser to gather, no one knows better than yourselves. Yet you
   ought to flourish, because you are planted in good soil and because you
   are placed in a sheltered position.

   Still we might assign a better reason why you should flourish. It is
   because you are so near the Farmer. "My Father is the Farmer," says
   Christ. They that are planted in the house of the Lord are planted in
   the Farmer's house. I think I hear someone say, "I do not wonder that
   such a vine flourishes, because, you see, the Great Vinedresser, who
   understands all about it, has it on the wall of His own house. He sees
   it every morning and, of course He pays very special attention to it."
   Little do you and I know, Beloved, what special attention God has paid
   to us personally and individually!

   Oh, there are some of us upon whom the Lord has long looked with a
   tender but jealous eye. If He has seen a little wrong about us, He has
   grieved at it and felt, "I must put it away." When He has seen us
   getting a little cold, He has begun at once to awaken us, for He has
   loved us too well to leave us exposed to even a little spiritual
   sickness. He has said sometimes, "There is My servant and he will get
   proud of his service, or of his success--I must bring him down." High
   looks and haughty thoughts are an abomination in His sight!

   Another time He has said, "Such-and-Such is increasing in wealth. He
   will get worldly-minded. I must take away some of his worldly goods
   that he may take more account of his treasures laid up in Heaven and
   set his heart more on Me." The Lord your God is a jealous God! Where
   there is love, there is oftentimes a sensitiveness which stirs up
   jealousy. The greatness of God's love makes Him very zealous for us and
   very jealous of us. If He sees those whom He very much loves with the
   slightest evil thing about them, He is quick to observe it and prompt
   to purge it away. You know that you do not like to see a spot on your
   dear child's face--you will have it washed off as soon as possible. So
   will the Lord cleanse His people, both on the outside and within!

   The care and the trouble He has had with us, as I have already said,
   none of us can tell. We ought to bring forth fruit to the profit of the
   Farmer, to the glory of God. Branches that bring forth fruit He purges.
   Those that bring forth very little fruit He lets very much alone. If
   there is a man that brings forth much fruit, that man will have much
   trial because it will profit the Vinedresser to prune him. Some
   branches will not pay for it. They will never do more than they are
   doing and so there they are and thus they are left to prove their
   feebleness. But those that will profit for pruning will be pruned again
   and again! And truly, when the man of God is in his right mind, he will
   bless the Lord for the honor He puts upon him when He afflicts him with
   the view of making him still more useful.

   This is evermore our Lord's design. Does He not say that they shall
   never perish whom He protects and provides for, holding them in His
   hands? But, as they cannot flourish if they run to wood, He will be
   quite sure to use His knife to take off this new shoot and that new
   shoot because it is not fruit-bearing wood. And so He takes it away and
   He leaves the vine in such a condition that it will bring forth good
   fruit in due time. They shall flourish and well they may, when they are
   so near to the Great Farmer's hand!

   Now, if any of you are not flourishing, though you are planted in the
   house of the Lord, I am sure it is not through any fault on God's part.
   Let such ask Him, and ask themselves, the reason why and go to Him in
   prayer and say--"Good Lord, I am planted in Your house. Make me to
   flourish according to Your Word."

   III. Well, now, as to THE CONTINUANCE OF THIS FLOURISHING, our third
   head is full of consolation. "They

   shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and
   flourishing." There are some that begin with a spurt and it is soon
   over. And there are some trees that promise exceedingly well for fruit,
   but the blossoms do not knit and, therefore, they fail to yield fruit
   in due season. But those whom God plants and whom He makes to flourish,
   bring forth fruit and continue to bring it forth, still, in old age!
   During all their youth and all their manhood they are fruitful and then
   they bring forth fruit when their years decline and their days are
   numbered!

   When others are in the sear and yellow leaf, their fruits are ripe and
   mellow. When others are decaying, they are ripening. They are growing
   sweeter, better, holier when others are not growing at all. They shall
   still bring forth fruit in old age--that time when one does not expect
   much fruit bearing--when the strength fails and when the capacity for
   projecting seems to have gone and the power for carrying out what is
   projected has become very little. "They shall still bring forth fruit
   in old age." This is not merely a cheering promise, but it is a very
   gratifying fact that God's people still bring forth fruit in old age!
   Some of them produce very luscious fruit.

   Yes, we look for the best fruit in the oldest saints. What fruit, then,
   you will ask, do they bring forth? Well, there is the fruit of
   testimony. I distinctly remember hearing a blind old minister talk of
   the loving kindness of the Lord when I was 16 or 17--and the
   encouragement that he gave me has never departed from me. A young man
   could not have done that because he had not attained so much
   experience. But the weight of years and even of infirmities, made that
   venerable blind man's testimony very, very weighty to my soul. "They
   shall still bring forth fruit in old age." Blessed be His name, I can
   tell of the goodness of the Lord to me these 25 years or more since I
   have known Him! But think of a man who can speak of 50 years--and there
   are some children of God who can do so!

   There is a member of this Church who has been a member of it for 70
   years and she can tell you how good the Lord has been to her! And the
   fruit is riper, you know. There is a cumulative force of evidence,
   because if a thing has been true 50 years and a person has tried it in
   all sorts and shapes and ways and modes and conditions and
   circumstances--50 years--well, who is to contradict that? It must be so
   and you feel the testimony is a blessed fruit of old age. Saints bring
   forth fruit in the way of savor when they grow old. Many young
   ministers can rattle out some of the Truths of the Gospel very readily,
   but if you want to taste the sweetness, to feel the unction, to enjoy
   the savor--you must hear one that has had long and deep experience. It
   must be so!

   There is an inimitable mellowness about the Christian who has grown old
   in his Master's service. If you want to hear about the sea, talk to an
   "old salt." If you want to hear about war, talk to an old soldier that
   has been in battle and smelt gunpowder--and knows what it is to have
   lost a leg. He is the man to tell you! And so, if you want to know
   about the real deeps, the truth, the vitality, the power of
   religion--you must not go to boys--you must go to those who bring forth
   fruit in old age because they can speak out of the fullness of their
   soul! We have had some in this Church--there are such now and there are
   some in Heaven--who, every time we used to hear them speak, let drop
   pearls and diamonds while they talked about what the Lord had done for
   them!

   Dear old Mr. Dransfield--how many a time he electrified us when he used
   to stand on that platform and talk about the blessedness of God and the
   sweetness of religion to his soul! You used to think a great deal more
   of it because he was so old. I am sure you did! It was good in itself,
   but still there was the age of the man at the back of it. So in that
   case the age gave a power to the experience which he told us. The aged
   Christian ought to have and I hope he often has, the fruit of patience.
   After having suffered so long and enjoyed the mercies of God so long,
   he ought to learn to be patient. I once heard a good Christian man say
   that he was confessing a fault.

   He said, "I am afraid that the fruit of my old age is peevishness."
   "No," I said, "that is not a fruit of your old age-- it is a fruit of
   your old nature." But the fruit of old age, where there is Grace in old
   age, should be patience. And oh, what fruit some of God's servants show
   by way of patience in poverty, in sickness, in infirmities! There used
   to sit here an aged woman who could not hear anything I said, but she
   always came because she thought it was setting a good example to the
   young people at home to attend the house of God. Whenever I used to
   speak with her, there was such a charm about her conversation because,
   though she was much tried, she never uttered a complaint. She could
   only bless the name of the Lord for everything!

   You remember Dr. Hamilton's story of poor old Betty who could not do
   anything but lie in bed and cough? She said, "Well, bless the Lord,
   whatever the Lord has told me to do I have tried to do it. And when He
   said, 'Betty, bring up your family,' I tried to bring them up in the
   fear of God. When He said, 'Betty, go to the house of God and sing My
   praises,' I was delighted to do it. And when He said, 'Betty, go
   upstairs and lie in bed and cough,' well I did that, too, and still do
   it," she said, "and bless the name of the Lord for letting me do it so
   long as there is anything to be done for Him." Now, the promise is that
   if we are planted as I have described, we shall be enabled to bring
   forth fruit in old age. Anything that we do with a sincere desire to
   glorify God in it and anything that we bear with patience and quietness
   according to the Divine will is sweet and gracious fruit. We can, by
   God's Grace, bring forth that fruit in our old age.

   One of the most delicious fruits that Christians produce in their old
   age is calm, quiet confidence in God. John Bunyan has described this in
   his, "Pilgrim's Progress," in the beautiful picture of the land,
   Beulah. I shall not at all object to have a gray head and eyes like
   lamps whose wasting oil is spent, weak shoulders and tottering knees if
   I may get to Beulah! You know that he describes it as a land that was
   just on the verge of the river and so near to the Celestial Country
   that the shining ones did often cross the river. And there was a
   pervading smell of sweet spices all over the land because it lay so
   near to the City of the Blessed that when the wind blew that way it
   wafted the spices across! And they could, in quiet places of the land,
   often hear the songs of the shining ones who wandered there.

   The inhabitants were at perfect rest. The land was called Beulah, for
   God's delight was in her. They that dwelt in her were called
   Heph-Zibah, for they were married unto the Lord and they were sitting
   there, many of them, close by the brink of the river, waiting till a
   message should come from the King, for the King's messengers, every now
   and then, came into the country and said, "The pitcher is broken at the
   cistern. Rise up, my Love, and come away." And so, one by one, the
   Beulahites crossed that river! On bright sunshiny mornings they were
   known to cross it singing, "O Grave, where is your victory?"

   Well, it is that patient abiding, that quiet waiting, that holy
   confidence, that Divine anticipation, that sweet expectation of the
   coming Glory that is one of the fruits which Believers bring forth in
   old age. And whenever we see it, we prize those golden apples and long
   for the time when we may bear them, too. But now notice that the text
   does not speak of old age merely bringing forth fruit, but it
   says--"They shall be fat and flourishing," which means that Christians,
   in their advanced years, shall have a fullness of savor and life in
   them. I have known some Christians, both old and young, that have been
   very dry sticks--certainly not fat and flourishing! They had very
   little savor and very little unction, though they had very sharp teeth
   to bite the young people with. They were very critical, very ready to
   look harshly at them and ask them hard questions.

   And, if the youngster could not spell the biggest word in the whole
   Confession of Faith, they have said, "Ah, the young people nowadays are
   not like what they used to be in my time." We have known some of that
   sort! But when they are planted in the house of God and God makes them
   to flourish, they are full of the juice of love! They are full of
   Christian kindness and gentleness! They are full of life! They are full
   of real vigor--not the vigor of the flesh, but the vigor of the
   Spirit--and they love the Lord and delight in Him. They greatly delight
   to help the young people and to encourage them in the ways of the Lord.
   Oh, I like to see an old man thus fat and flourishing!

   And it is added, in addition to their being fat, that they shall be
   flourishing. It means that the aged Believer shall have a special
   verdure. This flourishing means his profession--and how delightful is
   the profession of Christianity in advanced age! I do not mean that some
   people get exceedingly attached to the pastor whom they have heard for
   many, many years. One old woman used to say that she liked to hear the
   old minister better than anybody else. "Well, but," they said, "He is
   getting very feeble." "Oh," she said, "but then I remember what he used
   to be and I would sooner see him shake his head than I would hear
   anybody else preach."

   And I have no doubt that, though that grows to be an infirmity and
   folly, there is something praiseworthy in it because you remember the
   times and seasons when the Lord refreshed your soul by him and there is
   a moral glory about a man as you look at him who has been, say, for 50
   years, living and laboring as a public professing Christian--without a
   stain upon his reputation--not a spot on his character! Why, the young
   people say, "Bless God! If He has kept him, why should He not keep me?
   And if the Lord has sustained him under many trials, why should He not
   sustain me?" It is not what the man says--it is the man that says it
   that gives force to all he says. It is what you know is behind the
   voice. It is the experience of the Lord's goodness. It is the
   long-continued honorable conduct which God has enabled him to maintain
   and show to others, by the abounding Grace that was within him, which
   preaches in accents louder than the finest voice can articulate!

   Now, I pray that every young man here--and I am glad to see so many
   young men--will seek to be, one day, among the old men whose profession
   shall be the very strength of the Church because of this consistency! I
   will not say to my elder Brothers and Sisters--because the Lord will
   say it to them--that they ought to remember what manner of people they
   ought to be, seeing that God has been so gracious to them these many
   years.

   IV. I close with my fourth point, which is THE MANIFESTATION THAT
   AFFORDS CONCLUSIVE PROOF OF

   THE DIVINE FAITHFULNESS. "To show that the Lord is upright." These good
   folks are to bring forth fruit and to be fat and flourishing, on
   purpose, to manifest before the eyes of all men, "That the Lord is
   upright. He is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in Him." "That
   the Lord is upright." Well, how does the fruit-bearing of an aged
   Christian show that? Why, it shows that God has kept His promise! He
   has promised that He will never leave them nor forsake them.

   There you see it--He has promised that when they are weak they shall be
   strong! There you see it--He has promised that if they seek Him they
   shall not lack any good thing. There you see it. He has promised them,
   "Your bread shall be given you. Your water shall be sure." Hear what
   they have to say and you will see it! He has said, "Even to hoar hairs
   I am He. I have made and I will bear, and I will carry you as in the
   days of old." There you have it. Ask them! There you see it. We put,
   "Q. E. D.," at the end of a proposition when it is proved. So you may
   put that down at the end of the problem of life. God is good to His
   people! The old man stands up and says, "Truly God is good to Israel.
   If you could hear my story, young man, you would see it before your
   eyes and it would show that the Lord is upright."

   Nor is it only that He keeps His promises, but the Lord is kind and
   generous towards His servants. I always think it a shameful, heartless
   thing to turn adrift, when He gets old, a man who has been in your
   service from His youth. It is one of the things that have become more
   common in present than in former times, to turn out old servants. Since
   you have had the pith of their life--the marrow out of their
   bones--keep a roof over their heads! Grant them a pension, or at least
   a pittance! Supply them with a bit of bread and cheese till they die. I
   think it is only right that an old servant, a faithful servant, should
   be so treated.

   You know how David puts it. "O God, You have taught me from my youth,
   and up to now have I declared Your wondrous works. Now, also, when I am
   old and gray-headed, O God, forsake me not." It is not likely that He
   would, is it? Such a God as He, turn His old servants out? You remember
   the Amalekite who had a master that was an Egyptian and the master left
   him to perish and David found him? Ah, well, that is how the Egyptian
   masters do, but that is not how our Master does! You will not leave or
   desert me when my age and my infirmities multiply upon me! When these
   eyes grow dim You will look upon me. When another shall guard me and
   lead me where I would not, You, still, will be my Friend and Helper,
   and lay Your finger on my eyelids as I close them in the hour of death.
   It is a faithful God we serve, and He keeps His people alive in their
   old age that they may show that He is a faithful and upright God.

   Now, David added at the end, "He is my rock, and there is no
   unrighteousness in Him." I want every one of my elderly friends to add
   his, Amen, to this sentence and to set his seal that God is true! Come
   forward as witnesses, attest the

   deed while it is being executed and put your names to the record and
   say, "I bear witness to that." At least I want you in the silence of
   your hearts to come and say, "Yes, I can bear witness." David says, "He
   is my rock." My aged Brothers and Sisters, you can say, "God is the
   Rock on which my hope is founded--my Foundation--and He has never
   failed me. The Rock will never shake, never move, never give way. He is
   the Rock of my defense--the 'Rock of Ages cleft for me.' I have hidden
   myself in Him and I have been safe. He is the Rock of my abiding. I
   have dwelt in Him and lived in Him and I have found Him my castle and
   my high tower. He is a Rock for immutability."

   Can you say that, Brothers and Sisters? He has never changed--never! He
   has been "without variableness or shadow of turning." Every good and
   perfect gift have I received from Him. Bear witness to it! This is what
   is needed in this age-- that you should bear witness that God is a
   Rock--firm, strong, faithful, immutable--the defense of His people! And
   then "there is no unrighteousness in Him." I would have you bear
   witness to that. You have had some sharp troubles. Have you ever had
   more than you ought to have? You have had many losses. Have you really
   lost anything in being a Christian? You have been brought very low.
   Have you ever been altogether left and deserted? You have gone through
   fire and through water, but has the fire consumed you? Has the water
   drowned you?

   If you have anything to say against God, you old servants of His, let
   us hear it! No, but the older God's people get, the more they praise
   Him! And one reason why I am sure that God must be a good God is that I
   always find that all His servants want to get their children into the
   same house, into the same family! A man is not badly treated by his
   master when he says, "My ambition is to have my boy follow me." Oh, I
   can speak well of my Lord and Master in all that He has ever given me
   to do, but it is the joy of my soul to think that my sons should follow
   me in the love of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel!

   We who are younger men, but yet who have had a good deal of tossing to
   and fro, can say, "He is my Lord and there is no unrighteousness in
   Him. No, not a flaw in Him--not one unkindness, not one unfaithfulness,
   not one forgetfulness, not one angry word, not one thing but what has
   been full of love." He has said, "I have sworn that I would not be
   angry with you, or rebuke you," and He has kept His promise! And up to
   this hour we cannot discover speck, spot, or flaw in all the
   transactions of His Providence. Though sometimes they have been
   mysterious, they have always been right!

   Blessed be His name forever and ever! Oh, who would not be planted in
   the courts of such a God as this to be kept even to old age and to be
   blessed with such unspeakable blessings world without end? God grant
   you all to be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord
   that He might be glorified! Amen.

The Danger of Unconfessed Sin

   (No. 1366)

   DELIVERED

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the
   daylong." Psalm 32:3.

   IT is well known that in ordinary cases grief which is kept within the
   bosom grows more and more intense. It is a very great relief to shed
   tears--it gives a vent to the heart. We sometimes pity those who weep,
   but there is a grief too deep for tears which is far more worthy of
   compassion--we ought most to pity those who cannot weep. A dry sorrow
   is a terrible one, but clear shining often follows the rain of tears.
   Tears are hopeful things. They are the dewdrops of the morning
   foretelling the coming day. So is it, also, a very great consolation to
   tell your story to a friend. I do not know whether it would not be a
   comfort, even, to speak it to a little child, even if the child could
   not understand you.

   There is something in telling your sorrow and letting it out, otherwise
   it is like a mountain lake which has no outlet, into which the rains
   descend and the torrents rush and, at last, the banks are broken and a
   flood is caused. It is well for you to let your soul flow forth in
   words as to your common griefs! A festering wound is dangerous. Many
   have lost their reason because they had good reason to tell their
   sorrows, but had not reason enough to do so. Much talk has in it much
   of sin, but a heart full of agony must speak or burst. Therefore let it
   talk on and even repeat itself, for in so doing it will spend itself--

   "Sorrow weeps!

   And spends its bitterness in tears. My child of sorrow, Weep out the
   fullness of Your passionate grief, And drown in tears The bitterness of
   lonely years." We shall now, however, think of spiritual sorrows and to
   these the same rule applies. "When I kept silence," and did not pour
   out my sorrow when I ought to have confessed it, "my bones waxed old
   through my roaring all the day long." Is it not a great mercy for us
   that we have the Book of Psalms and the life of such a man as David?
   Biographies of most people, nowadays, are like the portraits of a past
   generation when the art of flattery in oils was at its height. There is
   no greater cheat than a modem biography! It is not the man, at all, but
   what he might have been if he had not been something else! They give
   you a lock of his hair, or his wig, or his old coat, but seldom the
   man.

   They make huge volumes out of a heap of his letters which ought to have
   been burned. And they copy little scraps of pictures which he used to
   draw for friends--and neither the letters nor the sketches ought ever
   to have been published. Like burglars, they break into a man's chamber
   and steal his hidden things. They hold up to the public eye what was
   meant for privacy, only, and expose the secrets of the man's heart and
   hearth. Things which the man would never have drawn or written if he
   had thought that they would meet the public eye are dragged forth and
   brought out as precious things, and so they are, but precious nonsense!

   We have no biographers nowadays. When Boswell died, the greatest of all
   biographers died, and he was not far removed from a fool. If a man
   lives a noble life, he may well shrink from dying, because he knows
   what will become of him, nowadays, when writers of his memoirs unearth
   him and tear him to pieces! David's Psalms are his best memorial. There
   you have not the man's exterior, but his inward soul. They do not
   reveal the outward manifestations of the man, but you see the man's
   heart--the inner David, the David that groaned and the David that wept!
   You see the David that sighed and the David that sinned--the David that
   yearned after God, and the David that was eaten up with the zeal of
   God's house--the man who was born in sin and groaned over sin and was
   yet the man after God's own heart. What a wonderful autobiography of a
   wonderful life that Book of Psalms is!

   David was a many-sided man and his life was like the life of our Lord
   in this respect--that it seemed to comprehend the lives of all other
   men within itself. There is no man, I suppose, who has known the Lord
   in any age since David wrote but has seen himself in David's Psalms as
   in a mirror and has said to himself, "This man knows all about me. He
   has been into every room of my soul--into its lowest cellar and into
   its loftiest tower. He has been with me in the dens of my inbred sin
   and in the palaces of my fellowship with Christ, from which I have
   looked upon the Glory of God." Here is a man who "seems to be, not one,
   but all mankind's epitome."

   Though we mourn over David's sin, yet we thank God that it was
   permitted, for if he had not so fallen, he had not been able to help us
   when we are conscious of transgression. He could not have so minutely
   described our griefs if he had not felt the same. David lived, in this
   respect, for others as well as for himself. I am thankful that David
   was permitted to try the experiment of silence after his great sin, for
   he will now tell us what came of it--"When I kept silence, my bones
   waxed old through my roaring all the day long."

   We shall apply this first, as it should be, to the erring child of God
   convicted of his sin. Secondly, we shall remind you that the same rule
   holds good with the awakened sinner in whom the Spirit of God has begun
   to work a sense of guilt.

   I. First, LET US THINK OF THE CHILD OF GOD. Children of God sin! Some
   of them have claimed to be well-near free from it but--I will say no
   more--but I think they sinned when they talked in such a lofty strain.
   God's children sin, for they are still in the body. If they are in a
   right state of heart they will mourn over this and it will be the
   burden of their lives. Oh that they could live without sin! It is this
   that they sigh after and they can never be fully content until they
   obtain it. They do not excuse themselves by saying, "I cannot be
   perfect," but they feel that their inability is their sin. They regard
   every transgression and tendency to sin as a grievous fault and they
   mourn over it from day to day. They would be holy as Christ is holy. To
   will is present with them, but how to perform that which they would,
   they find not.

   Now, when the child of God sins, the proper thing for him to do is at
   once to go and tell his heavenly Father. As soon as ever we are
   conscious of sin, the right thing is not to begin to reason with the
   sin, or to wait until we have brought ourselves into a proper state of
   heart about it, but to go at once and confess the transgression unto
   the Lord, then and there. Sin will not come to any very great head in a
   man's heart who does this continually. God will never have great
   chastisements in store for those who are quick confessors of sin.

   You know how it is with your child. There has been something broken,
   perhaps, by carelessness. There has been some violation of a rule of
   the house. But if he comes and catches you by the sleeve and says,
   "Father," or, "Mother, I am very sorry that I have been doing
   wrong"--why, you know, while you are sorry that he should transgress,
   you are glad to think that his heart is so right that without being
   questioned he comes of his own accord and tells you so frankly that he
   was wrong. Whatever grief you may feel about his fault, you feel a
   greater joy in the frankness of his confession and the tenderness of
   his conscience! And you have forgiven him, I am sure, before he has got
   half way through his open-hearted acknowledgment. You feel that you
   cannot be angry with so frank and penitent a child.

   Though sometimes you may have to put on a sour look, shake your head
   and reprimand and scold a little, yet if the little eyes fill with
   tears and the confession becomes still more open and the sorrow still
   more evident--it is not hard to move you to give the child a kiss and
   send him away with, "Go and sin no more. I have forgiven you." Our
   heavenly Father is a much more tender Father than any of us and,
   therefore, if we, being evil, know how to give good gifts to our
   children, how much more shall our heavenly Father forgive us our
   trespasses? "Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities
   them that fear Him" and, therefore, He has compassion upon the children
   of men when they acknowledge their offenses. We are not more ready to
   forgive our children than our heavenly Father is ready to forgive us!
   We may be quite sure of that.

   And so, if it is our habit--and I trust it is--never to suffer guilt to
   lie upon our consciences, but to go as soon as we are sensible of a
   fault and admit it before the Lord, asking pardon from Him for Jesus'
   sake, there will be no great amount of damage done to ourselves and the
   Lord's anger will not wax hot against us and neither will severe
   chastisements happen to us. We may endure sharp afflictions, because
   they are often sent for another purpose, but we shall not have
   visitations of paternal wrath. Many trials are not sent for
   chastisements at all, but as preparations for higher usefulness--for
   every branch that bears fruit He purges, evidently not because of any
   offense in the branch, but

   even because the branch is good and bears fruit and, therefore, it is
   allowed the special privilege of the pruning knife that it may bring
   forth more fruit.

   Speedy and full confession will not prevent tribulations which are
   meant merely for instruction, but it will avert trials which are
   intended as severe chastisements--and this will be no small benefit.
   Did not David pray, "O Lord, rebuke me not in Your wrath, neither
   chasten me in Your hot displeasure"? Now, it sometimes happens that
   God's children, when they have done wrong--especially if they have done
   very, very wrong--do not go and confess it. When there is the most
   necessity for confession, there is often the greatest tardiness in
   making it. It was so in David's case. Alas, how foully had he fallen!
   It is never to any purpose to try and excuse David's sin.

   There are certain extenuating circumstances, but he never mentioned
   them and, therefore, we need not. Indeed, if David were here, tonight,
   and we were to begin excusing his sin, he would rise with tears in his
   eyes and say, "For God's sake do not attempt it! Let it stand in all
   its deformity, that the power of God's mercy may be the more clearly
   seen in washing me and making me whiter than snow." But David's heart,
   sometimes, was very evil. It was sound towards God as a rule. There was
   deep love to God always there, but it had become overlaid and crusted
   with what was always David's great besetment--the strong passions of
   his impulsive nature.

   He had followed, in some measure, the ill example of neighboring kings
   in taking a number of wives to himself and this had fed, rather than
   checked, his natural tendencies. And at last, in an evil hour, he fell
   into a crime of deepest dye. He knew that he was doing wrong. He sinned
   against light and knowledge but, alas, he did not hasten to his God and
   confess the grievous crime. I think I can see why he could not have
   gone straight away from the sin to confession, for the sin prevented
   the confession--the sin blinded the eyes, stultified the conscience and
   stupefied the entire spiritual nature of David. Hence He did not
   confess at once, but surely he felt as if he must admit the fault when
   the time came for prayer.

   I have no doubt that David prayed after a sort, but he must have
   presented very formal and mutilated prayers so long as he refused to
   acknowledge his transgression. When the time came for David to finger
   his harp, perhaps he did so and went through a song or a Psalm. But he
   could never reach to the essence of true praise by pouring out his
   heart before God while the foul sin was hidden in his bosom. How could
   he? His Psalms and his prayers were silence before God, whatever sound
   he made--for his heart did not speak and God would not hear him.

   However sweet the tone or the tune, his songs were nothing to the Most
   High, for his heart was silent. And why was he silent when he knew that
   he was wrong? Why did he not go to God at once? Well, it was partly
   because he was stupefied by his sin. He was fascinated, captivated and
   held in bondage by it. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, beware of the serpent
   eye of sin! It is dangerous to even look at sin, for looking leads to
   longing. A look at sin often leads to a lusting after sin and that soon
   ripens into the actual indulgence. No man even thinks of sin without
   damage!

   I saw a magnificent photograph in Rome, one of the finest I had ever
   seen, and right across the middle there was the specter mark of a cart
   and two oxen repeated many times. The artist had tried to get it out,
   but the trace remained. While his plate was exposed to take the view,
   the cart and the oxen had gone across the scene and they were
   indelible! Often in the photograph of a fine building you will see the
   shade of a man who passed by who is represented by a sort of ghostly
   figure. Upon our soul every sinful thought leaves a mark and a stain
   that calls for us to weep it out--no, it needs Christ's blood to wash
   it away!

   We begin with thinking of sin and then we somewhat desire the sin. Next
   we enter into communion with the sin and then we get into the sin--and
   the sin gets into us and we lie as oak in it. So David did. He did not
   feel it at first, but there he was, plunged into the evil deeps. In
   such a state sin does not appear burdensome. A man with a pail of water
   on his head feels it to be heavy, but if he dives, he does not feel the
   weight of the water above him because he is actually in it and
   surrounded by it. When a man plunges into sin, he does not feel the
   weight of the sin as he does when he is out of that dreadful
   element--but then, by God's Grace, he is burdened by it. So David did
   not feel His guilt at first. He knew that he had done wrong, but he did
   not perceive the exceeding heinousness of his evil deed and, therefore,
   he did not confess it.

   Next, there was much pride in David's heart. Have you a child who, when
   he has offended, knows he is wrong, but will not admit it? If so, you
   talk to him, but he will not speak. He is quite silent, or, if he does
   speak, it is not in the right way. He makes some naughty, obstinate,
   strong-headed speech. You cannot bring him to say, "Father, I have done
   wrong." He tries to excuse himself in this way and that. Perhaps he
   partly denies the fault and only mentions certain things that other
   people did, by way of excuse for himself.

   Now, what our children do to us we have often done to God! We have
   sullenly stood it out before Him. I remember well a story of a
   reputable Christian man who, on a certain occasion, was betrayed into
   drinking. He was a long time in distress of mind about his sin. He had
   been drunk, but when he was spoken to about it, as he was, by some of
   the officers of the Church, he said that he was, "overtaken" and added
   that, "a very little affected him." I think that is what he said. And
   he pleaded that some others had been overtaken, too, and he did not see
   why such notice should be taken of a little slip. All this he said to
   leave a loophole for himself. When he had done saying that, he would
   add--Well, he did not know. He did not believe that he was drunk. He
   was sure that nobody could prove that he was, though he might have
   taken a little more than was good for him.

   His tongue talked in that way, but his heart knew better! He was a
   child of God and he knew he was wrong. He never got peace by making
   these shocking self-defenses. He was, indeed, terribly tortured in his
   soul, till, at last he went down on his knees and said, "Lord, I have
   been drunk. There is no use in denying it. I, who am Your servant, have
   been drunk. Forgive me, for Your mercy's sake, and keep me, from now
   on, from even tasting of the intoxicating cup." He honestly confessed
   his transgression and a sweet sense of pardon followed at once! It
   takes some professors a long time to get up to that point. We call our
   sin by some other name and fancy that it is not quite so bad in us as
   it would be in others.

   Oh, the ways we have got of trying to extenuate! And, oh, the
   sullenness which has sometimes been put on and carried out for days and
   days together before the living God by God's children when they have
   fallen into an ill-temper. I have no doubt that some have been silent
   before God for a time as to the confession of their wrong because of
   fear. They could not believe that, after all, their Father loved them!
   They thought that if they did confess they would receive a heavy
   sentence and be overwhelmed with wrath. David had often looked up into
   the face of God and known His love--but now that he had thrown dust
   into his own eyes, he could not see God's face.

   He only felt God's chastening hand, for He says, "Day and night Your
   hand was heavy upon me. My moisture is turned into the drought of
   summer." The sun burned him up, but afforded him none of the sunshine
   of the face of God. Unbelief is sure to follow sin of the kind
   committed by David. When it has brought on sullenness of temper, then
   we begin to think that God deals harshly with us, whereas it is we that
   are dealing harshly with Him. If we would confess, all would be
   well--but there is the tough part! It is not, if He would forgive, for
   He is ready to blot out the transgressions of His people--the
   difficulty lies in if we would believe in His love!

   There is a great deal of the Pharisee in many Christians. You may
   question the statement, but I should not wonder if there is a good deal
   of the Pharisee in you, or else you would not have doubted the
   assertion. You are so much of a Pharisee that you do not think yourself
   a Pharisee! But we are prone to begin thinking, "Surely, surely, I, at
   such a time was a worthy object of God's love, but now I am not." Oh,
   then, you were once a wonder of goodness and marvelously worthy and
   excellent? Do not believe it! My dear Brother, perhaps you were as bad
   when you had not openly transgressed as you are now, for then your
   disease may have taken the form ofpride, and though it has now taken
   another shape, it may be no worse, for pride is as damnable as any
   other form of sin. He who says to Himself, "I am righteous. I can stand
   before God and deserve His love," is as surely lost as though he had
   fallen into gross sin. Take heed of the Pharisee that lurks within you!

   Anyway, whatever was the reason, David was silent about his sin for a
   long time. The result of it was that his sorrow became worse and worse.
   He could not pray. He tried to pray, but as he would not confess his
   sin, it stuck in his throat. And till that was out, he could not pray.
   But still he must pray. So he took to roaring. That is to say, it was
   such inarticulate, indistinct prayer and there was so much of his soul
   in it that he calls it the roaring of a beast instead of the praying of
   a man! His inward grief over his unconfessed sin was such that his
   bones began to wax old. They are the pillars of the house, the
   strongest part of the entire system--but even they seemed as if they
   would decay.

   He was brought into ill health of body through the torment of his mind.
   He could find no peace and yet he would not go and confess the sin! He
   was still sullenly looking up to God, not as a sinner, but as a saved
   one and talking to God as if he were righteous--while at the same time
   his sin was crushing him. All this while, I say, his grief gathered and
   there was only one cure for it--he ought to have confessed it to the
   Lord. As soon as it was confessed he was forgiven. How quick was that
   act of amnesty and oblivion! David said, "I have sinned," and Nathan
   said, "The Lord has put away your sin. You shall not die."

   If pardon is so near at hand, who would linger a moment? Who among us
   would not, at once, repair to our heavenly Father and, with our head in
   his bosom sob out the confession of our sin? Because He is so ready to
   forgive we ought to be ready to confess! I may be addressing a child of
   God, or one who thought that he was a child of God, who has grievously
   fallen. My Brothers and Sisters, go with haste to your Lord and
   acknowledge your iniquity! He bids you come. Only confess your iniquity
   in which you have transgressed against the Lord and He will have mercy
   upon you now! And oh, what a relief it is when you have discharged the
   load and when the voice of mercy has said, "You are forgiven. Go in
   peace."

   "What would I give for that," says one. Well, you need not give
   anything. Do but confess and if you confess into the ear of God, with
   faith in His dear Son, for Jesus' sake He will accept you and seal your
   pardon home to your soul! Come and unburden your spirit at the bleeding
   feet of the Redeemer--and leap for joy! Thus have I tried to encourage
   the Lord's own children to confess their sins. I do not know for whom
   these words are particularly meant, but I am driven to say them, for I
   labor under the strong impression that there is some child of God here
   who is almost despairing of the Lord's mercy and who is well near ready
   to renounce his profession of religion because he fears that the Lord's
   mercy is clean gone forever.

   My dear Friend, judge not so harshly of Him who still loves you! Did He
   not love us when we were dead in trespasses and sins? And will He not
   love us if now our sin has wounded us again? He never loved us because
   we were good and, therefore, as He knew all that we should be, He will
   not change in His affection. He "commends His love to us in that, while
   we were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly"--died for us as
   SINNERS! If you never did come to Him--if all your religion has been a
   mistake--do not begin to argue upon that matter, but come to Jesus now,
   for the first time! Many and many a score of times have I done that!
   When the devil has said, "Your faith has been mere delusion and your
   experience has been all a fiction," I have replied, "I will not dispute
   with you, Sir Devil, but I will just go to Christ as a sinner, for I
   know He came to seek and to save sinners, even lost ones, such as I am.
   And I will humbly ask Him anew to be my Savior."

   That is a short cut to comfort! May the Spirit lead you into it! Be not
   baffled by Satanic suggestions, but come to Jesus again, and again, and
   again, "to whom coming as unto a living stone"--looking unto Jesus--not
   having looked once, but continually looking and trusting in Him!

   II. But now I must have a few minutes, while we use this same subject
   in reference TO THE AWAKENED SINNER. Some in this place, perhaps, have
   lately been awakened to a consciousness of guilt before God. But one
   thing they have not done--they have never made confession of their sin.
   They feel the burden of it, in a measure, and they will feel it more,
   but as yet they have kept their grief to themselves. Neither to God nor
   man have they poured out their souls. To speak to our fellow men about
   our heart troubles is comparatively of little use and yet, I would not
   recommend persons under conviction of sin always to hide their souls'
   sorrows from their Christian friends.

   They might often be much helped if they would communicate their
   thoughts to those who have gone further on the road to Heaven and know
   more about Christ and the way of salvation. Yet, for the most part, a
   wounded conscience, like a wounded stag, delights to be alone that it
   may bleed in secret. It is very hard to get at a man under conviction
   of sin. He retires so far into himself that it is impossible to follow
   him. Ah, you poor mourners, I know how you try to conceal your pains! I
   will tell you one reason why you do not like to tell your mother, your
   sister, your brother. It is because you think your feelings are so
   strange--you suppose that nobody ever felt like you--you have the
   notion that you must be the worst person that ever lived and,
   therefore, you are ashamed to tell what you feel for fear your friends
   should kick you out of their society.

   Ah, poor Soul. You do not know! You do not know! We have all been on
   your road. When you tell of your sin, you put us in memory of the way
   in which we talked, perhaps 25 years ago, or more, when we, too, felt
   sin a burden as you feel it now. When you tell us of the greatness of
   your sin and think that we shall surely despise you and never speak to
   you again, tears of joy are in our eyes to think that you feel as we
   did! We are glad to discover your tender and contrite spirit--we only
   wish that thousands felt as you do! Do you not remember what George
   Whitefield said when his brother at the dinner able said that he was a
   lost soul? Mr. Whitefield said, "Thank God," and his brother wondered
   why.

   "Why?" said Whitefield, "Jesus came into the world to seek and to save
   that which was lost." The more black you think yourself to be, the
   brighter is our hope of you! When you poor tremblers give yourselves an
   awful character, we

   know it is correct and we do not wish to contradict you, but we are
   glad to hear you say it and to know that you feel it, because now we
   see in you that which will prepare you to value a precious Christ! A
   man who says, "I am well clothed," is not likely to accept Christ's
   righteousness. But when he cries, "How naked I am, how useless are
   these fig leaves," He is the man for Christ's robes!

   When you meet with a man who says, "I am full. I feast on my own
   righteousness," what is the good of inviting him to the Gospel banquet?
   You must invite him, for you are commanded to do so, but he will refuse
   to come. But when you meet with another who is hungry, faint and ready
   to die--ah, there is the man for your money! Bid him come where the
   oxen and the fatlings are killed and all things are ready! His mouth is
   watering while you speak to him and he will come with you and sit down
   at the banquet of the King! We are glad, poor Sinner, to hear your tale
   and, therefore, the next time you meet with a Christian, I would advise
   you to tell him a little of it.

   But still, that is not what you most need. You need to lay bare your
   deep sorrow before your God and, oh, if you do it, there stands the
   promise, "He that confesses and forsakes his sins shall find mercy."
   Confession before God was never sincerely offered but absolution from
   the Most High was sure to follow! Remember, even though you do not go
   and tell the Lord, He knows already and, therefore, concealment is in
   vain! He needs not your confession for His information, but for your
   benefit. And if you do not confess to Him, you certainly will never
   obtain pardon, for there is not between the covers of the holy Bible a
   single intimation that God will ever pardon unconfessed sin! If you
   cover and cloak it--and feel no repentance about it and do not bring it
   to Christ--you cannot expect to receive mercy from the offended Lord.

   Now, it happens with some, that, though they are conscious of sin, they
   do not confess it. And what is the result? Why, it increases their
   misery! It is impossible that you should find peace while sin continues
   to gather in your soul. It is a festering wound--the surgeon's knife
   must be let in, there cannot be rest until it is so. I have known a
   sinner, before confession of sin, feel as if he could lay violent hands
   upon himself, so intense was his anguish. Well do I remember repeating
   to myself the words of the Prophet, "My soul chooses strangling rather
   than life," for of all the tortures in this world, an awakened
   conscience, pressed down with a sense of guilt, is the worst!

   The Spanish Inquisition invented cruel racks and thumbscrews, but there
   is no inquisitor like a man's own conscience, for it can put the screw
   upon the soul to the uttermost degree. Let a man's conscience loose
   upon him and at once the worm commences to gnaw and the fire begins to
   burn. They used, in olden times, to ascribe the torment of Hell to the
   devil--but we do not need any devil for that--conscience can measure
   out an infinite misery. Let but remorse lay its thongs of wire upon a
   man and it will scar him and gash him to the very soul! So long as a
   man continues silent before God and does not admit his sin--if the Lord
   has really begun to deal with him--he will have to suffer more and more
   from the pangs of conscience.

   But then, increase of sorrow accompanied by this silence is a very
   dangerous piece of business. I spoke cheeringly just now of those of
   you who are under a sense of sin, but it was only in the hope that you
   would go to God, through Jesus Christ, and confess your sin. But if you
   refuse to do so, your position is one of very great danger. "What
   danger?" you ask. Why, if sin remains festering within you and your
   sorrow increases, you will come to despair altogether--and that is an
   awful prospect, indeed. You remember John Bunyan's picture of the man
   in the iron cage? There is not, in the "Pilgrim's Progress," an
   incident more terrible!

   Now, you are forging the bars of a cage for yourself as long as you
   refuse to acknowledge your guilt before God. Those who are in the iron
   cage of despair will tell you that they delayed to acknowledge sin,
   that they refused to accept Christ, that they suppressed their feelings
   and so brought themselves into bondage. They were pleased to hear
   ministers preach about conviction of sin and speak of deep sorrow and
   the like--but they did not care to be told that it was their duty, then
   and there, to believe in Jesus! They could not endure that doctrine!
   They liked to be comforted in the notion that there was something good
   in feeling a sense of sin, apart from believing--whereas, if a soul
   will not believe in Christ, its sense of sin may be an evil instead of
   a benefit to it!

   Nothing can be good that is unsalted with faith. "With all your
   sacrifices you shall offer salt." And if the salt of faith is absent,
   the sacrifice is unacceptable. We have known some who, through getting
   into despair, have afterwards fallen into utter hardness of heart. They
   used to be malleable. They used to feel the strokes of the Divine
   hammer. Now they feel nothing and are as hard as the blacksmith's
   anvil. They have got into such a condition that they wickedly say, if
   God will save them they will be saved, but they have nothing to do with
   it. They once were tender--now they are presumptuous.

   They say, "there is no hope" and, therefore, on the theory of the old
   proverb that they may as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, in
   all probability they will go on to commit worse sins than ever.

   Some of the biggest sinners that have ever disgraced the name of
   humanity have been persons who were once tender of conscience and were
   on the point of conversion--but they did violence to conviction, came
   to despair of ever entering Heaven--and in the end determined that as
   they must go to Hell, they would go there with a high hand and an
   outstretched arm! He who has seen Heaven's gate open before him, but
   has not stepped in, is the man who, above all others, is likely to find
   the hottest place in Hell!

   You may think it strange for me to say so, but I know it is so, for
   such persons go by the way of despair into hardness of heart and then
   into the grossest transgression. Yes, and this is the back door to
   atheism, for when a man feels that God and he can never be at
   peace--when he has made up his mind that he never will confess his
   sin--what is the first thing that he does to comfort himself? He
   says--"There is no God." And what does the declaration, "There is no
   God," mean? It means this--that the man feels that he would be much
   more happy if there were no God! That is what it means and nothing
   more. It is the man's wish, rather than his creed, and he wishes it
   because he despairs and his heart has grown hard.

   Oh, when God makes your heart soft as wax, mind who puts the seal upon
   it! If the Spirit of the living God sets not the seal of deep
   repentance and holy faith upon the softened soul, there is another that
   will put the seal of despair and perhaps of atheism and of defiant sin
   upon it! And then woe was the day to you that you ever were born!
   Refusal to confess is a perilous thing for your soul! I am sure that
   when a man begins to be awakened to a sense of sin, if he tarries long
   in that condition, he is being entangled, moment by moment, in the
   Satanic web. The devil cares little about careless sinners. "Let them
   alone," he says, "they will come to me by-and-by!" And as for very
   religious people who possess no true godliness, the devil does not
   bother them, either. He says, "No, let the hypocrites be in peace. They
   are going my way as nicely as possible. Why should I awaken them by
   causing them mistrust as to their state?"

   But the moment that souls are startled into a sense of sin, the devil
   says to himself, "I shall lose them," and so he plies all his arts and
   uses all his craft, if by any means he may prevent their escape. Man,
   now is your time to flee away to the City of Refuge without tarrying
   even for an hour, for even now all the devils in Hell are after you!
   They did not trouble about you before, but they are after you now with
   sevenfold energy! Close in with Christ, then, and at once escape them
   all! Oh, may the Spirit of God enable you to find eternal mercy through
   the confession of your sin to God and looking to Christ for mercy--the
   mercy which He is so willing to give now!

   This is the last point. There is no hope, then, of any comfort to a
   bruised heart except by its confessing its guilt. I would earnestly
   urge upon every one conscious of sin to go with troubled heart and
   heaving bosom and confess his transgression to the Lord at once. I
   would do it in detail if I were you. I find it sometimes profitable to
   myself to read the Ten Commandments and to think over my sins against
   each one of them. What a list it is--and how it humbles you in the dust
   to read it over! When you come to that Commandment--"You shall not
   commit adultery," "Ah," you say, "I have never been guilty there." But
   when you are told by the Savior that a lustful glance breaks that
   command, how it alters

   all!

   Then you perceive that fleshly desires and imaginations are all sins
   and you humble yourself in the dust. You read, also, "You shall not
   kill."--"Well," you say, "I never killed anyone." But you change your
   tune when you hear that, "He that is angry with his brother without a
   cause is a murderer." When you see the spirituality of the Law and the
   way in which you have broken all the Commandments 10,000 times over, be
   sure to confess it all right sorrowfully! I find it good to look all
   round, sometimes, and think, "I am a father. There are my sins against
   my children. Have I trained them up for God as I should? I am a
   husband. There are sins in that relationship. I am an employer. There
   are sins in that position. How have I acted towards my servants? I am a
   pastor. How many sins occur in that relationship?"

   Why, you will not look around you, if God opens your eyes, without
   being helped to see what you ought to confess! Take the very limbs of
   your body and they will accuse you--sins of the brain in evil thoughts!
   Sins of the eyes in idle glances! Sins of this little naughty member,
   the tongue, which does more mischief than all the rest! There is no
   member without its own special sins. There are sins of the ear--how
   often have we heard the Gospel, but heard it in vain? On the other
   hand, have we not too often lent a willing ear to unholy words and to
   wicked stories against our neighbors? I need

   not read over the calendar of our offenses from this pulpit--go and
   write it out in your closet--and pour out a flood of tears over it.

   If yon are willing to confess, everything will help you to confession,
   and there is good reason for doing it at once. May the Holy Spirit work
   with His most tender influences to melt your heart into contrition!
   Remember, while you are confessing, that each one of your sins has a
   world of evil in it. There is a mine of sin in every little sin. You
   have taken up a spider's nest sometimes--one of those little
   money-spinner's nests--and you have opened it. What thousands of
   spiders you find hanging down and hastening away in many directions!
   What a myriad of them! So in every sin there is a host of sins. There
   is a conglomeration of many kinds of evil in every transgression,
   therefore be humbled on account of each one. Confess your iniquities
   before God and accept the consequences as being your righteous due.

   There stands the block and there is the place for your neck--put it
   down, and say, "Lord, I submit to my sentence and if You bid the
   headsman strike, I cannot complain." Go before God as the citizens of
   Calais came before the English king, with ropes about their necks!
   Submit yourselves to the chastisement due to your offense and then make
   an appeal ad misericordiam, to the mercy of God alone, and say, "For
   Christ's sake--for His blood's sake--have mercy upon me!"

   There is no man, woman, or child in this Tabernacle who shall do that
   tonight who shall be rejected, for, "Him that comes to Me," says
   Christ, "I will in nowise cast out." And this is the right way of
   coming--the way of confessing your sin and acknowledging the evil of
   it--and turning to the great Substitute for deliverance! Say that you
   deserve to be sent to Hell and cast yourself upon the mercy of God in
   Christ Jesus, trusting in the great Surety and Sacrifice, and you shall
   be accepted in and through Him! This is the way of life and he who runs
   therein shall find salvation! May the Lord, by His Holy Spirit, lead
   every one of you without exception to mourn your sin and rest in Jesus.
   Amen.

Strong Faith

   (No. 1367)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, JULY 15, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But was strong in faith, giving glory to God." Romans 4:20.

   ABRAHAM is the father of the faithful. When children have a noble
   father it is a good thing for them to be fully conversant with his
   character and, therefore, we shall do well to consider the life of the
   great Patriarch, especially marking that grand excellence which makes
   him the father of Believers, namely, his faith. Nor should we fail to
   observe the strength of his faith, for in him it reached a very high
   degree. He was not only a Believer, but he was an unstaggering
   Believer. He did not only trust God, but he trusted God most firmly in
   the teeth of all contradiction--not so much as considering the
   difficulties--but believing in God without questioning.

   Oftentimes I have exhorted unbelievers to faith, but now my word is
   directed to those who have faith already, bidding them manifest more
   faith. Where there is the root of faith, we plead for the growth of
   faith. Where there is life, our desire is that it may be found more
   abundantly. If you have not believed at all, then the Gospel cries to
   you, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved!" But if
   you have believed, its voice is, "Grow in Grace and in the knowledge of
   our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."

   We cannot talk to unbelievers upon the subject of strong faith because
   they have none to begin with--if they had even the weakest faith, it
   would save them and become the germ of the highest assurance--but
   without a beginning, how can they be exhorted to increase? There must,
   first of all, be the seed of faith in the heart and then it will be
   wise to water it, but to water barren ground is lost labor. Have you
   given glory to God by believing in the Lord Jesus? Then you may glorify
   Him more by a stronger confidence, but not till then! Those who have
   faith in God are constantly to be exhorted to grow in all Graces and
   especially in the most important and fundamental Grace of faith. They
   are permitted to pray, "Lord, increase our faith," with the assurance
   that, "He gives more Grace."

   My present address will have strong faith for its subject. Let those
   who have believed strive after it. Is it necessary for me to remind you
   that as faith, at first, is the work of the Holy Spirit, so must any
   real growth in it be of Divine operation? Any addition to faith which
   could come to you by or from the flesh, if such a thing were
   supposable, would be an adulteration of faith and not an increase of
   it! That which is born of the flesh is flesh and only that which is
   born of the Spirit is spirit. Even if an increase of faith could come
   to us by the will of man and not by Divine working, it would not be
   worth having, for it would be a counterfeit.

   Only the sap of the trunk can make the branch grow. He who gave you
   faith at the first must give you more faith if you are to become strong
   in it. Yet there is the parallel Truth of God never to be
   forgotten--that while faith is the gift of God--it is, also, our own
   act! The Holy Spirit works faith in us, but we, ourselves, believe. The
   Holy Spirit does not believe for us--what has He to believe? It would
   be altogether absurd to conceive of the Holy Spirit as believing or
   repenting! Nor, if such a thing were possible, could it be of any
   benefit to us, for the faith which saves the soul must be personal and
   cannot be performed by proxy. Faith is both God's gift and man's act.
   The Lord is the Author of our faith, but we, ourselves, believe.

   In the same manner, though the strengthening of our faith will come
   through the Spirit of God, yet must it be our own act and deed--we
   must, ourselves, believe more firmly, and our own heart must be
   exercised to attain to the highest privilege. As unbelief is a sin for
   which the unbeliever must be held responsible, even so is the
   feebleness of faith a fault for which we are blameworthy. We are duty
   bound to believe in God without wavering and if we neglect the matter
   we shall be held guilty concerning it. It is our duty to believe and to
   believe in the highest degree--and though some professors can never see
   the consistency of the two statements that faith is the gift of God and
   yet the duty of man--we are sure that the one is as true as the other.

   And so, while I shall earnestly refer you to the Spirit of God for
   strength in order to obtain more faith, yet I shall not apologize for
   unbelief, or treat strong faith as a work of our own, for which God has
   no claim upon us. I most earnestly declare the responsibility of each
   Believer and claim from him, as the righteous due of a faithful God,
   that he, from now on, believe in Him more fully than he has ever done.
   May the remarks I offer be used by the Holy Spirit to the increase and
   establishment of your confidence in God!

   I. Our first point is this--STRONG FAITH, WHEREVER IT EXISTS, IS
   SUPPORTED BY ABUNDANT REASONS. It is never chargeable with being
   unreasonable fanaticism or blind credence. It is a sound, prudent,
   justifiable thing. For, first, all the reasons which justify our
   believing in God at all, justify our believing in Him most firmly and
   continually. You do not need that I dwell upon this, because it is
   self-evident. It can never be right to believe unless the statements
   are true--and if true they deserve undivided faith. If you have trusted
   your soul with your Redeemer because of the efficacy of His atoning
   blood, that argument pleads with you to trust Him yet more steadfastly
   and confidently.

   If anything is strong enough for you to trust your eternal destiny to,
   your trust ought not to be tinctured with suspicion, or soured with
   mistrust--it ought to be unalloyed as pure gold and immovable as a
   granite rock. Either no confidence or great confidence can be logically
   defended! A divided heart cannot be justified by reason. Dear Brothers
   and Sisters, little faith will save you if it is true faith, but there
   are many reasons why you should seek an increase of it, and among the
   best, this forcible one--Your conscience cannot justify the weakness of
   your faith, nor answer the question, "Therefore do you doubt?"

   If you believe at all, why do you doubt at all? If God is worthy of
   trust, He is worthy of abundant trust! If it is well to lean on Him at
   all, it must be well to lean hard. Is the Lord faithful? Then do not
   both trust and mistrust, believe and disbelieve! Is the promise sure?
   Then do not believe it a little and doubt it a little! Elijah spoke
   concerning Jehovah and Baal, "If Jehovah is God serve Him, and if Baal
   is God serve him." So, also, would I demand in this matter--if the
   Gospel is a lie, deny it. But if it is a Truth of God, believe it! Be
   no longer content to mingle unbelief with faith, as if this were the
   utmost credence that God's children could give to their own Father! It
   is time that this mental twilight came to an end and that the day is
   known to be day and the night to be night.

   Hesitating and questioning, hoping and fearing make but a lame walk for
   a Christian pilgrim and are unreasonable and indefensible. As the legs
   of the lame are not equal, so such a state of mind has not the balance
   which a wise man should seek after. If you go up to the ankles in the
   river of faith, go further, even up to the loins, or to full swimming
   depth, for, if it is right to enter into faith's stream at all, every
   possible argument proves that the deeper you go, the better. Reasons
   for strong faith may be found in abundance in the Character of God. He
   is not like ourselves, for in Him is no mixture of truth and falsehood,
   wisdom and folly, power and weakness!

   Our reliance upon man must be cautiously given and measured out with
   great prudence, for man is only man, but, "the Lord is not a man that
   He should lie, nor the son of man that He should repent." His Character
   absolutely demands implicit faith, insomuch that while meditating upon
   this subject, I felt ashamed of myself that I should need to pray for
   faith in God. It is a clear evidence of our dire depravity that we
   should need to be helped to believe in One who cannot lie! It seems
   inevitable that a creature should trust its Creator and especially such
   a Creator! And it would be inevitable if that creature were not
   exceedingly depraved.

   For a child to trust its father is natural, so natural that no one
   counts it a virtue. How astounding is our moral perversity that we
   should be so far gone out of our right condition of heart that we have
   to argue ourselves into believing our God--and even then succeed not
   till the Holy Spirit gives us faith! It ought to be a very difficult
   thing for a Christian to doubt his heavenly Father. In fact, it ought
   to be impossible, seeing that the Divine Character is incapable of
   falsehood! Beloved, should we not have strong faith who believe in a
   God whose very essence is pure truth? Where deception is inconceivable,
   doubt should be impossible!

   You believe that a shadow of untruth never stained the Character of
   your God--why, then, do you not render to Him strong faith? You
   believe, also, that God is infinitely wise and, therefore, He has never
   spoken rashly nor promised what it might be wiser to withhold. The
   promise was not delivered in haste, or so unguardedly that it might be
   necessary to retract it and, therefore, no alteration can be supposed.
   The Covenant of Promise stands secure even as to its jots and

   tittles. If it had been foolish, it might pass away, but since it is
   ordered by eternal Wisdom, it will outlast the everlasting

   hills.

   Come, then, Beloved, should not the utmost confidence be rendered to
   Him whose every Word is steeped in Infallibility? Should you not
   believe with all your heart and soul and strength in Him whose Truth
   stands fast like the great mountains? Moreover, O man of God, you
   believe in One who is Omnipotent and, therefore, your believing should
   be strong. You know how to answer that question, "Is anything too hard
   for the Lord?" for you believe that with God all things are possible.
   If it is so, then His true Word spoken in wisdom can readily enough be
   carried out. He has but to will it and it is done! God's Word is
   fact--for Him to purpose is to perform--can there, then, arise any
   condition or circumstance which He cannot meet? Then why these doubts?

   In the Presence of an Almighty Promiser, unbelief is as ridiculous as
   it is sinful. "The Strength of Israel will not lie," neither may we
   treat Him with mistrust. You know, also, that your God is Immutable.
   All things change, but your God knows no shadow of a turning! He is
   "the same yesterday, today, and forever." Is He the same? He does not
   take back the Word that goes out of His mouth, nor reverse His Divine
   decree--why, then, question and suspect Him? Better far to believe
   immutably in an Immutable God! Can you not rest in Him who says "I am
   Jehovah; I change not"? You believe, also, that He is the God of Love,
   full of goodness, mercy and loving kindness. What a wanton insult it is
   to mistrust One who cannot be unkind, whose very Nature it is to bless
   His creatures and whose innermost soul is set upon loving and blessing
   His own elect!

   Have you confided in Him? Then does He not assure you that He has
   engraved your name upon the palms of His hands? Has he not said that He
   has loved you with an everlasting love and, therefore, with loving
   kindness He has drawn you? Will you fly in the face of changeless love
   and coldly question it? Can it be possible to trust it too confidingly?
   Surely all these things and much more, in the glorious Character of the
   beloved God, demand of us the strongest imaginable faith! Then, again,
   when I turn my eyes from pure Deity to Him who is bone of our bone and
   flesh of our flesh, even our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom dwells all the
   fullness of the Godhead bodily, it appears incongruous that the blessed
   Son of God should be received with meager confidence.

   God dwelt among men in human flesh. You know it is true, that Jesus,
   the Son of God, abode upon the earth throughout a lowly life amidst
   poverty and shame! And, (wonder of wonders), at last He poured out His
   heart's blood for our redemption! And can we entertain a doubt of His
   ability to save? Do we see those drops of blood from His hands and
   heart, sealing the Everlasting Covenant, and can we doubt? Abraham had
   strong confidence when he saw the smoking furnace and the burning lamp
   passing between the pieces of the slain victims. What ought our
   confidence be when we behold the Lord Jesus Christ, Himself, ratifying
   the Eternal Covenant by His own death? Surely if the Patriarch could
   find rest in the sight of the type, only, we ought to rest without
   thought of fear. When faith beholds the Divine antitype, no thought of
   disquietude should ever arise again!

   My Soul, what more do you need? Is there not, here, more than enough of
   solemn pledge and surety? Are not fountains of assurance opened in the
   bleeding Savior which are deeper than all fear and higher than all
   hope? That wondrous Sacrifice is as high above your thoughts, at their
   best, as the heavens are above the earth! And will you return doubts
   and fears as a fit recompense for such a Divine confirmation of eternal
   love? O Lord, help Your servants to be strong in faith! One other
   reason is, perhaps, of less weight than those which have gone before,
   but I cannot withhold it. It is this--we ought to give to God strong
   faith because there is no evidence to the contrary, nor any supposable
   evidence which could justify mistrust.

   All down the ages those who have trusted in Him have never been
   confused. Our fathers trusted in Him and He helped them to suffer and
   to bear, to attempt and to accomplish, to live and to die. We read just
   now, in the 11th Chapter of Hebrews, the record of what the Lord worked
   in those who believed in Him. Now, on the other side, per contra, there
   stands nothing. Has one child of God come forward wringing his hands
   and saying, "God has not fulfilled His Word and His promises are
   false"? We have stood, many of us, at the bedside of dying saints and
   the truth generally comes out there. But there is not one among us,
   most familiar with such scenes, who ever heard a solitary Believer
   declare that it is a mistake to confide in the blood of Jesus, or an
   error to rest in the faithfulness of God!

   Somewhere, or other, this thing would have come out if it had been so!
   If the Lord had been false to one of His people we should have had a
   sure record of it! And I think we might have trusted the devil and his
   followers, who delight in

   infidelity, to have circulated such a report, pretty largely, all over
   the world--if they had known of one such an instance! But they have not
   one to report! "He forsakes not His saints." Furthermore, I will appeal
   to your own experience--have you experienced anything which casts
   suspicion upon the Character of God? Has the Lord been a wilderness
   unto you? When you have trusted Him, has He failed you? Will you put
   your finger upon a promise which He has broken? Search the Bible
   through and through and find, if you can, one single Word of His
   against which you must write, "false."

   Oh, no! The promise tarries sometimes, but it never lies! There is a
   waiting time for the testing of your faith, but in the end it will be
   seen that He has withheld no good thing from them that walk uprightly
   and you will have to say, at last, like gray-headed Joshua, "There
   failed not one of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the
   house of Israel; all came to pass." Brothers and Sisters, ought we to
   doubt our God when we have no cause to show for it? Is there any
   apology for little faith since we cannot remember any instances of
   prayers unheard, deliverances denied, or mercies refused? We have
   nothing of the kind to quote and, therefore, when we doubt the Lord we
   are guilty of wanton distrust--may the Lord forgive us and deliver us
   from it!

   So much upon that first point, the strongest faith is supported by
   abundant reasons.

   II. And now, secondly, according to the text, STRONG FAITH PRODUCES THE
   MOST DESIRABLE RESULTS. We have not time to go into many of these, but
   we will dwell upon one, the one mentioned in the text, "Strong in
   faith, giving glory to God." Why, this is what we live for--to glorify
   God! Every man who is truly a child of God feels that he has no
   objective which at all approaches to this in importance--his chief end
   is "to glorify God and enjoy Him forever." Well, then, since strong
   faith answers to that end, we ought earnestly to desire it! But how
   does it appear?

   Well, strong faith glorifies God because it treats Him like God.
   Unbelief is practical atheism--denying the truthfulness of God, it
   takes away what is a part of the essential Character of God and mars
   His very existence. I would not say a word to grieve those who have but
   little faith, for the least faith is saving and is most precious, but
   still, weak faith does not treat God like God--it bounds and limits the
   Holy One of Israel! It believes Him up to a point, or under
   such-and-such circumstances--which questions His Omnipresence and
   Omnipotence!

   Strong faith treats God according to His infinite Character. It does
   not suspect Him, because it knows Him to be the God of Truth. It does
   not doubt the possibility of His accomplishing His promises because it
   knows Him to be God All-Sufficient. It does not question His
   faithfulness, because it knows Him to be absolutely Immutable. Alas, we
   often deal with God as if He were like ourselves, or like our fellow
   men. We are fickle and we suppose that He is also. Our fellow men
   promise and fail us, and we act as if our God were like the sons of
   man, who are but worms.

   O Beloved, it robs God of His Glory when we act towards Him otherwise
   than as He is! But it glorifies Him when we gain a Scriptural
   conception of what He is and act towards Him under that aspect--and
   what is that but to trust Him without staggering? To me, when I look at
   it calmly, the strongest faith does not appear to be a wonder--it is
   only what the Lord has a right to receive. Considering the folly and
   depravity of man, faith is a marvelous production of Divine Grace. Yet
   looked at from the Godward side of it, the strongest possible faith in
   God is only what God may justly claim! Do you agree with me, O
   Believers? Does not your Lord deserve to be trusted at all times?

   Further, strong faith brings glory to God because it treats Him as a
   Father and acts towards Him in a childlike spirit. It is very beautiful
   to see the confidence which our children repose in us. Why, even when
   the man is utterly unworthy of respect, you will see the little child
   still believing in his father. And as for those who are favored with
   parents who are wise and gracious, there is--there should always be--an
   implicit reliance upon father's judgment. I have known boys quote their
   father with as implicit a reliance as Christians quote Scripture, or as
   confidently as a Catholic quotes a bull of the Pope. Indeed, what is a
   father, after all, but the papa, the pope, of His child, to a very
   great degree, and though that confidence may be mistaken, yet it is
   natural to the child to feel it. And it is a sad pity that it should
   too often be rudely repressed by the father's folly.

   Now, every child of God ought to have unlimited confidence in God. Is
   He not my Father? Can my Father do an unkind thing to me? Can my Father
   be untrue? Can my heavenly Father be false or changeable? Impossible!
   The child of God does not boast of his faith, for it is only a simple
   childlike trust, yet it glorifies God more than all the efforts of
   proud reason, for it calls Him by the name which He loves and it puts
   Him into the place which He delights in, namely, that of Father to His
   own chosen.

   Again, strong faith honors God because it strengthens all the other
   Graces and these all bring glory to God. Without the Graces of the
   Spirit in him, a man cannot glorify God. Therefore, that which will
   produce in our character all those various lights which are the
   reflections of the Divine excellence as it shone in the Lord Jesus, is
   the chief means of our glorifying God and is to be prized. Faith is the
   root of whatever things are lovely and pure and of good repute. And in
   proportion as it is strong, all these precious things flourish.
   Therefore it greatly tends to magnify the Lord. Strong faith peculiarly
   glorifies God because it gives a striking testimony to the world.

   I do not think the world notices, much, the common faith of ordinary
   Christians. The faith which ordinarily relies upon God in good times,
   the outside world does not think much of. But even carnal minds are
   compelled to view with astonishment the faith which glories in God when
   all temporal things are swept away. The faith which can practice
   eminent self-denial, or which can achieve, through the power of God,
   enterprises which appear foolhardy to mere reason--that is the faith
   which attracts the eyes of men! Then they see your strong faith and
   they glorify your Father which is in Heaven! I pray God that we may
   always have such a faith that it may be worthwhile for men to study it.

   I have known some faith which would have required a man to put a
   microscope to his eye to be able to perceive it at all. And when we
   have declared that little faith saves the soul, the worldling has
   replied, "Well, it is a very small concern, at any rate." Brothers and
   Sisters, ask that your faith may grow! Let it embrace God heartily! Let
   it rest in Him without fear and even the ungodly will be obliged to
   confess that this is the finger of God! Strong faith glorifies God,
   again, because it enables Him to work great works in us and through us.
   As our Savior could not do many mighty works in a certain place because
   of their unbelief, so is God hampered with regard to some of us because
   we have such little confidence in Him.

   He has given to some men all the abilities necessary for the conversion
   of many souls, all the knowledge, all the utterance and a large part of
   the zeal--but they do not believe in Him and, therefore, they are not
   established. Some men's words actually create distrust in the minds of
   others, for they, themselves are so diffident in spirit that they
   rather hinder the children of God in their progress than help them to
   advance in the Divine life. Search, O my Brothers and Sisters, whether
   it is not so! He who has little faith will be made useful according to
   the littleness of his faith, but, if he had more, the Master might use
   him more. If we trusted more, our life would be holier, happier,
   serener, more close with God and more useful. And why should we not?
   Give me a reason why we should not! Oh, Spirit of the living God, why
   should we not? Help us, now, to be strong in faith, giving glory to
   God!

   III. Now I advance to a third observation which, I trust, may give some
   comfort to those who are little in Israel.

   STRONG FAITH, WHICH GIVES GLORY TO God, MAY BE EXERCISED BY PERSONS WHO
   ARE OTHERWISE

   EXCEEDINGLY WEAK. What a joy this is to you who are sufferers in body!
   You do not often creep out of your bed which is now growing so hard
   through your having laid upon it these months. It is quite a holiday
   for you to be found in the House of God now and then. Well, dear
   Brother, dear Sister, you cannot do Apostolic work and range a
   continent, fervently blazing out the Truth of God, but you can have
   strong faith in God!

   You may exhibit a placid patience, a sweet resignation, a sacred
   hopefulness as to the future. You may exhibit a Divine disdain as to
   the fear of death and, if these abound in you, the circle of friends
   who know you and tenderly watch you, are receiving from your example
   the utmost benefit and, perhaps, though you may not be able to enter
   into active service, you may be tutoring others by the strength of your
   faith--and they may accomplish great things as the result of your
   example. At any rate, the weakness of your body need not prevent your
   exercising the strong faith which glorifies

   God.

   So, too, dear Friends, you may have but few talents. You may be
   conscious that you have no brilliance of intellect, that you are not
   persons of remarkable parts or attainments and, yet you may glorify God
   by strong faith! You need not be a genius in order to give glory to
   God, for the strength of your faith will do it! Many a man who is of
   slender intellect glorifies God far more than your great thinkers do
   because the great thinker is too often filled with a high conceit of
   his own thoughts and will not follow God's Word. The poor
   unintellectual Believer rises superior to him by taking the intellect
   of God to be his guiding star.

   You can glorify God, dear Brothers and Sisters, by holding firmly to
   the Truth of God which you understand so little, but which you love so
   heartily. Though you do not know the whole of its meaning, you are in
   much the same condition as your more advanced Brethren, for who knows
   the whole meaning of God's mind? What you do know, you

   are resolved to hold with an iron grip and, by so doing, you greatly
   honor your Lord. Some saints are conscious of weakness of every sort,
   but they must not, therefore, think that they cannot honor God by
   strong faith. Abraham, of whom the text is spoken, was a special
   instance of this. He was so old that his body was now dead and yet he
   believed that he would be the progenitor of the chosen seed! He knew
   that death was written upon him as to all that matter and yet he was
   quite certain that God, who had promised, would certainly perform.

   Do you feel, this morning, almost dead spiritually? Dear lover of
   Jesus, have you wandered from Him so that your consciousness of life in
   Him is dimmed and you hardly know whether you are in Him or not? Are
   you so lethargic your soul cleaves to the dust? Now is the time to
   trust Him! When sin abounds, when fears are thickest, when temptations
   are most furious, when need comes upon you like an armed man--then is
   the time to trust in God! Summer weather faith is poor stuff, but a
   faith which bums on through the long, dark, dreary winter--a faith
   which is not dampened by the rain nor buried by the snowstorm--this is
   faith, indeed, and glorifies God!

   The depth of your weakness is just the height of your possibilities of
   honoring the Lord. If you are nothing, so much the more room for God to
   be everything! If you are unworthy, the more room for confidence in the
   righteousness of Christ! And if you are dead, you are the better able
   to prove the Truth of your Lord's words concerning the Believer,
   "though he were dead, yet shall he live." God grant us Grace that
   whatever our circumstances or conditions, we may have the same
   conquering faith towards God.

   IV. Now, fourthly, THIS STRONG FAITH VARIES AS TO ITS MANNER OF
   WORKING, very much, according

   to the person and his circumstances. There is one thing that strong
   faith does not do which some think it would be sure to do--it never
   blusters and it never talks big and boasts of what it will accomplish.
   "Though all men should forsake You, yet will not I," is not the
   language of strong faith--that is the prattle of Master Peter with his
   pride uppermost! Some men are, in their own opinion, in such a fine
   condition that they could push the whole world before them and drag the
   Church after them--I do not know what they think they could not do!

   Yes, but there is a great deal of difference between confidence in
   yourself and confidence in God. I have noticed that the faith which
   goes forth against the world with the dauntless courage of a lion is
   the very faith which lies down like a lamb at Jesus' feet. The next
   thing to, "I can do all things," is, "Without Christ I can do nothing."
   Consciousness of personal weakness attends a brave reliance upon God
   and shows itself in modesty and quietude of manner. Barking dogs do not
   often bite and those men who promise much, very seldom perform. Strong
   faith has a quiet tongue and does the daring deed without preliminary
   boasting. It does not advertise its coming victories, but falls upon
   the Midianites in the dead of night--and with its lamps and pitchers
   puts them to the rout.

   Point me to one boastful word that ever fell from Abraham. All the
   Scriptural heroes of faith were doers--not braggarts. David said little
   to his envious brothers, but he brought home the giant's bleeding head
   and bade its dumb mouth tell of what he had done. Faith exercises
   itself, as in the case of Abraham, by believing God's Word! God had
   said many things to Abraham and Abraham believed them all. That is a
   rare thing nowadays! The school of modern thought, which considers
   itself to be the most infallible thing now extant, always cuts and
   shapes divinity according to its own views of what it ought to be. In
   fact, it has a god of its own, cut out of the brown paper of its
   philosophies--a god of soft effeminacy who is no more like the Jehovah
   of Abraham than the Venus of Paphos.

   These men believe not what the Bible says, but what they imagine it
   ought to say. Their doctrinal views are like the camel which was
   evolved by a German philosopher out of his own consciousness. He had
   never seen one, but he produced it according to his own notion of what
   it ought to be and he was very strong against humps. He would never
   believe that a real camel had a hump because his consciousness did not
   suggest such a thing! Much of intellectual religion nowadays is just
   that--we have certain gentry about who evolve a gospel out of their own
   brain--and of course they utterly despise the Gospel which actually
   exists because it is not like their model. We are asked to bow down and
   worship the calf which comes out of their furnace, but that we shall
   not do while our faith is strong.

   We believe God's every Word as far as we know it. If I know a doctrine
   to be in God's Word, it is Infallible to me. If I have ever, in
   thought, gone beyond that which is revealed, I do heartily repent of
   such presumption. Brothers and Sisters, do you agree with me? If I see
   in God's Book two Truths which I cannot square with one another, I
   believe them both! There is a middle term somewhere, though I know not
   where to find it. And for the present I believe without that
   explanatory Truth of God. There are the two things--God has said them
   and they must be true--it is mine to believe

   them. Let God be true and every man a liar! This is where strong faith
   is needed in these days--we need a settled creed and a clear,
   comprehensive view of the revealed Truth of God--even if we should, in
   consequence, be called old-fashioned or imbecile, we need to be more
   old-fashioned than ever!

   I am a Radical in many things, but in the doctrines of the Gospel I
   would have you to be Conservative to the backbone--never yielding any
   point of the Truth of God to the most brilliant thinker that the world
   can produce! Thinkers are not appointed to tinker up a gospel for us!
   Thank God, we already have a perfect Gospel! Their shifting gospel
   changes about every 10 years and comes out spick and span as a new
   theology--but we have grasped the old Infallible Truths of God and we
   mean to hang on to them for dear life, being strong in faith, giving
   glory to God!

   But Abraham's was not only receptive faith. His was a faith which
   obeyed the precept. The test of his obedience was the strange command
   to take his only son and offer him up for a sacrifice. But he went to
   do it and, in God's account, he did do it, for he had the will to do it
   at God's bidding. You and I must be willing to do what God tells us, as
   God tells us, when God tells us, because God tells us--and only strong
   faith will be equal to such complete obedience. Then Abraham's faith
   awakened in him great expectations. He was looking for an heir, an heir
   from whom should spring a seed as the stars of Heaven for multitude!

   He expected that quite as confidently as you and I expect tomorrow. We
   shall be full of expectation if we have strong faith. If we are looking
   for blessings, expecting prayers to be answered and promises to be
   fulfilled, that is strong faith. We shall not cry, "How wonderful!"
   every time a prayer is answered, but we shall reckon it a matter of
   necessity that God should stand to every Word that comes out of His
   mouth. May the Lord give you such strong faith as this and may it work
   in this fashion. But time chides me, as it did the Apostle when he
   entered upon this subject. You may well pardon me if I am wordy, for
   even so was he until he said, "Time would fail us to speak of Gideon
   and Jephtha," and so on.

   V. Our last point is, FAITH IS ESPECIALLY TO BE EXPECTED IN CERTAIN
   QUARTERS. Here I wish to speak very pointedly and personally to all my
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ. Dear Friends, there ought to be strong
   faith in us who know God. "They that know Your name will put their
   trust in You, for You, Lord, have not forsaken them that seek You." And
   if He does not forsake the seekers, much less will He forsake those who
   have found Him and trusted in Him! Brothers and Sisters, there are some
   you can trust till you know them, but if it is true that when you do
   know them you can no longer trust them, it proves that they have a bad
   character. Now, you who know the Lord ought never to throw your God
   under such a suspicion! If you know Him, trust Him! I know you will.

   We expect strong faith, next, from those who have had a long experience
   of Him. We can almost forgive you young people who have just started in
   the Christian life if you are vexed with doubts and fears, though
   truly, God does not deserve them even of you! But when your sires begin
   to doubt, what shall we say of them? What? Have you known Him 50 years
   and cannot trust Him? What? My dear Brother, has the Lord kept you till
   you are seventy? How long do you expect to live? To eighty? Well, He
   has been good to you for 70 years, cannot you trust Him for the last
   ten? What? tested Him over and over again and never found a flaw in His
   fidelity--you have been in deep waters and kept from sinking--and yet
   are you mistrustful?

   What are those things upon your feet? Shoes of iron and brass! He said
   they should be. Are you afraid that after all these years you will be
   footsore and shoeless? He promised, "as your days so shall your
   strength be." How has it been? "Why," you say, "it has been so up to
   this moment." Then why not to the end? Speak well of the bridge which
   has carried you over so many times! As I have already said, you cannot
   put your finger upon a single instance in which the good Lord has
   deceived you! And if you never doubt your Lord till you have reason for
   it, you will never doubt Him at all! Come, come, let those of us who
   have been 25 years in the ways of God put aside our childish doubts!
   Yet I guarantee you this is easier said than done and, though we talk
   thus and we know it is true and right, alas, our nature goes readily
   astray into a wicked and provoking distrust of God!

   Further, dear Friends, those ought to trust Him who have lived in
   fellowship with Him. If you have been on the top of Tabor. If you have
   known the kisses of His mouth and tasted of His love, which is better
   than wine, if you have tasted unprecedented joy in His arms, in the
   full assurance of faith and the enjoyment of perfect love--why should
   you come down from the mountain and distrust Him? God forbid that we
   should do this! May the recollection of the hill Mizar and the
   Hermonites come freshly over our minds, this morning, and may we rest
   in our God! Those who are getting near to

   Heaven ought not to distrust Him. I see upon some of you the marks of
   the coming end. The snowflakes of many winters lie on your brows, no,
   the wind has blown even those away from some of you and left the summit
   bare!

   You will soon behold your Lord! Your eyes will soon see the King in His
   beauty in the land that is very far off. Do not let it be among the
   last memories of earth that you doubted your Beloved! Oh, you who have
   known Him from your youth and have proved His faithfulness till you
   have come to palsied age, do not, now, begin to suspect your gracious
   God! You do not doubt the partner of your bosom who has shared your
   sorrows for half a century and has been the comfort of your life--you
   do well to trust in her, for it is said of such--"The heart of her
   husband does safely trust her." But surely, she is not to be relied
   upon as implicitly as your God! Oh, dear aged Brother, permit one who
   is but a little child compared with you, to entreat you. Console and
   cheer the younger people by the exhibition of confidence and serenity
   worked in you by strong faith!

   Lastly, we who are teachers of others ought to have strong faith in
   God. I think we may, at times, profitably mention our own doubts and
   fears for the encouragement of those who are terribly downcast, but it
   ought always to be done with very great prudence and much regret. I
   remember once speaking of my own trembling, when preaching, and a
   venerable Brother said to me afterwards, "I do not think, dear Pastor,
   that you were right in speaking of your own transgressions so freely.
   You encouraged the people, certainly, by what you said about yourself,
   but I hardly think they ought to be encouraged. Now, suppose you were
   to go into the pulpit and say, 'there are some of you who are thieves.
   It is very wrong of you, but still do not despair, for I thieve a
   little myself.' Why, you know," he said, "you would not be doing good,
   but harm! And yet thieving is not more truly a sin than doubting
   God--in fact there is the utmost sin in unbelief."

   I replied to my good Brother that he was right and I thanked him for
   the correction. Whenever, dear Hearers, you catch any of us who are
   teachers doubting and fearing, do not pity us, but scold us! We have no
   right to be in Doubting Castle! Pray do not visit us there. Follow us
   as far as we follow Christ, but if we get into the horrible Slough of
   Despond, come and pull us out by the hair of our heads if necessary,
   but do not fall into it yourselves! Never say, "My beloved pastor went
   there and, therefore, I may go there." No, but say, "Even our minister
   fell into that error and, therefore, I will keep as far from it as ever
   I can, for if the teacher slips, the disciple may easily do so and,
   therefore, I must very carefully watch against unbelief."

   Brothers and Sisters, we shall never succeed in winning sinners to
   faith if we preach what we do not intensely believe. I do verily
   believe that the sinner is lost and that unless Grace saves him, he is
   lost forever. I believe that eternal punishment will fall upon him
   unless he repents and believes in Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus
   shed his precious blood and that whoever believes in Him is saved
   beyond all fear of destruction, saved by the blood of the Lamb. We must
   preach in a believing manner, knowing our message to be true, or else
   men will die in unbelief! And, what is more, I do not think we shall
   have many conversions unless we expect God to bless His Word and feel
   certain that He will do so. We must not wonder and be astonished if we
   hear of a dozen or two conversions, but let the astonishment be that
   thousands are not converted when they hear such Divine Truth and when
   we ask the Holy Spirit to attend it with Divine energy.

   God will bless us in proportion to our faith! It is the rule of His
   Kingdom. "According to your faith so be it unto you." O God, give Your
   ministers more faith! Let us believe You firmly! Oh, that we could
   believe You up to the fullest possible measure of faith and never doubt
   You again! If the enemy number thousands, give us the faith of Samson
   to throw ourselves upon them and in the name of God to smite them! And
   though we, ourselves, as to all power to convert others are as dead
   men--and though the sinner is dead--yet help us to believe that souls
   can be begotten, again, by the preaching of the Gospel--and let us
   preach with confidence in Your Divine power. O Lord, grant this to us,
   for Jesus' sake. Amen.

The God of Peace and Our Sanctification

   (No. 1368)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 5, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now the God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus,
   that Great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the Everlasting
   Co venant, make you perfect in every good work to do His will, working
   in you that which is well-pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ;
   to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen." Hebrews 13:20,21.

   THE Apostle, in the 18th verse, had been earnestly asking for the
   prayers of the Lord's people. On the behalf of all his Brethren he
   said, "Pray for us." And for himself he added, "I beseech you the
   rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner." If the
   Apostle needed the prayers of his Brethren, how much more do we who are
   so greatly inferior to him in all respects? We may, indeed, even with
   tears, appeal to you who are our Brothers and Sisters in Christ and
   entreat you to be earnest in your supplications to God on our behalf.
   What can we do without your prayers? They link us with the Omnipotence
   of God! Like the lightning rod, they pierce the clouds and bring down
   the mighty and mysterious power from on high.

   But what the Apostle was anxious to receive, he was careful to bestow
   and, therefore, he proceeded in the words of our text to plead for his
   Brothers and Sisters, from which we learn that if we desire others to
   pray for us we must set the example by praying for them! We cannot
   expect to be benefited by other men's prayers unless the spirit of
   supplication dwells in us, also. In this matter the Lord will give us
   good measure pressed down and running over according as we give unto
   others. Other hearts shall be stirred up to intercede for us if we are,
   ourselves, diligent in intercession. Pray, if you would be prayed for!

   The prayer before us was an exceedingly great one, for Paul had learned
   to ask great things of the Lord. The Holy Spirit had filled him with
   much love to the Hebrews and with a strong desire for their welfare
   and, therefore, he asks for that which is the greatest of all blessings
   to the people of God--that they may be fit for every good work and that
   God may work in them to do that which is well-pleasing in His sight.
   When we plead for God's own beloved people, we are safe in asking for
   the best of blessings! If we feel straitened in pleading for ourselves,
   there can be no reason in being so in reference to them, since we know
   that the Lord loves them and abounds towards them in Grace through
   Christ Jesus.

   It is noteworthy that this prayer or benediction comes at the close of
   the Epistle, even as in Christian assemblies the benediction is
   pronounced at the end of the worship. Let the end of all our acts be a
   blessing to men and a doxology to God! As long as you live, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, endeavor to bless others--and when you die,
   conclude life with a blessing, even as your Lord and Master did, who,
   as He ascended to Heaven, was seen with outstretched hands blessing His
   people. As Jacob would not let the angel go until He blessed him, so we
   should not cease from preaching or writing in the name of the Lord
   until we have a comfortable persuasion that a blessing has come upon
   our Brethren.

   This prayerful benediction is an exceedingly instructive one. It has,
   within itself, the whole compass of the Gospel, as one might show if
   this were our objective at this season. It is condensed spiritual meat!
   Much in little--all things in one blessing. Every word is as a pearl of
   value and as the deep as the sea. It is not the objective of prayer to
   instruct our fellow men. A decided distinction ought always to be drawn
   between praying and preaching--and those err greatly who, under the
   name of prayer, not only instruct, but argue and exhort! Yet it is a
   remarkable fact that there is no inspired prayer in Scripture but what
   is full of teaching to those who are willing to study it.

   Take any one of the Psalms--though they are addressed to God, yet
   within them the preacher finds a thousand texts from which to inculcate
   the doctrines and the precepts of the Lord. As for the prayers of our
   Lord Jesus, they drop fatness--that which is commonly called, "The
   Lord's Prayer," contains a world of doctrine! And that glorious prayer
   in the 17th of John is as honey from the honeycomb! Now, since the same
   Spirit that worked of old, works, also, in us, I

   conclude that He will lead us, also, to pray to the edification of
   those who hear us. Though the foremost objective of prayer is not the
   instruction of our fellow men, yet prayer ought to be full of good
   matter and worthy of the consideration of those whom we invite to join
   in it!

   Public prayer would be a far better means of Grace to the people if
   those who utter petitions in public would seek preparation of heart
   from the Lord and enter upon the exercise with careful thought. Surely
   it is not sufficient to repeat a round of godly expressions which have
   become current in the Church, but we ought to speak with the Spirit and
   with the understanding in our approaches to God, so that the thoughts
   of our fellow Christians may be excited and their hearts united with us
   in our public devotions. He who prays a dull prayer in public, devoid
   of all thought and meditation, dampens the flame of devotion, whereas
   it was his duty to have added fuel to it. I invite those who take part
   in our Prayer Meetings to lay this matter to heart.

   We must, however, further note that though the prayer of Paul for the
   Hebrew Believers is full of doctrine, yet the whole of it tends to the
   end which he had in view. He did not garnish his prayer with extraneous
   ornament, nor drag in needless doctrinal statements--every word was
   meant to support his plea for personal, practical holiness--which was
   the one objective of his prayer. While he shows us from where holiness
   must come and how it must come, and how it is worked in us and what it
   is like when it is worked in us, he is, all along, bringing forth his
   strong arguments with the Lord that in the Hebrew Believers this
   holiness might be worked abundantly.

   I am sure I shall have your earnest attention while I endeavor to weigh
   the very words of the text, since each one is full of meaning. I cannot
   hope, in the short space of one sermon, to bring out the whole fullness
   of its meaning, for who can hold the sea in the hollow of his hand, or
   compass the fullness of such a text in one brief address? Yet I would
   labor to give you sufficient insight into it to let you see that its
   lengths and breadths and depths and heights are not easily to be
   measured by mortal mind.

   I. I call your attention to THE PECULIAR TITLE UNDER WHICH GOD IS
   ADDRESSED IN THIS PRAYER-- "Now, the God of Peace." The names of God
   employed in prayer in Holy Scripture are always significant. Holy men
   of old were not so poverty-stricken in language as always to address
   God under one name, nor were they so careless as to speak with Him
   under such a title as might first come to hand. In their approaches to
   the Most High they carefully regarded that attribute of the Divine
   Nature from which they expected the blessing which they desired. If
   they needed that their enemies should be overthrown, they pleaded with
   the arm of His strength. If they were wrongfully entreated, they prayed
   to the God of Righteousness. If they needed pardon for their sins, they
   pleaded with the God of Mercy.

   And such names as Jehovah, Elohim, Shaddai, are not used
   indiscriminately in the prayers of the saints of old, but always with
   selection and judgment. Why, then, did the Apostle here call God, "the
   God of Peace"? He had a reason. What was it? It is a Pauline
   expression. You find that title only in the writings of Paul. It is a
   name of Paul's own coinage by the teaching of the Holy Spirit. There
   were reasons in Paul's experience which led him to dwell upon this
   peculiar trait of the Divine Character. Each man, seeing with his own
   eyes, sees something peculiar in the name of the Lord. And the Apostle
   of the Gentiles, when writing to Hebrew Believers, saw with special
   clearness, "the God of Peace," who had made both Jew and Gentile to be
   one in Christ, so making peace.

   If you look in the Epistle to the Romans, the 15th Chapter and 33rd
   verse, you find him praying, "Now, the God of Peace be with you all."
   In the same Epistle, Chapter 16, verse 20, he says, "The God of Peace
   shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly." Again, in the second
   Epistle to the Corinthians, 13:11, he says, "Be perfect, be of good
   comfort, be of one mind, live in peace and the God of Love and Peace
   shall be with you." In Philippians 4:9, he concludes his exhortation
   with, "Those things, which you have both learned, and received, and
   heard and seen in me, do; and the God of Peace shall be with you." But
   especially in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, there is a passage strikingly
   parallel to our text. He there prays, "And the very God of Peace
   sanctify you wholly."

   Sanctification is the subject of the present prayer. Just as in our
   text he prays, "Perfect you in every good work to do His will," so in
   Thessalonians he says, "And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and
   body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
   It is evident, not only that the Apostle delighted in the expression
   peculiar to himself, but that he saw a close connection between the
   peace of God and the sanctifying of Believers. And for this reason,
   both in the Thessalonians and in the Hebrews, his prayer for their
   sanctification is addressed to the God of Peace. The title is a Gospel
   one.

   God is not spoken of as the God of Peace in the Old Testament--but
   there He is, "a man of war, the Lord is His name." "He shall cut off
   the spirit of princes; He is terrible to the kings of the earth." He is
   frequently spoken of in the Psalms and the Prophets as, "the Lord
   strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle," and it is a part of
   Israel's praise of Him that He slew mighty kings, "for His mercy
   endures forever." Constantly, in the older volume of Inspiration, do we
   read of, "the Lord of Hosts," and of this title an old Divine says, "It
   has the sound of hostility in it." But now we no longer speak of the
   Lord of Hosts, but of the God of Peace, for, since Jesus is our Peace,
   the enmity is slain.

   Messiah's reign began with songs in Heaven of, "peace on earth,
   goodwill towards men." His errand was peace! His spirit was peace! His
   teaching was peace! His last testament was peace and, through His
   atonement, from the opened heavens, the God of Peace and Consolation
   looks down upon the sons of men! The appropriateness of the title to
   the particular prayer will readily strike you, for holiness is peace.
   "May the God of Peace make you holy," for He Himself is peace and
   holiness. When holiness reigned over the whole universe peace reigned
   also. There was no war in Heaven till one who had been an angel became
   a devil and fomented a rebellion against the thrice holy God!

   Sin brings forth strife, but holiness is the mother of peace. In
   perfection there is peace and, therefore, Paul prays the God of Peace
   to make His children perfect. Holiness is well-pleasing to Him and when
   He is pleased, all is peace. Therefore Paul prays Him to work in them
   that which is well-pleasing in His sight. The God of Peace has, also,
   graciously restored peace and reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ.
   But it has been by the putting away of sin, for while sin remained,
   peace was impossible. "The blood of the Everlasting Covenant," of which
   the text speaks, was the sealing of a Covenant of Peace which God made
   between Himself and man. Of old there were thoughts of peace in the
   mind of God towards His chosen.

   In the fullness of time the gift of Christ and His atoning death was
   the actual establishment of peace, for He has made peace by the blood
   of His Cross. He is the ambassador of God to us and by His
   substitutionary Sacrifice peace was effectually made, "for He is our
   Peace." By the blood of the Everlasting Covenant there was a treaty
   made between God and His elect which shall stand fast forever and ever.
   As for our Lord's Resurrection and Ascension, of which the text
   speaks--"The God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord
   Jesus"--that was the open proclamation of peace. So long as Jesus was
   in the grave peace was not openly declared--it was assuredly
   established--but not publicly announced. But when the Mediator rose and
   especially when He ascended on high and received gifts for men and sat
   down at the right hand of God, even the Father, then, before the whole
   universe, it was declared that God was at peace with the sons of men.

   Jesus is in all things the Adam, the model man, the representative of
   His people and peace with Him means peace with all who are in Him. He
   died for our sins, but He rose again for our justification, which is
   none other than the replacing of us in a condition of reconciliation
   with God. He went into Heaven to take possession of our inheritance and
   what better evidence could there be that we are reconciled to God? If
   our Representative sits at His right hand, we may be confident that the
   Lord is reconciled unto us. Beloved, if you pursue the subject, you
   will see more and more clearly the significance of the title, "the God
   of Peace," for, to make us perfect in every good work to do His will is
   to give us peace!

   Although every Christian is justified by faith in Christ and so has a
   judicial peace with God, yet we never can enjoy perfect peace with our
   own consciences so long as any sin is committed by us, or dwells in us.
   So long as there shall remain a solitary tendency to sin within these
   members, we shall be disturbed. Sin will contend with Grace and newborn
   Grace will war with inbred sin. Sin and Grace can no more agree than
   fire and water. Even the God of Peace never tries to establish a peace
   between good and evil, for it would be monstrous even if it were
   possible! The way to peace is the way of holiness. Cast out sin and you
   cast out contention. Subdue iniquity and peace wins the victory.

   Beloved, it is of no use for us to seek happiness in life except by the
   way of holiness of conversation. I have already declared that we have
   peace with God through the atoning work of our Lord Jesus Christ--but
   for deep calm of heart and quiet of conscience there must be a work of
   sanctification within us worked by the power which raised Jesus Christ
   from the dead. Sin is our enemy and the new life within us is heartily
   at enmity with evil and, therefore, peace can never be proclaimed in
   the triple kingdom of our nature until we always do that which is
   well-pleasing in the sight of the Lord, through Jesus Christ.

   Nor is this all. When the Apostle, praying for our sanctification,
   prays to the God of Peace, it is as much as to say to us that we must
   view God as the God of Peace if we are to be led to do His will. O man,
   is God your enemy? Then you will

   never serve Him, nor do that which is well-pleasing in His sight! Do
   you, at this moment, feel a horror of God, a dread at the mention of
   His name? Then you can never do that which will please Him, for without
   faith it is impossible to please God. Faith is the reverse of horror!
   You must, first of all, know that there is peace between you and your
   God, and then you can please Him. This knowledge can only come to you
   through Christ Jesus, for peace is made only by "the blood of the
   Everlasting Covenant."

   When once you know that the Lord has made with you an Everlasting
   Covenant, ordered in all things and sure, then you have leverage to
   work with. Then are you founded upon a rock whereon you may be built up
   in every form of obedience, but not till then. Peace with God is the
   root of virtue! Reconciliation by the death of His Son is the door to
   conformity to the life of His Son. May we know our Great Shepherd both
   in His dying Atonement and living example as the Lord and Giver of
   peace.

   I think, also, that the Apostle, in thus praying to "the God of Peace,"
   had in His mind's eye the entire Church of the Hebrews, or, if you
   will, any one Christian Church. Brethren, it is essential that we have
   peace in the Church! Whatever is the enmity on the outside, we must
   love one another! If we do not walk in love, we certainly cannot have
   prosperity. God, alone, can give peace to a Church and He only gives it
   by sanctifying its members, stirring them up to good works, keeping
   them in sacred activity, making them fit to labor for Him and working
   in them to do that which is well-pleasing in His sight.

   When you hear of disturbances in Churches you need not so much seek to
   compose the differences among the members as to amend the members,
   themselves! We would not gather so many thorns if the plants were fig
   trees. Wars and fights would never spring up among us if we were not
   carnal and unsanctified. If we were more spiritually-minded we would be
   more ready to forgive and less likely to offend or to be offended. "Are
   you not carnal?" asks the Apostle, "because one says, I am of Paul, and
   another, I am of Cephas," and the like. But once let the God of Peace
   sanctify each Believer and then will every man seek his brother's good
   and the things which make for peace. When you pray for the peace of
   Jerusalem, remember that you can promote it by laboring after holiness.

   Before leaving this first head, I would call to your notice the fact
   that the title, the "God of Peace," sheds a light over the whole
   passage and is beautifully in harmony with every word of the prayer.
   Let us read it line by line. "Now the God of Peace, that brought again
   from the dead our Lord Jesus." War drives men down to the dead and is
   the great jackal of the grave. Ah, how sadly the nations see this
   exemplified in the East at this moment. War brings down death, but the
   God of Peace brings back from the dead. The restoration of the Lord
   Jesus from the grave was a peaceful act and was meant to be the
   guarantee of peace accomplished forever!

   "That Great Shepherd of the sheep"--sheep are peaceful creatures--and a
   shepherd's occupation has not to do with blood-red fields of strife. We
   always couple with the idea of peace the quietness and repose of the
   sheepfold and the simple restfulness of flocks in green pastures. Peace
   is the very atmosphere of pastoral scenes. "Through the blood of the
   Everlasting Covenant." The very word, "Covenant," is, also, full of
   peace and especially is it so when we remember that it is a Covenant of
   peace which Eternal Love has established between Himself and man. Where
   no Covenant or league exists, war may break out at any time, but where
   a Covenant is once established there is peace and rest.

   The Apostle goes on to pray, "Make you perfect in every good work to do
   His will." If God's will is done by us, then there must be peace, for
   no ground of difference can exist. "Working in you that which is
   well-pleasing in His sight." Oh, the soft music of these words! When
   all in us is well-pleasing to God, then, indeed, is He the God of Peace
   to us! The final doxology is, also, very significant, for, in effect,
   it proclaims the universal and eternal reign of peace--"To whom be
   glory forever and ever. Amen." What can there be to disturb the
   universe when the Lord God Omnipotent shall reign and all nations shall
   glorify and extol the Ever Blessed, world without end? Not without
   reason, therefore, did our Apostle select the title, "The God of
   Peace."

   II. We have now briefly to consider THE SPECIAL ACT DWELT UPON IN THIS
   PRAYER. "That brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that Great
   Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant."
   Here I would have each one of you, for himself, read the passage of
   Scripture which I think the Apostle had in mind when he wrote these
   words. Turn to Isaiah 63:11--"Then he remembered the days of old,
   Moses, and his people, saying, Where is He that brought them up out of
   the sea with the shepherd of His flock? Where is He that put His Holy
   Spirit within

   them? That led them by the right hand of Moses with His glorious arm,
   dividing the water before them, to make for Himself an everlasting
   name?"

   See how this making to Himself an everlasting name tallies with the
   last clause--"To whom be glory forever and ever"? But let us
   proceed--"Who led them through the deep as an horse in the wilderness,
   that they should not stumble." Truly, those do not stumble in whom the
   Lord works "that which is well-pleasing in His sight." "As a beast goes
   down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest"--there
   is the God of Peace--"so You lead Your people, to make Yourself a
   glorious name"--there again is the doxology, "To whom be glory forever
   and ever." The historical event to which he alludes is the deliverance
   from Egypt and the coming up from the Red Sea!

   Having saved His people by the blood of the Covenant which was smeared
   upon their doorposts, He led them to the Red Sea, their foes pursuing
   them. Into the Red Sea they descended--not to its banks, alone, did
   they go, but into its very depths they passed and there were they
   buried--the sea was as the place of death to them. Between its liquid
   walls and beneath the cloudy pillar which hung over the passage, they
   were baptized unto Moses and buried in Baptism as in a liquid tomb! But
   lo, they come up out of it again, led safely up from what became the
   grave of Pharaoh, with songs and shouts and rejoicing!

   The parallel is this--"That Great Shepherd," who is far greater than
   Moses and Aaron, must go down into the place of death on behalf of His
   people. He must, as the Representative of His flock, descend into the
   sepulcher. This He did, for He bowed His head and died. But lo, the
   Lord led Him up, again, from the deeps and He arose to life and
   glory--and all His people with Him! On that day the song might have
   been jubilant as that of Miriam when she chanted, "Sing unto the Lord,
   for He has triumphed gloriously. Your right hand, O Lord, is become
   glorious in power." But now, in this greater deliverance by "the blood
   of the Everlasting Covenant" the Psalm is not to the Lord who is a man
   of war, but to "the God of Peace." The honor is ascribed to the same
   Lord, but under a gentler name and to Him be glory forever and ever.

   I have no doubt that Paul, in part, borrowed his imagery from the Red
   Sea which is, of all deliverances, the most instructively typical. Is
   it not even in Heaven the chosen type, for there they sing the song of
   Moses the servant of God and of the Lamb? With that illustration to
   help us, we shall notice that the bringing back of the Lord Jesus from
   the dead was the seal of His perfected work and, consequently, of our
   peace and ultimate perfection in holiness. The Lord Jesus could no more
   be held by the bands of death but might justly return to His Throne.
   Because He had finished all His work, the Word of authority declared
   His freedom and He was brought back to His former Glory. Because He had
   worked all righteousness He stood among living men--and because He had
   merited a crown of glory He rose even to the Throne of Jehovah, to sit
   there till His enemies are made His footstool. His work is finished
   and, therefore, God acknowledges the fact by bringing Him, again, from
   the dead!

   Most wisely does the Apostle pray that He who thus owned Christ's
   finished work would finish His Spirit's work in us. Christ is
   perfected, therefore, O Lord, perfect Your saints! Jesus has done Your
   will, help us to do it! May He that brought Jesus from the dead in
   token of His completed righteousness bring up, also, His people from
   all relics of their death of sin and make them complete in holiness to
   the glory of His name! Beloved, we go further. The bringing, again, of
   Christ from the dead was, in effect, the leading back of all His
   people! Not without the sheep did the Shepherd come, for that were to
   return defeated. He went down into the grave to seek the lost sheep
   and, finding them, He flung them on His shoulders and, as He came up
   from the grave, He bore upon His mighty shoulders the sheep for whom He
   died.

   The text speaks of, "Our Lord Jesus." Did you notice that? Ours in His
   offices of Shepherd and Savior--altogether ours as brought, again, from
   the dead! What He did was for us! He is the Great Shepherd of the sheep
   and, therefore, what He did was for the sheep. We can give many reasons
   why the Lord Jesus is the Great Shepherd. He is the Shepherd, not of
   one congregation, but of all the saints in all ages and because the
   sheep are His own and He who owns the sheep is far greater than He who
   only feeds the flock for another. But the reason which just now
   attracts my attention is this--if there is a Great Shepherd, there must
   be a great flock.

   You cannot truly call any man a shepherd if he has no sheep, nor call
   him a great shepherd if he has not a great flock. So He "that brought
   again from the dead that Great Shepherd of the sheep," did, by that act
   and deed, bring up the great flock from the dead, too, for so long as
   our Lord Jesus can truly be called a shepherd, He must have a living
   flock--they are inseparable from Him and essential to Him. The Church
   is the fullness of Christ. A king is no king without subjects.

   A head is no head without a body and a shepherd is no shepherd without
   sheep. The idea of the Great Shepherd involves the chosen flock--His
   bringing, again, from the dead, as a Shepherd, involves their coming up
   in Him.

   The Resurrection and the Glory of Christ are thus the resurrection and
   the glory of all His flock for whom He laid down His life! Glory be to
   His name for this! Now you see the force of the petition which may be
   interpreted thus-- Lord, You have brought Your people up from the dead
   in Christ, therefore bring them up from all the death of sin. Quicken
   them to fullness of life. Perfect them in every good work to do Your
   will. Work in them that which is well-pleasing in Your sight because
   this is their spiritual resurrection, this is the giving to them what
   you did give to Christ on their behalf--therefore fulfill it unto them.

   Beloved, it needs the same power to make us holy that it needed to
   bring our Savior from the dead! That same power which raised the dead
   body of Christ must raise us from our death in sin. The same power
   which enabled the living Christ to climb from earth to Heaven and take
   His Throne, must be exercised in living saints to make them rise from
   one degree of holiness to another, till they shall be presented without
   spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, before the Father. Yes, and that
   power comes to us because Christ has risen! "Because I live," He says,
   "you shall live, also." And because He lives to intercede, therefore
   His people are preserved from evil. Satan desires to have us, that he
   may sift us as wheat. But the Great Shepherd, who was brought, again,
   from the dead, is daily watching over us and pleading for us! And the
   power of His life, of His Kingdom and of His pleas are manifested in us
   so that we conquer temptation and advance from strength to strength in
   our pilgrimage to Heaven.

   The text is all of one piece and each word is necessary and important.
   We have not here pious expressions strung together without reason, but
   every single syllable adds to the weight of the whole. The work
   described in this text must be worked in us by the Spirit of God. Jesus
   is the Model to which we are to be conformed. Beloved, you must go down
   to death as Jesus did and be buried with Him that you may rise with
   Him! There must be in you the death of all carnal power and strength or
   the power of God cannot be revealed in you! You must know the depths as
   Moses did--even the depths wherein proud self-sufficiency is drowned!
   You must be baptized in the cloud and in the sea--you must have, over
   you, the sentence of condemnation.

   You must acknowledge in your own soul that in your flesh there dwells
   no good thing and that you are condemned under the Law--and then there
   must be worked in you a quickening, a coming to life, a coming up out
   of the place of condemnation and death! Happy is he who has come forth
   from the tomb of his former vain conversation, leaving the grave
   clothes of worldliness and sin behind--coming up to be clothed with a
   heavenly mind and to lead a new life, secret and Divine as that of the
   risen Savior! Yes, like that of the ascended Lord, "for He has raised
   us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenlies in Christ
   Jesus." "You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."

   Have you realized this? You have been buried in Baptism, many of you,
   but were you, at that time, partakers of your Lord's death? You had no
   right to be buried if you were not dead! Did you really know that death
   had passed upon you before you were buried with your Savior? And now do
   you feel the life of God within you, quickening you to newness of life?
   If so, it will daily lift you to something nobler and better till you
   shall be ultimately raised to dwell where you shall never again be
   defiled by sin--where Satan shall be bruised under your feet and the
   God of Peace shall reign! When you shall dwell in perfect holiness,
   then shall you reign in perfect peace! May He who brought our Lord
   Jesus from the grave to Glory, bring you, also, along the upward way
   till you are with Him and like He forever!

   III. Thirdly, let us notice THE VERY REMARKABLE MANNER IN WHICH THE
   HOLINESS PRAYED FOR IS DESCRIBED in the text. "Make you perfect in
   every good work to do His will." That is the first clause, but the
   translation is not strictly accurate. The passage would be better
   rendered, "make you fit in every good work to do His will," and the
   original Greek word, (though I have not noticed that expositors observe
   it, yet anyone turning to the lexicon will see it), properly means to
   reset a bone that is dislocated.

   The meaning of the text is this--by the Fall, all our bones are out of
   joint for the doing of the Lord's will. And the desire of the Apostle
   is that the Lord will set the bones in their places and thus make us
   able with every faculty and in every good work to do His will. If we
   take the arm-joint for our illustration, He would have it so well set
   that it may be capable of every movement for which an arm was at first
   constructed by Infinite Wisdom. A dislocated bone may be so badly set
   as only to be capable of a part of the motions natural to it--there may
   be a flaw in the surgery so that certain

   movements cannot be performed. There may be a stiffness and an
   awkwardness and even a positive inability for certain movements--this
   may be seen in some men's minds, but it is by no means desirable.

   The Apostle would have every bone in us to be well set and our whole
   manhood fitted for performing every form of good work to thoroughly do
   the will of the Lord. What a blessed prayer! O Lord, You have raised
   Your Son up in perfection, not a bone of His was broken. And now we,
   who are His body, need to be set together and fixed, every joint in its
   own place, and the whole Church compactly knitted together by its bands
   and sinews, so that it may be in perfect order for performing Your
   Divine will.

   I apprehend that our text refers not so much to any one Believer as to
   the entire Church, for the Apostle speaks of the Great Shepherd of the
   sheep, by which he must mean the whole Church. The Apostle prays that
   the Lord would perfectly joint His Church, put it into harmonious union
   and so make it fit to do all that God meant the Church to do here
   below. When shall we see our Churches in such a state? Alas, the
   disjointed members of our Churches cause great pain and weakness to the
   body--and only holiness can put them into their proper position. If I
   must take the text as applying to each individual, the prayer is that
   you and I may be fitted to do the Divine will everywhere--fitted to
   suffer, fitted to labor, fitted for the meanest office in the Church,
   (which requires a great deal of fitness, by the way), fitted for the
   highest work in the Church and fitted for anything that God wishes us
   to do.

   The prayer, therefore, asks that we may not be competent for only one
   set of duties, but may be ready for all things. We shall greatly
   glorify God if we have a complete character in which every Grace shall
   be manifested and in which no single sin is seen to mar its
   consistency. Such is the prayer. Who can work this, good Lord? Who can
   work this in us? You can, O God of Peace, for You did bring up Your Son
   from the grave to the Throne! And You can bring up our mangled nature
   and perfect it till it shall be ready to partake of the inheritance of
   the saints in light, world without end. The first part of the prayer,
   then, is for fitness for holiness. The next is for actual
   service--"Working in us that which is well-pleasing in His sight."

   And here I ask you to notice how all things are of God. We might have
   thought that the Apostle would have said, "Lord, when You have made us
   fit to work for You, then help us to serve You." But he does not say
   so. He puts his prayer into a humbler form and asks the Lord to work in
   us. What a heavy blow at all self-glory! How instructive to us! Dear
   Brothers and Sisters, when the Lord makes you fit for every good work,
   you will still do no good work unless He works it in you! Even he who
   is best adapted for the performance of virtue and holiness does not
   perform these things till the Lord works in him to will and to do of
   His own good pleasure!

   Over and above this mode of securing all the Glory to God, notice the
   next clause--"through Jesus Christ." That which we do, even when the
   Lord works in us, we only do through Jesus Christ! We are nothing
   without our Lord and though we do what is acceptable in the Lord's
   sight, it is only acceptable through Jesus Christ! What nothings and
   nobodies we are! Even when the Lord does the most for us that can be
   done, so that we dwell in His sight and our actions become
   well-pleasing to Him and He looks upon us with delight--yet even then
   we are nothing! It is the Lord that has worked all in us, even the God
   of Peace, who is All in All!

   To each fruitful bough He says, "From Me is your fruit found." When
   your garments sparkle like the sun, it is He that transfigures you!
   When your face shines like Moses' through secret communion upon the
   mountain, it is God's brightness which illuminates your brow! Our
   goodness is none of ours, "for we are His workmanship, created in
   Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before ordained that we
   should walk in them."

   IV. Our fourth point drops into its place very naturally, for we have
   already seen that THE WHOLE OF IT COMES

   TO A MOST APPROPRIATE CONCLUSION OF PRAISE--"To whom be glory forever
   and ever. Amen." To glorify

   God is the objective of it all. We too much forget this. Praise is the
   flower for which the stalk of prayer exists. Praise to God is the
   essence of all the flowers of holiness, the motto of all the roses in
   the garden of the Church. God's Glory is the harvest for which all the
   plowing and sowing of ministry and evangelizing must be done. Glory to
   God in the highest and glory to His only begotten Son forever and
   ever--this is the pure gold for which we dig the mines of godly
   service.

   It would be a very difficult question to decide to whom the last clause
   alludes, whether to, "the God of Peace," or to, "Our Lord Jesus" and,
   therefore, I think the safer way is to take them both together, for
   they are one. "To whom," that is to God. "To whom," that is to the Lord
   Jesus, "be glory forever and ever. Amen." Let it be so. It ought to be
   so, it must be so, it shall be so. Amen. Amen! Tarry just a minute
   while we give glory unto the Three in One God. O you hearts

   that love Him, glorify Him, first, as the God of Peace who had thoughts
   of peace and designs of peace and executed a Covenant of Peace on your
   behalf!

   Glorify Him who is at peace with all His believing ones today. He lays
   His thunder by. He hangs His bow in the cloud as the token of His love.
   He puts aside His javelin and His buckler--He loves, He smiles, He
   speaks in tenderness. He is the God of Peace! Approach Him with holy
   delight! Adore Him! Glorify His name evermore! Then magnify Him, next,
   because He found for us a Shepherd. We were as sheep going astray and
   He sent His Son to shepherd us. He took from His own dear bosom His
   equal and eternal Son and sent Him here to gather us from the wilds and
   save us from the wolves. Glory be to You, You Shepherd of Israel, and
   to Your Father who sent You to this end!

   Glorify Him, next, for the Covenant. What mercy is this, that God
   should enter into Covenant with man! Adore Him for the blood of the
   Covenant, that He gave His Only-Begotten to die to make that Covenant
   sure! Adore Him that the purchased, blood-begotten possession might
   never be alienated from one of those for whom He laid down His glorious
   life! Glory be to Father, Son and Holy Spirit! Praise Him, praise Him,
   praise Him, you blood-bought sons of men! Lift up your hearts with
   gratitude and joy, and bless the Lord who brought back the dying
   Shepherd to live and reign for you!

   And then adore Him because the power which He exerted upon Christ He is
   now exerting upon you. You are not perfect, yet, but still, in your
   measure you are fitted for every good work. In many ways the Lord is
   qualifying you for service. In some of you He is working to do and in
   others to suffer the good pleasure of His will. Bless Him for every
   Grace received, for faith, however little. Bless Him for love, even
   though it burns not as you would desire. Bless Him for every conquered
   sin. Bless Him for every implanted Grace. Bless Him evermore! Bless Him
   that He deals with you through Jesus Christ. Through the Mediator all
   good has come to us and through the Mediator it will still come until
   that day when He shall deliver up the Throne to God, even the Father,
   and God shall be All in All!

   Meanwhile we will glorify the mediatorial Lord and extol the Father and
   the consoling Spirit. Even now we join with cherubim and seraphim and
   adore Him to whom all worship belongs.

Proclamation of Acceptance and Vengeance

   (No. 1369)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S DAY MORNING, AUGUST 12, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance
   of our God; to comfort all that mourn." Isaiah 61:2.

   We know that this Scripture speaks concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. We
   don't say this as if we relied upon our own opinion. We know it, for
   sure, from the Lord's own lips, for, reading this passage in the
   synagogue at Nazareth, He said, "This day is this Scripture fulfilled
   in your ears." It is Jesus of Nazareth whom the Lord has anointed to
   preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the
   blind! And our text tells us that He was, also, sent to make a
   proclamation which should usher in the year of acceptance and the day
   of vengeance. Notice well the expression, "to proclaim," because a
   proclamation is the message of a king--and where the word of a king is,
   there is power.

   The Lord Jesus Christ came into the world to announce the will of the
   King of kings. He says, "I am come in My Father's name," and again, "My
   doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me." Every word of the Gospel
   is backed by the authority of "the King eternal, immortal, invisible,"
   and He who rejects it is guilty of treason against Jehovah, God of All.
   The Gospel is not of the nature of a commonplace invitation or human
   exhortation which may be accepted or refused at will without involving
   guilt--it is a Divine proclamation, issued from the Throne of the
   Eternal--which none can reject without becoming, thereby, rebels
   against the Infinite Majesty.

   Now if this is so, let us give the Divine edict our most earnest
   attention and take heed what we hear! When a proclamation is issued by
   the head of a state, all good citizens gather around to read what has
   been said to them and to know what the supreme law may be. And so, when
   God proclaims His will, all right-hearted men desire to know what it is
   and what bearing it has upon them--what the Lord demands or what the
   Lord promises and what is their share therein. Beloved Hearers,
   listening to the Gospel should always be very solemn work since it is
   listening to the Word of God! Though the voice is that of man, yet the
   Truth he preaches is of God. I pray you do not trifle with it.

   Nor let it be forgotten that a proclamation must be treated with
   profound respect, not merely by receiving attention to its contents,
   but by giving obedience to its demands! God does not speak to us by His
   Son that we may be gratified by hearing the sound of His voice, but
   that we may yield to His will. We are not to be hearers only, but doers
   of the Word. We should be quick in obedience to the command of the
   proclamation, swift in acceptance of its promise and cheerful in
   submission to its demands! Who shall resist the proclamations of
   Jehovah? Is He not our Creator and King? Who is stubborn enough to
   refuse obedience? Or who has a bronze face enough to dispute His sway?

   Shall not He who made Heaven and earth, and shakes them when He
   pleases--and will destroy them at His pleasure--be regarded with
   reverential awe by the creatures of His hands? O Son of God, since it
   is a Divine proclamation which You do publish, send forth Your Holy
   Spirit that we may receive it with deepest reverence and lowly
   obedience, lest, through our neglect, we do despite to You as well as
   to Your Father! When a proclamation is not made by an ordinary herald,
   but when the Prince, Himself, comes forth to declare His Father's will,
   then should all hearts be moved to sevenfold attention! It is the Son
   of God, anointed by the Spirit of God, who acts as herald to us and so
   by each Person of the Divine Trinity we are called upon to bow a
   listening ear and an obedient heart to what the Lord proclaims.
   Attention, then! The Messenger of the Covenant makes proclamation!
   Attention for the King of kings!

   With this as a preface, let me notice that there are three points in
   the proclamation worthy of our attention. The first is the acceptable
   year. The next, the vengeance day. And the third, the comfort derived
   from both--"to comfort all that mourn."

   I. Jesus, in the first place, proclaims the acceptable year of the
   Lord. Take the expression to pieces and it comes to this--the year of
   the Lord and the year of acceptance. Now, what was the year of the
   Lord? There can be, I think, very

   little question that this relates to the Jubilee Year. Every 7th year
   was the Lord's year and it was to be a Sabbath of rest to the land. But
   the seventh 7th year, the 50th year, which the Lord reserved unto
   Himself, was in a very marked and special sense the Year of the Lord.

   Now, our Lord Jesus has come to proclaim a period of Jubilee to the
   true seed of Israel. The seed of Abraham, now, are not the seed
   according to the Law, but those who are born after the promise. There
   are privileges reserved for Israel after the flesh which they will yet
   receive in the day when they shall acknowledge Christ to be the
   Messiah. But every great blessing which was promised to Abraham's seed
   after the flesh is now virtually promised to Israel after the Spirit--
   to those who, by faith, are the children of believing Abraham.

   Now, Beloved, to all who believe, our Lord Jesus proclaims a year of
   Jubilee! Let us dwell upon the four privileges of the Jubilee and
   accept with delight the proclamation which our Lord has made! In the
   year of Jubilee, as we read in the 25th Chapter of Leviticus, there was
   a release of all persons who had sold themselves for servants. Pinched
   by great poverty and unable to meet their debts, it sometimes happened
   that men were compelled to say to their creditor, "Take us and our
   wives and children and accept our services instead of money. We have no
   goods or chattels and our land has been mortgaged long ago. But here we
   are--we cannot pay in any other way--give us food and raiment and
   lodging, and we will put ourselves under apprenticeship to you."

   The Law of Moses ordained that such persons were not to be treated
   harshly, nor regarded as slaves, but as hired servants. But still, it
   must have been an unpleasant condition of servitude for a freeborn
   Israelite. How happy, then, was the morning when the Jubilee trumpet
   sounded and the generous Law came into operation which said, "He shall
   serve you unto the Year of Jubilee, but then shall he depart from you,
   both he and his children with him." From that moment he owed no more
   service, however great his debt might have been. He looked upon his
   wife and children and rejoiced that they were all his own and all free
   from the yoke so that they could, at once, return to the possession of
   their fathers, all live in the cottage in which they formerly dwelt and
   enjoy the piece of land which they formerly called their own. Liberty,
   that gladsome sound! Liberty had come to them! No matter that they had
   long been under obligations to the creditor-- those obligations ceased
   on the sound of the sacred trumpet!

   Beloved Souls now present, proclamation is made to you in the Lord's
   name that if you are under bondage to sin and to sinful habits, there
   is liberty for you! Faith in Jesus will set you free! If you are in
   bondage under justice and the broken Law, there is deliverance. If you
   are under bondage through fear of death, or from the rage of Satan, our
   Divine Lord and Master has come into the world on purpose to break
   these bonds and to proclaim liberty to the captives! You need be bound
   no longer! If you believe in Jesus you are bound no longer and you are
   set free from all the bondage of the Law, from the slavery of Satan and
   from the dread of death! Take the liberty which the great Lord freely
   presents to you and be no longer slaves. Jesus has brought in
   redemption and finished atonement and Believers are free! Come and
   rejoice!

   The next Jubilee blessing was the redemption of alienated possessions.
   Every man had his own plot of ground in the Holy Land, but through the
   pressure of the times it sometimes happened that a man forfeited his
   property. He might be in need of ready money. His children might need
   bread to eat and he, therefore, parted with his land. It was gone--the
   vines and the fig trees, the corn and the oil passed over to
   another--but it was not gone forever. He had no power to sell beyond
   the year of Jubilee. When this joyful morning dawned, he went back to
   his family estate. It was all his, again, clear of all encumbrances.
   The little homestead, the farmyard, the fields and the garden all had
   come back to him and none could dispute his right to them.

   Just so my Lord and Master declares to all who believe in Him that the
   estate which Adam forfeited is restored to all for whom the Second Adam
   died! The alienated heritage is ours again. The great Father's love,
   favor and care, yes, all things--whether things present or things to
   come, or life or death--all are ours and we are Christ's and Christ is
   God's. If we are Believers and we are of the true seed of Israel, this
   day the Lord Jesus proclaims to us a restoration of all the lost
   privileges and blessings which originally belonged to manhood! Behold,
   Believers, all Covenant blessings are yours-- rejoice in them! Partake
   of heavenly blessings freely. Let your soul rejoice in its portion and
   delight itself in fatness.

   It followed, also, as a third blessing of the Year of the Lord that all
   debts were discharged. The man who had sold himself had, as it were,
   made a composition of his debts by the sale of himself, and this
   implied a full and final discharge at the Jubilee. The person, also,
   who had mortgaged his land up to the Jubilee Year had discharged his
   debts, thereby,

   and when the man received back himself and his property, no further
   liability rested upon him--he was cleared of all charges. The Jubilee
   did not give the man back himself and his land under a condition, but
   unconditionally. If debt had still been due, the release would have
   been a mere farce, since he would have had to mortgage his land and
   sell himself again, at once, to meet the demand. No, there was a full
   discharge, a canceling of all debts, a removal of all encumbrances upon
   the man and upon his estate--he was free.

   What a joy this must have been! He who is in debt is in danger. An
   honest man sleeps on a hard bed till he has paid what he owes. He who
   is immersed in debt is plunged in misery, driven to his wits' end, not
   knowing what to do. Happy is he that is delivered from debt once and
   for all. Now behold, O Believers in Jesus, your debts before the Lord
   are all discharged--the handwriting that was against you is nailed to
   the Cross--it is receipted in the crimson lines of Jesus' precious
   blood! Being justified by faith you are clear before the sight of the
   Eternal--no one can lay anything to your charge. What joyful notes are
   these! Jesus makes the proclamation--who will not believe it and be
   glad?

   A fourth blessing of the Jubilee trumpet was rest. They had their
   lands, but they were not to till them for a year. No more the spade and
   the plow, the sickle and the flail--they were to put away instruments
   of labor and rest for 12 months. Think of a whole year of perfect
   repose in which they might worship and adore God all the week, make
   every day a holy festival and the whole year a Sabbath of Sabbaths unto
   the Most High! Brothers and Sisters, the Israelites had no small
   privileges under the Ceremonial Covenant, if they had lived up to
   it--but they failed to do so. It has sometimes been questioned whether
   they ever kept a Jubilee at all and whether the Sabbatic year was ever
   once observed. If they had obeyed the Lord they would have been
   favored, indeed, for in the matter of holidays and quiet resting times
   they were favored above all people.

   Think of one year in seven of absolute cessation from toil. What repose
   for them! And then they had, also, the year after the 7th seven, so
   that every man who reached the 50th year enjoyed two consecutive years
   of absolute rest from all labor--and yet knew no need, for the promise
   was that the ground would bring forth plentifully and every man could
   help himself. Those who had land would have a good store to last them
   through three years and those who had none would be fed by the
   spontaneous produce of the soil. We live not under such laws, but if we
   did I am afraid we would not have the faith to trust in the Lord and
   avail ourselves of the divinely appointed holiday.

   But, Beloved, we rest spiritually. He that believes in the Lord Jesus
   Christ has entered into rest. Now no more does he strive to work out a
   righteousness of his own, for he already has a Divine one and needs no
   other. It is his pleasure to worship God, but he no longer trembles
   beneath His wrath. It is his delight to obey His commandments, but he
   toils and frets no longer as a slave under the Law--he has become a
   free man and a beloved child--and the peace of God which passes all
   understanding keeps his heart and mind. Being justified by faith he has
   peace with God and enjoys his influences of the Divine Comforter whose
   indwelling gives rest to the soul.

   The Jubilee Year, according to our text, was called, "the Year of the
   Lord," and the reason for all the four jubilee blessings was found in
   the Lord. First, the servants were set free because God said, "they are
   My servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt" (Lev.
   25:42). Ah, poor burdened Soul, if you believe in Christ, you shall go
   free, for you are the Lord's own--His chosen, His redeemed and,
   therefore, He claims you and will suffer no other lord to have dominion
   over you! The devil seeks to lay an embargo upon you and hold you a
   slave, but Jesus says, "Let go of My captives, for I have redeemed them
   with My blood." Jesus claims you, O penitent Souls! He cries to sin as
   once the Lord said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the Lord, let My people go."

   Jesus says of each repenting soul, "Loose him and let him go, for he is
   Mine. My Father gave him to Me. He is My chosen, my beloved. Neither
   sin nor Satan, nor death nor Hell shall hold him, for he is Mine." The
   land, also, was set free for this same reason, for concerning it the
   Lord said, "The land is Mine" (Lev. 25:23). The freehold of the land
   was vested in Jehovah, Himself, consequently He ordained that no man
   should hold any portion of it by right of purchase beyond the 50th
   year, for the land was entailed and must go back to those for whom He
   had appointed it at the Jubilee Year. So the blessings of the
   Everlasting Covenant are God's and, therefore, He appoints them unto
   you poor believing sinners and you shall have them, for the Divine
   decree shall not be frustrated.

   As surely as He appointed Christ to reign and placed Him on the Throne,
   so does He appoint you to reign with Him! And you shall sit upon His
   Throne though all the devils in Hell should say you may not! So, too,
   the debts were all discharged, because on the day before the Jubilee,
   the great atonement had swept away all transgression and indebtedness

   towards God and He would have His people forgive all the debts of their
   fellow men. All things are the Lord's and He exercised His crown rights
   on the day of Jubilee so far as to declare all debts discharged. "The
   earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof," was the motto of the
   Jubilee and sufficient reason for the canceling of obligations between
   man and man.

   As for rest, that came also, because it was God's year and was hallowed
   unto the Lord. "A Jubilee shall the 50th year be unto you: you shall
   not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself in it, nor gather the
   grapes in it of your vine undressed. For it is the Jubilee; it shall be
   holy unto you: you shall eat the increase thereof out of the field."
   During man's years the earth brings forth thorns and thistles and man
   must earn his bread with the sweat of his face. But when God's year
   comes, then the wilderness and the solitary places are glad and the
   desert rejoices and blossoms as the rose! When the Lord's own Kingdom
   comes, then shall the earth yield her increase as she has never done
   before! My Beloved, I trust you know the blessedness of living in God's
   year, for you live by faith upon His Providence, casting all your care
   upon Him, for He cares for you. This is the Sabbath of the soul, the
   counterpart of Heaven!

   You behold the work of Atonement fully accomplished on your behalf and
   know yourselves to be delivered from all your liabilities to the Law
   and, therefore, your heart leaps within you. You are clean, delivered,
   set free, washed in the blood of the Lamb and, therefore, you come to
   Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon your heads! But the text
   speaks, also, of the "acceptable year of the Lord." Now, our Lord Jesus
   Christ has come to proclaim to sinners the Lord's acceptance of guilty
   men through His great Sacrifice. Apart from the work of our Lord Jesus,
   men as sinners are unacceptable to God. Some of you know the misery of
   being in that condition--it is horrible to feel that the Lord is weary
   of you and your vain oblations.

   Since you have come in your own name and righteousness, God has not
   accepted you. Neither has He heard your prayers nor listened to your
   cries, nor had respect unto your religious observances, for He says,
   "Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear." If the Spirit of
   God has convinced you of your natural unacceptableness with God, you
   must have been brought into a very sad state, indeed. Not to be
   accepted of God--and to be aware of it--is cause for intense sorrow!
   But now be sure, you that believe in Jesus, that you are accepted of
   God--notwithstanding your infirmities and sins you are, "accepted in
   the Beloved," by Him who has said, "I will accept you with your sweet
   savor."

   And now, being thus accepted as to your persons, your petitions shall
   come up with acceptance before the Lord. As for your prayers, God hears
   them! As for your tears, He puts them into His bottle. As for your
   works, He counts them to be fruits of His Spirit and accepts them. Yes,
   now that you are accepted in Christ, all that you are and all that you
   have and all you do--the whole of you--is acceptable to God through
   Jesus Christ our Lord. Thrice happy am I to have to talk upon such a
   subject as this! Come, you who are willing, now, to believe in
   Jesus--THIS is the acceptable year of the Lord! God is reconciled! Man
   is favored! Blessings abound! Now is the accepted time! Now is the day
   of salvation! Let sin be confessed and the confession shall be accepted
   and you shall find forgiveness! Let transgression be repented of, the
   repentance shall be accepted and you shall hear a voice saying, "Go and
   sin no more. Your sins, which are many, are forgiven you."

   Hail, you that are graciously accepted, blessed are you among women!
   And you too, my Brothers and Sisters, remember the words of Solomon,
   "Go your way, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry
   heart; for God now accepts your works" (Ecc. 9:7). Come to Jesus by
   faith, and though you come with a limping walk and with sorrowing
   spirits, come, you that are downcast and dare not look up! This is no
   common time, the Lord Jesus has made it a red letter year for you! He
   proclaims a year of Grace and acceptance! Behold in this anno Domini,
   or year of our Lord, we have a choice year of Grace set apart for us!
   Who will not come to our gracious Prince, accept His mercy and live?
   Thus you see we get a double meaning from the text--the Year of Jubilee
   with all its accumulated privileges of Free Grace, and the year of
   acceptance in which whoever will, may come, and God will accept him if
   he comes in the name of Jesus, trusting alone in the atoning blood!

   II. May the Lord help us while we speak upon the second part of the
   text--the "DAY OF VENGEANCE OF OUR GOD." Does not the sound of
   vengeance grate upon your ears? Does it not seem discordant to the
   sweet tenor of the passage? Vengeance! Shall that happen side by side
   with acceptance? Yes, Beloved, this is the mystery of the Gospel--the
   system of Redemption marries Justice and Mercy--the method of
   Suretyship unites Severity and Grace. The economy of

   Substitution blends Acceptance and Vengeance. This Gospel mystery is to
   be published to every creature under Heaven, for it is the power of God
   unto salvation to everyone that believes. We sweetly sang just now--

   "Here I behold His innermost heart, Where Grace and Vengeance strangely
   join, Piercing His Son with sharpest smart, To make the purchased
   pleasure mine."

   Now behold in this text you have the heart of God laid bare, for you
   have the year of acceptance coupled with the day of vengeance. Let us
   explain this strange commingling and, at the same time, expound the
   text. In the first place, whenever there is a day of mercy to those who
   believe, it is always a day of responsibility to those who reject
   it--and if they continue in that state it is a day of increased wrath
   to unbelievers. It is not possible for the Gospel to be without some
   effect. If it is a savor of life unto life to those who receive it, it
   must of necessity, from its own intrinsic vigor, be a savor of death
   unto death to those who reject it.

   To this sword there are two edges--one will kill our fears and the
   other will surely kill our pride and destroy our vain hopes if we yield
   not to Christ. You may, perhaps, have noticed that when our Lord read
   this passage at Nazareth, He stopped short, He did not read it all. He
   read as far down as, "to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord," and
   then He closed the Book and gave it to the minister and sat down. I
   suppose that at the commencement of His ministry, before He had been
   rejected by the nation and before He had suffered for sin, He wisely
   chose to allude to the gentler topics rather than to those more stern
   and terrible ones. But He did not conclude His ministry without
   referring to the stern words which followed those which He had read.

   If you will turn to Luke's 21st Chapter you will find Him saying in the
   21st and 22nd verses, "Then let them which are in Judea flee to the
   mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart. And let
   not them that are in the countries enter there. For these are the days
   of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled." You
   know the story of the siege of Jerusalem, the most harrowing of all
   narratives, for the anger of God was concentrated upon that wicked city
   beyond all precedent! It was because they rejected Christ that
   vengeance came upon them. They filled up the measure of their iniquity
   when, at last, they disowned their King and cried out, "Away with Him,
   away with Him, let Him be crucified!"

   Mark then, dear Hearer, that if you have heard the Gospel and rejected
   it, you have incurred great guilt and you can never sin so cheaply as
   you did before! There will be a day of vengeance for you more terrible
   than that for the men of Sodom and Gomorrah because you have
   perpetrated a crime which they were not capable of committing--you have
   rejected the Christ of God! The year of acceptance to Believers will be
   a day of vengeance to those who obey not His Gospel! Another meaning of
   the text comes out in the fact that there is appointed a day of
   vengeance for all the enemies of Christ and this will happen in that
   bright future day for which we are looking. Not merely for rejecters of
   His Gospel will there be vengeance, but for all men and fallen spirits
   who dare to oppose His sway!

   Behold He comes a second time! Every winged hour hastens His advent and
   when He comes it will be a great and a dreadful day for His foes. It
   will be for His saints the day of their revelation, manifestation and
   acceptance--but to the ungodly, "the day of vengeance of our God."
   "Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, "Behold,
   the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints to execute judgment
   upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their
   ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard
   speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him."

   Paul, also, bears witness the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven
   with His mighty angels, "In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that
   know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
   who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the Presence of
   the Lord, and from the Glory of His power; when He shall come to be
   glorified in His saints, and to be admired in all them that believe."

   Note the vengeance and the Grace combined. The Prophet Isaiah saw our
   great Champion returning from His last fight and thus spoke concerning
   Him--"Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?
   This that is glorious in His apparel, traveling in the greatness of His
   strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Therefore are
   You red in Your apparel, and Your garments like Him that treads in the
   wine vat. I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there
   was none with Me: for I will tread them in My anger, and trample them
   in My

   fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon My garments, and I will
   stain all My raiment. For the day of vengeance is in My heart, and the
   year of My redeemed is come."

   Observe, again, the connection between the day of vengeance and the
   year of the redeemed. At the Second Advent Christ will come to be
   glorified in His saints and they shall be manifested in the fullness of
   their acceptance. But it will be an overwhelming day of vengeance for
   all those who have hardened their hearts and continued in their sins.
   "Behold, the day comes that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud,
   yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes
   shall burn them up, says the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them
   neither root nor branch."

   However, I consider that the chief meaning of the text lies in
   this--that, "the day of vengeance of our God," was that day when He
   made all the transgressions of His people to meet upon the head of our
   great Surety. Sin with many streams had been flowing down the hills of
   time and forming, by their dread accumulation, one vast and fathomless
   lake. Into this the sinner's Substitute must be plunged. He had a
   Baptism to be baptized with and He must endure it, or all His chosen
   must perish forever! That was a day of vengeance when all the waves and
   billows of Divine wrath went over His innocent head--

   "Came at length the dreadful night; Vengeance with its iron rod Stood,
   and with collected might Bruised the harmless Lamb of God. See, my
   Soul, Your Savior see, Prostrate in Gethsemane!"

   From His blessed Person there distilled a bloody sweat, for His soul
   was exceedingly sorrowful even unto death. All through the night He was
   scourged, buffeted and spit upon by cruel men! He was tortured and
   abused! He was rejected, despised, maltreated and pierced in His inmost
   soul by man's scorn and cruelty. Then in the morning He was taken out
   to be crucified, for nothing could suffice short of His death. The
   outward sorrows of crucifixion you know, but the inward griefs you do
   not know--for what our Lord endured was beyond what any mortal man
   could have borne! The infinity of the Godhead aided the manhood, but I
   doubt not Hart was right in saying that He--

   "Bore all Incarnate God could bear With strength enough but none to
   spare." It was an awful "day of vengeance of our God," for the voice
   cried aloud, "Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, against the Man that
   is My fellow, says the Lord of Hosts."

   The doctrine that justice was executed upon our great Substitute is the
   most important that was ever propounded in the hearing of men! It is
   the sum and substance of the whole Gospel and I fear that the Church
   which rejects it is no longer a Church of Christ. Substitution is as
   much a standing or falling article in the Church as the doctrine of
   Justification by Faith, itself. My Brothers and Sisters, there would
   never have been an acceptable year if there had not been a day of
   vengeance! You can be sure of this!

   And now let us look at the instructive type by which this Truth of God
   was taught to Israel of old. The Year of Jubilee began with the Day of
   Atonement. "Then shall you cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on
   the 10th day of the 7th month, in the Day of Atonement shall you make
   the trumpet sound throughout all your land." What did the High Priest
   do on that day? Read for yourselves the 16th Chapter of Leviticus. On
   that day he washed himself and came forth before the people, not
   wearing his breast-plate, nor his garments of glory and beauty, of blue
   and scarlet and fine linen, but he wore the ordinary linen garments of
   a common priest. Even thus the Lord, who counted it not robbery to be
   equal with God, laid aside all His Glory and was found in fashion as a
   man!

   Then the priest took a bullock and, having offered it, went within the
   veil with the censer full of burning coals of fire, and sweet incense
   beaten small, with which he filled the inner court with perfumed smoke.
   After this he took the blood of the bullock and sprinkled it before the
   Mercy Seat seven times. Thus our Lord entered within the veil with His
   own blood and with the sweet incense of His own merits to make
   Atonement for us! Of two goats, one was killed as a sin offering and
   his blood was sprinkled within the veil. The other was used for a
   scapegoat. Upon the head of the scapegoat Aaron laid both his hands and
   confessed all the iniquities of the children of Israel, "putting them
   upon the head of the goat," which was then taken into the wilderness as
   the type of the carrying away of sin into oblivion.

   Do you not see your Lord and Master bearing your sins away? "As far as
   the east is from the west, so far it is He removed our transgressions
   from us." Is there any wonder that a Jubilee of peace should follow
   such a taking away of iniquity as our Great High Priest has
   accomplished? Jesus is entered into the heavens for us--can we doubt
   our acceptance with God? The bodies of the beasts whose blood was
   brought into the sanctuary for sin on the Day of Atonement were not
   suffered to remain in the Holy Place, but were carried forth outside
   the camp to be utterly consumed with fire, in token that sin is
   loathsome in the sight of God and must be put away from His Presence.
   Even thus did our Lord suffer outside the gate and cry, "My God, My
   God, why have You forsaken Me?" "Christ, also, has once suffered for
   sins, the Just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God."

   All this was absolutely necessary to a Jubilee. Without Atonement, no
   rejoicing! Before there can be acceptance for a single sinner, sin must
   be laid on Jesus and carried away. The blood of Jesus must be shed and
   must be presented within the veil, for "without shedding of blood there
   is no remission of sin." There can be no pardon or acceptance for any
   man living under Heaven in any way but by the bloody sacrifice which
   our Redeemer offered when He bowed His head and gave up the ghost on
   Calvary. This great Truth of God we must never becloud, nor ever cease
   to publish so long as we have a tongue to move. The day of vengeance,
   then, is intimately connected with the year of acceptance.

   And mark, Beloved, they must be so connected experimentally in the
   heart of all God's people by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, for
   whenever Christ comes to make us live, the Law comes, first, to kill
   us. There is no healing without previous wounding. Depend upon it,
   there never will be a sense of acceptance in any man until he has first
   had a sense of the just and righteous vengeance of God against his
   sins. Have you noticed that remarkable parallel to our text in the 35th
   Chapter of Isaiah where salvation and vengeance are so closely joined?
   There we read in the 3rd verse and onward--

   "Strengthen you the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to
   them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God
   will come with vengeance, even God with a recompense; He will come and
   save you. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of
   the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart,
   and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters
   break out, and streams in the desert." O poor trembling convicted
   Sinner, God has come with vengeance to you, but His intent is to save
   you! Every soul that is saved must feel that wrath is deserved and that
   the death penalty is due on account of sin. When this is known and
   felt, acceptance by faith will follow.

   There must be a death blow struck at all self-sufficiency and
   self-righteousness--and the man must be laid as dead at the feet of
   Christ before he will look up and find life and healing in the great
   atoning Sacrifice! When our Lord puts on the helmet of salvation, He
   also girds about Him the garments of vengeance--and we must see Him in
   all His array. (See Isaiah 59:17). The day of vengeance is a necessary
   companion to the year of acceptance--have they gone together in your
   experience?

   III. I wish Time would occasionally stay his rapid flight, or at least
   allow us to pluck a feather from his wing while we contemplate such a
   subject as this! But I must close with the third head, namely the
   comfort for mourners derivable from both these things. "To comfort all
   that mourn." Now, I have no hope of interesting, much less of doing any
   good, to any in this House of Prayer who do not come under the
   description of mourners. The sower's duty is to sow the seed
   everywhere, but he knows within himself that it will take no root
   anywhere except where the plow has been first at work. If the Lord has
   made you a mourner, then the blessed subject of this morning will
   comfort you!

   But the Lord never comforts those who do not need comfort. If you can
   save yourself, go and do it! If you are righteous, "He that is
   righteous let him be righteous still." I say it in sarcasm, as you
   perceive, for you cannot save yourself, nor are you righteous! But if
   you think so, go your way and try it--vainly try it, for surely when
   you have fanned your best works into a flame and have walked by the
   light of the sparks of the fire which you have kindled, you shall have
   this at the Lord's hands--you shall lie down in sorrow and be
   astonished that you were ever so mad as to dream of self-salvation or
   of justification by your own works!

   But oh, you mourners, what joy is here! Joy because this is the year of
   acceptance and in the year of acceptance, or Jubilee, men were set free
   and their lands were restored without money! No man ever paid a penny
   of redemption money on the Jubilee morning--every man was free simply
   because Jubilee was proclaimed. No merit was demanded, no demur was
   offered, no delay allowed, no dispute permitted. Jubilee came and the
   bondman was free! And now, today, whoever believes in Jesus is saved,
   pardoned, freed--without money, without merit, without
   preparation--simply because he

   believes and God declares that he that believes is justified from all
   things from which he could not be justified by the Law of Moses.

   Do you believe? Then you are of the house of Israel and you have God's
   guarantee for it--you are free! Rejoice in your liberty! Surely this is
   sweet comfort for all that mourn! Look not for any marks and evidences,
   signs and tokens. Look not for any merits or attainments. Look not for
   any progress in Grace or advancement in piety as a ground of
   salvation--listen only to the proclamation of the Gospel--and accept
   the Divine decree which ordains a Jubilee. If you are of the chosen
   seed, you believe in Jesus and then for you it is an accepted year.
   Come, bring here your griefs and sorrows and leave them at the Cross,
   for the Lord accepts you and who shall tell you no?

   An equal note of joy, however, rings out from the other sentence
   concerning the day of vengeance. If the day of vengeance took place
   when our Lord died, then it is over! The day of vengeance was past and
   gone 1,800 years ago and more--

   "Nowno more His wrath we dread, Vengeance smote our Surety's head.
   Legal claims are fully met, Jesus paid the dreadful debt. "

   My Heart, do you bleed for sin and mourn because of it? Be it so. But
   it has ceased to be, for Christ made an end of it when He took it up to
   His Cross and bore it there in His own body on the tree! O Believer,
   are you bowed down and troubled on account of past sin? It is right you
   should repent, but remember, your past sins exist no more! The pen is
   drawn through them and they are canceled, for the day of vengeance is
   over! God will not, twice, take vengeance for the same sins.

   Either the Atonement which Jesus offered was enough, or it was not. If
   it was not, then woe be to us, for we shall die! But if it were
   sufficient--if, "It is finished," was not a lie but a Truth of
   God--then He has "finished transgression and made an end of sin." The
   sin of the Believer is annihilated and abolished and can never be laid
   to his charge. Let us rejoice that the day of vengeance is over and the
   year of acceptance has begun! In another sense, however, it may be that
   some are mourning because of the temptations of Satan. Here, too, they
   may be comforted, for Jesus has come to take vengeance on the Evil One.
   The God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. Are you
   afraid of dying? Behold, Christ has taken revenge on Death, for He bids
   you cry, because of His resurrection, "O Death, where is your sting? O
   Grave, where is your victory?"

   Are we mourning, today, because our dear ones are not converted? It is
   a good thing to mourn on that account, but let us take comfort, for
   this is an acceptable year! Let us pray for them and the Lord will save
   them. Are we mourning because sin is rampant in the world? Let us
   rejoice, for our Lord has broken the dragon's head and the day of
   vengeance must come when the Lord will overthrow the powers of
   darkness. Have we been looking with mournful spirit upon old Rome, the
   Muslim imposters and the power of Buddhism and Brahmanism and other
   ancient idolatries? Let us be glad! Behold the Avenger comes! He comes
   a second time and comes conquering and to conquer! Then shall the day
   of His vengeance be in His heart and the year of His redeemed shall
   come.

   From the seven hills, the deceiver shall be torn, no more to curse the
   sons of men with his pretensions to be the vicar of God! In blackest
   night shall set forever the crescent of Mohammed which already
   wanes--its baleful light shall no more afflict unhappy nations. Then
   shall fall the gods of the Hindus and the Chinese, broken like potters'
   vessels by the rod of iron which Jesus wields! At His appearing the
   whole earth shall acknowledge that He, who was "despised and rejected
   of men," is "King of kings and Lord of lords." Behold, the day comes
   quickly, let all that mourn be comforted! The day of vengeance, the
   full year of the millennial glory, the day of the overthrow of error,
   the year of the acceptance of creation in all her former beauty--the
   age when God shall be All in All--is near at hand! Come quickly, O
   Lord! Amen.

Sheep Among Wolves

   (No. 1370)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 19, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be you
   therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves." Matthew 10:16.

   WELL may the text begin with a, "Behold," for it contains some special
   wonders such as can be seen nowhere else. First, here is a tender and
   loving Shepherd sending His sheep into the most dangerous position--"I
   send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves." It is the part of a
   shepherd to protect his sheep from the wolves, not to send them into
   the very midst of those ravenous beasts! And yet, here is the Good
   Shepherd, "that Great Shepherd of the sheep," actually undertaking and
   carrying out this extraordinary experiment of conducting His sheep into
   the very midst of wolves. How strange it seems to poor carnal sense. Be
   astonished, but be not unbelieving--stand still awhile and study the
   reason.

   The next remarkable thing is, "sheep in the midst of wolves," because
   according to the order of Nature, such a thing is never seen, but, on
   the other hand, it has been reckoned a great calamity that in some
   lands wolves are too often seen in the midst of sheep! The wolf leaps
   into the midst of a flock and rips and tears on every side--it matters
   not how many the sheep may be--for one wolf is more than a match for a
   thousand sheep. But lo, here you see sheep sent forth among the wolves,
   as if they were the attacking party and were bent upon putting down
   their terrible enemies! It is a novel sight, such as Nature can never
   show, but Grace is fall of marvels!

   Equally extraordinary is the singular mixture, never yet seen by human
   eyes among beasts and birds--a mixture of the serpent with the dove in
   one person! What a strange blending! Creatures which are capable of
   cross-breeding must have some sort of kinship. But here is a reptile of
   the dust united with a bird of the air--"Be you therefore wise as
   serpents, and harmless as doves." Grace knows how to pick the good out
   of the evil, the jewel out of the oyster shell, the diamond from the
   dunghill, the wisdom from the serpent--and by a Divine chemistry it
   leaves the good which it takes out of the foul place as good as though
   it had never been there.

   Grace knows how to blend the most gentle with the most subtle, to take
   away from prudence the base element which makes it into cunning and, by
   mingling innocence with it, produce a sacred prudence most valuable for
   all walks of life. With these three wonders outside the text, lying, as
   it were, upon the very surface, we shall enter into a fuller
   consideration of it with great expectations. But if we do so, we shall
   be disappointed if we expect to learn anything very extraordinary
   unless we are prepared to practice what we learn! I may truly say of
   this text, he that does its bidding shall understand its doctrine. He
   who follows its precept shall best know its meaning. May the Spirit of
   all Grace work in us according to His Divine power and perfect in us
   the will of the Lord.

   Though primarily addressed to the Apostles, it seems to me that our
   text relates, in its measure, to all who have any talent or ability for
   spreading the Gospel and, indeed, to all the saints so far as they are
   true to their calling as the children of God. They are, all of them,
   more or less as sheep in the midst of wolves, and to them all is the
   advice given, "Be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as
   doves." Let us hear for ourselves as though the Lord Jesus spoke
   individually to each of us.

   We may see in the text four things concerning the people of God. First,
   their prominent vocation--"Behold, I send you forth." Secondly, their
   imminent peril--"as sheep in the midst of wolves." Thirdly, their
   eminent authority-- "Behold, I send you forth." And, lastly, their
   permanent instructions--"Be you wise as serpents, and harmless as
   doves."

   I. First, let us consider THEIR PROMINENT VOCATION. They had other
   callings, for some of them were fishermen, but their great calling was
   this--"Behold, I send you forth." The call of the Lord overrides all
   other vocations. Every child of God, according to the capacity of Grace
   which God has given him, should hear this voice of the Lord calling him
   and sending him forth to labor--"Behold, I send you forth." These
   disciples had been with Him and

   had been taught by Him that they might teach in His name. They had for
   some little time been His disciples or learners and now He calls them
   apart from the rest, and says, "I send you forth to teach and to make
   disciples."

   The mode of operation in the Kingdom of God is, first make disciples,
   baptize them, teach them whatever the Lord has commanded and then let
   them go forth and do the same with others. When one light is kindled,
   other candles are lit from it. Drops of heavenly water are flashed
   aloft and scattered all around like dew upon the face of the earth and,
   behold, each one begets a fountain where it falls and thus the desert
   is made to rejoice and blossom as the rose! Do not try to teach till
   the Lord Jesus has first taught you! Do not pretend to instruct till
   you have been instructed! Sit at Christ's feet before you speak in
   Christ's name--but when once you are instructed, do not fail to become
   teachers.

   The lessons of your Lord will be impressed upon your minds the more
   forcibly and indelibly when you have earnestly communicated them to
   your fellow men. First be taught, but afterwards fail not to teach!
   Hoard not up the treasure of Divine knowledge, for there is no shortage
   there--eat not, alone, the honey of redeeming love, for there is enough
   and to spare. Feed not upon the Bread of Heaven with selfish greed, as
   though there were a famine in the land and you had need to save each
   crumb for yourself--but break your bread among the hungry crowd about
   you and it shall multiply in your hands. Christ has called you that you
   may afterwards go forth and call others to His sacred feast of Grace.

   Our Lord called them not only to teach those that came in their path,
   but to go after the lost sheep. "Behold," He said, "I send you forth."
   Some persons will hardly teach those who come immediately to their
   doors. Living under your own roof, with some of you, there are
   neglected souls! Even in some professedly Christian families there are
   sons and daughters who are not being trained for holiness nor taught in
   the way of everlasting life. This is sad to the last degree! Friend, do
   you fail there? Let conscience be awake to judge! Your Master supposes
   that you have fulfilled home duties and then He calls you forth to
   attempt something further.

   "Go your ways," He says, "for I send you forth." You have been sitting
   and hearing the Gospel--leave your seats at times and go forth to bring
   others to the faith! You have the power of the Word upon your hearts,
   now go and show its power upon your lips by speaking to others, however
   few or many. Go out, yourselves, as sowers and scatter the seed your
   Lord has given you for that end. Go where Providence guides you--to the
   Sunday school class to teach, to the street corner to preach, to the
   remote village or hamlet to bear witness for Christ, or to the densely
   crowded city slums to lift up the banner of Christ--but go your way
   somewhere!

   Sit not down in idleness and fold your arms in indifference to the
   world's woes. Behold, your compassionate Lord sends you, therefore go
   gladly anywhere, everywhere--where His wisdom appoints the way--where
   your business gives you opportunity, or your traveling gives you
   occasion. "I send you forth," He says. He sent them forth, we are told,
   to work miracles as well as to preach. Now, He has not given us this
   power, neither do we desire it--it is more to God's Glory that the
   world should be conquered by the force of the Truth of God than by the
   blaze of miracles! The miracles were the great bell of the universe
   which was rung in order to call the attention of all men all over the
   world to the fact that the Gospel feast was spread. We do not need the
   bell, now, for the thousands who have feasted to the full are the best
   announcers of the banquet!

   Those of us who have fed upon Christ and His salvation will make the
   matter known wherever we go. No further announcement by miracle will be
   required, save only the standing miracle of the indwelling Spirit. We
   now have the great advantages of rapid traveling and of the printing
   press so that we need not the gift of tongues, since men can so much
   more readily learn a foreign language than they could before, and so
   much more quickly travel to the spot. The moral and spiritual forces of
   Truth to work by themselves, apart from any physical manifestation, is
   more to the Glory of the Truth of God and the Christ of the Truth than
   if we were all miracle workers and could destroy gainsayers!

   But still, though we work no miracles in the physical world, we work
   them in the moral and spiritual world, yes, and the same miracles, too,
   for, behold, He has sent us forth to heal the sick as the Evangelist
   has it in the 8th verse of the chapter before us. Those who are
   depressed in spirit, faint and feeble, broken-hearted and desponding,
   bruised and mangled by the assaults of the great enemy--we are to go
   forth and pour in the oil and wine of the Gospel, apply the heavenly
   plaster of the promise and bind up with the sacred liniment of
   consoling doctrine--and bring before sin-sick sinners everywhere the
   matchless medicine of the precious blood of Christ! For every spiritual
   disease the Gospel is the sure remedy and we are to carry it to every
   land.

   "Heal the sick." This, also, we do. Such sicknesses as laugh at the
   physician and cannot be touched by mortal skill are healed by the
   servants of Him who came, Himself, to bear human sicknesses that He
   might bear them away. Go forth, you servants of God, with a better balm
   than that of Gilead! Sit not still in idleness while bleeding hearts
   and sickening souls are all around you! Men are perishing--go forth to
   heal them! You are, also, to "cleanse the lepers." There is a leprosy
   abroad in the world which takes different shapes in different ages, but
   is the same, both in its cause and effect. In our land we see on all
   hands the foul leprosy of drunkenness, that brutish disease which
   degrades and destroys men's souls. There is the leprosy of superstition
   which casts into the understanding and makes a man a fool! And, alas,
   there is the white leprosy of skepticism which, like an inward fire,
   consumes the very heart.

   Sin is this leprosy and our business is, as God shall help us by the
   preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to make these lepers clean! It
   is to be done. It is done by us now in our Lord's name. He that works
   in us mightily will cause the Word to be mighty to this end, also, that
   the leprosy may depart from men and that they may come into the
   congregation of the Lord. He bids us, also, raise the dead, which seems
   the sternest work of all. But as the others are impossible to us apart
   from Him, this is not more difficult than the rest. We are to "raise
   the dead." Our Gospel begins with men where they are by nature and does
   not wait till they come part of the way. We go forth to preach to those
   who are careless and insensible, to those who have no feeling whatever
   and are furtherest gone from any tenderness of heart with regard to
   their own sin or the love of God.

   Go with the Gospel to the sepulcher of vice and preach to the dead in
   sin! The Gospel has a quickening power, Beloved, and Jesus, who is the
   Resurrection and the Life, sends you forth that by His Word in your
   mouths, dead souls may be raised! None are too dull to be awakened, too
   hardened to be renewed. And then He adds, "Cast out devils." This
   commission He gave to His Apostles and, in a spiritual sense, to us,
   too. The devil and his legions reign over the hearts of men, subjecting
   them to sin and unbelief. Behold, they claim this world as their
   dominion, but it is not so! They are usurpers, for the earth is the
   Lord's and the fullness thereof! Go with the Truth of God and cast out
   the demon of error--go with the glad tidings of joy and cast out the
   demon of despair! Go with the message of peace and cast out the demon
   of war! Go with the Word of holiness and cast out the demons of
   iniquity! Go with the Gospel of liberty and cast out the demons of
   tyranny. These blessed deeds can be done and shall be done, God being
   with you, and to this end He bids you go in His name, for He will gird
   you with His strength.

   Now, when I say that every Christian, according to his ability, is
   called to do this, I mean precisely what I say. I mean that Christian
   men nowadays, while they should be attached to the Church to which they
   belong--and the more intense that attachment the better for a thousand
   reasons--yet they should not regard the Church as being a peaceful
   dormitory where they are all to sleep, but a common barracks where they
   are all to be trained and out of which they are to issue and carry on
   the sacred crusade for Christ! We are not to be frozen together with
   the compactness of a mass of ice, through mere agreement of creed, but
   welded together like bars of iron by the fire of a common purpose and a
   common zeal.

   If we are what we should be, we shall be continually breaking forth on
   the right hand and on the left--each man, each woman, according to the
   calling that God has given to us--we shall be seeking to extend the
   Redeemer's Kingdom in all directions. My dear Brothers and Sisters, you
   are arrows in the quiver--how gladly would I see you shot forth upon
   the enemy from the bow of the Lord! Many of you are as battleaxes and
   weapons of war hanging on the wall. O that you may be taken down and
   used of the Lord in His glorious fight! Lo, on the walls of Zion hang a
   thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men! But the great need of the
   age is that these weapons be removed from their resting and rusting and
   carried into the thick of the fray!

   May the Lord send you forth, O you who have been saved under my
   ministry! May He hurl you forth with Divine power, like a mighty hail
   against His adversaries. May each man among you be eager to contend
   earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints and to save souls
   from going down into the Pit. Here, then, is your permanent
   vocation--try to realize it.

   II. Secondly, we shall consider THEIR IMMINENT PERIL. "I send you forth
   as sheep in the midst of wolves." That is to say, the task is one of
   great danger and difficulty. Our Divine enterprise is no child's play.
   The work has its charms--it looks very pretty upon paper and sounds
   well when eloquently described. At missionary meetings and revival
   services it stirs your blood to hear of what is to be done and you
   resolve to rush upon it at once! But while we would not dampen the
   ardor of one eager aspirant, we would have him count the cost and know
   what the warfare is. Enlist, by all

   means, but stop a bit and know what you are doing, lest you quit the
   field as hurriedly as you entered it--and bring disgrace both on
   yourselves and the cause.

   Old soldiers who know the smell of gunpowder talk not so lightly of a
   battle as the raw recruits may do. They remember the blood and fire and
   vapor of smoke and, though they are not timid, they are very serious.
   Come, you who have never thought about it, and look upon that which
   will dishearten every man who is a coward and test the brave as to
   whether their courage is that of Nature or of Grace. You are to go
   forth as sheep among wolves, that is to say, you have to go among those
   who will not in any way sympathize with your efforts.

   Sometimes we go among amiable, quiet, almost-persuaded people, and it
   is somewhat pleasant work, though even there it is very discouraging,
   for those who are not far from the kingdom are often the hardest to be
   won. People on the border are a difficult sort of people to deal with
   and for real success one may as well go among the decidedly ungodly at
   once. If you discharge your souls and behave zealously before God, you
   will have to deal with people who cannot enter into your feelings or
   agree with your aims. The bleating sheep finds no harmony in the bark
   or howl of the wolf! The two are very different animals and by no means
   agree. You do not suppose that you are going to be received with open
   arms by everybody, do you?

   And if you become a preacher of the Gospel you do not imagine that you
   are going to please people, do you? The time may come when, perhaps,
   the wolves will find it best, for their own comfort, not to howl quite
   so loudly, but my own experience goes to show that they howl pretty
   loudly when you first come among them--and they keep up the hideous
   concert year after year until, at last, they somewhat weary of their
   useless noise. The world raves as a wolf if any man is in double
   earnest for the Kingdom of Christ. Well, you must bear with it. What
   sort of sympathy can a lamb expect from wolves? If he expected any,
   would he be not disappointed? Be not disappointed, for you know your
   surroundings and you know your mission!

   When our Savior used similar words to the 70, He did not call them
   sheep, but lambs, (see Luke 10:3), for they were not so far advanced as
   the 12, yet He sent them into the same trying circumstances and they
   returned in peace. Even the weak ones among us should, therefore, be of
   good courage and be ready to face opposition and ridicule. Sheep in the
   midst of wolves are among those who would rip them, tear them, devour
   them. Luther used to say Cain will go on killing Abel to the world's
   end, if he can, and so he will till that millennial day when the wolf
   shall lie down with the lamb! The disposition and nature of the wolves
   cause them to be opposed to the sheep--and it is the nature of the
   world to hate the children of God!

   All through history you see the two seeds in contention--if there is
   Abel there is Cain who slays him. If there is Noah, you see an ungodly
   world all round him. If there is an Isaac, so, also, is there an
   Ishmael who will mock him. And if there is a Jacob, there is an Esau
   who seeks to kill him. There cannot be an Israel without Pharaoh, or
   Amalek, or Edom, or Babylon to oppose! David must be hunted by Saul and
   the Son of David by Herod. There is an enmity between the seed of the
   serpent and the Seed of the woman--and that enmity will always remain.
   The ungodly roar upon the righteous and seek to bring cruel accusations
   against them, even as against their Lord. No matter how pure the lives
   of the godly, the wicked will slander them! No matter how kind their
   actions, they will render evil in return. No matter how plain and
   honest their behavior, they will suspect them and no matter how
   disinterested in their motives, they will be sure to attribute to them
   the most evil designs, for the wolf comes to kill and to devour--and he
   will do it to the best of his ability.

   Ah, how red are his fangs in times of persecution! How the wolf raged
   and raved over, this, our country, in the days of Mary and Charles the
   Second. And afterwards when, first as a Protestant and next as a
   Puritan, the godly were devoured and he that followed his conscience
   was made to suffer bitterly! Scotland can tell how the wolf's fangs
   were wet with the blood of her covenanting sons! And were it not for
   God's own strong hand put upon them, the wolves would be tearing the
   sheep to this day in our own land! Again, they were to go like sheep
   among wolves, among a people who would hinder their endeavors, for
   their business was to seek the lost sheep and the wolves would not help
   them in that. On the contrary, the wolves, themselves, desire to seize
   upon the lost sheep as their prey.

   You must expect, if you are faithful to Christ and put forth zealous
   efforts, that there will be others who will put forth their strength
   and cunning to oppose you! It is often an awful game that we have to
   play for a man's soul. Each move we make is met by the devil and,
   unless God directs us, we shall lose the man. If we draw him to a
   Prayer Meeting,

   another takes him to the theater. If we set before him the Truth of
   God, another puzzles him with skepticism. If we persuade him, others
   entice him in the wrong direction. The cunning of our foe is something
   terrible! We go forth to hunt for precious souls, but there are others
   who, in another sense, hunt for the precious life.

   The streets at night tell of those whom Satan hires that he may use
   them as his decoys! The vicious literature scattered abroad so
   plentifully is another form of the nets of Satan, the great fowler, who
   catches the sons of men in his snares. If we are not earnest, the devil
   is! He never sleeps--he lost his eyelids long ago. We may slumber if we
   dare, but the powers of evil will never suspend their activities--day
   and night the deadly work goes on and the wolves howl over their prey.
   Therefore we go forth like sheep, not among the images of wolves, but
   in the midst of real active wolves that are doing all they possibly can
   to destroy those sheep who are as yet lost, but whom Christ has,
   nevertheless, purchased with His precious blood!

   We are to go forth like sheep among wolves in this sense, that we are
   quite powerless against them. What can a sheep do if a wolf sets upon
   it? It has no strength to resist! And so those 70 disciples of Christ,
   if the Jews had hunted them down, would have gone to prison and to
   death, for they could not fight. "My Kingdom," said our Lord, "is not
   of this world, else would My servants fight, that I should not be
   delivered to the Jews." All through the history of the Church, when the
   wolves actually set upon the sheep, they make no active resistance, but
   as the flock of slaughter they suffer and die. I know there was a time
   in history when the sheep began fighting, but it was not their Master's
   mind that they should--He bids us put our sword in its scabbard. Our
   place is to bear and bear and bear continually--as He did!

   He says, "If a man strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the
   other, also." Fighting sheep are strange animals and fighting
   Christians are self-evident contradictions. They have forsaken the
   Master's way--they have gone off from the platform where He stands
   whenever it comes to carnal weapons. It is ours to submit and to be the
   anvil which bears the blows but outlasts all the hammers! After all,
   the wolves have had, by far, the worst of it--the sheep are multiplied
   and the wolves grow fewer and fewer! As a matter of fact, the sheep
   have lived in this country to see the last of the wolves--and they will
   in other lands, too!

   The wild dogs of Australia are very fierce against the sheep, but the
   sheep will surely, in the end, live, and the wild dog will die.
   Everywhere it is so. They are weak in themselves and yet they conquer
   the strong. "Ah," you say, "it is the Shepherd who gives them this
   victory." Precisely so! And that is where our strength lies--even in
   "that Great Shepherd of the sheep." Though called to bow down as the
   street that men may go over us, by this endurance we conquer! In
   suffering we are invincible and in this sign we conquer--the cross of
   self-denial and self-sacrifice leads the way. "I send you forth as
   sheep in the midst of wolves," not rendering railing for railing, but
   contrariwise, blessing! Being provoked, you return gentleness and,
   being persecuted, you pray for your enemies!

   "Ah," says one, "I do not like the looks of such a mode of warfare!" I
   thought you would not and you may go your way. As notice was given of
   old in the camp of Israel that he who had lately married a wife, or
   built a house, or was fainthearted, might go home, so do we say--"To
   your beds, you cowards! If you cannot undertake this for your Master,
   He does not need that His hosts should be encumbered by your presence!"
   Our Master calls out men to whom He gives Divine Grace that they may be
   strong to endure even unto the end! The Spirit of the Lord gives
   patience and forbearance to those who, in true faith, seek to be like
   their suffering Lord.

   Brethren, it is trying work for the sheep to go forth among wolves, but
   it has to be done. Picture it in your mind's eye. The timid sheep
   trembles at it. The wolves are rough, unmannerly, coarse-minded,
   irritating, annoying. The poor sheep does not feel at home in such
   company! He sees, every now and then, the white teeth glittering within
   the wolf's mouth and he is ill at ease. The sheep wishes he were back
   in the quiet fold among his happy brethren, but the Shepherd knows what
   He is doing and it is the duty of the sheep to obey and to go into the
   midst of the wolves if his Shepherd bids him. It is very testing, too,
   because if a man is not truly one of God's own, he will not obey so
   trying a command, but will neglect duty and seek comfort.

   It will try even you who are most sincere. You think you have much
   patience--get among the wolves and see how much is left! You fancy you
   could put up with a great deal of annoyance--let it come upon you and
   you will see how it torments you. When it comes to the loss of your
   good name, to downright lying and slander against the most tender part
   of your character. When it comes to bitter sneers and sarcasms and
   words which eat like acid into the flesh and burn like

   coals of fire flung into the bosom, it is not easy, then, to maintain
   the love which hopes all things, endures all things. Grace, alone,
   makes Believers press forward in their work of love, seeking with
   gentleness to win souls.

   Oh to say--though the wicked man curses me and foams at the mouth with
   rage--I will still seek his good! This is the victory of faith, but the
   battle will test all your Graces and make you see that all is not gold
   which glitters. You will soon see whether the Spirit of God is in you
   or not, for patient love is not natural, but supernatural--and only he
   who is filled with the supernatural indwelling of the Holy Spirit will
   be able to live as a sheep among wolves! If you can accomplish this
   work it will be very instructive to you.

   You will never know why Christ wept over Jerusalem till you get among
   the Jerusalemites and painfully feel the cruel wrongs which make men
   weep because they love! You cannot understand the Savior's death
   throes, the bloody sweat, the heaviness even unto death and the broken
   heart until you go, like a sheep, into the midst of wolves! Then you
   will be where Jesus was and you will have fellowship with Him!
   Practical learning is best--books cannot teach us fellowship with our
   Lord, but when we get to do Christly work, then we come to mourn the
   evil which He lamented and prize the remedy which He supplied. Thus we
   gather knowledge and are, ourselves, the better for our labor for
   others.

   III. Let us now look at God's servants sent forth and note THEIR
   EMINENT AUTHORITY. "Behold I send you forth." What a grand expression!
   It could be used by no mere man! He who spoke thus is Divine. Brothers
   and Sisters, our commission justifies us in what we do. For a sheep to
   go into the midst of wolves of its own accord would be a foolish
   courting of peril. But when the Great Shepherd says, "I send you," it
   would be a grievous fault to linger. Who is this who says, "I send
   you"? First, it is "The Lord of the Harvest." Did you notice while we
   were reading in the 10th of Luke, how the two verses ran on, "Pray you,
   therefore, the Lord of the Harvest, that He would send forth laborers
   into His harvest. Go your ways; behold, I send you."

   The same connection is here, only there is a little parenthesis--read
   the last verse of the ninth chapter of Matthew, and you will see that
   it is the same. It is the Lord of the Harvest to whom we pray, who
   actually sends us forth in answer to our own prayers! He is the Master
   of all worlds and owner of the souls of men. He puts His sickle into
   your hands and bids you go forth and reap the golden grain which is the
   reward of the travail of His soul. "I send you,"--the Lord of the
   Harvest. Armed with His authority, who shall daunt you? Go even to the
   gates of Hell if Jesus commands!

   Next, "I send you"--I, who prize you, for you are My sheep. I who love
   you, for I bought you with My blood. I, who would not expose you to a
   needless danger. I, who know by My infinite wisdom that I am doing a
   wise and a kind thing. I send you, you, My sheep, My dear sheep, for
   whom I laid down My life--I send you into the midst of
   wolves--therefore you may safely go, for I, who love you, send you
   there. Lord, we ask no questions, but we go at once. "I send you," that
   is I who have gone on the same errand Myself.

   Did He not come into the world like a sheep in the midst of wolves?
   Remember with what patience He endured and with what glory He
   triumphed! Remember His poverty and shame and death! Remember how, like
   a sheep before her shearers, He was dumb, like a lamb that is taken to
   the slaughter, He opened not His mouth. He does not bid you go where He
   has not gone Himself. It is dangerous, but then He has passed through
   the danger, endured it and triumphed in it. "I send you"--mark that--I
   who overcame in the very Character in which I send you! Have you not
   read in the book of Revelation, "The Lamb shall overcome them"? And
   again, "They overcame by the blood of the Lamb." And know you not that
   Heaven's high songs go up to Him that sits upon the Throne and unto the
   Lamb forever and ever?

   The Lamb in the midst of wolves has conquered the wolves and is Lord of
   All! And so He, in effect, says, "You are My lambs, therefore, go
   forth,, as I did. Endure, as I did. Conquer, as I did, and you shall
   sit on my Throne and the Lamb shall lead you to the living fountains of
   water."

   IV. We close by noticing THEIR PERMANENT INSTRUCTIONS. You have a tough
   task before you, to act as

   sheep among wolves! Your Lord leaves you not without guidance in the
   form of plain precepts. What are you to do, then? Be bold as lions?
   Yes, but that is not the principal thing. Be swift as eagles? Yes, by
   all means, but that is not the main requirement. For everyday life, for
   the wear and tear of this great battle, there are two grand requisites.
   The first is prudence--be wise as serpents. And the next thing is
   innocence--be harmless as doves.

   First, be prudent and wise as a serpent. Do not imitate a serpent in
   any other respect but in this. Never let the devil enter into you as he
   did the serpent, nor become groveling and cunning. But, still, the
   serpent is an exceedingly wise creature and it had need to be, for it
   lives in a world where it is hated by a deadly foe. It is natural for
   man to hate the

   whole serpent tribe. The very first thing you do if you see a viper is
   to look for a stick to kill it. Everybody is the enemy of serpents and
   if they are to exist, at all, they must be very wary--in this you are
   to copy them.

   What does a serpent do to preserve itself? What is it which proves its
   wisdom? First, it gets out of the way of man as much as it can. Our
   Lord meant this, for immediately after our text He says, "But beware of
   men." It is well to get out of the society of ungodly men and let them
   see that their habits and modes of conversation are not ours. Seek to
   benefit them, but do not seek their society! Their wolfish propensities
   are most seen in their leisure time, in their drinking and reveling
   and, therefore, keep far from these. You have no business in their
   parties, their frivolous assemblies, their drinking bouts and places of
   lascivious song.

   Do not accept their invitations when you know that they will be under
   no restraint. Do not linger near them when they are talking lewdly or
   profanely. Your moving away will be your most telling protest. You must
   be with them in your business--indeed, you are sent to them--but while
   you are with them you must not be of them! And you should discreetly
   avoid them when you know that you can do no good. You younger ones
   should get out of the way of old blasphemers and scoffers as much as
   you ever can, for they delight to worry the lambs. Do not attempt to
   answer them, but keep out of their way. Do not court quarrelling and
   controversy, but avoid all disputing upon the Gospel.

   Your workmates will chaff you and, no doubt, you will receive many
   opprobrious epithets, but neither provoke this treatment nor resent it
   in any way. Do not cast pearls before swine and do not introduce
   religion at unseasonable times. Hold your principles very firmly, but
   when you know a man will only blaspheme if he hears you name the name
   of Jesus, do not give him the occasion. Stand up for Jesus when the
   time is fit, but do not exercise zeal without knowledge. When a man is
   half drunk, or in a passion, leave him to himself and thus escape many
   a brawl. At another opportunity, when the occasion is more favorable,
   then endeavor to instruct and persuade, but not when failure is
   certain. Be very prudent and hold your peace when silence is better
   than speech.

   How else does the serpent act? It glides along very quietly. It can
   hiss, but it does not very often do so. As it glides along, it neither
   sings, nor roars, nor barks. It does not court observation. It slips
   off quietly, gracefully, swiftly and without noise. Now, do not seek
   after great publicity. There may be times when it may be well to ring
   the great bell. If you can get multitudes of people together to hear
   the Gospel, by all means ring the bell as loudly as you can! But as far
   as you are personally concerned, do not make a fuss, do not blazon
   abroad what you are going to do, do not call upon everybody, saying,
   "Come, see my zeal for the Lord of Hosts."

   Glide along through a useful life as quietly as the serpent which does
   what he finds to do and says nothing, dreading, rather than courting
   the eyes of man. Unobtrusive earnestness, quiet, simple-minded
   resolution to achieve your purpose--whether men will bear or whether
   they will forbear, whether they will praise, or whether they will laugh
   at you--this is your wisdom. Then, again, the serpent is famous for
   finding his way where no other creature could enter-- any little space,
   any tiny opening will be sufficient for his purpose. His form is
   adapted to progress among obstacles. You may block the way to other
   creatures, but he will wriggle in somehow.

   So should it be with us. If we cannot get at men's hearts one way, we
   must try another. If you cannot induce them to read the Gospel, get
   them to hear it. If you cannot induce them to hear a sermon, drop a
   verse into their ears. If a tract is refused, put a word in edgeways
   for your Lord and Master. There is a way into everyone's heart if you
   know how to find it--be wise as serpents and discover it. Though it
   seems very difficult to reach some minds, yet with holy perseverance
   and serpentine adroitness continue the attempt and you will succeed.
   There is a weak point in the strongest man's mind, where his opposition
   can be wounded. Even Leviathan that laughs at the spear has a tender
   place where the spear's point may come at him--and so the most ungodly,
   wicked, blaspheming, profane infidel has some point where you may reach
   his better feelings if you do but search it out. Be wise as serpents in
   this respect.

   But then you are to add to this--which might otherwise degenerate into
   cunning--the innocence of the dove. The Greek for, "harmless," is,
   "without horn." The dove is without horn, hoof, fang, or other means of
   defense. You are to have positively no weapons! Like the dove, you are
   to be defenseless. It seems an amazing thing to set doves flying at
   eagles, and lambs at war with wolves, but this is what the Lord has
   done! This defenselessness, however, which looks like our weakness, is
   our real strength! Our being harmless appears to predict sure
   destruction, but it is to be the means of certain victory!

   You are to be gentle and easily entreated. You are not to fly into a
   passion because you are contradicted, nor to be angry because you are
   reviled. You are to endure contradiction and slander with tenderness
   and gentleness, as a dove bears all things. You are not to be driven
   into any sin by opposition. The dove is pure--it loves to be by the
   rivers of waters, in the quiet and clean places. So should you never be
   driven to sinful word or deed, but do good to all men and glorify God
   in all things by being both gentle and pure as a dove. And as the dove
   is very simple and is altogether artless and unworldly, so let your
   strength and your wisdom lie in your artless truthfulness and childlike
   dependence upon God.

   See how Christ explains His own utterance a little further down.
   "Harmless as doves," then He adds, "But when they deliver you up, take
   no thought how or what you shall speak." Be like a dove, confident
   because fearless, gentle, artless, simple and restful. Do no ill, and
   fear none. You Christian people, if you are going to defend the Gospel,
   need not study oratory or become expert in pleading such as are used at
   law. Tell the truth and baffle the devil! The Truth of God is the most
   powerful weapon and the most subtle policy.

   I believe that even in affairs of State, truth is wisdom. No diplomatic
   agent would so confound intriguers as a man who should tell the truth.
   They would conclude that what he said was a lie because they are
   accustomed to regard everything as having another meaning. An
   ambassador, it was formerly said, was to be a gentleman who is sent
   abroad to lie for the good of his country--but I hope it is not so now.
   If straightforward truth should ever become the policy of any country
   it would be invincible in council! If in politics a man were to throw
   away all arts and tricks and adhere only to principle, he must gain
   respect. The greatest art in all the world is to fling all art away and
   the grandest policy is to have no policy, but honest dealing. The
   bravest thing that can ever be done and the most noble, is to be
   artless and harmless as a dove.

   There, then, is the policy of your warfare--be prudent, but be innocent
   and simple-minded. Oh, the power of truthfulness! Do not believe that
   men are strong in proportion as they are artful. By no manner of means!
   Do not believe that they are strong in proportion as they can bend a
   fist. No, the power of a Christian must lie in his holy heart, in his
   earnest tongue and in his look of love. By this he shall vanquish, and
   by nothing else! The conclusion of my sermon is this. Does it come home
   to you, Brothers and Sisters? Do you hear the Lord sending you out to
   work? Then I entreat you, go forth! Suppose I make that one sentence my
   last word--"go forth"?

   You may have heard of the Scot officer who had his men drawn up for the
   battle and felt bound to make them a speech. He pointed to the enemy,
   and said, "There they are, lads. If you don't kill them, they will kill
   you." My words are the same--There are the enemies of all
   righteousness, the enemies of Christ, the enemies of the good of men,
   the enemies of progress--if you do not overthrow them by publishing the
   Gospel to all according to your ability, they will overthrow you! Which
   is it to be? By the Grace of the Eternal and the Omnipotence of Him who
   bled for us, we will conquer even by His Cross after His own fashion!
   Only let His Holy Spirit rest upon us. Amen.

Brave Waiting

   (No. 1371)

   DELIVERED ON LORDS-DAY MORNING, AUGUST 26, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Wait on the Lord: be of good courage and He shall strengthen your
   heart: wait, I say, on the Lord." Psalm 27:14.

   THE Christian's life is no child's play. All who have gone on
   pilgrimage to the Celestial City have found a rough road, sloughs of
   despond and hills of difficulty, giants to fight and tempters to shun.
   Hence there are two perils to which Christians are exposed--the one is
   that under heavy pressure they should stay away from the path which
   they ought to pursue--the other is lest they should grow fearful of
   failure and so become faint-hearted in their holy course. Both these
   dangers had evidently occurred to David and in the text he is led by
   the Holy Spirit to speak about them. "Do not," he seems to say, "do not
   think that you are mistaken in keeping to the way of faith. Do not turn
   aside to crooked policy. Do not begin to trust in an arm of flesh, but
   wait upon the Lord."

   And, as if this were a duty in which we are doubly apt to fail, he
   repeats the exhortation and makes it more emphatic the second
   time--"Wait, I say, on the Lord." Hold on with your faith in God.
   Persevere in walking according to His will. Let nothing seduce you from
   your integrity--let it never be said of you, "You ran well, what
   hindered you that you did not obey the Truth of God?" And lest we
   should be faint in our minds, which was the second danger, the Psalmist
   says, "Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart." There
   is really nothing to be depressed about. There is no real danger--you
   are safe while God lives, while Christ pleads and while the Spirit of
   God dwells in you--therefore be not dismayed, nor even dream of fear.
   Be not timorous and unbelieving, but play the man! "Wait on the Lord:
   be of good courage and He shall strengthen your heart."

   The objective of our discourse this morning will be the encouragement
   of those who feel in any degree dispirited and depressed on account of
   the hard places of the way, or the opposition of the world. May the
   Divine Spirit, whose peculiar office it is to be the Comforter of His
   people, now give the oil of joy to all who mourn and courage to all who
   tremble! We shall look at our text under four heads. First, God is to
   be waited on. Secondly, courage is to be maintained. Thirdly, waiting
   upon God will sustain courage and, fourthly, experience has proven
   this--for David sets his own seal to the text when he says, "Wait, I
   say, on the Lord." As much as to say--I have tried and proven the power
   of communion with God and, therefore, personally give my advice that
   you continually wait upon the Lord and you will be greatly
   strengthened.

   I. First, then, dear Friends, GOD IS TO BE WAITED ON. That word,
   "wait," is so exceedingly comprehensive that I quite despair of
   bringing out every shade of its meaning. The word, "walk," describes
   almost the whole of Christian life and so does this word, "wait," for,
   rightly understood, waiting is active as well as passive, energetic as
   well as patient and to wait upon the Lord necessitates as much holy
   courage as warring and fighting with His enemies. We are to wait on,
   wait upon and wait for the Lord, for it is written, "They that wait on
   the Lord shall inherit the earth." "They that wait upon the Lord shall
   renew their strength." And, "blessed are all they that wait for Him."

   What do we mean, then, by, "wait on the Lord"? I say, first, let us
   wait on the Lord as a beggar waits for alms at the rich man's door. We
   are very poor and needy, laboring under such necessities that the whole
   world cannot supply what we require. Only in God is there a supply for
   the deep poverty of our souls! We have gone to His door, many of us,
   and knocked and waited. And, in so doing, we have obtained very
   gracious answers. If others of us have not seen the door of Mercy open
   to us, let us still wait at the posts of the Lord's door. Let us still
   knock and still hope for His salvation.

   Are you seeking the Savior and are you trusting Him? Have you not yet
   obtained the peace which comes with believing? Then with great
   importunity continue in prayer and wait on, remembering that the
   blessing is worth waiting for--it is such a treasure that if you had to
   wait for a lifetime to fully obtain it, you would be well repaid when
   it came. Wait, but knock as you wait, with fervent pleading and strong
   confidence, for the Lord Himself waits to be gracious to

   you. Agonize in desire and let not the knocker of Heaven's gate ever
   rest! Make the door of Mercy resound again and again with your resolute
   blows upon it.

   The Lord is good to them that wait for Him. He will, in due time,
   answer you. It shall never be said that any were sent away empty from
   His gate. He has not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth, nor
   said unto the seed of Jacob, "Seek you My face in vain." Pray on,
   believe on, and as surely as God's promise is true, He will, in due
   time, grant you conscious salvation. Your head shall be lifted high
   above your enemies round about you and you shall rejoice with
   unspeakable joy and full of glory! The devil bids you cease from
   prayer. He tells you that the little faith you have will never save
   you. Do not believe him! Stand fast, pray on, believe on, expect
   on--though the vision tarries, wait for it--it shall come, it shall not
   be long.

   The Lord grant you Grace to wait in all humility, for what are you but
   a beggar, and beggars must not be choosers! It is good that a man both
   hope and quietly wait for the salvation of God, for they shall not be
   ashamed that wait for Him. To cling to the Cross, to rest at the altar
   of our Lord's Atonement is the safest course. Believingly to wait upon
   the Lord, pleading the all-prevailing name of Jesus, is the suppliant's
   best posture. I trust many in the House of God this morning have passed
   from this stage to the next--they wait as learners for instruction. The
   disciple waits at His Master's feet and, according as the Teacher
   chooses to speak, so the disciple's ears are opened.

   Mary sat at Jesus' feet. Some stand in the crowd and listen a little
   and soon they are gone, but the true disciple abides in the school and
   waits to hear what his Master will say. We bow down at His feet with
   this humble resolve, that whatever He says we will hear and whatever
   His doctrine, precept, or promise may be, we will drink it all in with
   intense delight. The pupils of the old philosophers were apt to walk in
   the groves of academia till the wise men were ready to come and speak
   with them. And when any one of the wise men began to speak, the young
   disciples quietly followed his steps, eagerly catching up every
   precious sentence which he might utter.

   Much more should it be so with us towards our Lord Jesus. Let us follow
   Him in every page of Inspiration, study every line of creation and
   learn of Him in all the teachings of His Providence. Let us catch the
   faintest whisper of His Spirit and yield to each Divine impulse. "Wait,
   I say, on the Lord." If you are to be instructed disciples it must be
   by a diligent, patient, persevering waiting upon Him who is the
   Fountain of all knowledge and the Sun of all light. May we never outrun
   our Master by conceited speculations and vain imaginations, but may we
   wait till He speaks and be content to remain in ignorance unless He
   chooses to withdraw the veil.

   A third form of this waiting will come out under the figure of waiting
   as a servant waits upon his lord. A true servant is anxious to know
   what his master wishes him to do and, when he once knows it, he is
   happy to undertake it and carry it through. In great houses certain
   servants enquire of the master in the morning, "Sir, what are your
   orders for the day?" Imitate this and when you rise in the morning,
   always wait upon your Lord to know what His commands are for the day.
   Say, "Show me what You would have me do. Teach me Your ways, O Lord.
   Lead me in a plain path. Inform me as to what to seek and what to shun,
   for my will is to do Your will in all things."

   Notice how maid-servants watch their mistresses when they are waiting
   at table or serving about the house. A word is enough and sometimes a
   look or a nod of the head is all the direction needed. So should it be
   with us--we should eagerly desire to know the mind of the Lord and
   carefully watch for indications of it. As the eyes of a maiden are unto
   the hands of her mistress, so should our eyes wait upon the Lord our
   God. We, who are the ministers of the Lord Jesus, ought to be looking
   all around to see what we can do in God's House. Good servants do not
   need to be told of every little thing--they have their master's
   interest at heart and they perceive what should be done and they do it.

   Oh, to be always waiting to do more and more for Jesus! I would go up
   and down my Master's House, seeing what I can do for His little
   children whom I delight to cherish! What part of the House needs
   sweeping and cleaning, that I may quietly go about it? What part of the
   table needs to be furnished with food, that I may bring out, as His
   steward, things new and old? What is there to be done for my Master
   towards those who are outside and what is to be done for those already
   in His family? You will never be short of work if, with your whole
   heart, you wait upon the Lord! We do evil if we stand idly gazing up
   into Heaven expecting His coming and making it a pretense for doing
   little or nothing to win souls! Our wisest course is, as men that
   expect their Lord, to stand with our loins girt and our lamps trimmed.

   You know what the Orientals meant by having their loins girt--they
   gathered up their loose flowing garments when they meant work--even as
   a hard-working man among us takes off his coat and works in his
   shirtsleeves. Stand like

   workmen with your sleeves up--that is the English of it, ready for any
   work which your Master may appoint! You put on the uniform of the Lord
   Jesus years ago when you were baptized into His name--take care to keep
   it spotless, for it is known to be connected with a sinless Prince!
   Never, by disobedience, make the uniform to be a lie, for if you are
   not His servant, why should you wear the garb of His household?
   Beloved, "He that waits upon his master shall be honored." Let us not
   fail in waiting upon ours.

   Sometimes the servant will have to wait in absolute inaction--and this
   is not always to the taste of energetic minds. I suppose that walking
   round Jericho six days and doing nothing must have been very
   distasteful to the men of war who wanted to be coming to blows. They
   might have said, "Why should we and all the multitude march round the
   walls and do nothing? The men of war chafed in their harness and longed
   to be at the foe! It is said that Wellington kept back the Guards at
   Waterloo till far into the fight and it must, I should think, have
   needed much courage on their part to remain calm and quiet while cannon
   were roaring, the battle raging and the shots flying about them.

   They must not stir till the commander-in-chief gives the order, "Up,
   Guards, and at them!" Then will they clear the field and utterly
   annihilate the foe. They were as much serving their country by lying
   still, till the time came, as they were by dashing forward when, at
   last, the word was given! Wait, then, upon your Lord in all sorts of
   service and patience, for this is what He would have you do. Another
   form of this waiting may be compared to a traveler waiting the
   directions of his guide, or a mariner waiting upon the pilot who takes
   charge of his ship. We are to wait upon God for direction in the entire
   voyage of life. He is at the helm and His hand is to steer our course.

   I am fearful that some Christians very greatly fail in waiting upon the
   Lord for guidance, yet the types and examples of the Old Testament very
   strongly enforce this duty. I will give you one type and one example.
   The type shall be Israel in the wilderness. There was a straight way to
   Canaan and, I suppose, it would not occupy many days to go from Goshen
   to Jerusalem. They must not, however, take that way, but follow their
   leader. When they had wandered for a year in the wilderness, they might
   soon have reached the land, for, in fact, they were near its borders.
   But no, they must go where the famous pillar, which indicated the
   Presence of God, should conduct them!

   If it remained stationary for a year, the tents must not move. If it
   was up early in the morning, again, and again, and again for a whole
   succession of weary marching days, Israel must not dare rest. Under the
   shade of the pillar of cloud must they abide by day and its light must
   be their glory by night. Everywhere they were to wait for the heavenly
   signal and never choose their own path. Do you watch the cloud, my
   Brethren? Do you wait upon the Lord for guidance? Do you continually
   say, "I pray You show me Your way"? Do you commit your own way unto the
   Lord? If not, how little you have learned the true position and
   privilege of the people of God!

   The example I take from David's own life. If you have noticed the 14th
   Chapter of the First Book of Chronicles, you will read that David,
   being threatened by the Philistines, enquired of the Lord, saying,
   "Shall I go up against them?" And he had for an answer, "Go up, for I
   will deliver them into your hands." Encouraged by the oracle, he went
   forth to the attack and carried all before him like the breaking forth
   of a flood. The Philistines rallied again and spread themselves abroad
   in the valley--surely David might have felt quite safe in falling upon
   them again. What further directions could he need? Would not the former
   oracle avail, now that the same circumstances were occurring?

   But no, the man of God did not feel safe until he had laid the new case
   before the Lord and it is recorded, "Therefore David enquired, again,
   of God." This time the response was very different. Possibly to his own
   surprise David received orders not to go up after the Philistines, but
   to turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberry
   trees. When he should hear a sound of the going in the tops of the
   mulberry trees, he was to bestir himself, but not just then. He
   followed the new directions and again smote the host of the
   Philistines!

   Brothers, wait on the Lord often! Though you were wise in the last
   intricate business, you may be a fool over the next simple matter! In
   fact, it is over the simple matters that we make our great blunders in
   life, even as Israel did with the Gibeonites when they came with old
   shoes and bread that was moldy--half an eye might have sufficed to see
   through their trick but Israel acted hastily, ate bread with them, made
   a treaty with them--and inquired not at the hand of the Lord. Not so
   David--he was never slow to seek Divine guidance.

   I admire that which comes out, incidentally, about him in the saying of
   Abimelech, the priest at Nob. When Saul accused him of having enquired
   of the Lord for David, Abimelech replied, "Did I then begin to enquire
   of God for him?" As much as to say, "He is an old frequenter of the
   Lord's courts. He has enquired of God many and many a time before

   this. To accuse me of inquiring of the Lord for him, as though I was
   abetting rebellion, is unjust, for I only did for David what I had
   often done before." And so it was that David behaved himself wisely in
   a perfect way--because he followed not his own judgment but waited on
   the Lord.

   There was one occasion, when he marched against Nabal in the heat of
   his wrath, when he went in his own spirit and not under heavenly
   influences. And had it not been that the Lord sent a wise woman to
   cross his path, he would have shed blood that day and it would have
   been a grief of mind to him all his life. Oh that we did more sincerely
   wait upon the Lord in the sense of seeking instruction as to our path
   in life--then would He fulfill His promise to us--"Your ears shall hear
   a voice behind you, saying, This is the way, walk you in it."

   I have not yet exhausted the word, "wait," for we ought to wait upon
   God as a child waits upon its parent. Our children can seldom be
   accused of having small expectations with reference to us. They have
   almost countless desires and wants--and they always expect their
   parents to readily supply them--in which reckoning, I have no doubt,
   they have been strongly confirmed by their past experience! No little
   child thinks of providing for himself, nor does he dream of directing
   his own course in life. You cannot get that little head to be
   thoughtful about tomorrow's food! You cannot force that little heart to
   be anxious about the next suit of clothes. To all suggested doubt, the
   little lips reply, "My father knows what I need and I am sure he will
   give it to me."

   Such is the happy, restful life of a loving child and this is as it
   should be with us. It is my Father's business to provide for me. His
   name is Jehovah-Jireh. It is my Father's business to preserve me. He
   has given His angels charge to keep me in all my ways. It is my
   Father's business to mark out the future for me--I cannot see, even,
   into tomorrow! My eyes are dim, but my Father knows all about what
   shall be and He will be ready for whatever shall happen--therefore I
   should wait upon Him, raise no questions and expect great mercies.
   Blessed are they who are thus found waiting.

   And then, perhaps, I may add one more thing--we should wait upon the
   Lord as a courtier waits upon his prince. He that is at court and seeks
   to rise to favor waits upon his prince with the desire to be employed
   in the royal service, that he may prove his loyal zeal. He counts any
   sort of employment at court to be a great honor. He tells his friends
   and they accept it as a subject of congratulation that he has obtained
   such-and-such work to do for the king. He delights to increase the
   honor and dignity of his prince's court, for he shares in it himself.

   Brethren, how carefully should you and I endeavor to show forth the
   honor of our Lord Jesus among the sons of men! Has He not made us kings
   and priests? And should we not exalt His glorious name forever? We
   should seek to make our Lord Jesus famous to the world's end--our daily
   conversation and our current character--our private and public behavior
   should all tend to increase our Master's honor among the sons of men.
   We must be ready for anything for Jesus and everything for
   Jesus--counting that we, ourselves, are honored by disgrace if we bring
   honor to Him.

   Sir Walter Raleigh was wise in his generation when he took off his
   richly embroidered cloak to spread it over a miry place, that Queen
   Elizabeth's feet might not be dampened. The courtier knew how to smooth
   his own road by caring for his queen. And thus, with unselfish motives,
   out of pure reverence for our Lord, let us be willing to be made as the
   street to be walked over if Jesus can be honored! Let us lay out for
   our Lord the best that we have, even our life, itself, if by so doing
   we may bring glory to the holy and blessed name of our Redeemer! From
   now on it is ours to live unto the Lord and die unto the Lord! We will
   wait on the Lord and keep His way and may His Grace enable us daily to
   say, "I wait for the Lord, my soul does wait, and in His Word do I
   hope."

   II. Secondly, COURAGE IS TO BE MAINTAINED. "Be of good courage." Our
   good Lord and Master ought not to be followed by cowards. Be of good
   courage, you that wait on the Lord! Have the courage of hope concerning
   the faith which you are exercising upon Christ. You are just beginning,
   some of you, to believe in Jesus, and you are afraid that He will cast
   you away, or fearful that you will not obtain full salvation from sin.
   I have already told you to continue to knock at Mercy's door--do so,
   but be of good courage--for that door will certainly open to you. He
   that asks receives, he that seeks finds and to him that knocks it shall
   be opened.

   Take heart, poor fainting one, the Lord has a tender eye towards
   mourning souls! He is very good to those who seek Him. Though you are
   like poor trembling Mercy who fainted outside the door of the
   interpreter's house, yet your Lord thinks upon you and He says, "Come
   in, you blessed of the Lord, why do you stand outside?" He will not
   suffer those to perish who humbly wait on Him. The light of His
   countenance shall yet be yours. Be of good courage, O Seeker! Be, also,

   of good courage, you who have newly found Him. Be bold to avow your
   faith. Remember that the trust which you repose in Jesus is a
   justifiable one and can be vindicated against all comers--therefore do
   not hide it.

   I hate to see a Christian act like a rat behind the wall who comes
   peeping out, when everything is still, to see if anybody is about so
   that he may get his crumbs. If there is half a sound of a foot
   anywhere--away he slips and hides himself in his hole! No, if you
   belong to Christ, acknowledge it! What is there to be ashamed of? To
   believe the Truth of God--shall a man blush at that? To follow infinite
   purity and holiness incarnate in Christ Jesus--is there anything to be
   ashamed of in that? No, rather let us wear our colors before the face
   of all men and lift high our banner in all companies, for it is a cause
   for glorying rather than for blushing that we are on the Lord's side!
   It is the best thing about us! It is the greatest mercy we have ever
   received! Why should we conceal it? Wait on the Lord, be of good
   courage and confess your faith before men, you that have newly been
   brought to Jesus.

   Then go farther. Be of good courage in endeavoring to spread the faith
   which you have received. When you go to speak to others about the great
   salvation, be not afraid! If it is new work for you, I dare say you
   will tremble, but still do it and ask the Lord to give you greater
   confidence in proclaiming the tidings of His Grace. If you speak with
   infidels, be of good courage, though for a while you cannot lead them
   to believe. If you speak to those who are incensed against the Truth of
   God, be of good courage--what harm can they do to you that shall be
   equal to the harm you will suffer by being a coward? Be of good courage
   and undertake great things for Christ! Do not expect a defeat, but dare
   and venture all for Him.

   Do something more than you are able to do, expecting strength beyond
   your own to be afforded you, and it will certainly come. "Wait on the
   Lord: be of good courage and He shall strengthen your heart." Be of
   good courage, then, in the way of practical energy for the advancement
   of your Redeemer's cause. Be of good courage when you pray for others.
   Wait on the Lord about your children and be of good courage and expect
   to see them saved. Wait on the Lord about your servants, about your
   brothers and sisters, about your neighbors--be of good courage about
   them--believe that God hears prayer and that your intercessions will
   bless those for whom you pray.

   Intercession has great influence with God. It is no vain thing to wait
   upon the Lord for the souls of others. Thousands now in Heaven owe
   their conversion to the prayers of the saints and, therefore, plead
   with great courage! Never cease to pray! And when you pray, pray not as
   though you spoke to a tyrant reluctant to hear, or to a forgetful God
   who would fail to answer, but wait on Him with quiet confidence and you
   shall not come away empty. Be of good courage, too, in making
   self-sacrifices for the cause of Christ. If you lose a situation
   because you are honest, be of good courage--you will be no loser in the
   long run.

   Are there some who despise you because you are a Christian? Be of good
   courage, their opinion is of very little worth and in the judgment of
   angels and good men you stand very high. Are you like Moses when he
   refused the treasures of Egypt with all the honors of the court? Be of
   good courage, the Lord will give you, even in this life, a recompense
   and, in the world to come, life everlasting! If it should come to
   losing all you have for Jesus' sake, be of good courage, for he that
   loses his life for Christ's sake shall find it and he that becomes poor
   for the cause of Christ shall be eternally rich! Be of good courage!

   Once again, if you are called to endure great affliction, sharp pain,
   frequent sickness. If business goes amiss, if riches take to themselves
   wings and fly away. If friends forsake you and foes surround you, be of
   good courage, for the God upon whom you wait will not forsake you.
   Never let it be said that a soldier of the Cross flinched in the day of
   battle! Bear your Father's will, glad to have such a Father's will to
   bear! If Grace cannot enable us to endure all that Nature can heap upon
   us, what is Grace worth? Now is the time, my dear Brothers and Sisters,
   in the floods of adversity, to see whether your faith is real faith or
   not! Mere sunshine faith is not worth having! We need that which will
   outlive the most terrible storm that ever beclouded the heavens.

   Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, though heart and flesh should
   fail you. Though eyes grow dim and the light of day should be quite
   shut out. Though hearing should fail and the daughters of music be
   silent. Though all the doors of the senses should be closed. Though the
   bearers of the body should totter and the keepers of the house should
   tremble, yes, though death itself should remove this feeble body, yet
   there is no cause for fear! We may exclaim with dying Jacob, "I have
   waited for Your salvation, O Lord." Let not your hearts be troubled!
   Wait on the Lord and courage shall revive.

   III. Our third point is that WAITING UPON GOD SUSTAINS COURAGE.
   Beloved, if ever you begin to grow weary in the good ways of God, wait
   upon Him with double earnestness. You have heard of the famous giant
   whom Hercules could not kill because the earth was his mother. Every
   time Hercules dashed him down, he obtained fresh strength by touching
   his parent and rose again to fight. We are of like nature--every time
   we are driven to our God, though we are dashed upon Him by defeat--we
   grow strong, again, and our adversary's attempt is foiled. Our foe will
   never destroy us unless he can separate us from the love of God which
   is in Christ Jesus our Lord and that is impossible! Waiting upon God is
   the way to renew our strength until we mount up with eagle's wings and
   leave the world below.

   In the first place, our heart is strengthened by waiting upon God
   because we thus receive a mysterious strength through the incoming of
   the Eternal Spirit into our souls. No man can explain this, but many of
   us know what it is. We do not know how the Holy Spirit operates, but we
   are conscious that after a season of prayer we are often much refreshed
   and feel as if we had been ground young again. We have gone in before
   the Lord haggard and worn, desponding and, (shame upon us, we must
   add), ready to give up, turn tail and run away!

   We have not long drawn near God before we have felt our spirit revive.
   Though our approach was mostly a groan, yet we did wait upon the Lord
   and the Eternal Strength came into us. How wonderfully do the secret
   springs of Omnipotence break into the feeble soul and fill it with
   might in the inner man! Through the sacred anointing of the Holy Spirit
   we have been made to shout for joy! We have been so glad in the Lord
   that we could not contain our joy! He that made us has put His hands, a
   second time, to the work and restored unto us the joy of His salvation,
   filled our emptiness, removed our weakness and triumphed in us
   gloriously!

   The poor harp which had been long played upon could not, at length,
   yield music to its owner's hands. In vain the fingers roamed over the
   strings, the more heavily they were struck the more discordant were the
   sounds. The harp was taken from the hall and laid aside in a quiet
   chamber and there its maker came to deal with it. He knew its frame and
   understood the art of tuning it. He put new strings here and there and
   set the rest aright--and the next time the harper laid his fingers
   among the strings, pure music floated forth and flooded the palace with
   melody! Where discord had peopled the air with evil spirits, all was
   changed and it seemed as though angels leaped forth with silver wings
   from every chord! Yes, go to your God, poor Soul, when you are out of
   order! Wait on the Lord and He will strengthen your heart by His
   mysterious power.

   Besides this, waiting upon the Lord has an effect upon the mind which,
   in the natural course of things, tends to strengthen our courage, for
   waiting upon God makes men grow small and dwarfs the world and all its
   affairs till we see their real littleness. Poor David sat fretting
   about the ungodly as he saw them prospering in their way, while as for
   himself he was plagued all day and chastened every morning. Foolishly
   and ignorantly he complained of the Lord and questioned His justice,
   "until," he said, "I went into the sanctuary of God, then understood I
   their end." Set your great troubles before the infinite God and they
   will dwarf into such little things that you will never notice them
   again!

   He takes up the isles as a very little thing and the nations are as a
   drop in a bucket--and this great God will teach you to look at earthly
   things in the same light as He does, till, though the whole world
   should be against you, you would smile at its rage and though all the
   devils in Hell should rise against you, you would defy their fury! Our
   worst ills are utterly despised when we learn to measure them by the
   line of the Eternal. Thus you see that waiting upon God strengthens the
   heart by lessening the causes of fear.

   And then it inflames the heart with love. Nothing can give us greater
   courage than a sincere affection for our Lord and His work. Courage is
   sure to abound where love is fervent. Look among the mild and gentle
   creatures of the brute creation and see how bold they are when once
   they become mothers and have to defend their offspring! A hen will
   fight for her chicks, though at another time she is one of the most
   timid of birds. Mr. White, in his book on Selborne, tells of a raven
   that was hatching her young in a tree. The woodman began to fell it,
   but there she sat. The blows of the axe shook the tree, but she never
   moved--and when it fell, she was still upon her nest! Love will make
   the most timid creature strong and, oh, Beloved, if you love Christ you
   will defy all fear and count all hazards undergone for Him to be your
   joy!

   In this sense, also, perfect love casts out fear. It hopes all things,
   endures all things and continues, still, to wait upon the Lord. To have
   more love we must more continually wait upon the Lord and this will
   mightily renew the strength of our heart. Again, waiting upon the Lord
   breeds peace within the soul and when a man is perfectly at rest
   within, he cares little for trials or foes. It is conscience that makes
   cowards of us all, but let conscience be pacified through the atoning

   blood of Jesus and you can smile when others spit their venom at you
   and, like your blessed Master, you can bear their taunts without reply,
   for there is a heavenly calm within. A heart unsettled towards God is
   sure to be afraid of men, but when the soul waits on the Lord in glad
   serenity, it stoops not to fear.

   And, Beloved, this waiting upon the Lord produces the effect of
   increasing our courage because it often gives us a sight of the eternal
   reward. And if a man gets a glimpse of the crown of glory, the crown of
   thorns will no more prick his temples. He that sees what he shall be in
   the day when Christ shall be revealed, mourns not because of what he
   now is while he bears the reproach of Christ. In fact, waiting upon God
   makes us see that we are in fellowship with Christ and causes us to
   know that the load we carry is a cross of which He always bears the
   heaviest end! It lets us see that His heart is full of sensitive
   sympathy towards us and so it makes us suffer without complaining. Is
   it not sweet to sing--

   "If on my face for Your dear name, Shame and reproach shall be, I'll
   hail reproach and welcome shame For You will remember me"? Thus waiting
   upon the Lord pours power into the central reservoir of our strength.

   IV. Now I finish with the fourth point, which is, EXPERIENCE PROVES
   THIS. I want you to keep your Bibles open at the 27th Psalm and see how
   my text is a summary of the entire Psalm. All the rest of the verse may
   be compared to the figures of an account and this closing verse is the
   casting up of the whole--waiting on the Lord is the path of wisdom.
   For, first, in the opening verses David had been surrounded by enemies.
   He waited upon the Lord and the Lord made them stumble and fall.
   Afterwards, when they fought against him, he told his sorrow to God and
   God lifted his head high above his enemies till he could sing in the
   sanctuary songs of exultant joy unto the Lord.

   My Brothers and Sisters, do the same when you are assailed! You are not
   in a country subject to actual war, but you have many adversaries,
   spiritual and otherwise. You have the Prince of Darkness armed against
   you and a host of evil spirits in high places. Wait on the Lord in this
   conflict and He will give you victory. Your strength is to sit still.
   Fret not! Quietly refer all the contests to Him who returns from Edom
   with dyed garments from Bozrah, traveling in the greatness of His
   strength, because His foes and yours are trod beneath His feet. Wait on
   the Lord. Get away to the shadow of His pavilion. Hide in the secret of
   His tabernacle. Climb up upon the Rock and stay there--and all the
   adversaries of your soul shall be broken in pieces.

   Next, read the 7th and 8th verses and you will see David occupied in
   prayer, and there, too, he succeeded and prospered abundantly because
   in prayer he waited on the Lord. The very essence of prayer is to get
   the ear of God. You might as well whistle as pray, unless you pray in
   spirit and in truth--and the very spirit and truth of prayer must lie
   in communion with God Himself. If you have been praying after a fashion
   and you have not gained that which you prayed for, surely you have not
   yet reached the ear of God! Get into the secret place. Go close to your
   Lord and wait upon Him in very deed--then you shall have great courage
   in prayer, renew your strength and come back victorious.

   Next, David had been enveloped in darkness. He was afraid that God was
   about to forsake him. He had lost the light of Jehovah's Countenance. I
   think I hear one say, "What am I to do in such a case?" Wait on the
   Lord! If He does not smile, still wait on Him. The smile of His face is
   delightful, but if you lose it, hide under the shadow of His wings!
   When He does not smile, He still loves. "Though He slay me," said Job,
   "yet will I trust in Him." Even when He seems an angry God, throw
   yourself at His feet! Let nothing drive you away from Him. If He lifts
   His sword to strike you, the further off, the heavier the blow will
   fall. Run close in, dear child, if your Father is going to whip you!
   Run close in, then He cannot strike hard.

   Draw very near to your Father's heart. Lay hold on His strength and put
   Him against Himself, as it were, pleading His love against His wrath
   and saying, "You have sworn that You will not be angry with me, nor
   rebuke me, therefore deal tenderly with Your child." If any walk in
   darkness and see no light, let him still trust and wait on the Lord. In
   the next sense we find David forsaken by everybody. Father and mother
   had left him--still he waits upon the Lord and the Lord takes him up.
   Now that you are quite alone, dear widow, and the husband of your love
   is gone, wait on the Lord! Now that the children, one by one, have been
   carried to the silent tomb, wait on the Lord and He will be better to
   you than 10 sons!

   Now, young man, you are drifting about London without a helper--wait on
   the Lord and He will direct your ways. Yes, all of you who, either from
   persecution or bereavement, have come to be alone, remember the Lord
   sets the solitary

   in families and makes them families like a flock. Wait upon Him and all
   will be well. Next we find David in a difficult road, so that he prays,
   "Teach me Your ways, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of my
   enemies." But waiting on the Lord met the case exactly. Whenever you
   cannot tell what to do, wait upon the Lord. When the road turns this
   way and that and you know not which is right, kneel down and pray--you
   will know which way to go when you rise from your knees, or if you do
   not, kneel down again. The directing post is best seen when we are in
   prayer. The oracle shall answer to you out of the excellent majesty
   when you have resigned your will and believingly sought directions from
   the Most High.

   To conclude, we find, next, that David had been slandered by His
   enemies--"False witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe
   out cruelty." What then? Wait upon the Lord! "Oh, but I must answer
   them." Yes, and then you will make bad, worse. Your slanderers will
   forge another lie when you have answered the first. "Oh, but," one says
   "I could bear such a charge if it were true." Ah, but then you ought
   not to bear it! The truth of an ill report ought to grieve you,

   but if it is not true, never mind, let it alone. "Oh, but they say_."
   What do they say? Let them say it! No hurt will

   come of it. Wait upon the Lord!

   They rail at you. Take care not to rail back. Make no reply to howling
   wolves. When dogs bark, let them bark, for it is their nature. They
   will leave off when they have done and so, with all our adversaries,
   they will confute themselves if we will but leave them alone. Our
   strength is to wait upon the Lord! Tell Him about it and leave it with
   Him. Go to the Law? Yes, but get a suit which will not wear out in a
   hurry. Go to the Law and bring upon yourself no end of troubles. In all
   other things except slander--if you want a thing done--do it yourself.
   But there, if you want to be well defended, let others defend you. Dirt
   will rub off when it is dry--be bravely patient.

   Wait upon the Lord, commit everything to Him and He will see you
   through, even to the triumphant end. All that you can do in your own
   justification will only make more mischief. Hands off, there, and leave
   it with the Most High. So we close by repeating our blessed text--"Wait
   on the Lord: be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart:
   wait, I say, on the Lord," May He keep you waiting courageously, for
   Christ's sake. Amen.

God Our Portion and His Word Our Treasure

   (No. 1372)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 2, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You are my portion, O Lord: I have said that I would keep Your Words."
   Psalm 119:57.

   OBSERVE the close connection between privilege and duty. "You are my
   portion, O Lord." This is an unspeakable happiness. "I have said that I
   would keep Your Words"--this is the fitting return for such a blessing.
   Every mercy given us by the Lord brings with it a claim which we ought,
   in gratitude, to recognize. Notice very carefully the order in which
   the privilege and the duty are arranged. The blessing of Grace is first
   and the fruit of gratitude next. The Grace given is the root and the
   resolve is the fruit growing out of it. It is not, "I have said that I
   would keep Your Words, that You may be my portion, O Lord." No, first
   the portion is enjoyed by faith and then the resolution is formed. "You
   are my portion, O Lord, I have You already in present possession.
   Therefore will I, as You shall help me, keep Your Words."

   Duty in order to privilege is the Law--God be thanked that we are not
   under it, for we should never obtain a single blessing thereby! But
   privilege in order to obedience is the Gospel--God grant that we may
   know the fullness of its power to sanctify our souls! The Lord must
   first be your portion before you will be able to keep His Words. How
   can a man keep what he has not received? Without God to be our portion,
   where will the strength come from to accomplish so difficult a duty as
   the keeping of God's Words? See to it, all of you, that you do not
   reverse the order! Do not, as the old proverb says, put the cart before
   the horse.

   Let all things come in their due course and keep due rank, for mischief
   comes of the wrong placing of things. First receive from Divine Grace
   until you can say, "You are my portion, O Lord," and then give forth,
   by daily service, what God has worked within, and say, "I will keep
   Your Words." Each possession not only involves service, but appropriate
   service, even as each plant bears it own flower. The general principle
   which calls for service bears a particular application, for each
   particular Gospel benefit is linked with some special Gospel service.
   The unspeakable gift of having God for our portion has here fastened to
   it the peculiar excellence of keeping God's Words and one objective of
   the present sermon will be to show that this is by no means an
   accidental arrangement, but that a true connection really exists and
   ought to be earnestly acknowledged by every child of God.

   Because you can say, "You are my portion, O Lord," you ought, also, to
   add, "I will keep Your Words." First, this morning, let us consider the
   infinite possession--"You are my portion, O Lord." Secondly, the
   appropriate resolution--"I have said that I would keep Your Words."

   I. Begin, then, where the text begins, with THE INFINITE POSSESSION.
   "You are my portion, O Lord." Here,

   first, notice a clear distinction. The Psalmist declares the Lord to be
   his portion in distinction to the portion of the ungodly. "These often
   have their portion in this life; they increase in riches." The 73rd
   Psalm gives a full and particular description of the ungodly in their
   prime and glory when, "their eyes stand out with fatness" and, "they
   have more than heart can wish."

   But David did not desire to share their short-lived joys. He sought his
   happiness elsewhere, looking to the Creator rather than the creatures
   and to eternity rather than time--

   "What sinners value I resign, Lord, 'tis enough if You are mine." "You
   are my portion, O Lord." It is better to have our good God than all the
   goods in the world! It is better to have God for our All than to have
   all and be without Him. He who possesses God lives at the wellhead and
   drinks from the ever-flowing fountain. He who owns the choicest worldly
   goods, apart from Him, only drinks of the foul leavings which remain in
   the corners of earth's broken cisterns. What is the whole universe
   compared with Him who made it? What are the base pleasures of sin
   compared with the fullness of joy which always dwells at God's right
   hand?

   David says, "You are my portion," evidently in opposition to the future
   portion of the wicked. "Upon the wicked, God shall rain snares, fire
   and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of
   their cup." There is to come to the ungodly a dreadful awakening from
   their dream of security. They shall wake up in another world to find
   that their wealth has vanished, their joys have forever fled and that
   they must forever suffer the loss of all things and remain utterly
   undone. For them an unutterable woe is prepared and wrath like a fierce
   hurricane shall heat upon their guilty souls without end!

   But, "You are my portion, O Lord." For me there shall be no deadly
   snares in life, nor horrible tempest in death. So long as I abide in
   this body, I shall be fed upon Your goodness, and when I shall fall
   asleep and shall afterwards awaken in the likeness of my Redeemer, I
   shall find myself in eternal possession of my God who is my All in All.
   Nor does the distinction end here. David here makes a distinction
   between his true position and the earthly comforts with which the Lord
   had endowed him. He was a king and had many possessions, but none of
   these were his portion! Some of the Lord's people are not the subjects
   of distressing poverty--on the contrary, they are blessed with many
   comforts for which they ought to praise God day and night--but none of
   these things are their peculiar heritage as joint heirs with Jesus.

   Beloved, whatever we have in this world we are bound to turn our eyes
   to God and say, "This is not my portion. You are my portion, O Lord."
   The comforts of this life are like the youth's allowance--they are not
   the estate to which he is the heir--upon which he will enter when the
   fullness of time shall come. Present mercies are a sip by the way, a
   morsel eaten to satisfy the stomach--our full meal will be eaten at the
   Great Supper of the Lamb! We are like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in
   Canaan, dwelling in tents, as strangers and foreigners. The flocks and
   herds which graze around our camp are greatly valued, but still, we
   look not on those things as our portion--Canaan itself is the lot of
   our covenanted inheritance--and nothing else will content us. We look
   for a city which has foundations whose Builder and Maker is

   God!

   Oh, Beloved, take care of ever making common things your portion! If
   riches increase, set not your heart upon them! If God indulges you with
   a healthful and happy family. If you are in a good state of bodily
   health. If your business prospers and if the Lord pours out for you
   temporal mercies from a full horn, yet never make these things your
   idols! Live above them and say, "I cannot be put off with these. You
   are my portion, O God." I think David carried this distinction right
   into eternity.

   Some think of Heaven as this and some as that. Fellowship with
   Believers of all ages is the great desire of some. Others long for
   Paradise as a place of increased knowledge, to know even as they are
   known. And a third rejoice in it chiefly as a haven of rest. There are
   grounds for each of these forms of desire, but concerning Heaven, this
   is the Believer's chief thought--that he will be with God, and that God
   will be forever his joy and bliss! No sins will hide the brightness of
   Jehovah's Glory from our eyes! No doubts will disturb the deep calm of
   our enjoyment of Jehovah's love when once we fully enter upon our
   portion. We shall be forever with the Lord and nothing more or better
   can be imagined!

   God is our Heaven! Whom have I in Heaven but You? Draw, then, a clear
   distinction between the things that are seen, which are not your
   portion, and the things which are not seen, which are your true
   heritage. Between the temporal and fleeting joys which amuse us by the
   way and the abiding and eternal felicity which will satisfy us at the
   end. Allow nothing to rival the chief good in your judgment or your
   affections, but cry evermore, "O God, You are my God; early will I seek
   You."

   Notice, next, the positive claim--"You are my portion, O Lord." He
   deliberately declares this in the silence of his soul. As for the
   ungodly, they are boasting of their prosperity. They are girding
   themselves with pride as with a golden chain. But I dare not seek my
   joy in such matters, "You are my portion, O Lord." To get into a corner
   quietly. To commune with your heart and be still. And then to find your
   soul reveling in the wealth which she finds in her God--this is true
   happiness! Let worldlings babble on as they may and let the trumpet of
   fame sound out its loudest blasts for her darlings--we will not envy
   her rich men or her great men so long as in the deep of our spirit we
   can feel that the Eternal, Himself, has declared, "I will be their
   God."

   Ours is the best portion by far! Whether we have little or much, our
   hereafter is our true treasure, for then shall we enjoy our God to the
   full. These storerooms and barns, banks and iron safes cannot hold our
   portion--behold our treasure is secured where neither moth nor rust
   does corrupt, neither do thieves break through and steal. It is worthy
   of observation that this clear claim which David sets up is not merely
   felt in his own heart, but it is uttered in the most

   solemn place, even in the Presence of God. He addresses himself to the
   all-seeing, heart-searching God and cries, "You are my portion, O
   Lord." Though I stand before You, great God, even before You who can
   read me through and through, yet I dare make my claim--You know all
   things and You know that I do choose You to be my All in All.

   Though I gaze upon Your splendor, which bids angels veil their faces
   because of its excess of Glory, yet I call that splendor mine! However
   great You are, I adore with trembling, but yet my faith calls Your
   greatness mine. You are my portion! Nothing less than Your own Self, O
   infinitely glorious, Omnipotent, thrice-holy Jehovah! My soul does not
   bound her humble claim, nor rest content with a part of You, but You,
   Father, Son and Holy Spirit--You one God-- and You, Yourself, are my
   portion!

   Do you see how fully assured of his interest in Divine Love a man must
   be if He dares to speak thus in the Presence of the infinite Majesty
   and to challenge the Divine judgment upon his claim? You see he speaks
   in the present tense. There are a great many whose religion lies in,
   "shall be," hope and trust, but David's faith lay in the present tense.
   "You are my portion, O Lord." There are some things which I have not
   received as yet, but I have already laid hold upon my God. Many things
   I press forward to obtain, for I have aspirations which are, as yet,
   unfulfilled, and spiritual ambitions not yet satisfied, but You are
   even now my God, despite my infirmities and shortcomings. Yes, even
   today, my God, You are mine.

   At this hour, "My Beloved is mine, and I am His." I know whom I have
   believed. I know that He has given Himself to me as I have given myself
   to Him. Beyond a doubt, You are, at this very moment, my portion, O
   Lord. May the Lord teach you, Brothers and Sisters, to speak in the
   same confident manner. If true Believers, you have a right to speak so
   because you simply declare a fact. Do not be satisfied to leave such a
   matter in question--aim at positive certainty. Pray the Lord to give
   you the full assurance of faith that you may always unwaveringly say,
   "You are my portion, O Lord."

   Now let us linger for a few moments while we muse upon the portion,
   itself, a subject which it might require many an hour to consider
   fully. The text contains an intelligent description of this
   portion--"You are my portion, O Lord." The Psalmist at once mentions
   the very heart and center of his spiritual wealth--"You are my portion,
   O Lord." What a boundless portion! Parochial authorities beat the
   bounds of the parish and great men make surveys of their estates, but
   none can beat the bounds or make a full survey of this inheritance of
   the saints! A man takes stock in trade, or sits down to balance his
   accounts, but there is no taking stock here--towards the infinite God
   there are no calculations--figures are lost and even imagination
   swallowed up!

   Our inheritance surpasses that of all the men of the world put
   together! Yes, and apart from having something of the like, even angels
   could not vie with us! Heaven itself is not so vast a treasure as the
   God of Heaven! How ought we to prize an inheritance which knows no
   boundary! Indeed, Brothers and Sisters, we require something
   boundless--our soul pines for the infinite! I appeal to those of you
   who have been favored in Divine Providence with prosperity beyond what
   you expected. Do you feel that it fills your soul? You are content that
   God should give you what He wills, but do you find satisfaction in
   earthly property?

   What if your children are a comfort to you and your house is filled
   with all manner of provisions and friendly neighbors speak well of you?
   Can you find perfect rest in these things? Do they yield you inward,
   heart-filling joy? I know they cannot! If you were to be as highly
   favored as Solomon, himself, who beyond all men enjoyed this present
   world, yet would you have to come to Solomon's own conclusion, "Vanity
   of vanities, all is vanity." For a regenerate man, this life is like a
   bird within a shell just wakened into life. However comfortable the
   shell may be for him, in its way and after its fashion, yet as life
   becomes vigorous, he needs more space. He needs wing room, he needs to
   get out of his prison and roam at large!

   The things which are seen are a prison to the soul--our spirit needs
   more air, more space in which to breathe. When a man can truly say, "My
   God, You are mine," he has touched the confines of the infinite and he
   has reached the Ultima Thule of his spirit, where he may cast anchor
   and no more tempt the troubled sea of desire. When we reach God, our
   soul is at peace, but not till then--for then the immortal soul has
   gained the immortal God and eternal destiny is sealed with happiness by
   eternal love! And while this inheritance is boundless, how abiding it
   is! A man who has the Lord for his portion has a freehold for eternity!
   His lease will never run out and there will need no renewal of lives,
   for there is one life on which our tenure hangs and that is
   everlasting! "Because I live, you shall live, also."

   He that gets God has an entailed estate. He has in Him a Friend who
   cannot change, who cannot fail, who cannot cease to be, nor cease to be
   the source of blessedness to those who possess Him. Of this portion
   time cannot deprive us, nor death rob us, nor judgment deprive us, nor
   eternity bereave us. "This God is our God forever and ever." Ah, you
   worldlings, all your goods shall wither like Jonah's gourd, but our God
   shall be our shield and our exceedingly great reward, world without
   end! As the Lord is an abiding portion, so is He an appropriate portion
   in every way suitable to content the soul.

   Man was made in the image of God, and nothing will satisfy man but God,
   in whose image he was made. Manna was fit food for man and God Himself
   is fit sustenance for the man of God. Only in the Lord can the mind and
   heart find that which all their faculties require for their development
   and perfection. When renewed by Grace, our powers are adapted to
   receive God and to rejoice in Him and, therefore, a full possession of
   God is the craving of the heart. In God there is food for memory which
   looks upon the past and for hope which gazes into the future. There is
   food for the judgment, which weighs, for the will, which decides--for
   the affections, which clasp and for the imagination, which creates.

   There is no power of humanity which is properly a part of God-made man
   which does not find its due sphere and place in God. How well my
   portion suits me! Adam was not more at home in Paradise than I am in my
   God. My soul, by Grace, is brought into a place of sweet content and
   delights herself in the abundance of peace. This portion is to the
   fullest degree, satisfying. Nothing else will ever end the awful hunger
   of the soul of man, which, like the grave, forever yawns for more. But
   the infinite God fills the heart and he who has the Lord for his
   portion has all that he can desire--

   "All my capacious powers can wish In You does richly meet."

   You may sit down and imagine all that you could have wished--and then
   if you rightly view your God--you will see that He surpasses all your
   desires. Never, even in eternity, will you be able to conceive of a joy
   beyond your God, a bliss surpassing Himself!

   Next, dear Brothers and Sisters, the Lord is an elevating portion. A
   man is gradually changed into the image of that which he loves. He who
   has his portion in this world grows worldly. When a man gives himself
   to any pursuit he, first of all molds it, and then it molds him. We say
   a man rides a hobby, but after a while the hobby rides the man. You
   will find it so. Now, if a man seeks his wealth in the things of this
   life and covets gold, he will become metallic, hard, and unfeeling. He
   who lives to increase his land soon becomes of the earth, earthy. To
   pursue carnal things will degrade a man, cramp his mind and hold him in
   captivity to base materialism. He that loves to hoard that he may
   gratify his covetousness by counting over his stores--what a wretched
   creature he becomes!

   Better, by far, to be a poor squirrel who, in due time, enjoys the
   little store of nuts and acorns! The worldling is little better than
   the mole who burrows through the earth and never looks upon the sun.
   Earth, earth, earth--nothing but earth does the carnal heart care
   for--its faculties are all pressed downward and forced to become
   adapted for its groveling sphere. Nothing is more debasing than to live
   for self and, the more a selfish man has, the more base-hearted he
   becomes.

   But if our portion is the Lord, our delight in Him raises our thoughts
   and purifies our emotions. Covetousness, selfishness, worldliness all
   vanish when God is All in All to us. If God is ours, we seek to be like
   He is--we become followers of God as dear children. "He that has this
   hope in him purifies himself." He who is possessed of the light is
   filled with light--He who has God is filled with God. The Holy Spirit
   transforms us until, at last, He makes us to be qualified to dwell with
   Him forever. Only one more thought on this portion, although many are
   crowding upon my mind. If God is my portion, then my portion is all of
   Grace, for no one can merit God. The idea is utterly ridiculous, if not
   profane. No human excellence could merit Deity. If, then, the Lord is
   my portion, let my song always be of that rich, free, sovereign,
   boundless Grace which is given to me who deserves Hell, but obtains
   Heaven!

   I want to call your attention, once more, to this infinite possession,
   or rather to the seasonable utterance of David concerning it, for it is
   very noteworthy that this holy claim has generally been made by godly
   men at peculiar times. Did you ever notice the parallel passages? Truly
   the Lord is His people's God at all times, but His people rejoice most
   in the possession of Him when they have most trouble. In the particular
   instance before us I find in the 51st verse, "The proud have had me
   greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from Your Law." And in the
   61st verse--"The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
   forgotten Your Law."

   David appears to have been between two fires--derided by the proud and
   robbed by the oppressor--and it is in the middle of this double trouble
   that he puts in his claim, "You are my portion, O Lord." Perhaps the
   robbers helped him to think more of that treasure which no thief can
   steal. Perhaps the derision of the proud made him remember the kindly
   condescension of the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, who
   deigned to be his portion. Look at another instance, where the same
   language is used, namely, in Psalm 16:5, and you will find the Psalmist
   declares, "The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: You
   maintain my lot. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my
   flesh, also, shall rest in hope. For You will not leave my soul in
   Hell; neither will You suffer your Holy One to see corruption."

   So far as this language is that of David, you see that he claims God
   for his portion in the prospect of death and the grave. How good it is
   to have a living hope in dying moments, to be full of light when
   peering into the darkness of the grave! When death is taking away
   everything else, then does the Christian cling to the portion which can
   never be touched by Death's bony fingers. Read, again, in the 73rd
   Psalm, at the 26th verse. There Asaph claims God as his portion. But
   you know the Psalm is all about the trouble of mind which he felt while
   he fretted over his own affliction and contrasted it with the
   prosperity of the wicked.

   One more instance. In Lamentations 3:24, Jeremiah says, "The Lord is my
   portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in Him." But that is said
   in connection with a long roll of sorrows concerning which the Prophet
   had said, "O that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of
   tears." Beloved, learn this lesson--if in Scripture you find God
   claimed as the portion of His saints when under different forms of
   trial, then when you are in deep affliction and when you come near to
   die, you, also, may find the strength of your heart and the sustenance
   of your courage in this same blessed fact that the Lord is your
   portion.

   II. Secondly, let us consider THE APPROPRIATE RESOLUTION--"I have said
   that I would keep Your Words." Here notice the preface, "I have said."
   Why did he not put it, "You are my portion, O Lord; I will keep Your
   Words"? No, he writes "I have said it," which means deliberation. He
   had thought over his happiness in having such a portion. What then? His
   thoughts began to stir within him and to devise a fit expression for
   his gratitude and he, at last, said, "I will keep Your Words."

   It was no hasty thought but a determined resolve. I suppose he also
   means that he had given a distinct pledge. He had opened his mouth to
   the Lord and could not go back. "I have said"--to my God, to myself, to
   my fellow men--"I have said I will keep Your Words." It signifies,
   also, an adherence to what had been said--I have said it and that is
   the end of all questions about it. Do not distress me any more, the die
   is cast. I have said it, and--

   "High Heaven, that heard the solemn vow,

   That vow renewed shall daily hear:

   Till in life's latest hour I bow,

   And bless in death a bond so dear." I have said it, my God, and I will
   not unsay it. What I have written I have written. Others have heard me
   say it. I have said it in the presence of a cloud of witnesses--men and
   angels looking on. I have said it and so let it stand in time and in
   eternity.

   It is time that we investigated the link between the portion possessed
   and the resolution made. It is not very difficult to discover. God is
   best known to us by His Words. His works reveal Him by a reflected
   light as the moon, but His Words display Him by a direct light as a
   very sun of light to us. How do I know God except by His Words? The God
   of Revelation is the Christian's God. Philosophers, nowadays, worship a
   god of their own imagination--they construct a god out of their own
   consciousness and a very pretty god he is, indeed! But the God of the
   Christian is the God who has spoken and whose Words are preserved here,
   in THE BOOK. The God of the Inspired Word is our God and because this
   God is our portion and we know Him by His Words, therefore have we said
   we will keep His Words.

   I want you to notice that there always seems to have been a connection
   between the possession of the portion and the keeping of the Words of
   God. When God said to Abraham, "Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and
   your exceedingly great reward," (Gen. 15:1), a little further down, in
   the 6th verse, we read, "And he believed in the Lord; and He counted it
   to him for righteousness." First he receives God to be his own--"I am
   Your shield"--and then he keeps God's Word, for he believes it. How did
   he know that God was his shield except through the Word which God had
   spoken to him?

   Notice in the first verse, "After these things the Word of the Lord
   came unto Abram," and again in the 4th verse, "And, behold, the Word of
   the Lord came unto him." He believed--this was Abraham's way of keeping
   the Words of the Lord and it is worthy of our imitation. Oh for Grace
   to believe every Word that God speaks and to never start aside unto
   unbelief on any pretense whatever, for every Word of the Lord is sure
   and abides true forever! By keeping God's Words we fulfill the type of
   Israel in the wilderness.

   Do you not remember the story of the manna, which is contained in the
   16th of Exodus? Now, the manna is so named, according to Rabbi Kimchi,
   because the people saw in it their "portion." Our version reads, "They
   said, It is manna"-- for they were not sure what it was, but according
   to the rabbi, they said, "It is a portion: for they knew not what it
   was." Men did eat angels' food in the wilderness! They realized, there,
   that, "man shall not live by bread alone, but by every Word that
   proceeds out of the mouth of God." Their feeding on manna was the type
   of the Lord being our portion! But what then? They ate the manna, but
   did they keep any part of it?

   Assuredly they did! Look at the 32nd verse, "This is the thing which
   the Lord commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations;
   that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
   when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. And Moses said unto
   Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up
   before the Lord, to be kept for your generations." God Himself is my
   manna, or portion and, therefore, I will treasure Him up as He is
   revealed in His Word, which is the golden pot in which the heavenly
   food is preserved. Brothers and Sisters, let us keep the Divine Word in
   the very secrets of our heart as in a golden pot, saying with the
   Psalmist, "Your Word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin
   against You."

   Another beautiful type of the exaltation which the Believer gets when
   he can practically realize our text will be found in Numbers 18:20,
   "And the Lord spoke unto Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in the
   land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am Your part and
   your inheritance among the children of Israel." See, Beloved, we take
   our share with the high priest, for he had God to be his only portion.
   Was it not a better portion than all the rest put together? Happy are
   the people whom the Lord Jesus has made to be priests and to whom He
   has given the priest's portion, namely, Himself!

   But what is our duty if this is the case? We must note how the priests
   of the tribe of Levi behaved and imitate them. We read in Deuteronomy
   33:9--"Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him;
   neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: or
   they have observed Your Word, and kept Your Covenant." Their heritage
   was the Lord and they kept His Words, for the priest's lips should keep
   knowledge. They lived upon the meat of the Lord's house and they were
   bound carefully to keep His ordinances. If you are priests unto God it
   falls unto you, likewise, that as God is the lot of your inheritance
   and your portion, your daily business is, like the tribe of Levi, to
   observe the Word of God and keep His Covenant.

   Moreover, the Words of God are our title-deeds to our portion. Men
   despise them and so might a stranger pour contempt upon old deeds
   relating to property in which he has no concern. "What is the good of
   those old parchments?" says the ignorant man when he sees legal
   documents. "What is the good of the old Book?" cry others even more
   ignorant! Ah, we know their value--those to whom those title-deeds
   secure an inheritance prize them exceedingly! Whenever you hear people
   talking about Bibliolatry and finding fault with us for believing in
   verbal Inspiration, you will find that they set small store by Covenant
   treasures. And, what is more, you will soon discover that they tamper
   with our Divine charter in order to rob us of the choice Truths of the
   Gospel--and that the top and bottom of their meddling with the Divine
   Words of Inspiration is a design to take away their portion from the
   people of God.

   Leave them alone and you will soon see them tearing away one privilege
   after another and making great havoc with our comforts. Therefore,
   warned by what we have seen them do, we have said, "I will keep Your
   Words," for we shall not, otherwise, be able to keep God for our
   portion. If we let even the jots and tittles go, we may soon discover a
   flaw in our title and we cannot afford to do that! Our possession is
   too precious for us to tamper with the securities by which we hold it.
   "You are my portion, O Lord; I have said that I would keep Your Words."

   Now, very briefly, what is this work of keeping God's Words? I pray
   God, the Holy Spirit, to help us to know it by practically carrying it
   out every day of our lives. First, then, there is a WORD which above
   all is to be kept, enshrined in the heart and obeyed in the life. "In
   the beginning was the Word." That very name, "the Word," given to
   Christ, puts the highest honor upon every other Word of Revelation.
   Beware of trifling or being negligent towards any Word of the

   Lord, since Jesus Christ is the chief and sum of the Words of God. Keep
   Him, hold Him, abide in Him, continue in Him, never let Him go. "I have
   said that I would keep Your Words"--this means the Words of the Gospel.

   This we will accept by sincere and simple faith. The Gospel of Free
   Grace, of Substitution, of Atonement by blood, of Justification by
   Faith--this we will hold by faith right steadfastly so long as we
   breathe. All our hope hangs there and, therefore, there we will abide,
   neither shall any seduce us from it. "I have said that I would keep
   Your Words"-- that is, "I will believe Your doctrines." When I cannot
   comprehend the great mysteries I will still believe them. Though others
   dispute, I will believe! Despite the insinuations of crafty men, I will
   hold to the doctrines of Grace intensely-- believing them as long as
   Reason holds her Throne.

   What I see to be in God's Word I will not dare to doubt or neglect. The
   Doctrines of Grace are the backbone of the Christian life. Keep to them
   for your comfort and you shall never be ashamed of them. If you
   willingly tamper with any one of the doctrines, there is no knowing
   where you will drift. Cast out more anchors--never let the vessel
   drift. "I have said that I would keep Your Words," that is, Your Words
   of precept. What You bid me do, I will delight to do. I will not merely
   rejoice in the doctrines, but in the commands, also, and I will ask for
   Grace to obey them all. I will keep Your ordinances, too, for they are
   a part of Your Word and are to be kept as they were delivered, without
   addition or diminution.

   I will not say, "This is non-essential, and this is unimportant," but,
   "I have said that I would keep Your Words and keep them I will, through
   Your Grace, in every particular. I will do what You bid me, as you bid
   me, when You bid me." So much evil has grown out of slight departures
   from Scripture that Christian men ought to be very scrupulous and
   carefully observe every ordinance as it is set forth in the Word of
   God. "I have said that I would keep Your Words," that is, I will keep
   Your promises in my heart to comfort me. I will keep them in my faith,
   expecting their fulfillment. I will keep them in my mind for daily use
   and solace. And on my tongue, that I may encourage others.

   Since the Lord keeps His promises by fulfilling them, we ought to keep
   them by remembering them. "I have said that I will keep Your Words,"
   and this especially includes the Word which the Lord has pledged in His
   Covenant. I will rejoice to think that You have, by deed of gift, made
   Yourself over to me! Now will I keep in mind Your Word and oath pledged
   to the Lord Jesus on my behalf! Now will I rejoice in the blood which
   ratified the Covenant and in the Covenant Word itself. See what an
   ocean of room I have in my topic and yet I have merely coasted and
   skirted the shore! What boundless sailing room there would be if we
   were to launch out into the deep!

   My Brothers and Sisters, pray for Grace to keep every Word of God with
   all your hearts! Do not believe, as some do, that it does not matter
   what is truth or what is falsehood. It makes all the difference
   conceivable! God's Word against man's word any day in the week! I fear
   that the ancient power of Protestantism has evaporated through the
   influence of those who hold loose views upon Inspiration and who are
   busy manufacturing new gospels instead of preaching the old one which
   is already in the Word. The great thinkers may propound what they
   choose and the learned men of this age may invent what doctrines they
   like, but one thing I know--they will not cause those who have God for
   their portion to give up His Words!

   For these 24 years you have found me here preaching the Words of God
   and you will find me here, still, if I live another 24 years. By His
   Grace I am incapable of moving one inch away from the old faith! One
   thing I know, namely, the Gospel of Substitution! And one thing I do,
   namely, preach it! I have determined to know nothing among you save
   Jesus Christ and Him Crucified! When we get through all the Words of
   God we will begin them again--but we shall still keep to the old Book
   and its old, old story! The children shall go on eating their daily
   bread and, not even for novelty's sake, will we give them the stones of
   modern thought!

   Now, to conclude. This blessed subject very painfully suggests to me a
   solemn contrast. Will you, at your leisure, read another portion which
   the Lord reserves for certain persons? God grant we may never inherit
   it! It is the portion for hypocrites. In Matthew 24:50, our Lord speaks
   very strongly of some and I will tell you the reason why He deals so
   terribly with them. He says of some that, "the Lord of that servant
   shall come in a day when he looks not for Him and in an hour that he is
   not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion
   with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

   Do you know what this man had done? He had not kept Christ's Word! His
   Master had said that He would come, and he did not keep the word about
   His second coming, nor believe in it at all, but, according to the 48th
   verse, he said,

   "My Lord delays His coming." And then he began to act upon it, to smite
   his fellow servants and to eat and drink and to be drunk, so that, not
   keeping what some think a very small matter--the Word concerning the
   future coming of Christ--he was found to be a hypocrite and had his
   portion appointed with false-hearted pretenders.

   The same passage, with a little variation, comes in Luke 12:46, where
   the unfaithful servant is said to have his "portion with unbelievers,"
   which is equally to be dreaded. The threat seems most to apply to
   ministers and teachers of the Word who are unfaithful to the Truth of
   God. The condemned one was not a faithful and wise steward and did not
   bring forth things new and old with which to feed his Master's servants
   and he, also, doubted whether his Master would ever come to call him to
   account. And so he had his portion among unbelievers.

   It will be an awful thing for me and for any minister here, or any
   other teacher of the people, if we do not bring forth things new and
   old out of the Gospel to give the saints their portion of meat in due
   season. If we keep from the Lord's servants, their portion, we shall be
   kept without our portion, or rather we shall have it, but it will be a
   portion of the most awful kind! This makes it solemn work for any of
   you who attempt to teach others. God grant that you may give forth a
   good portion! Give out the things that are new, that is the Gospel,
   which is always new--and give out the old things, the antiquities of
   everlasting love and electing Grace--bring them all forth in proportion
   lest you be found, at last, to have been unbelievers.

   We will finish when we duly note one more point, namely this, that if
   you do diligently keep God's Words and if it is the joy of your heart
   to live on them, feed upon them and defend them against all comers, you
   may take this as an evidence that you are one of the Lord's people.
   Poor Job fell back upon that when he was in great distress. And at such
   seasons you may do the same. Job 23:8-10--"Behold, I go forward, but He
   is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive Him: on the left
   hand, where He does work, but I cannot behold Him: He hides Himself on
   the right hand, that I cannot see Him: but He knows the way that I
   take: when He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold."

   And why? "My foot has held His steps, His way have I kept, and not
   declined. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of His lips; I
   have esteemed the Words of His month more than my necessary food," or,
   "my portion," as many translate it. The Words of God were dear to him!
   He felt he had kept them and, therefore, he said, "He knows the way
   that I take: when He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold." If you
   trifle with God's Words you will miss a great evidence of being His
   child!

   Unless you are very strict as to what you believe and what you do.
   Unless you make the Word of God to be the chart by which you steer your
   course when you come into stormy waters and the devil begins to tempt
   you and the world laughs at you, you will not be able to fall back upon
   the evidence which Job could so honestly quote in his own favor. And
   neither will you have the sweet confidence that when the Lord has tried
   you, He will bring you forth as gold. The Lord bless you, for Christ's
   sake. Amen.

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 9, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "When a few years are come, then I shall go the way from where I shall
   not return." Job 16:22.

   THE season of the year may well remind us of our mortality. The corn,
   which a few weeks ago was green and vigorous, has now, for the most
   part, yielded to the sickle. Many flowers which adorned our gardens
   have exchanged their bloom for ripening seed. The year has commenced to
   die--its glory and prime have gone. The dews of evening are heavy and
   the mists linger in the morning, for the summer heat is declining. The
   leaves are just upon the turn and the fall of the year is close at
   hand. These are Creation's warnings, reminding us that the Lord has set
   a harvest for us and that we all fade as a leaf.

   Nature has her prophets as well as Revelation and Autumn in his rugged
   garb is one of them. He has now come to us with this solemn message,
   "The harvest is passed and the summer is ended; prepare to meet your
   God!" In addition to the warnings of Nature, we have lately been
   saluted by voices from Divine Providence. Loud calls have come to us,
   of late, from almost every part of our Church work. Death is come up
   into our windows and is entered into our palaces. Death, who seldom
   comes into the Orphanage, has forced his cruel hand into our nest of
   young ones and has taken from there the widow's child.

   A funeral has left our gates and little boys have gathered around a
   grave to see one like themselves laid in the silent earth. Death has
   set his axe, also, against the College and has cut down one of our
   growing trees, upon which there were abundant tokens of future
   fruitfulness. Our brother Winter had sharpened his sword for the
   conflict and was just about to leave us for actual service, when, in a
   few days his strength departed and he was not. Death has come, also,
   among the ministers who were once our students and were our crown of
   rejoicing as laborers for the Lord.

   One of the ablest and best of them has put a whole town in mourning,
   for he has been taken Home at an early age, when he had already become
   foremost for usefulness. Middlesborough mourns our brother Priter with
   no common sorrow. Beyond all this, almost every day we have reports of
   this one and that one in the membership and in the congregation going
   home. These dying ones are God's voices to us and I should be unworthy
   of addressing you if I did not, first, hear them in the silence of my
   own soul and then endeavor to interpret them for you.

   All these things bring to my mind the language of our text, "When a few
   years are come, then I shall go the way from where I shall not return."
   Will they not have the same effect upon you? He that has ears to hear
   let him hear! My subject is one upon which it would be quite impossible
   to say anything new, since death is neither novel nor uncommon, for
   from the days of Abel until now it has honeycombed the earth with
   graves. Nor need I seek out elegancies of speech, for these would be
   incongruous with such a theme.

   When we speak of eternal things, the less attempt we make at fluent
   language the better--such solemn topics are most powerful when suffered
   to have their own natural voice and speak for themselves. Begone all
   trifling thoughts! Let the mind put off all joyous apparel and wear,
   awhile, the shroud. Instead of rising with gaiety, let the imagination
   bow with solemnity, for now we have to do with the dying chamber, the
   grave and the Judgment Throne. The blast of the archangel's trumpet is
   ringing in our ears and we are to anticipate the day in which we shall
   receive our final sentence from the Judge of all the earth!

   Solemnity, therefore, should possess our minds. Let us shut out the
   present world and become familiar with the world to come. Very simple
   and self-evident will be the considerations which I shall set before
   you. But if you are already moved to a solemn frame of mind, you will
   be prepared to derive profit from them. May God the Holy Spirit bless
   the Word and by its means prepare us for our last day of which the text
   speaks so plainly.

   First, then, let us realize our inevitable journey--"I shall go the way
   from where I shall not return." Secondly, let us contemplate its
   nearness--"When a few years are come." Thirdly, let us consider our
   non-return from the journey-- "From where I shall not return." And then
   we shall close, in the fourth place, by enquiring where we are going.
   We are going from where we shall not return, but to what place are we
   bound? Is it endless bliss or ceaseless woe?

   I. First, then, let us REALIZE OUR INEVITABLE JOURNEY. I desire that
   these words may be earnestly taken up in a personal manner by each of
   us. The language is in the singular number. "I shall go the way from
   where I shall not return." Let us apply it, each one, to himself. The
   fact that all men are mortal has little power over our minds, for we
   always make a tacit exception and put off the evil day for ourselves.
   We acknowledge ourselves to be mortal, but do not expect to die just
   now. Even the aged look forward to a continuance of life and the
   consumptive dream of possible recovery.

   I will not, therefore, remind you so much of the general truth, but
   place before you the individual, pointed, personal declaration of the
   text. "I." The preacher. You, each one of you looking upon the preacher
   now--"I shall go the way from where I shall not return." As surely as
   you live, you will die! It may help you to realize this fact if I ask
   you to accompany me, first of all, into the chamber of a dying man. As
   you look upon him I entreat you to remember that you, yourself, will
   lie there in the same condition before long.

   It is sometimes my duty--and a very hard and painful task it is--to
   communicate to sick and dying persons the fact that it is not possible
   that they should recover. One beats about the bush a little, but at
   last you come with tenderness to the sad point and say, "Friend, do you
   know that there is very little hope, if any, that you can recover? In
   fact, it is as nearly certain as a thing can be that you must die. Your
   physicians are compelled to believe that your end is near." The news is
   taken in different ways--sometimes it is not believed. At other times
   it occasions a thrill of pain which wounds your heart and cuts your
   soul to the quick.

   In many cases it is received with calm, patient resignation, but
   frequently I have the tidings accepted with joy and the man of God has
   said, "It is a thing I have longed for! Now shall I be rid of this
   weary pain and see the face of Him whom my soul loves." Yet it is a
   solemn business. Take it how you may--solemn to those who tell the news
   and more solemn, still, to those who hear it. Look, then, at the poor
   dying man wasting away before your eyes. He must now go to his long
   home. He must go. No one can delay his departure. The chariot is at the
   door. If he could offer all the gold of the Indies he could not bribe
   inexorable Death. No, he may be master of a mint of treasure, but it
   cannot buy him an hour's life. His time is come and he must go.

   His beloved wife would gladly detain him, but he must be torn from her
   embrace. His children weep, but he must not stay to dry their tears. A
   kind friend would almost make an exchange and die in his place, but
   there can be no proxies here. There is no discharge in this war. It is
   appointed unto all men once to die and die he must. The hour is come!
   His pulse is slow! His eyes are glazing! Look at him! Do you not feel
   for a man in such solemn circumstances? There must you, also, lie--and
   thus must you, also, depart. I ask you to place yourself in his place
   and try, this morning, to feel as he must feel, seeing it is absolutely
   certain that to such a condition you, also, must come, unless, indeed,
   the Lord should descend from Heaven with a shout, of which we know so
   little as to when it may be.

   How the individuality of a man comes out in his dying hour! What an
   important being he becomes! You think more of that one man, while
   dying, than of all the thousands of the living who parade our streets.
   No matter who he is, he is dying and we tread softly. Poor man, he must
   now die and die alone. And now how important his character becomes! His
   life, his own life, is now being put into the balance and he is looking
   back upon it. It is the most important thing in the universe to him.
   His outward circumstances are now a small matter--his life is the main
   consideration. Was he righteous or wicked? Did he fear God or despise
   Him?

   Whether he was rich or poor, his rank and station are subjects of
   indifference. The hangings of the bed are of very small account--the
   man who lies there is the only concern. Whether he is now waited upon
   by the best physician, hired by the costliest fee, or whether he lies
   in the hospital tended by gentle charity, it is the man, himself, the
   man's soul, the man's personal character that is now seen in all its
   grandeur, demanding his whole thought. Whether he is a peer or peasant,
   king or serf, it is much the same to each man to die. Differences on
   the dying bed arise out of character and not out of rank.

   Now he has to face, for himself, the great things of eternity and
   cannot leave them to another. He used to hear about eternity as one of
   the mass, but now he has to experience it alone--by himself. Into the
   cold river his own feet must descend, the cool waves must chill his
   blood, death must close his eyes and into the unknown future he must
   plunge! No brother's hand can grasp his when he has quit the body. No
   fellow mortal can fly side by side with him through the unknown tracks.
   How vividly the individuality of the man comes out and the need of a
   personal interest in the great salvation!

   How much it is to be desired that it could be made quite as plain under
   happier circumstances. And yet how clear it is that each one of us must
   believe in the Savior for himself. We must each serve God personally
   and each have a good hope through Divine Grace worked in his own soul.
   Will men never think of this till they come to die? And now that candle
   burning in the sick man's chamber sheds a strange light upon his past
   life. Some said he was fortunate, but if he was sinful, where is his
   good fortune? Men said he was a poor unsuccessful muddler. But he will
   be worth as much, in a short time, as if he had been the most prudent
   and had prospered in the world--for here all men are the same--"Naked
   came I out of my mother's womb and naked must I return there."

   So must it be. In death the financial element looks contemptible and
   the moral and the spiritual come to be most esteemed. How did he live?
   What were his thoughts? What was his heart towards God? Did he repent
   of sin? Does he still repent? Does he believe in Jesus? Is he resting
   upon the finished work of Christ, or not? He, perhaps, failed to ask
   himself some of those questions a little while ago, but now, if he is
   in his sober senses, he is compelled to put his soul through its paces.
   How does his heart answer when cross-examined? Now he must reach down
   the accounts, the memoranda and the day-book of his life--and he must
   look to what he did and what he was--and what he is.

   Ah me! How will the reckoning end? What will the sum total be? It
   matters little what he was before his fellow men, whose judgments are
   fallible. The question is, what was he before the all-searching eyes of
   the Most High God? Such an account you will have to render. The
   individuality of the man is clear--and the man's character before God.
   And now it is also evident that death tests all things. If you look
   upon this poor dying man you see that he is past the time for pretences
   and shams. You yourself, if you knew but little of him before, feel
   very concerned to know whether the religion he professed was truthful
   or not--whether he was really regenerate or merely dreamed that he was.
   If you wish to answer that question, how much more does that poor dying
   man want to know for himself?

   Here let me tell you that very much of the comfort with which we wrap
   ourselves up in days of health proves to be very sorry stuff when we
   come to die. While you are in good health and strength, you often
   derive a measure of peace of mind from things which will not stand the
   fiery ordeal of an approaching eternity. Some of the best men that ever
   lived have found this out. You may know the name of Mr. Durham, the
   author of a famous book on Solomon's Song, one of the most earnest of
   Scotland's ancient preachers.

   Some days before he died, he seemed to be in some perplexity about his
   future well-being, and said to his friend, Mr. Carstairs, "Dear
   Brother, for all that I have written or preached, there is but one
   Scripture which I can now remember or dare grip unto, now that I am
   hastening to the grave. It is this--'Whoever comes unto Me, I will in
   no wise cast out.' Pray tell me if I dare lay the weight of my
   salvation upon it." Mr. Carstairs justly replied, "Brother, you may
   depend upon it though you had a thousand salvations at hazard."

   You see, it was a plain,, sinner's text that he rested on. Just as Dr.
   Guthrie wanted them to sing a bairn's hymn, so do dying saints need the
   plain elementary doctrines of the Gospel to rest upon. Those fine ideas
   and dainty notions of our nearing perfection and becoming completely
   sanctified, dissolve like the hoar frost in the sun when we come face
   to face with eternity! Those grand excitements, those high enjoyments
   and those deep experiences which lead us to think ourselves to be
   somebodies in the Church of God are of small account in dying moments!
   Men cannot die on stilts! Death finds out the truth of our condition
   and blows away, with his cold breath, a heap of chaff which we thought
   to be good wheat!

   Then a man has to look to the mercy of God, to the blood of the
   Covenant and to the promises of the Gospel--and to cling as a poor
   needy, guilty sinner to free, rich, Sovereign Grace, or else his spirit
   will utterly sink. When life is ebbing, nothing will do but the
   faithful saying, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." I
   have heard children of God speak in their last moments just as seeking
   souls speak. They come to God, again, just as they came at first--and
   they find in Jesus all their hope! Dying men need realities! They need
   a sinner's Savior! They need atonement for guilt, for

   only then can they pass out of the world with hope! Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, follow after that which is solid and real, for nothing else
   will serve your turn when you come to die.

   Keep your eyes on that dying man whom I have tried to picture--he is
   vividly before me now. He must go. There is no alternative. He cannot
   resist the power which now summons him to depart. Willing or unwilling,
   it matters not--he must go. The sheriff's officer has him in his grip
   and he must go. Is he prepared? Pray God he may be! But whether he is
   or not, it makes no difference. He must leave all and take his journey.
   Has he children dependent upon him and a wife who needs his support?
   Their necessities cannot detain him, he must go. Has he made his will,
   or has he left all his business affairs in a tangle? Whichever it is,
   he must go.

   The tide which bears all before it has seized his boat and even now it
   drifts down the stream. That man who must go is yourself--projected
   only a little way further into time! Can you not realize what will
   certainly be the fact? Can you not already hear the ticking of the
   watch at your bed in the silence of your last night? Can you not
   anticipate that mysterious consultation of physicians, when each one
   admits to his colleagues his incompetence to suggest a remedy? It is
   clear that the hour is come--you must go. This must happen to every
   mortal man and woman sitting or standing in this house this morning.
   Will you not lay it to heart?

   Now survey another scene to help you realize your departure. Look no
   longer on the dying, but bend over the dead. It is all over. He has
   breathed his last and he now lies upstairs in a darkened chamber. A
   loving one has stolen in and tremblingly lifted the coffin lid to gaze
   once more upon the dear face and say another adieu--but there can be no
   more of this. The friends have gathered and the mourners must go
   through the streets and bear him to the tomb. That funeral is yours!
   The corpse is borne to the grave and on the road it silently preaches
   to all passersby. Archbishop Leighton one morning was asked by a
   friend, "Have you heard a sermon?" He said, "No, but I met a sermon,
   for I met a dead man carried out to be buried."

   Let every funeral be a discourse to you. Within a short time it will
   happen to each one of us that we must lie within the narrow limits of
   the coffin. And then will come, for us, the opened grave, the lowering
   of our corpse and the gathering of mourners around it. Upon your coffin
   lid and mine the mold shall fall--"Earth to earth, dust to dust and
   ashes to ashes." A green mound, a daisy or two amid the grass, a friend
   to bring a few fading flowers to scatter on our graves. Perhaps a
   head-stone, perhaps not--to this we must all come. "Here he lies" is
   the universal epitaph. On the lap of earth you will lie. There shall I,
   also, lie. Realize it--it is so near, so sure! When a few years shall
   come we shall be with the unnumbered throng!

   Now let your realization go a little further. Can you picture the
   spirit of a man as it leaves the body? I confess my imagination does
   not enable me to picture it, myself, and certainly my words are not
   competent to convey to you what little I can realize in my mind. The
   soul finds itself rid of materialism--how will it feel when it has
   shaken itself loose of its shell of clay? I cannot tell. We all love
   this earthly house of our tabernacle and leave it with reluctance--

   "For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey, This pleasing anxious being
   ever resigned, Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day, Nor cast
   one longing, lingering look behind?" But it does not matter what
   lingering looks we cast, our soul will have done with the body in its
   present fashion and it must, for a while, dwell apart from all
   materialism.

   At once it must come before God! Its state will immediately, after
   death, be known to it beyond a question. In a moment it will know
   beyond all doubt whether it is accepted before God! And beyond all hope
   it will know whether it is reprobate and condemned! That knowledge will
   at once commence its happiness, a happiness which will be increased as
   ages roll on--or that knowledge will at once commence its misery, which
   will deepen evermore! The soul will abide in the disembodied state for
   a while. And then will come the clarion note of the Resurrection
   trumpet and the body shall rise again to be again inhabited by the
   soul.

   What will the meeting be? What will be the sensation of the remarriage
   of mind with matter, of soul with body? We know not. The Resurrection
   is the blessed hope of the Christian, but it is a terrible dread to the
   ungodly. The soul shall never more return to the world's cares, nor to
   the world at all as the world now is, but it shall again inhabit the
   body and stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ to receive the
   verdict from the lips of Him who is appointed Judge of all

   mankind! The Divine verdict is given and the soul must continue its
   journey. Still onward must it go--whether accepted or condemned--onward
   it must go.

   Onward, exulting in a bliss unspeakable like to the Divine, if Christ
   pronounces it blessed! Onward, in a misery unutterable if Christ
   pronounces it "cursed." I do not know whether you are able, in
   imagination, to place yourself in such a condition, but in such a
   condition you will certainly be found before long. You will be stripped
   of this house of clay and so you will die, but you will live again,
   yes, live forever! You will live to be judged, to be justified or to be
   condemned! And then you will live forever in happiness or torment--and
   all this you will know in a short time to come. Thus I have helped you
   as best I could and, I fear, but poorly, to realize the inevitable
   journey.

   II. Now, let us very briefly CONTEMPLATE ITS MEANING. Very soon we
   shall have to start upon our solemn and mysterious pilgrimage. If we
   should fulfill the entire tale of our years, the allotted period of
   human life is but short. The text in the Hebrew speaks of "years of
   number." They are so few that a child may count them. At the
   commencement of life, the view before us looks like an endless avenue,
   but as we advance along the path, the end seems very near and we
   perceive how short our time really is.

   Middle life has but a short view, either backwards or forwards. As for
   some of you, upon whom age is descending, you should be well enough
   aware how short, for certain, your time for lingering here must be.
   Your lease has almost run out! Do you doubt it? What are 70 or 80
   years, if we live so long? But we are further warned by the
   consideration that we cannot safely reckon upon the whole of that brief
   period, for children are carried away and young men are cut down by the
   scythe--and we frequently see the maiden, before she reaches the full
   bloom of her years, carried off with Death as her bridegroom.

   Does not the text say, "a few years"? Read it months, read it days,
   read it hours, read it minutes, for we cannot tell how soon we must set
   sail for the far-off land! In a short time we must join the great
   caravan and cross the desert to a land from where we shall not return.
   Life is so short that we have scarcely begun to live before we are
   called to die! Therefore, dear Brothers and Sisters, if there is
   anything grievous to be borne, we may well bear it cheerfully, for it
   cannot last long. When a few years are come we shall be gone from the
   thorn and the briar which now prick and wound!

   Therefore, if there is any work to be done for Jesus, let us do it at
   once--or else we shall never do it--for when a few years are come we
   shall have gone from where we shall not return! Therefore, if there is
   salvation to be sought, let us seek it, for soon we shall be where
   salvation is no more proclaimed! And if worldly goods are possessed by
   us, let us hold them very loosely, for in a short time we must leave
   them! Let us lay them out for God's Glory, for our stewardship will not
   last long and we shall soon have to give an account! And therefore,
   above all things, we must realize the need of being always prepared to
   die. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, he who is to die next had need be ready.
   Who is he?

   An old man who used to sell goods from house to house had an eccentric
   cry of his own which he was known to utter whenever he sold goods at
   the door. He would cry out aloud, "Who'll be the next? Who'll be the
   next?" One day a funeral passed just as he had given out his usual cry
   and, strange enough, sounded the question--"Who'll be the next?" I may
   ask with solemn emphasis whenever the cemetery's gates are opened and
   the funeral passes through, "Who will be the next? Who will be the
   next?"

   Your hymn says, "Who will be the next to follow Jesus?" But I must ask,
   this morning, "Who will be the next among us to be carried to the
   silent tomb?" To be ready to depart is wisdom. It is the mark of the
   beast that it looks not beyond the present mouthful of grass which it
   crops from the ground--it never thinks of the butcher's knife and the
   shambles. Be not as the brutes which perish, but, being gifted with
   minds, use them to look before you! It is the mark of the fool that he
   never looks before he leaps but is content with present enjoyments
   though they leave him penniless! Be not as the fool, but be prudent and
   look before you and consider your latter end!

   It is the mark of the worldling that he confines his thoughts within
   the narrow range of time. The Christian looks into the everlasting
   future as an immortal being should do. Be not worldlings, lest you
   perish with them! May God make you wise unto salvation! To be prepared
   to die is an immediate duty--will you neglect it? Some imagine that to
   be prepared to die would involve a life of perpetual gloom. If it did
   so, it were well to face it! When a man comes to die and finds himself
   prepared, even if he had endured 50 years of perpetual anguish of heart
   and had denied himself every worldly comfort, he would think himself
   well repaid to have the prospect of a blessed future!

   Heaven at any price is well secured. A good hope through Grace is worth
   a thousand worlds. But it is a mistake to suppose that melancholy
   attends upon fitness to die. Why should it? To be unprepared for death
   and to know that it may come at any moment is a fair reason for
   sadness--but to have that great matter secure must surely be a source
   ofjoy! To be prepared to die is to be prepared to live! To be ready for
   eternity is, in the best sense, to be ready for time. Who so fit to
   live on earth as the man who is fit to live in Heaven? Who has
   brightness of the eyes? Is it not the man who has looked within the
   gate of pearl and seen his place prepared among the blessed?

   Who has lightness of heart? Is it not the man who is unloaded of his
   sin and has found mercy through the blood of Christ? Who can go to his
   bed and sleep in peace and wake with joy--who but the man that is
   reconciled to God by the death of His Son? Who has the best of this
   world as well as the world to come? Is it not he to whom death has now
   become a changed thing, a cherub that has lost its way--no longer
   destruction, but rather development and admission into a higher and
   nobler life? Since readiness for death is peace and happiness and is,
   above measure, necessary in prospect of the eternal state, let us see
   to it at once!

   We are to be gone so soon--let us gird up our loins for our solemn
   journey. There is no time to spare! The end is drawing near. Every
   flying moment is hastening on our last hour. It is high time to awake
   out of sleep and in earnest make ready to meet the Bridegroom who is
   already on His way!

   III. Now, thirdly, I want you to CONSIDER THE FACT THAT WE SHALL NOT
   RETURN--"When a few years are come, then I shall go the way from where
   I shall not return." To the occupations of life--to sow, reap, and mow.
   To the abodes of life--to the store and to the country house. To the
   pleasures of life--the festival and the family--we shall not return. To
   the engagements of the sanctuary, the communion table, the pulpit, or
   the pew--we shall not return. To the chamber of love, to the hearth of
   affection, to the walk of friendship--we shall not return. To hopes,
   fears, joys and pains--we shall not return. To summer's flowers and
   winter's snows we shall not return.

   To our brothers, children, husband, or wife, we shall not return. To
   nothing that is done under the sun shall we return! Soul, unsaved Soul,
   to the land of the Gospel and the Mercy Seat you shall not return! If
   you die unsaved you will not be able to come back to the House of God
   to hear the ministry of reconciliation! You will hear no more
   invitations and expostulations, neither will Jesus be set before you as
   your hope! You will not be able to come back to the Prayer Meeting and
   to the earnest entreaties of a godly mother and other loving
   friends--nor even back to your Bible and to the opportunity of
   searching it that you may find eternal life!

   You will not return to find space for repentance, nor a second
   opportunity for prayer, nor another season for believing in Jesus. It
   shall be said concerning you, "He which is filthy, let him be filthy
   still." Where the tree falls there must it lie. Once pass the barriers
   of life unsaved and you cannot return to a new probation. The die is
   cast. Beloved Christian Friends, we need not wish to return! What is
   there here that should either tempt us to stay in this world or induce
   us to return to it if we could? Still, I could suppose, in a future
   state, some reasons for wishing to return. I can suppose we might have
   it in our hearts, for instance, to wish to undo the mischief which we
   did in life.

   If a dying man should receive mercy in his last moments, one might
   imagine him as desiring to return to earth to tell the glad tidings and
   beseech his family and friends to seek salvation. Who would not wish,
   for once, to plead with his children if he felt that he had neglected
   his duty to them? A man might wish, even if he were in the unquenchable
   flames, to come back to earth or to send a messenger, as the rich man
   did, to tell his brothers and sisters lest they should come into the
   place of torment. Selfishness might wish to be spared the reproaches of
   those we helped to ruin. But you cannot come back or send back to undo
   your ill deeds!

   Therefore seek to mend matters now. Avoid the doing of evil and, as for
   that which is already done, confess it before God and seek to
   administer the antidote by an earnest and godly life. You cannot come
   back to carry out those good resolutions which, as yet, are as unripe
   fruit. Young man, you mean to do good some day, do you not? You have it
   in your heart to lead a grand life. Well, you must do it now, for you
   cannot come hack to revise your conduct. It will not be possible to
   correct and amend it, for death stereotypes all. After death you cannot
   return to develop your promises into performances! Therefore resolve to
   do them now.

   We shall not be able to come back to finish the work we have began. The
   half-built house will never be completed by our labor. We have many
   projects which are but half-developed--we had better proceed with them
   or they will never be completed. If we leave our ships on the stocks,
   we shall not be able to return to launch them. When our lives below are
   at

   an end we have reached the finis of our earthly career. Neither can we
   come back to rectify any mistake we have made in our lifework, or even
   return to look after it, in order to preserve that which was good in
   it.

   I sometimes think if I were in Heaven I could almost wish to visit my
   work at the Tabernacle, to see whether it will abide the test of time
   and prosper when I am gone. Will you keep to the Truth of God? Will you
   hold to the grand old doctrines of the Gospel? Or will this Church,
   like so many others, go astray from the simplicity of its faith and set
   up gaudy services amid false doctrine? I think I should turn over in my
   grave if such a thing could be. God forbid it! But there will be no
   coming back and, therefore, we must build well, rejecting all wood, hay
   and stubble, using nothing but gold, silver and precious stones!

   We must build quickly to get the work done, but fast as we labor we
   must do it surely and honestly and thoroughly, for the fire will try it
   when we are gone. It will be a pity that our work should suffer loss,
   even though we, ourselves, should be saved. We cannot return to save
   the burning mass, nor to rebuild the ruin, but we shall, doubtless, see
   and know what comes of it. "Establish the work of our hands upon us;
   yes, the work of our hands establish it." Therefore, dear Brother, if
   your hands find anything to do, do it at once with all your might. If
   your heart suggests anything that should be done, let it be done at
   once!

   See to the bringing up of your children, the conversion of your
   neighbors, the laying out of your talents for Christ, the consecration
   of your substance, the propagation of the precious Truths of God which
   have been revealed to you. If a good work is to be done, do it! Do it,
   do it at once. The curfew of time is sounding. Your own vesper bell is
   ringing out and these are the words which I set to its music--"What you
   do, do quickly, for when a few years are come, you must go where you
   will not return." Again I say, "He that has ears to hear, let him
   hear!"

   IV. And now, lastly, let us ENQUIRE TO WHERE WE SHALL GO? In some
   respects it happens alike to all, for all go upon the long journey. All
   go to the grave, which is the place of all living. It matters very
   little where our grave shall be--whether beneath a weeping willow or in
   the solemn deeps. The best of all, I think, that can happen to any of
   us is to be laid where we shall quickly mold into the common earth,
   that none may afterwards profane our bones. But if they do, what does
   it matter? We shall know nothing of it and precious in the sight of the
   Lord will our dust be, though it is trod under foot or blown by the
   winds! We shall all die and then we shall all pass into the disembodied
   state.

   But of what character shall my death be and where shall I spend the
   time of waiting? May I urge upon you to ask yourselves this question?
   May I press a second enquiry upon you? If at this very instant you were
   to leave your body, where would your soul be? You may know very
   readily. Where does it delight to be now? I once visited an aged
   Christian woman who said to me when she was near death, "Sir, I do not
   think that God will appoint me my portion with the ungodly, for I could
   never bear their company. I hope I shall be among His people, though I
   am very unworthy, for I never was so happy as when I was with them."

   Yes, you will keep the same company forever! The sheep shall be with
   the sheep and the goats with the goats. Your delight prophesies your
   destiny. What you have chosen here shall be your portion hereafter. The
   scoffer, the drunk, the liar, the unchaste--they shall be your comrades
   in Hell if you were so here. If you love sin, you shall be steeped up
   to the throat in it--and it shall burn around you like liquid fire! If
   you have loved the wages of unrighteousness, you shall receive them in
   full tale, for the wages of sin is death--and Death shall rage about
   you and gnaw you with his undying worm. But if your delights have been
   with your God, you shall dwell with Him! If you have rejoiced in Christ
   Jesus, you shall reign with Him! And if you have loved His people, you
   shall abide with them forever!

   Your disembodied state shall be spent either with Christ and His people
   or with sin and sinners. If not in Paradise with Jesus, you know where
   you must lie. Did not our Lord, Himself, tell us of the great gulf
   which cannot be passed and of the torment of those upon the other side?
   You may know it all before yon clock strikes again! Think of it and
   tremble! Then, as I have already stated, we shall all go forward in our
   journey towards Resurrection. We shall, every one of us, stand in the
   latter day upon the earth. To the righteous this is the greatest joy.
   "And though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh
   shall I see God." Oh, blessed hope! It were worthwhile to die with this
   in prospect! A child of God who died not long ago said to one who stood
   by, "I have enjoyed more, in the two hours I have been dying, than in
   the 50 years that I was living. It is so blessed a thing to die, for I
   have a clear prospect of the Resurrection!"

   But, oh, to have no blessed Resurrection before you! Instead, to have
   the certainty of rising to shame and to everlasting contempt! To have
   nothing but the rising so that both body and soul may be cast into Hell
   till the tongue

   that now dares to curse will ask in vain for a drop of water to cool
   its burning! To know that your every limb shall be made to suffer
   because it yielded itself up to be an instrument of unrighteousness and
   of rebellion against God! Which shall your resurrection be--a blessing
   or a horror? God help you to decide!

   Yes, may the Holy Spirit so work upon your heart and will that you may
   lay hold on Jesus at once and find eternal life in Him! Speedily shall
   come the great and terrible scene of the Judgment, when all that are on
   the earth and in the sea shall stand before the Great White Throne.
   What an assembly! These mighty gatherings in the Tabernacle and the
   crowds we hear of on great festival days, are but as a drop in a bucket
   compared with the innumerable hordes of men that shall spring up from
   their graves when the last trumpet sounds!

   If you can think of anything, then, besides your Judge, you will cast
   your eyes as far as you can see, and over hill and dale you will see
   myriads of our race. Men have been so numerous a host that they will
   cover every speck of earth! Yes, and the sea, itself, shall yield, for
   once, a solid basis for them to stand upon--and all shall teem like a
   hive when the bees swarm around it--the world shall appear black with
   the multitude of men! And what a sight when the Assessor shall sit upon
   His Throne and He shall begin to divide them as the shepherd divides
   the sheep from the goats. To the right! To the left! Blessed! Cursed!
   Come! Depart!

   Oh, the terror of that voice which shall pronounce a separate sentence
   upon each of the two great classes into which the population of earth
   shall then be divided! On which side would you be if, now, instead of
   this poor voice saluting your ears, there should suddenly be a
   transformation scene and Christ should sit upon His Throne--and you and
   I are there to be judged before Him? And then, after the judgment comes
   the end, but what then? Do not flatter yourselves with the idea, you
   ungodly, that you shall be annihilated! You have chosen sin. You have
   deliberately rejected Christ and if you continue to do so you have
   settled your own destiny--and settled it forever! Look the danger in
   the face like honest men--and then escape from the wrath to come!

   But if you believe in Jesus now, look your future in the face and
   rejoice, for your redemption draws near! See body and soul
   together--and both perfect--and Christ the Judge acquitting you,
   saying, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
   for you from before the foundation of the world." Can you conceive your
   overflowing joy, your ecstatic delight? The presence of angels! The
   fellowship of perfect saints! The sight of your Savior! Communion with
   your God! And all this forever and forever! Why, I think it makes me
   willing to use my solemn text no longer as a dirge, but as a sonnet and
   say right joyously, "When a few years are come, I shall go from where I
   shall not return, nor ever wish to return, but shall be forever with
   the Lord." Amen, so let it be!

"Forever With The Lord"

   (No. 1374)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 16, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "So shall we be forever with the Lord." 1 Thessalonians 4:17.

   WE know that these words are full of consolation, for the Apostle says
   in the next verse, "Therefore comfort one another with these words."
   The very words, it appears, were dictated by the Holy Spirit, the
   Comforter, to be repeated by the saints to each other with the view of
   removing sorrow from the minds of the distressed. The comfort is
   intended to give us hope in reference to those who have fallen asleep.
   Look over the list of those beloved in the Lord who have departed from
   you, to your utmost grief, and let the words of our text be a
   handkerchief for your tears.

   Sorrow not as those that are without hope, for they are with the Lord
   though they are not with you and, by-and-by, you shall surely meet them
   where your Lord is the center of fellowship forever and ever. The
   separation will be very transient--the reunion will be everlasting!
   These words are, also, intended to comfort the saints with regard to
   themselves. And I pray that they may be a cordial to any who are sick
   with fear--a matchless medicine to charm away the heartache from all
   Believers. The fact that you bear about a dying body is very evident to
   some of you by your frequent and increasing infirmities and pains and
   this, it may be, is a source of depression of spirits.

   You know that when a few years are gone you must go the way from where
   you shall not return, but be not dismayed, for you shall not go into a
   strange country alone and unattended. There is a Friend that sticks
   closer than a brother who will not fail you nor forsake you! And,
   moreover, you are going Home--your Lord will be with you while you are
   departing--and then you will be with Him forever. Therefore, though
   sickness warns you of the near approach of death, be not in the least
   dismayed! Though pain and weariness should make your heart and flesh
   fail, yet doubt not of your triumph through the Redeemer's blood!

   Though it should sometimes make your flesh tremble when you remember
   your many sins and the weakness of your faith, yet be of good cheer,
   for your sins and weakness of faith will soon be removed far from
   you--and you shall be in His Presence where there is fullness of
   joy--and at His right hand where there are pleasures forevermore!
   Comfort yourselves, then, both with regard to those who have gone
   before and in reference to the thought of your own departure.

   Observe that the comfort which the Apostle here presents to us may be
   partly derived from the fact of the Resurrection, but not chiefly, for
   he does not so much refer to the words, "The dead in Christ shall
   rise," as to these last--"so shall we be forever with the Lord." It is
   a great Truth of God that you will rise again. It is a sweeter Truth
   that you will be "forever with the Lord"! There is some consolation,
   also, in the fact that we shall meet our departed Brothers and Sisters
   when we shall all be caught up together in the clouds to meet the Lord
   in the air. Blissful will be the general assembling of the redeemed,
   never again to be broken up--the joy of meeting, never to part, is a
   sweet remedy for the bitterness of separation.

   There is great comfort in it, but the main stress of consolation does
   not lie even there. It is pleasant to think of the eternal fellowship
   of the godly above, but the best of all is the promised fellowship with
   our Lord-- "So shall we be forever with the Lord." Whatever else you
   draw comfort from, neglect not this deep, clear and overflowing well of
   delight! There are other sources of good cheer in connection with the
   Glory to be revealed, for Heaven is a many-sided joy. But still, none
   can excel the glory of communion with Jesus Christ! We comfort one
   another, in the first place and most constantly with these words, "So
   shall we be forever with the Lord."

   I shall view our text, in order to our comfort at this time, in three
   lights. I look upon it, first, as a continuance--we are with the Lord
   even now and we always shall be. Secondly, as an advancement--we shall,
   before long, be more fully with the Lord than we are now. And thirdly,
   as a coherence--for we both are and shall be with Him in a close and
   remarkable manner.

   I. I regard the text as A CONTINUANCE of our present spiritual
   state--"So shall we be forever with the Lord." To my mind, and I think
   I am not incorrect in so expounding, the Apostle means that nothing
   shall prevent our continuing to be forever with the Lord. Death shall
   not separate us, nor the terrors of that tremendous day when the voice
   of the archangel and the trumpet of God shall be heard. By Divine plan
   and arrangement, all shall be so ordained that, "So shall we be forever
   with the Lord." By being caught up into the clouds, or in one way or
   another, our abiding in Christ shall remain unbroken. As we have
   received Christ Jesus the Lord, so shall we walk in Him, whether in
   life or in death.

   I understand the Apostle to mean that we are with the Lord now and that
   nothing shall separate us from Him. Even now, like Enoch, we walk with
   God and we shall not be deprived of Divine communion. Our fear might be
   that in the future state something might happen which would become a
   dividing gulf between us and Christ, but the Apostle assures us that it
   will not be so--there shall be such plans and methods used that, "so
   shall we be forever with the Lord." At any rate, I know that if this is
   not the Truth of God, here intended, it is a Truth worthy to be
   expounded and, therefore, I do not hesitate to enlarge upon it.

   We are with the Lord in this life in a high spiritual sense. Read you
   not, in the Epistle to the Colossians, "for you are dead and your life
   is hid with Christ in God"? Were you not "buried with Him in Baptism
   wherein, also, you are risen with Him through the faith of the
   operation of God, who has raised Him from the dead"? Do you not know
   what it is to be dead to the world in Him and to be living a secret
   life with Him? Are you not risen with Christ? Yes, and do you not
   understand, in some measure, what it is to be raised up together and
   made to sit together in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus? If you are not
   with Him, Brothers and Sisters, you are not Christians at all, for this
   is the mark of the Christian-- that he follows with Christ.

   It is essential to salvation to be a sheep of Christ's fold--no,
   more--a partaker of Christ's life, a member of His mystical body, a
   branch of the spiritual vine! Separated from Him we are spiritually
   dead. He Himself has said, "If a man abides not in Me, he is cast forth
   as a branch and is withered. And men gather them and cast them into the
   fire and they are burned." Jesus is not far from any of His people--no,
   it is our privilege to follow Him wherever He goes--and His loving
   words to us are, "Abide in Me, and I in you." May He enable us sweetly
   to realize this! We are, dear Brothers and Sisters, constantly with
   Christ in the sense of abiding union with Him, for we are joined unto
   the Lord and are one spirit.

   Sometimes this union is very sweetly apparent to ourselves." We know
   that we are in Him that is true," and in consequence we feel an intense
   joy, even Christ's own joy fulfilled in us! For the same reason we are
   at times bowed down with intense sorrow, for being in and with Christ,
   we have fellowship with Him in His sufferings, being made conformable
   with His death. This is such sweet sorrow that the more we experience
   it, the better--

   "Live or die, or work or suffer,

   Let my weary soul abide,

   In all changes whatever,

   Sure and steadfast by Your side.

   Nothing can delay my progress,

   Nothing can disturb my rest,

   If I shall, wherever I wander,

   Lean my spirit on Your breast."

   This companionship is, we trust, made manifest to others by its fruits.
   It ought always to be so --the life of the Christian should be
   manifestly a life with Christ. Men should take knowledge of us, that we
   have been with Jesus and have learned of Him.

   They should see that there is something in us which could not have been
   there if it were not for the Son of God--a temper, a spirit, a course
   of life which could not have come by Nature--but must have been worked
   in us through Grace which has been received from Him in whom dwells a
   fullness of Grace, even our Lord Jesus Christ. Brothers and Sisters, if
   we are what we ought to be, our life is spent in conscious communion
   growing out of continued union with the Lord Jesus Christ! And if it is
   so, we have that rich assurance which is written by the Beloved John,
   "If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you,
   you, also, shall continue in the Son and in the Father."

   We are with Him, dear Friends, in this sense, too, that His unchanging
   love is always set upon us, and our love, feeble though it sometimes
   may be, never quite dies out. In both senses that challenge of the
   Apostle is true, "Who shall separate us from the love of God which is
   in Christ Jesus our Lord?" We can say, "I am my Beloved's and His
   desire is

   towards me." And, on the other hand, we, also testify, "My Beloved is
   mine, and I am His." He claims us and we claim Him! He loves us and we
   love Him! There is a union of heart between us. We are with Him, not
   against Him! We are in league with Him, enlisted beneath His banner,
   obedient to His Spirit. For us to live is Christ--we have no other aim!

   He is with us by the continued indwelling of the Holy Spirit who is
   with us and shall be in us forever. His anointing abides on us and
   because of it we abide in Christ Jesus! He has sent us the Comforter to
   represent Himself and through that Divine Paraclete He continues to be
   with us--and so, even now we are forever with the Lord. Our Lord has,
   also, promised to be with us whenever we are engaged in His work. That
   is a grand word of encouragement, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto
   the end of the world." Think not, therefore, that it will be the first
   time of our being with Christ when we shall see Him in Glory, for even
   now He manifests Himself unto us as He does not unto the world.

   Has He not often fulfilled His promise, "Where two or three are
   gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them"? We have
   heard the sound of our Master's feet behind us when we have been going
   on His errands. We have felt the touch of His hands when we have come
   to the forefront of the battle for His sake. And we have known that He
   dwells in us by His Spirit and is with us by the power with which He
   has attended our work, and the deeds which He has worked by the Gospel
   which we have proclaimed. The Lord Jesus is with His Church in her
   tribulation for His name's sake and He will forever be so, for He
   forsakes not His saints. "Fear not, I am with you," is as much a word
   of the Lord under the Gospel as in Old Testament times. By the power of
   His blessed Spirit Jesus abides with us and through this present
   dispensation He enables us to be "forever with the Lord."

   But, my Brethren, the time is coming when we shall die unless the Lord
   shall descend from Heaven with a shout in the meanwhile. Assuredly in
   the article of death we shall still be with the Lord--

   "Death may my soul divide From this abode of clay But love shall keep
   me near Your side Through all the gloomy way."

   "Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
   fear no evil; for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff they comfort
   me." This makes dying such wonderful work to the people of God, for
   then, especially, is Jesus seen to be near! By death they escape from
   death--and from now on it is no more death for them to die! When Jesus
   meets His saints, there seems no iron gate to pass through, but in a
   moment they close their eyes on earth and open them in Glory!

   Beloved, there should be no more bondage through fear of death since
   Christ attends His people even in their descent into the tomb and
   strengthens them upon the bed of languishing. This has been a great joy
   to many departing saints. A dying Believer who was attended by an
   apothecary who was, also, a child of God, was observed to be whispering
   to himself while dying. His good attendant, wishing to know what were
   his last words, placed his ear against the dying man's lips and heard
   him repeating to himself, again and again, the words, "Forever with the
   Lord. Forever with the Lord." When heart and flesh were failing, the
   departing one knew that God was the strength of his life and his
   portion forever--and so he chose for his soft, low-whispered, dying
   song, "Forever with the Lord."

   After death we shall abide, awhile, in the separate, disembodied state
   and we shall know as to our soul what it is to be still with the Lord,
   for what does the Apostle say? "Knowing that when we are absent from
   the body we are present with the Lord." The dying thief was to be, that
   day, with Christ in Paradise, and such shall be our lot as soon as our
   souls shall have passed out of this tenement of clay into that wondrous
   state of which we know so little. Our pure spirits shall "come unto
   Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
   Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general
   assembly and Church of the first-born which are written in Heaven, and
   to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
   and to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of
   sprinkling, that speaks better things than that of Abel."

   Who is dismayed when such a prospect opens up before him? Yes, and this
   body which shall fall asleep, though apparently it shall be destroyed,
   yet shall not be so, but shall only slumber awhile and then awake again
   and say, "When I awake I am still with You." Constantly death is
   described as sleeping in Jesus--that is the state of the saint's mortal
   frame through the interval between death and resurrection. The angels
   shall guard our bodies--all that is essential to complete the identity
   of our body shall be securely preserved so that the very seed which was
   put into the earth shall rise,

   again, in the beauty of efflorescence which becomes it. All, I say,
   that is essential, shall be preserved intact, because it is still with
   Christ.

   It is a glorious doctrine which is stated by the Apostle in the first
   Epistle to the Thessalonians, the 5th chapter, at the 9th and 10th
   verses, "For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation
   by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or
   sleep, we should live together with Him." In due time the last trumpet
   shall sound and Christ shall come and the saints shall be with Him. The
   infinite Providence has so arranged that Christ shall not come without
   His people, for, "Them, also, that sleep in Jesus shall God bring with
   Him." The saints shall be with Him in the Advent as they are now. Our
   souls shall hear the shout of victory and join in it! The voice of the
   archangel shall be actually heard by all His redeemed and the trumpet
   of God shall be sounded in the hearing of every one of His beloved, for
   we shall be with Jesus all through that glorious transaction.

   Whatever the glory and splendor of the Second Advent, we shall be with
   Jesus in it! I am not going to give you glimpses of the revealed
   future, or offer any suggestion as to the sublime history which is yet
   to be written, but most certainly there is to be a last general
   Judgment and then we shall be with Christ, assessors with Him at that
   day. Being ourselves, first acquitted, we shall take our seat upon the
   Judgment Bench with Him. What does the Holy Spirit say by the
   Apostle--"Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? Know
   you not that we shall judge angels?" The fallen angels, to their shame,
   shall, in part, receive the verdict of their condemnation from the lips
   of men--and thus vengeance shall be taken upon them for all the
   mischief they have done to the sons of men.

   Oh, think of it! Amidst the terror of the tremendous Day you shall be
   at ease, resting in the love of God and beholding the Glory of Christ
   and, "so shall you forever be with the Lord." There is, moreover, to be
   a reign of Christ. I cannot read the Scriptures without perceiving that
   there is to be a millennial reign, as I believe, upon the earth and
   that there shall be new heavens and new earth wherein dwells
   righteousness. Well, whatever that reign is to be, we shall reign also!
   "And he that overcomes and keeps My words unto the end, to him will I
   give power over the nations. And He shall rule them with a rod of iron;
   as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers; even as I
   received of My Father." "And have made us unto our God kings and
   priests and we shall reign on the earth."

   He shall reign, but it will be "before His ancients gloriously." We
   shall be partakers in the splendors of the latter days, whatever they
   may be, and, "So shall we be forever with the Lord." The particular
   incident of the text does not exhaust the words, but you may apply them
   to the whole story of God's own children. From the first day of the
   spiritual birth of the Lord's immortals until they are received up into
   the seventh Heaven to dwell with God, their history may be summed up in
   these words, "So shall we be forever with the Lord." Whether caught up
   into the clouds or here below on this poor afflicted earth--whether in
   Paradise or in the renovated earth, in the grave or in Glory--we shall
   always be with the Lord!

   And when comes the end and God alone shall reign and the mediatorial
   kingdom shall cease, ages, ages and ages shall revolve, but "so shall
   we be forever with the Lord." The saints immortal shall be with their
   Covenant Head, free from sorrow. All tendency to sin, all fear of
   change or death shall be gone! And their intimate communion will last
   on forever--

   "Blessed state! Beyond conception! Who its vast delights can tell? May
   it be my blissful portion, With my Savior there to dwell."

   I think the text looks like a continuation of what is already begun,
   only rising to something higher and better. To be with Christ is life
   eternal--this we have already and shall continue to have and--"so shall
   we be forever with the Lord."

   II. Secondly, most assuredly, Brethren, the text is A GREAT
   ADVANCEMENT--"So shall we be forever with the Lord." It is an
   advancement upon this present state, for however spiritual-minded we
   may be and however in consequence, thereof, we may be very near unto
   our Lord Jesus, yet still we know that while we are present in the body
   we are absent from the Lord. This life, at its very best, is still
   comparatively an absence from the Lord, but in the world to come we
   shall be more perfectly at home. Now, we cannot, in the highest sense,
   be with Christ, for we must, according to the Apostle's phraseology,
   "depart, and be with Christ; which is far better." But there we shall
   be forever beholding His face unveiled. Earth is not Heaven, though the
   Believer begins the heavenly life while he is upon it. We are not with
   Christ as to place, nor as to actual sight--but in Glory we shall be!

   And it is an advancement, in the next place, upon the present state of
   the departed, for though their souls are with the Lord, yet their
   bodies are subject to corruption. Still does the sepulcher contain the
   blessed dust of the fathers of our Israel. Though scattered to the four
   winds of Heaven, the martyr's ashes are still with us. The glorified
   saints are not as yet consciously "with the Lord" as to their complete
   manhood, but when the grand event shall occur of which Paul speaks, the
   body shall be reanimated. This is our glorious hope! We can say with
   the Patriarch Job--"For I know that my Redeemer lives, and that He
   shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my skin,
   worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God; whom I shall
   see for myself and my eyes shall behold, and not another; though my
   reins be consumed within me."

   Know you not, Brothers and Sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
   the kingdom of God? That is, as they are. But this corruptible must put
   on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality--and then shall
   the entire manhood, the perfected manhood, the fully developed manhood,
   of which this manhood is, as it were, but a shriveled seed--be in the
   fullest and most Divine sense, forever with the Lord! This is an
   advancement, even, upon the present state of departed saints in
   Paradise!

   And now let us consider this glorious condition to which we shall be
   advanced. We shall be with the Lord in the strongest possible meaning
   of that language. So with Him that we shall never mind earthly things
   again, shall have no more to go into city business, or into the
   workshop, or into the field. We shall have nothing to do but to be
   engaged forever with Him in such occupations as shall have no tendency
   to take us off from communion with Him. We shall be so with Him as to
   have no sin to becloud our view of Him! Our understanding will be
   delivered from all the injury which sin has worked in it and we shall
   know Him even as we are known. We shall see Him as a familiar Friend
   and sit with Him at His marriage feast. We shall be with Him so as to
   have no fear of His ever being grieved and hiding His face from us
   again.

   We shall never again be made to cry out in bitterness of spirit, "Oh,
   that I knew where I might find Him." We shall always know His love,
   always return it and always swim in the full stream of it, enjoying it
   to the fullest! There will be no lukewarmness to mar our fellowship. He
   shall never have to say to us, "I would you were either cold or hot."
   There shall be no weariness to suspend our ceaseless bliss--we shall
   never have to cease from fellowship with Him because our physical frame
   is exhausted through the excessive joy of our heart--the vessel will be
   strengthened to hold the new wine. No doubts shall intrude into our
   rest, neither doctrinal doubts nor doubts about our interest in Him,
   for we shall be so consciously with Him as to have risen 10,000 leagues
   above that gloomy state.

   We shall know that He is ours, for His left hand shall be under our
   head and His right hand shall embrace us and we shall be with Him
   beyond all hazard of ever losing Him. The chief blessedness seems, to
   me, to lie in this, that we will always are with Him and with Him
   always. Now we are with the Lord in conscious enjoyment, sometimes, but
   then we are away from Him. But there it will be constant, unwavering
   fellowship! No break shall ever occur in the intimate communion of the
   saints with Christ. Here we know that our high days and bright Sabbaths
   with their sweetest joys, must have their eventides and then come the
   work-days with the burden of the week upon them. But there the Sabbath
   is eternal, the worship endless, the praise unceasing, the bliss
   unbounded. "Forever with the Lord."

   Speak of a thousand years of reigning? What is that compared with,
   "forever with the Lord"? The millennium is little compared with
   "forever"--a millennium of millenniums would be nothing to it! There
   can come no end to us and no end to our bliss, since there can be no
   end to Him--"because I live, you shall live also." "Forever with the
   Lord." What will it mean? I remember a sermon upon this text by a
   notable preacher, of which the heads were as follows-- "Forever life,
   forever light, forever love, forever peace, forever rest, forever joy."
   What a chain of delights! What more can heart imagine or hope desire?
   Carry those things in your mind and you will get, if you can drink into
   them, some idea of the blessedness which is contained in being forever
   with the Lord!

   But remember these are only the fruits--not the root of the joy. Jesus
   is better than all these! His company is more than the joy which comes
   out of it. I do not care so much for, "life forever," nor for, "light
   forever," as I do for, "forever with the Lord." Oh, to be with Him! I
   ask no other bliss and cannot imagine anything more heavenly. Why, the
   touch of the hem of His garment healed the sick woman! The sight of Him
   was enough to give life to us when we were dead! What, then, must it be
   to be with Him actually, consciously and always? To be with Him no more
   by faith, but in very deed with

   Him forever? My soul is ready to swoon away with too much joy as she
   drinks in even her shallow measure into the meaning of this
   thought--and I dare not venture further.

   I must leave you to muse your souls into it, for it needs quiet thought
   and room for free indulgence of holy imagination till you make your
   soul dream of this excess of joy. "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard,
   neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has
   prepared for them that love Him. But God has revealed them unto us by

   His Spirit."--

   "O glorious hour! O blessed abode!

   I shall be near and like my God.

   And flesh and sin no more control

   The sacred pleasures of my soul." We love to think of being with Jesus
   under the aspect which the text specially suggests to us. We are to be
   forever with the Redeemer, not only as Jesus the Savior, but as the
   Lord. Here we have seen Him on the Cross and lived thereby. We are with
   Him now in His Cross-bearing and shame and it is well--but our eternal
   companionship with Him will enable us to rejoice in Him as the Lord.
   What did our Master say in His blessed prayer? "I will that they, also,
   whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am; that they may behold My
   Glory."

   It will be Heaven for us to be forever with Him as the Lord! Oh, how we
   shall delight to obey Him as our Lord! How we shall triumph as we see
   what a Lord He is over all the universe! And what a conqueror He is
   over all His enemies! He will be more and more the Lord to us as we see
   all things put under Him. We shall forever hail Him as King of kings
   and Lord of lords. How we will adore Him, there, when we see Him in His
   Glory! We worship Him, now, and are not ashamed to believe that the Man
   of Nazareth is, "very God of very God." But oh, how His Deity will
   shine upon us with infinite brightness when we come to be near Him!
   Thanks be to His name, we shall be strengthened to endure the sight and
   we shall rejoice to see ourselves in the full blaze of His glory!

   Then shall we see what our poet endeavored to describe when he said--

   "Adoringsaints around Him stand,

   And thrones and powers before Him fall!

   The God shines gracious through the Mian,

   And sheds sweet glories on them all." We shall be forever with the Lord
   and His Lordship shall be most upon our minds! He has been raised into
   Glory and honor and is no more able to suffer shame!--

   "No more the bloody spear,

   The Cross and nails no more! For Hell itself shakes at His word, And
   all the heavens adore."

   III. Now we come to our third point and shall consider what, for lack
   of a better word, I entitle A COHERENCE. Those who are acquainted with
   the Greek language know that the, "with," here, is not meta, which
   signifies being in the same place with a person, but one which goes
   much further and implies a coherence--the two who are with each other
   are intimately connected. Let me show you what I mean.

   We are to be forever with the Lord. Now, the Christian's life is like
   the life of His Lord and so it is a life with Christ. He was in all
   things with His Brethren and Grace makes us to be with Him. Just
   hurriedly look at your spiritual experience and your Lord's life and
   see the parallel. When you were newly born as a Christian, you were
   born as Jesus Christ was, for you were born of the Holy Spirit. What
   happened after that? The devil tried to destroy the new life in you,
   just as Herod tried to kill your Lord--you were with Christ in danger,
   early and imminent. You grew in stature and in Grace and, while Grace
   was yet young, you staggered those who were about you with the things
   you said, did and felt, for they could not understand you! Even thus,
   when He went up to the Temple, our Lord amazed the doctors who gathered
   around Him.

   The Spirit of God rested upon you, not in the same measure, but still,
   as a matter of fact, He did descend upon you as He did upon your Lord.
   You have been with Him in Jordan's stream and have received the Divine
   acknowledgment that you are, indeed, the child of God. Your Lord was
   led into the wilderness to be tempted--and you, too, have been tempted
   by the devil. You have been with the Lord all along, from the first day
   until now. If you have been, by Grace,

   enabled to live as you should, you have trod the separated path with
   Jesus! You have been in the world, but not of it, holy, harmless,
   undefiled and separate from sinners. Therefore you have been
   despised--you have had to take your share of being unknown and
   misrepresented because you are even as He was in the world. "Therefore
   the world knows us not, because it knew Him not."

   As He was here to serve, you have been with Him as a servant. You have
   carried His yoke and counted it an easy load. You have been crucified
   to the world with Him. You know the meaning of His Cross and delight to
   bear it after Him. You are dead to the world with Him and wish to be as
   one buried to it. You have already, in your measure, partaken of His
   Resurrection and are living in newness of life. Your life story is
   still to be like the life story of your Lord, only painted in
   miniature. The more you watch the life of Christ the more clearly you
   will see the life of a spiritual man depicted in it--and the more
   clearly will you see what the saints' future will be.

   You have been with Christ in life and you will be with Him when you
   come to die. You will not die the expiatory death which fell to His
   lot, but you will die feeling that "it is finished" and you will
   breathe out your soul, saying, "Father, into Your hands I commend my
   spirit." Then our Lord went to Paradise and you will go there, too. You
   shall enjoy a sojourn where He spent His interval in the disembodied
   state. You shall be with Him and like He is and then like He, you shall
   rise when your third morning comes. "After two days will He revive us.
   On the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live in His sight."
   "Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
   arise."

   You shall also ascend as Christ did. Do you catch the thought? How did
   He ascend? In clouds. "A cloud received Him out of their sight" and a
   cloud shall receive you. You shall be caught up into the clouds to meet
   the Lord in the air and so shall you be always with the Lord, in the
   sense of being like He, walking with Him in experience and passing
   through the same events. That likeness shall continue forever and
   forever. Our lives shall run parallel with that of our Lord! Think,
   then, Beloved--we are to be like Christ as to our character! We are to
   be with the Lord by sharing His moral and spiritual likeness! Conformed
   to His image, we shall be adorned with His beauty!

   When the mother of Darius saw two persons entering her pavilion, she,
   being a prisoner, bowed to the one whom she supposed to be Alexander.
   It turned out to be Hyphestion, the King's favorite. Upon discovering
   that it was Hyphestion the lady humbly begged Alexander's pardon for
   paying obeisance to the wrong person, but Alexander answered, "You have
   not mistaken, Madam, for he, also, is Alexander," meaning that he loved
   him so much that he regarded him as his other self. Our Lord looks on
   His Beloved as one with Himself and makes them like Himself. You
   remember, Brothers and Sisters, how John bowed down before one of his
   fellow servants, the prophets in Heaven? It was a great blunder to
   make, but I dare say you and I will be likely to make the same, for the
   saints are so like their Lord!

   Don't you know that "we shall be like He when we shall see Him as He
   is"? Christ will rejoice to see them all covered with the Glory which
   His Father has given Him! He will not be ashamed to call them Brethren.
   Those poor people of His who were so full of infirmity and mourned over
   it so much--they shall be so like He that they shall be at once seen to
   be His Brothers and Sisters! Where shall such favored ones be found? We
   shall be with Him in the sense that we shall be partakers of all the
   blessedness and Glory which our adorable Lord now enjoys. We shall be
   accepted together with Him. Is He the Beloved of the Lord? Does His
   Father's heart delight in Him, as well it may?

   Behold you, also, shall be called Hephzibah, for His delight shall be
   in you! You shall be beloved of the Father's soul. Is He enriched with
   all manner of blessings beyond conception? So shall you be, for He has
   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ Jesus, according as
   He has chosen us in Him! Is Christ exalted? Oh, how loftily is He
   lifted up to sit upon a glorious high Throne forever! But you shall sit
   upon His Throne with Him and share His exaltation as you have shared
   His humiliation! Oh, the delight of thus being joint-heirs with Christ
   and with Him in the possession of all that He possesses!

   What is Heaven? It is the place which His love suggested, which His
   genius invented, which His bounty provided, which His royalty has
   adorned, which His wisdom has prepared, which He, Himself, glorifies!
   In that Heaven you are to be with Him forever! You shall dwell in the
   King's own palace! Its gates of pearl and streets of gold shall not be
   too good for you. You who love Him are to abide with Him forever--not
   near Him in a secondary place, as a servant lives at the lodge gate of
   His master's mansion--but with Him in the same palace in the metropolis
   of the universe! In a word, Believers are to be identified with Christ
   forever!

   That seems, to me, to be the very life and essence of the text--with
   Him forever--that is, identified with Him forever. Do they ask for the
   Shepherd? They cannot behold Him to perfection except as surrounded by
   His sheep! Will the King be illustrious? How can that be if His
   subjects are lost? Do they ask for the Bridegroom? They cannot imagine
   Him in the fullness of joy without His bride! Will the Head be blessed?
   It could not be if it were separated from the members. Will Christ be
   forever glorified? How can He be if He shall lose His jewels? He is the
   Foundation and what would He be if all His people were not built upon
   Him into the similitude of a palace?

   O Brothers and Sisters, there shall be no Christ without Christians!
   There shall be no Savior without the saved ones! There shall be no
   Elder Brother without the younger brethren! There shall be no Redeemer
   without His redeemed! We are His fullness and He must have us with Him.
   We are identified with Him forever! Nothing can ever divide us from
   Him. Oh, joy, joy forever! Hallelujah!--

   "Since Christ and we are one, Why should we doubt or fear? If He in
   Heaven has fixed His Throne, He'll fix His members there."

   Two or three practical sentences. One word is this--this, "with the
   Lord" must begin now. Do you wish to be forever with the Lord? You must
   be with Him by becoming His disciple in this life. None come to be with
   the Lord hereafter who are not with the Lord here in time. See to it,
   dear Hearers, see to it, lest this unspeakable privilege should never
   be yours. Next, every Christian should seek to be more and more with
   Christ, for the growth and glory of your life lies there. Do you want
   to have Heaven below? Be with Christ below! Do you want to know, at
   once, what eternal bliss is? Know it by living with the Lord now.

   The next word is, how plainly, then, the way of life is to be with the
   Lord. If you want to be saved, Sinner, you must be "with the Lord."
   There is no other way! Come near to Him and lay hold upon Him by faith.
   Life lies there. Come to Him by a humble, tearful faith. Come at once!
   And, lastly, what must it be to be without the Lord? What must it be to
   be against the Lord? For it comes to that, "He that is not with Me," He
   says, "is against Me"--to be forever without the Lord, banished from
   His love, light, life, peace, rest and joy! What a loss this will be!

   What must it be to be forever against the Lord! Think of it--forever
   hating Jesus, forever plotting against Him, forever gnashing your teeth
   against Him--this is Hell, this is time infinite of misery, to be
   against the Lord of Love and Life and Light. Turn from this fatal
   course! Believe on Him--"Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and you perish
   from the way, when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all
   they that put their trust in Him." Amen.

"Now Then, Do It"

   (No. 1375)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 23, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "You sought for David in times past to be king over you: now then, do
   it: for the Lord has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of My servant
   David I will save My people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines,
   and out of the hand of all their enemies." 2 Samuel 3:17,18.

   You know the circumstances under which these words were spoken. God had
   cast off Saul because he had not been faithful and He had appointed
   David to be his successor, anointing him by the hand of Samuel. Yet
   when Saul was slain in battle, Israel seemed determined to choose her
   own king by selecting one of Saul's family--and under the leadership of
   Abner, the majority of the tribes set up Ishbosheth, son of Jonathan,
   to be king. Then commenced a civil war between the two parties and we
   read that the house of David waxed stronger and stronger, but the house
   of Saul grew weaker and weaker. In process of time Abner, the
   commander-in-chief and prime minister who was at the head of Saul's
   party, because it served his own purposes, changed his mind and
   resolved that David should become king over the whole land.

   Having so resolved, he began to persuade the tribes and argue with them
   on David's behalf. And the words of my text are a part of a very
   powerful argument which he used in order to induce them to give up the
   king of their own choosing and offer the crown to the king whom God had
   appointed, even David. I need say but very little, however, about the
   circumstances of the case, for I am about to accommodate the words to
   quite another people and another king. I desire, in all sincerity of
   heart, to approach those of you whose minds are ruled by evil desires
   and motives, all of which are alien sovereigns, hostile to the true
   King whom God has anointed--and to remind you, this morning, that you
   have, in times past, sought to have Jesus to be King over you.

   Perhaps you have some desires towards Him lingering in your heart even
   now and, therefore, I have hope of you that you will go further, and in
   all sincerity, submit yourselves to His dominion. It is time that you
   should go beyond mere desires and attain to something practical. In the
   words of Abner I would say to you, "Now then, do it." If worth
   desiring, it is worth performing. "Now then, do it." There are the best
   of reasons why you should do it, for Jesus is God's appointed King,
   anointed by the Holy Spirit, by whom alone He will save you from your
   spiritual enemies. May God grant that His Word be successful, through
   His Divine Spirit, in establishing the Kingdom of Christ in many
   undecided hearts, this morning, and He shall have the praise!

   The text gives me the following run of thought. First, I would remind
   you of former impulses--"You sought for David in times past to be king
   over you." Secondly, I would recommend decided action--"Now then, do
   it." And thirdly, I would reason with a forcible argument for, only
   changing names, I may read my text in this fashion, "The Lord has
   spoken of Jesus, saying, By the hand of My only begotten Son I will
   save My people Israel out of the hand of the powers of darkness, and
   out of the hand of all their enemies."

   I. First, then, my business this morning is to REMIND UNDECIDED PERSONS
   OF FORMER IMPULSES. I would personally address each hesitating hearer
   and call up the memories of His life. You are not a Christian, but many
   times you have been upon the verge of it, for you have even gone the
   length of seeking, after a fashion, to have Jesus for your King. Of
   course the character and frequency of those impulses have varied
   greatly in different individuals. Each man has had his own amount of
   drawings and inclinings towards God. I cannot so speak as to describe
   all at once and, therefore, I must go into particulars.

   Many of you have been tutored in the ways and manners of the godly from
   your youth up. The very first song you heard your mother sing, as she
   hushed you to sleep, was sweetened with the name of Jesus. Probably you
   cannot recollect a time when there were not some holy agencies at work
   upon your heart. And you remember the effect they had upon

   you, even at the very beginning, when as a child your little prayers at
   night grew fervent and you sobbed yourself to sleep with grief for
   having done wrong. Often did your childish heart sigh after, "gentle
   Jesus," and long for His love. I think I see those tears upon your
   little cheeks even now, when you had lately heard the story of Jesus,
   or had been earnestly addressed concerning death and judgment to come.
   When the sweetness and beauty of Christ and the happiness of Believers
   were set before you in your youth, you often felt drawn to the Cross of
   Christ.

   Nor was it in childhood, alone, for as you grew older there were
   agencies adapted for your growth prepared by infinite love. Some of you
   fell into the hands of sincere Christian men and women who did not
   cease to instruct you and to warn you. And sometimes, as you must
   remember if you will but try to do so, you were like Agrippa of old,
   "almost persuaded to be a Christian." You promised, you resolved, you
   began even to pray, but, alas, your goodness was as the morning cloud,
   as the early dew and soon passed away. But you do remember, don't you,
   that it was there? Since then, though you have been immersed in
   business cares, you have not been altogether without some thoughts
   towards Jesus the Savior.

   An earnest sermon has driven you home to your knees. Affliction has
   frequently compelled you solemnly to consider. The death of others has
   made you pause and forced you to hopeful resolves. Can you count up the
   many times in which you have come to a dead halt and have raised the
   question, "Shall I go further or shall I turn?" Your soul has been half
   constrained to say within herself, "Things shall be altered. I will no
   longer be an ungrateful child to my good God, but I will arise and go
   to my Father." Why, there are some of you to whom continuance in
   rebellion must have been very difficult, for you have had to stifle and
   almost to strangle conscience! If you do not see, it is because you
   have laid your fingers heavily upon your eyelids to keep out the
   light--if you have not heard, it has been because you have stopped your
   ears till they have become dull of hearing.

   The knock at your door by your Lord's pierced hand has been kept up
   year after year, almost incessantly, and even in the night watches you
   have been startled with it. He whose head is wet with dew and His locks
   with the drops of the night, has stood there these many weary months
   knocking, knocking, knocking! In boundless patience of love He still
   lingers and again lifts that scarred hand to knock again in tender
   earnestness. You have been almost persuaded to rise from the couch of
   your sloth to admit Him to your heart, but as yet you have not done so.
   You sought for David to be king over you in times past, some of you,
   but, alas, you have not crowned him yet.

   There are others among you who have not been so highly favored with
   religious advantages. Some of you, perhaps, come of an ungodly
   household and your bringing up has been apart from the things of God. I
   grieve to say that this is getting more frequent daily, especially in
   our great cities. Children, nowadays, are not trained to the observance
   of the Sabbath as they were! Multitudes in this great city seldom tread
   the floor of God's House at all. Still, I can scarcely imagine that
   there is one present but who has, at times, enjoyed holy impulses,
   right convictions and pure desires. Conscience, though not enlightened
   as we could have wished, has not been quite quit with you--you have
   felt uneasy in your unconverted state and you are uneasy now.

   You have been forced, sometimes, to think, and when a man who is
   without God and without Christ begins to think, his thoughts must
   trouble him and, being troubled, he is likely to desire the way of
   peace. I cannot but believe that you who are thoughtful have sometimes
   had intense desires to be Christians. You have longed to be pardoned,
   renewed and sanctified. Would you not give all that you have for a sure
   hope of Heaven? You know that occasionally, at least, pure aspirations
   have come over you--and I wish that I could, by any means, so revive
   your memories that you would all confess that you sought for Jesus in
   times past to be King over you!

   If you remember these things, I beg you, also, to consider that your
   responsibilities have been increased in proportion to those impulses,
   for every time you have checked conscience, or have held yourself back
   when you were moved towards right, you have not only incurred a present
   sin, but you have rendered all your future life the more censurable!
   The more difficult it is to persevere in an evil course, the more
   intensely sinful that perseverance becomes! So that I must charge upon
   some here present that every day in which they live without repentance
   and without faith is a day of aggravated iniquity, seeing that they
   resist the Holy Spirit as did, also, their fathers!

   You love darkness rather than light because your deeds are evil. None
   are so blamable for ignorance as those who refuse to learn and none so
   guilty in their sins as those who resist better impulses and do
   violence to themselves in order to indulge their iniquities. The case
   varies, however, as we have already seen. These impulses have been
   usual in you at

   certain times and these find a parallel in the case of Israel. The
   tribes desired David for king on certain occasions. For instance,
   whenever Saul was more than ordinarily oppressive, they sighed for the
   son of Jesse who was of a gentler mold. Whenever sin begins to be
   oppressive to a man, he has, for the present, some wish to escape from
   its tyranny. Sin is a very hard taskmaster, especially some forms of
   it.

   Let a man pursue the sin of drunkenness and, "who has woe? Who has
   redness of eyes" like he does? Let a man follow the lusts of the flesh
   and his very body soon begins to smart beneath the lash of his despotic
   vices. Even now the earnest of sin's wage is something dreadful for a
   man to receive! Have you ever seen a spendthrift brought to beggary and
   rags? Do you wonder that when his hungry belly accuses him, he promises
   better things and, in a measure, is sincere in his good resolves?
   Selfishness, itself, calls upon men to quit their evil ways which are
   ruining them body and soul! It is not at all amazing that so loud and
   near a voice should, for a time, be heard!

   Some of you know well when it has been so, when your sin has lost its
   pleasurableness, when the beaded bubbles of frothy joy have disappeared
   from the cup of sin and it has become stale and flat--then you have
   seen the hollowness of the world and cried, "I would gladly be a
   Christian!" These Israelites, perhaps, in their hearts sought for David
   to be king when they saw the joy upon the face of David's men. His
   troops often had spoil to share and they always spoke well of their
   captain. And whenever one of David's men was seen anywhere about Judah
   or Israel, the people said, "Those warriors have a goodly heritage in
   being under such a noble leader"--and they wished they had such a king,
   themselves!

   I do not doubt but sometimes when you hear Christ preached in all His
   sweetness, your mouths begin to water after Him! "Is He so good, is He
   so pleasant? Oh, that we knew Him!" And when you see Christians so
   happy and especially when you see them in times of trouble so cheerful
   and joyous under all their trials, I know you have had an inward wish
   that you knew their secret and could share their peace. Has not it been
   so? When you saw your mother die, did you not wish you had her Savior
   to soften your pillow as He softened hers? When that dear little child
   of yours who loved the Savior sang of Jesus as she departed, you almost
   wished that you could die with her if you might as cheerfully meet the
   Lord! Well, those were times when you sought David to be king over you
   in days past.

   I want, if I can, to bring them all up afresh. Perhaps if they would
   all revive at once and come again, God might bless them and make the
   united impulse strong enough, by His good Spirit, to carry you over the
   frontier into the Kingdom of Christ. The Israelites, no doubt, often
   wished that David had been king when they saw their enemies gradually
   encroaching upon their territory and threatening to subdue them. They
   sighed and said, "Oh, for an hour of David with his sling and his
   stone. In the name of the Lord he brought down the haughty Philistine.
   O that he were to the front again! Saul has fallen on the mountains and
   Jonathan is slain upon his high places, and we, the people of the Lord,
   are trod down by the uncircumcised! Oh for the son of Jesse, once
   again, to lead our armies forth to successful war!"

   Have you not, also, when you have seen the strength of your growing
   sins and contemplated the ruin which they will bring upon you, longed
   for a Deliverer? When you have perceived what sin will surely bring
   upon you, by-and-by, in another world and how, even now, it holds you
   in bondage, have you not wished for a Savior, yes, wished for the
   Christ of God to come and destroy your sins and overthrow Satan and set
   you free? I am sure you must have had such wishes when sickness has
   made death appear to be approaching, when judgment has begun to be
   realized and the terrors of wrath to come! You thought of Jesus in
   times past to be King over you. And have you not, also, like Israel,
   often longed for your true King that you might, at last, find rest?

   The civil war must have inflicted much misery upon the nation and,
   therefore, the people wished the strife to be ended through David's
   being made king. So, too, you wish that your heart were peaceful and
   quiet, for now you are ill at ease. You love your pleasurable sins, but
   you are not easy in them. The bed is shorter than a man can stretch
   himself upon and you know it! You wish that you enjoyed the solid
   peace, the confidence and satisfaction which Believers possess! But you
   know that you cannot have it apart from Christ and this reflection has
   sometimes made you seek Christ, after your fashion, though, alas, it
   has not lasted long enough to produce real allegiance to Him! I think
   it right to remind you of these past feelings. How I wish they would
   come back and rise to practical results. May the Holy Spirit renew them
   in a deeper form than in the past, that you may, at once, with
   eagerness, go forth and salute your King--the King who wore a crown of
   thorns for your sake!

   These seekings after David were sometimes vivid and strong with the
   Israelites and so, too, impulses with undecided people are occasionally
   very powerful. Though they do not actually lay hold on Eternal Life,
   they have strong desires to

   do so. They go beyond empty wishes and seriously sigh for an interest
   in Jesus--and yet they pause there and go no further. The bud becomes a
   tiny fruit and then withers from the tree. I have known unconverted
   people to feel great terror at the thought of remaining unsaved. Under
   this influence they have gone to their knees and begun to pray. They
   have gone to their Bibles and begun to read. They have attended the
   House of God with great regularity and listened with very solemn
   attention--and they have even gone the length of mending their ways in
   many points!

   They have begun to frequent Prayer Meetings and, for a while, it did
   seem as if Jesus would be King over them! Indeed, we hoped that they
   were already the servants of the Lord, but, alas, our hopes were
   disappointed--they turned back and walked no more with us. Oftentimes
   the impulses which are put aside and stamped out by half-awakened men
   are exceedingly difficult to overcome. Some of you have had to exert
   yourselves fearfully to remain as you are. You have needed help of the
   world, the flesh and the devil to overpower the force which held you,
   for a while, in its grasp. Some men battle for damnation with a greater
   force than others strive after Eternal Life! The way of transgressors
   is sometimes hard, in this sense, that they find it difficult to
   continue as they are--they are so persecuted by the persuasions,
   warnings and entreaties of good men--and their conscience is so alarmed
   as to give them little or no rest.

   Alas, their neck is as an iron sinew and they are set on mischief! And
   despite the inward calls which bid them seek Jesus for their King, they
   turn a deaf ear to the most tender wooing and continue as they
   were--but not without an awful increase of guilt. Listen to me, you who
   are described in the language I have used! Listen and learn wisdom!
   Nothing has come of all the seekings of your youth and your later days.
   You sought for David in times past to be king over you, but nothing has
   come of it! Nothing has come of it even to this day. You saw that
   religion was right--you did not argue to the contrary! You admitted all
   its reasons! You yielded your understanding so far that you would even
   defend the Truth of God against opponents!

   But what of all that? To admit a thing to be right is but a small part
   of the matter, if you practically deny it by your indifference. You
   have wished that you were a Christian--you have wished it hundreds of
   times, but this, also, is vanity, if carried no further. "If wishes
   were horses beggars would ride" and so, if wishes were Graces the
   careless would be saved. You know, too, that you went beyond
   wishing--you regretted that you were not already decided--you felt very
   much ashamed of yourself for having resisted so long. If anybody had
   told you that you would be hesitating, now, you would not have believed
   it. Ten years ago, if anyone had said, "In ten years' time you will be
   sitting in the Tabernacle just as undecided as you used to be," you
   would have replied with indignation, "Is your servant a dog? I shall
   never be so

   foolish."

   But it is even worse, for now you do not feel half so much as you once
   did. You were more impressible years ago than you are now and, speaking
   after the manner of men, you are now far less likely to be saved. You
   know it is so and yet you did at that time, after a fashion, pray and,
   after a sort, you were in earnest. But what of all that? Nothing has
   come of it! Will anything ever come of it? The Israelites might talk
   about making David king, but that would not crown him. They might meet
   together and say they wished it were so, but that would not do it. It
   might be generally admitted that he ought to be monarch and it might
   even be earnestly hoped that one day he would be--but that would not do
   it-- something more decided must be done.

   And oh, am I not, indeed, hitting the very center of the target when I
   say of some of you that you have, scores of times, given up the whole
   question as a matter of argument? Yes, and your heart has submitted
   that it was wrong of you to continue as you are! And you have been
   moved with strong resolutions towards repentance and faith and yet you
   are the same as ever and not one inch closer to salvation! You are
   still in darkness, still under the dominion of Satan, still the slave
   of sin and so, I fear, you will be in 10 more years! And so you will be
   to the end of life--and so forever and forever! May God grant that my
   words may not be prophetic concerning any one of you, but that you may,
   this very day, be moved by the Eternal Spirit to take decided action
   through His Grace. "Now then, do it."

   II. I therefore pass on to the second part, to RECOMMEND DECIDED
   ACTION. "You sought for David in times

   past to be king over you, now then, do it." No longer stand thinking,
   questioning, hesitating, halting--but now then, do it! Do one thing or
   the other! If God is God, serve Him! If Baal is God or the devil is
   God, serve him. Do not sit down forever in this absurd condition of
   believing a thing to be right and yet neglecting it--of feeling
   yourself to be in danger and not seeking to escape by the way which you
   admit to be safe and fitting! Come, now, to something like honest
   dealing with yourself and with your Lord.

   Note the business on hand--it is that Jesus should be King over you. It
   was necessary that David should become king, or else he could not
   rescue Israel from the Philistines and, in your case, Jesus must be
   King or He cannot be your Savior. Thousands of people are quite willing
   to be saved by Christ, but when it comes to the first step, namely,
   that Jesus must be accepted as Ruler, Lawgiver, Master, King and Lord,
   then they start back and reject Eternal Life--

   "Yet know (nor of the terms complain),

   Where Jesus comes, He comes to reign!

   To reign, and with no partial sway--

   Thoughts must be slain that disobey." The whole question of your being
   saved or lost will turn on this--if Jesus is not your King, then the
   devil will remain enthroned in your heart--and you will remain a lost
   soul! But if your heart will yield itself up to the supreme authority
   of King Jesus, then the work of salvation has already commenced and
   Jesus will take care to purge your nature of all His enemies until you
   shall be an empire in which He, alone, shall reign in holiness and
   peace! Jesus must be king! What do you say, Sir, Madame--shall it be
   so? Do you hesitate about it? He must be your Lord and Master. His will
   must be your will. His commands must be law to you and His example
   must, from now on, be the model of your life. Do you disagree, or will
   you yield at once?

   Next, notice that if Christ is to be your King, it must be by your own
   act and deed. So says the text concerning King David--"Now then, do
   it." David would not be king over Israel unless Israel was willing that
   he should be king. And our Lord Jesus Christ is no forced monarch over
   one single human heart--the promise is, "Your people shall be willing
   in the day of Your power." The Kingdom of Christ over men's hearts is a
   kingdom of love, not a kingdom of force! There must be the full assent
   and consent of the will to the reigning power of Christ in the soul or
   else He does not reign at all! What do you say--yes, or no? Are you
   willing that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, should, from now on, rule
   and reign over your entire nature as your heart's supreme Lord?

   That is the question! Let it be settled once and for all! You have
   sometimes sought to have it so, "now then, do it." And here is the
   point, if Jesus is to reign, the old king must go down! It is of no use
   trying to have Ishbosheth and David on the throne at the same time. It
   is impossible to serve sin and to serve Christ! Favorite and
   constitutional sins must be relinquished. I know many persons who say
   that they are under concern of soul whose sincerity I more than
   question, because they continue in known sin--and yet they complain
   that they cannot find peace! How can they? If you meet with a person
   who drinks, on the sly, and is frequently half intoxicated. If you hear
   him say that he cannot find rest in Christ, do you wonder?

   Do you not think that he is a hypocrite? How can men and women
   continually fuddle themselves with drink and yet hope to be children of
   God? Give up your abominable tippling! Do you think Christ is going to
   save sots and let them continue to make beasts of themselves? To prate
   about being saved and in secret worship the bottle is clear lying and
   next door to blasphemy! Talk about having a Savior and continue to get
   drunk? I marvel that you do not perish like Ananias and Sapphira!
   Another man is carrying on his trade in a way which is dishonest and
   yet he whines and cants about not finding peace with God. Do not his
   own words condemn him? What has he to do with peace? How can he
   continue in sin and yet be saved from sin? Oh, Sirs, be not deceived!
   Your sins and you must part or Jesus will have nothing to do with you!

   Do you think so badly of my Lord as to dream that He will pander to
   your passions by giving you liberty to live in sin and yet go to
   Heaven? For shame! Has Christ come to play the lackey to your lusts and
   let you do the work of Satan and then receive the wages of the godly?
   Oh no! There must be a clean sweep of the false to make room for the
   true! We must have no Ishbosheth if David is to be king! Though you may
   not attain perfection, yet in your desires you must be perfect--you
   must, from your heart, put away every single sin--no matter of what
   shape it may be or however pleasurable or painful it may appear. Off
   must come the right arms and out must go the right eyes! It were better
   for you to enter into life maimed and blind than that you should perish
   in your transgressions. The main point, however, is to do it--really
   and at once make Christ Jesus your King! And to this end we must
   believe in Him or trust Him.

   It is this trusting Jesus Christ which is the essential point, for out
   of it grows the repentance which renounces every false way. When a man
   fully and honestly trusts Christ with his soul, he is enabled, from
   that time forward, to hate the sin which he once loved and so he wins
   the mastery over it. He finds a joy in submitting to the holy reign of
   Jesus because he has already trusted Him and believes that he is saved.
   But, alas, many of you do not believe! Indeed you would not be

   persuaded to believe though one rose from the dead! How many times have
   I spoken from this platform to some of you about this matter? How many
   times have you wished and resolved and all that?

   We have had enough of this trifling! This morning I would push you on
   to a decision and address you in these words--"Now then, do it! NOW
   THEN, DO IT!" You reply that you wish you could. Away with your
   wishes--"Now then, do it!" "But," you say--out with your "buts!" DO IT!
   "But, Sir"--I say again, no more of your, "but, Sirs!" DO IT! DO IT,
   and DO IT NOW! The blessed and eternal Spirit who has brought you to
   this point, this morning, and who urges me to press this question upon
   you waits to help you. When your whole soul wills to do it, He will be
   with you and you will do it--and Christ shall be enthroned in your
   hearts to reign there forever!

   I fear that many do not mean to do it, at any rate not just now. They
   will not say, "No," but they hesitate and that is much the same thing.
   O, my Friend, the day will come when God will take your hesitation for
   a final negative! I believe it often happens to men that though they
   have not deliberately said, "No," yet having no heart for the Gospel
   and only trifling with God by pretences, they mean to obey Him
   by-and-by. But He has, at last, taken the meaning of their delay and
   regarded it as final rejection and left them to themselves so that they
   have perished in their sin. I beseech you, delay no more, but, "now
   then, do it."

   The sooner it is done the better. Until the deed is done, remember, you
   are undone! Till Christ is accepted by you as King. Till sin is hated
   and Jesus is trusted, you are under another king. Whatever you may
   think of it, the devil is your master! You say you do not like him, but
   he is your master and lord, for all that, since he leads you captive at
   his will. Till Jesus reigns in your heart, you are, also, in the utmost
   danger--in danger of death and eternal punishment! Let your breath go
   the wrong way, or let your heart cease beating just for a little--and
   you will be in Hell! My Friends, you will be in HELL! You who sought
   for Jesus in times past, you who felt those good desires, you, the
   beloved child of Christian parents, you the earnest hearer at the House
   of God, you who are fond of sermons, but are, I fear, sermon-hardened--
   you, even you--will sink down to Hell with all those privileges like
   millstones about your neck!

   "Well, Sir, I will think about it." Under cover of that promise there
   lurks delay and that is exactly what I am afraid of. Do not so much
   think, as ACT. "Now then, do it." I beseech you to make serious and
   immediate business of it! Perhaps if it is not done at this moment, it
   never will be done. For all these long years nothing has been actually
   done-- though so much has been proposed--and this mainly because of
   your perpetual delays. What has come of all your fine resolutions? What
   is the good of a mere resolve? A man resolves that he will be
   industrious, but if he continues to lie on the bed of the sluggard, is
   he any more thrifty? A man is sick and resolves to take medicine, but
   leaves it untasted--is he benefited by his intention? A man resolves to
   go on a journey, but does not take the trouble to get into the public
   conveyance, or to use his limbs--what progress does he make? Does he
   not abide just where he was?

   All this bears upon your case! You know it does! All this, while Jesus
   is being rejected! We do not sufficiently think of the dishonor done to
   Jesus by base delays. All the while that Israel did not accept David as
   king, David was being badly treated. He who fought the Philistines for
   them. He whose valor was Israel's right arm, whose band of men was the
   sword and shield of the nation against the Philistines was being kept
   away from his rightful throne, his merits forgotten, his claims
   ignored. Soul, by refusing Him His Throne, you are treating Jesus
   badly! Your wavering between two opinions is setting Him in rivalry
   with foul sin and a base world--and upon you daily guilt is coming--a
   guilt which grows thicker and blacker as time rolls on.

   Think of your previous impulses and as you consider them, answer me
   this question--were they wrong? When, in your childhood, you felt such
   strong desires after Christ, were they not commendable desires? Why,
   then, do you not carry them out? If you were wrong in stopping them,
   then why should you continue to act so unwisely? If they are returning
   now, why not heartily entertain them? Remember, moreover, that though
   you had these holy impulses, they passed away. Have you any reason to
   hope that they will continue with you now? Will they not, again, melt
   into thin air? Unless God, the almighty Spirit, at this time shall lead
   you to take decided steps, you will resolve again today, and
   re-resolve, but continue, still, the same! Of all things, the most
   pitiable sight, to my mind, is a man who has light enough to know he is
   wrong but not Grace enough to forsake the evil!

   It is terrible to see a soul under impulses which urge it towards the
   right and yet remaining a captive to that accursed free will which
   enslaves it to the last degree. Alas, how many put bitter for sweet and
   sweet for bitter and, therefore, will not come to Christ that they
   might have life? Such is the state of man! Such is the state of some of
   you! May God have

   mercy upon you for Christ's sake! It is mine, however, to return
   distinctly to the charge of my text and say, "Now then, do it." Oh,
   Sirs, I wish you would do as one did a little while ago. I was
   preaching and I said that if any man sincerely went to God confessing
   his sin and just trusted Christ to save him--if He did not save him I
   wished he would write me a note to let me know it, for I had been so
   accustomed to declare that He would not cast out any that came to Him
   that I should like to know if I was laboring under an error.

   There was one in my audience who went deliberately home and, kneeling
   at his bedside, he said, with all his heart, " I do confess my
   guiltiness before You, O God, and I do now trust myself with Christ
   that He may save me. Lord, cast me not away, for I believe in Your
   Son." He found peace immediately and continued to feel the love of God
   shed abroad in his soul! And he, therefore, thought it right to tell me
   the good news. It greatly cheered me. Instead of being rejected, he was
   welcomed by the God of Mercy and found immediate acceptance in Christ
   Jesus! I remember to have said that if one believing soul was cast out
   by Christ and sent to Hell, I would engage to lie side by side with him
   in the quenchless fire forever and ever.

   I repeat the pledge! If any of you perish repenting of your sin and
   trusting in Jesus, alone, I will perish with you! I will be bondsman
   for God, this morning, that if any one of you will humble himself
   before the Lord and simply trust His Son whom you accept to be your
   King and your Savior, He can no more reject you than He can cease to
   be, for so it is written, "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast
   out." "Now then, do it." There is life in a look at the Crucified One!
   The Lord help you to look at the Crucified One at once! "Now then, do
   it." Dream not of believing tomorrow or next year--nor even in
   half-an-hour's time--but cast your guilty soul on Christ at once! NOW
   THEN, DO IT! While the Spirit of God now pervades this assembly, yield
   yourself to the silver scepter which is held in the pierced hand of the
   once crucified King and you shall live! Now then, do it!

   III. Lastly, I have to REASON WITH STRONG ARGUMENTS. I will utter them
   rapidly, for time fails me. Here they are in a condensed form. You,
   dear Friend, need salvation! Sin has got the mastery over your nature
   and you need a powerful arm to set you free from it. Nor is it sin,
   alone, but punishment, also, which threatens you. Be you who you may,
   you are in danger of eternal wrath and you need to be saved from it!
   Now, it is evident that none can save you from eternal wrath but King
   Jesus. Will you have Him for King?

   Whether you will have Him or not, you must have a king. Every man in
   the world has a master of some kind. Some principle or another has
   dominion over you and the worst tyrant a man can serve is himself. Self
   is the hardest and meanest of all despots! Seeing, then, that you must
   have a king, can you have a better king than King Jesus, who is
   Incarnate Love? Think of His Character and of the love He has shown to
   men and tell me, could you have a better King? Have you not already had
   enough, my Friend, of your old king? What benefit have you had in the
   service of Satan? What advantage has sin been to you? What elevation of
   mind, what delight of spirit have you found in the ways of
   transgression? The times past may suffice you to have worked the will
   of the flesh. Down with Ishbosheth and let David reign!

   Here is the point about the King whom we preach to you--God has chosen
   Him to be King and proclaimed it in His everlasting decree! He has
   said--"You have to get My king upon My holy hill of Zion." Can man make
   a better choice than God has made? The Eternal Father has looked upon
   His Only Begotten and made Him to be King of kings and Lord of
   lords--will you not say, "Hosanna! Blessed is He that comes in the name
   of the Lord!" Will you not accept Him for your King, whom Jehovah,
   Himself, proclaims as such? I want you to notice the promise of the
   text, for this commends the Lord Jesus to all who are wise in heart. It
   is through Him that God will deliver you from your enemies, even from
   all of them.

   Philistia's giants feared David, who cried, "over Philistia will I
   triumph." Your sins, your sorrows, death, the devil--all these, the Son
   of David overcomes for you. If He is accepted as King, you need fear no
   adversary, for He will guard you with His great power and utterly
   confuse your enemies. Oh, Sirs, kiss the Son! With the kiss of homage
   accept the Prince of Peace! Crown Him with your heart's love. Bow at
   His dear feet and be content to yield the utmost loyalty to Him. May
   the blessed Spirit sweetly draw you while I am persuading you and may
   you now approach the Throne of the Prince of the House of David and be
   forever His joyful subjects!

   Will you now turn to the 5th chapter of this second book of Samuel for
   one minute and see if we cannot all join in a reproduction of the scene
   which it describes. I wish and pray that the words of that passage may
   come true--"Then came

   all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron and spoke, saying,
   Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. Also in time past, when Saul
   was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel. And
   the Lord said to you, You shall feed My people Israel, and you shall be
   a captain over Israel."

   Many in this house will join with me in accepting our Lord Jesus, over
   again, to be our King, and I wish some of you who have never yet
   accepted Him would unite with us. We shall be glad to see others of the
   tribes of Israel entering our ranks for the first time, while we salute
   our King. May the blessed Spirit lead you to do so, while now I say, in
   the name of all His people here present, "Glorious Lord Jesus, behold
   we are Your bone and Your flesh, and we delight to acknowledge the
   condescending kinship! In time past, when sin and Satan ruled over us,
   You were still the lover of our souls and You did redeem us and make
   war on our account. We bless You for the great love which You had to
   us, even when we were dead in sin. The Lord has said to You, You shall
   feed My people, You shall be a Captain over Israel, and we gladly
   accept You as the Lord's Anointed. Feed us, O Shepherd of Israel! Lead
   us, O Captain of the host! Behold, we enlist beneath Your banner--be a
   Captain over us today, for we are Yours and Yours alone--and before the
   eyes of God, Your Father, we give ourselves up, spirit, soul and body,
   to be Yours forever and ever! We are, from now on, not our own, for You
   have bought us with a price."

   All this has long ago been done by many of us. We are only repeating
   the declaration which we have made hundreds of times before. Oh that
   some of you poor souls would hear the voice which says--"Now then, do
   it." To give you words with which to do it, we will all sing the
   verse--

   "'Tis done, the great transaction's done!

   I am my Lord's, and He is mine!

   He drew me, and I followed on,

   Charmed to confess the voice Divine.'"

   May the Lord bless you. Amen.

The True Priesthood, Temple and Sacrifice

   (No. 1376)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 30, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed, indeed, of men,
   but chosen of God, and precious, you also, as living stones, are built
   up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
   sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." 1 Peter 2:4,5.

   AT the outset I call your special attention to the connection of the
   two verses. "To whom coming, as unto a living stone...you also, as
   living stones, are built up." Or, "To whom coming...are built up...an
   holy priesthood." Everywhere throughout Scripture the connection
   between the saints and their Head is perpetually mentioned. "In Christ"
   is the very symbol of New Testament writers. Whatever choice and good
   things are mentioned concerning the saints, their privileges and
   honors, we are always reminded that they are only enjoyed in connection
   with the Lord Jesus, according as the Father has blessed us in Him and
   made us to be accepted in the Beloved.

   Coming to Him as a Foundation, we become a temple! Coming to Him as the
   Holy One of Israel we become an holy priesthood! And resting in His
   sacrifice we, also, offer spiritual sacrifices. Coming close to
   Him--for such is the force of the word--coming closer and closer, we
   grow up in all things into Him and become perfect in Christ Jesus.
   Realizing and consciously enjoying our vital union with Him, we obtain
   promises, receive blessings, possess privileges and exercise offices
   which can only be ours in union with our Lord. It is only by coming to
   our great Covenant Foundation and, only in proportion as we daily come
   to Him and rest upon Him, that God dwells in us as in a temple.

   It is only as we are seen in union with the Apostle and High Priest of
   our profession that the Father allows us to serve Him as priests and
   accepts the sacrifices which we present. Let this Truth of God be
   always in your view because there are many who judge us otherwise. The
   true judgment of any man is how he stands towards Christ, whether he is
   in Him and believes in Him or not. If he believes on the Lord Jesus, he
   is in Him and he is, by coming to Him, built up as a part of the
   spiritual house. But if he is not in Christ, he may call himself by
   what name he pleases and may assume this or that lofty pretension, but
   he boasts himself beyond his line and beyond the truth.

   Union to Christ is the test of union with the true Church. If we are
   members of the most orthodox Church in Christendom it will avail us
   nothing unless we are spiritually joined to Christ, Himself. Without
   Christ we can do nothing and we are nothing. There are some who judge
   us because we don't follow them. They cry, "The temple of the Lord, the
   temple of the Lord are we." They claim to be "the Church" beyond whose
   pale there can be no salvation. Brothers and Sisters, regard them not,
   for if you are in Christ, you are built up as a spiritual house and so
   are a portion of the true Church. If you have come to Jesus by a living
   faith and if it is your daily practice to come to your Lord and live
   upon Him and unto Him, you are priests unto God and need not mind the
   censure of those who are ordained of men.

   There are others who condemn us because we reject the pomp of their
   ceremonies, the prestige of their State connection and the
   venerableness of their antiquity. These have weight with the unlearned
   and unspiritual, but those who are taught of God discern the vanity of
   their boasts! Be not moved by their judgment, no, not for an hour, for
   if you, indeed, come to the Lord Jesus, you are built up by Himself
   into a spiritual house--and that which He does, does not lack for honor
   or reverence. It is enough of prestige and of antiquity for us to be
   accepted by our Lord Jesus! "Unto you that believe, He is honor."

   Whether your critics are so or not, you are, beyond question, living
   stones built up a spiritual house, if, indeed, you are evermore coming
   to your Lord. There are some who in the serenity of their
   infallibility, because we cannot endorse their creed or pronounce their
   shibboleth, straightway cut us off and count us to be mere pretenders.
   But if we are in our very heart coming to Christ. If He is the end of
   our conversation. If we make Him Alpha and Omega and if He is to us the

   beginning and the end of all things, we may make small account of the
   condemnation or the approval of the best of our brethren, since we are
   in Christ and so we are a spiritual house built up for the inhabiting
   of God!

   I remember an anecdote of the Jesuit Fathers of the South Seas which
   illustrates this. When they intruded themselves upon a native
   population who had been converted to Christ, they began to instruct
   them in their Popish idolatries by means of pictures and, among the
   rest, showed them a famous tree. The natives asked, "What is this?" "It
   sets forth the Church." "And what is this root?" "O that is Jesus
   Christ." "And this trunk, what is that?" "That is the succession of the
   Popes, who are the vicars of Christ." "And these great branches, what
   are these?" "They are the cardinals." "And these branches, what are
   they?" "They are the bishops of the Church." "And what are these small
   branches and little twigs?" "They are the priests and the faithful."
   "And what are these poor twigs which are cut off and are falling into
   the fire?" "They are the heretics--such as Martin Luther, Calvin, and
   the like."

   The natives looked at the picture for a while, rubbed their eyes,
   declared that they did not understand much about it, but with great
   glee exclaimed--"It is all right with us, for we have the root! We have
   the root!" So we can say if we have come to Jesus Christ our Lord, we
   are growing out of the root and we need have no doubt as to our being
   in the right place. The branch which grows out of Him must be a true
   branch of the vine! The stone which rests upon Him as a foundation must
   be a true part of the spiritual temple! Our only hope lies in our being
   of Him and in Him--we know no other.

   Whatever the dignity which men ascribe unto themselves apart from Him,
   verily, I say unto you, we know them not, neither do we give place for
   subjection to them. They may tell us of what they are, but we only know
   what Jesus is! It is written, "The sheep hear His voice and a stranger
   they will not follow, for they know not the voice of strangers." We
   know not the many strange voices which are in the world, of those who
   would have us follow them and yield to their authority. But we know the
   voice of the great King in Zion and we rejoice to feel that if we are
   found in Him we are accepted in Him! And in Him, today, as living
   stones, we are built up a spiritual house.

   I propose, this morning, to show that we who are in Christ have the
   reality of all that which Ritualism pretends to possess. The votaries
   of that faith delight in the shadow, but we have the substance! For,
   first, we are a temple-- "built up a spiritual house." Secondly, we are
   a priesthood-- "an holy priesthood." And thirdly, we have our own
   peculiar sacrifices-- "to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to
   God by Jesus Christ."

   I. First then, all those who are coming to Christ--daily coming nearer
   and nearer to Him--are, as living stones, built up into A TEMPLE. The
   saints in their corporate capacity are a holy temple unto the Lord.
   They are called a spiritual house in opposition to the old material
   house in which the emblem of the Divine Presence shone forth in the
   midst of Israel--that temple in which the Jew delighted--counting it to
   be beautiful for situation and the joy of the whole earth. We have
   nothing to do with material temples now--we are quite clear of that,
   for the typical has given way to the real and spiritual.

   Solomon's Temple, itself, is always to be spoken of with honor, seeing
   that God did, for a time, make it the center of His worship, yet it
   must not be too highly honored, for God never had any great delight in
   its magnificence and worked but few mighty deeds amid its splendors.
   You remember that when David proposed to build it, the Lord seemed
   rather to yield to the weakness of His servant than to rejoice in the
   proposal, for He said, "For I have not dwelt in an house since the day
   that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to
   tent, and from one tabernacle to another. Wherever I have walked with
   all Israel, spoke I a word to any of the Judges of Israel, whom I
   commanded to feed My people, saying, Why have you not built Me an house
   of cedars?"

   The Lord sought not for such a palace, nor, when it was built, did He
   much regard it, for He says by His servant Isaiah, "Thus says the Lord,
   the Heaven is My Throne and the earth is My footstool; where is the
   house that you build unto Me? And where is the place of My rest? For
   all those things has My hand made, and all those things have been, says
   the Lord; but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of
   contrite spirit, and trembles at My Word." Stephen in the latter day,
   when he was rehearsing the history of Israel, alludes to the Temple,
   but he carefully guards himself from being supposed to attach any great
   importance to it. He says, "But Solomon built Him a house. However, the
   Most High dwells not in temples made with hands" and goes on to quote
   the passage from the Prophet which I have just mentioned.

   When the Apostles sat down opposite the Temple which Herod had
   renovated, they were filled with wonder at the great stones of which it
   was made. But our Lord did not seem at all to sympathize in their
   admiration of its glories--

   rather, He said, "There shall not be left one stone upon another that
   shall not be thrown down." Had God cared for the Temple, He could have
   preserved it to this day, but lo, like a dream of night it has passed
   away! And no order has since been given to the servants of the Lord to
   build temples. We have nobler work to do in building up the spiritual
   house and need not be occupied with gorgeous architecture of buildings
   made with hands!

   I fear that the pretentious architecture which is now so much in vogue
   for professedly Christian places of worship is only one of those evil
   signs of the times which indicate a departure from inward and spiritual
   worship. The Prophet Hosea said of old, "Israel has forgotten his Maker
   and builds temples." There is, I fear, too much going back to the
   beggarly elements of outward and materialistic worship and a receding
   from pure spiritual adoration. Even the purer sort are hankering after
   visible show and the delights of music and the fine arts as accessories
   to worship. God, the Everlasting One, has beneath yon blue canopy
   studded with a thousand stars, a far more glorious temple than all that
   architects shall plan, or wealth of builders and skill of masons shall
   ever be able to build!

   All man's architecture is but child's play compared with the great
   universe of God which is the temple of the Infinite! And what seems to
   us the most enchanting music must surely be but discord in His ears. It
   is significant that of Heaven, where God is best worshipped, John says,
   "I saw no temple there." Where every place is holy, what need is there
   of a temple? And where every being shall be perfect and forever full of
   adoring love, there shall be no need of any select shrine or settled
   hour of assembly! When we become holy, as we should be, we shall count
   all places and all hours to be the Lord's! And we shall always dwell in
   His Temple because God is everywhere.

   For one spot to be holy and not another is but to show how much of the
   earth we resign to the devil! From this dreary superstition, I pray
   you, shake yourselves loose! We have not so learned Christ as to count
   one edifice more sacred than another, for we know Him as cleansing all
   places and things and from now on nothing to us is common or
   unclean--except only as sin defiles and spreads pollution. We are,
   then, a spiritual temple in opposition to all material temples, even
   that of Solomon included among the rest. We are a spiritual temple, but
   not the less real. That which is spiritual is sometimes supposed to be
   mythical and imaginary, but indeed, it is not so. The things which are
   seen are the shadowy and the dreamy--the things which are not seen are
   the substantial and the eternal!

   Our Lord Jesus called His body the Temple of God. He said, "Destroy
   this Temple and I will build it in three days." As a Temple of God, the
   body of Christ was most real. There was no fiction about His humanity.
   The Word was made flesh and tabernacled among us, so that the Apostle
   John says, "We beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of
   the Father, full of Grace and truth." His perfect body was a true
   Temple which God had pitched and not men--and just as true and real is
   the spiritual Temple of which the text speaks. With equal truth the
   Apostle Paul tells us that our bodies are "the temple of the Holy
   Spirit, which is in us"--and that not by imagination but in reality, as
   the context of that expression proves, since he, therefore, bids us
   avoid all fornication (1 Cor. 6:18, 19). He would not use a mere fancy
   as a practical reason for guarding the purity of our bodies! The force
   of the argument must lie in its truthfulness and so the bodies of the
   saints are really and, indeed, temples of the Holy Spirit.

   Moreover, the whole Church together, the whole body of the elect, the
   whole company of the redeemed, regenerate and called are, "built
   together for an habitation of God through the Spirit," and this, also,
   is most real. Read verses 16 and 17 in the First of Corinthians and the
   3rd chapter. "Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the
   Spirit of God dwells in you? If any man defiles the temple of God, him
   shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you
   are." Surely this cannot relate to a fiction or a dream--or the
   punishment for defiling a mere notion would hardly be so terrible. Yet
   while real, the Temple of God in the saints is spiritual. A Church is
   made up of spiritual men and her temple form is spiritual. Your eyes
   cannot, as yet, see the Church in which God dwells.

   Words have come to be so misused, nowadays that they call a steeple and
   a building made of stone or brick and mortar a Church--which cannot
   possibly be correct--for a Church is a company of faithful men. Alas,
   they have yet further perverted language and make a company of
   ecclesiastics, whether regenerated or not, to be "the Church." "Going
   into the Church" is a current phrase which shows the ignorance of those
   who use it! Nor is this all--there is no one visible Church which can
   claim to be the Church. I tell you the Church of Jesus Christ differs
   greatly from these associations which are called Churches! The visible
   Church contains a large part of the true Church of Christ, but it is
   not identical with it. Like its Lord, the Church is as yet hidden and
   the creation, itself, waits for the manifestation of the sons

   of God.

   The Lord has a people scattered abroad everywhere, whose lives are hid
   with Him in God--and these make up the real Temple of God in which the
   Lord dwells. Men of every name and clime and age are quickened into
   life, made living stones and then laid upon Christ. These constitute
   the true Temple which God has built--not man! God dwells not in temples
   made with hands, that is to say, of man's building--He dwells in a
   Temple which He Himself has built for His habitation forever,
   saying--"This is My rest forever. Here will I dwell, for I have desired
   it."

   This temple is spiritual and, therefore, it is living. A material
   temple is dead. A spiritual temple must be alive and so the text tells
   us, "You, also, as living stones." I cannot understand why the
   translators put the word, "lively," since it is precisely the same word
   in the original as above where they have translated it, "a living
   stone." Those good men wished to infuse a little variety into their
   version, but this was hardly justifiable in interpreters who ought to
   have given us the exact meaning. They should have left the sacred style
   to take care of itself--even its monotony is more refreshing than the
   variety of any other book! True Believers are stones full of life, so
   joined to Christ as to be part of the live Rock, filled with spiritual
   vitality!

   God has quickened them from the dead! The Holy Spirit has come to take
   possession of them and whereas they were dead in trespasses, they now
   live by the living Seed which God has put into them--and the life that
   they live in the flesh is the life of Christ within them. "I live, yet
   not I," said the Apostle, "but Christ lives in me." Can your eyes of
   faith see that Temple of God made up of living men and women--not alive
   through the life of the First Adam--but alive through that Second Adam,
   of whom it is said, "The Second Adam is made a quickening Spirit"? Put
   these live people together in an organization which allows free action
   to the life within and you have before you the Divine Cathedral in
   which Jehovah dwells forever and ever! We are a spiritual house, my
   Brothers and Sisters, and, therefore, spiritually built up!

   Peter says, "You are built up"--built up by spiritual means. You cannot
   force men and women under rule and call them a Church--even if they
   come together willingly--they will not be a temple for the Lord unless
   the Divine Spirit shall fitly frame them together. God's Temple does
   not build itself, neither does man build it, but it is the sole work of
   God! The Spirit of God quarries out of the pit of nature the stones
   which are as yet dead, separating them from the mass to which they
   adhered. He gives them life and then He fashions, squares and polishes
   them. And then they, without sound of axe or hammer, are brought, each
   one, to their appointed place and built up into Christ Jesus!

   The old heathen fable says the music of Orpheus was so sweet that as he
   poured forth the mellifluous sounds, the rocks began to dance around
   him--and as he continued to play, they piled themselves up into a
   temple at his bidding! This is true of our Lord Jesus--the music of
   whose Divine Word by the Spirit brings us stones from different parts
   of the fields in which we lay and fits us together, stone to His stone,
   till a holy temple in the Lord arises to His praise! May the Holy
   Spirit work among us in this manner and may we all become indwelt by
   the ever-blessed Spirit. As you and I, who have long been brought into
   the Church, think of how we became built upon the Foundation, let us
   praise the hand which laid us in our places!

   And as we cling closer and closer to the great Cornerstone to whom we
   are always coming, let us bless Him that the same love which, in the
   beginning, cemented us to the Cornerstone still holds us in our place
   so firmly that none shall separate us! We are a spiritual house, dear
   Friends and, therefore, the more fit for the indwelling of God who is a
   Spirit. It is impossible, if you consider for a moment, to conceive of
   God dwelling within walls! The roof may be of cedar and the walls of
   polished marble overlaid with fine gold, but can Omnipresence be
   enclosed by a wall or surmounted by a roof? The Infinite, who fills all
   things and who makes all things--who stretches out the heavens like a
   tent to dwell in, who rides on the wings of the wind--does He dwell
   within walls of man's building?

   It can only be in some typical sense that He can be said to abide in a
   temple--but that He should dwell within spiritual beings whom He has
   created in His own image--that He should dwell in intellect, thought,
   love, hope and all those high and spiritual powers which adorn the
   minds of His people is most fitting! A Spirit dwelling in a spiritual
   house! A Spirit inhabiting other spirits and making them all to be
   resplendent with His excellence--this is a beautiful conception and, by
   no means, impossible to realize. Within the assemblies of the saints,
   God is known, loved, remembered and consulted. In the Church He is
   heartily worshipped, for all true worship is in the hearts of His
   people and all else is mockery. Not at your altars, O you that pile up
   your hewn stones! Not under your groaning arches, O you who seek to
   show the skill of the stonemason! But in your hearts, Believers, where
   God's skill and power are seen--there is God worshipped, whether you
   are in cathedrals or by the wayside.

   Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, "the hour comes when you shall
   neither in this mountain of Gerizim, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
   Father, but the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and
   in truth, for the Father seeks such to worship Him." Material temples
   are abolished and a spiritual temple is instituted! It is in the Church
   that God reveals Himself. If you would know the Lord's love and power
   and Grace, you must get among His people, hear their experiences, learn
   from them how God deals with them and let them tell you, if you have
   Grace to understand them, the height, depth, length and breadth of the
   love of Christ which passes knowledge, for He manifests Himself to them
   as He does not to the world. Has He not said, "I will dwell in them and
   walk in them"? And it is out of the Church, the spiritual palace of
   God, that His glory shines forth among men!

   The promise of the 110th Psalm is, "The Lord shall send the rod of Your
   strength out of Zion; rule You in the midst of Your enemies." If you
   desire to see God's spiritual power, you will discern it best by seeing
   how it is exerted in and through spiritual men and spiritual women,
   built up together as a spiritual house! The Church of Christ is the
   camp from which the armies of the Lord go forth to conquer the nations!
   It is the pavilion in which the Prince of Peace has fixed His
   headquarters during this last crusade. If you ask for the center of the
   nations. If you would discover the eye and soul of this poor world. If
   you would gladly see the glory and excellence of the sons of men, find
   out the quickened stones that God has built together and you will see
   the habitation of the great King!

   But I must now bring you back to the point from which I started, that
   all this is in subordination to Christ, "To whom coming, as unto a
   living stone, disallowed, indeed, of men, but chosen of God and
   precious, you also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house."
   You live because He lives! You are a building because He is the
   Cornerstone! You are honored because, "to you that believe He is
   honor." Of Him and through Him are all things. You are no member of the
   Church unless you are a member of Christ! You are not a living stone
   unless you live by the life of Christ. You are not built up unless you
   are built up on Him.

   "What do you think of Christ?" That is the test of your whole state. Is
   He your Savior, your All in All? If He is, then, by this sign do you
   know that God has built you up into His Temple. But if not, you are
   cast forth as a rejected stone. God grant us Grace to realize as a
   Church that we are a Temple of God--and realize it best by coming daily
   to Christ more and more closely--that we may be vitally one with Him.

   II. In addition to being a temple, God's people are said to be A
   PRIESTHOOD. Observe that they are spoken of together and not merely us
   individuals. They make up one indivisible priesthood--each one is a
   priest, but all standing together they are a priesthood, by virtue of
   their being one with Christ. "For we, being many, are one body in
   Christ." Never let us cease to walk in unity and love, for we are all
   one in Christ Jesus--and what God has joined together let no man put
   asunder. We are "an holy priesthood."

   This stands in opposition to the nominal and worldly priesthood. I
   think I see the world's priests, decorated with many different robes
   and ornaments! A gallant show, indeed, for fools to stare at! I see
   them with their garments of all colors. I see them with their shaved
   heads or unshaven, as the case may be. These are the priests of Baal!
   They are mere mimics, servants of a visible shrine, servitors of idols!
   These are not the priests of the living God, who is a Spirit and is
   served by spiritual priests! It is of these outward priests that He
   says, "He that offers an oblation is as if he offered swine's blood and
   he that burns incense as if he blessed an idol." There are no priests,
   now, except those who are in Christ--and this priesthood belongs to all
   Believers alike!

   When a man comes forward and claims that he is a priest, beyond and
   above the sense in which all Christians are so, we spit upon his lie!
   We utterly loathe the idea of fellowship with such falsehood and we
   regard the poor mortal as going back to the elements of old Judaism, if
   not turning aside altogether unto Antichrist! All men and women who are
   in Christ, believing in Him, become sanctified by His Spirit, and so
   they become--not some of them but all of them-- priests and kings unto
   God through Christ Jesus! This they are, not in themselves in any way,
   nor by any derivation of Grace from men by Apostolic succession and the
   like, but by the personal and direct union with their great High
   Priest, in whom, alone, they become an holy priesthood unto God--

   "Blest inhabitants of Zion, Washed in the Redeemer's blood! Jesus, whom
   their souls rely on, Makes them kings and priests to God. 'Tis His love
   His people raises

   Over self to reign as kings

   And as priests.

   His solemn praises

   Each for a thank-offering brings." This priesthood is most real,
   although it is not of the outward and visible order, for God's priests
   become priests after a true and notable fashion. The priests of Aaron's
   line were priests by birth and so are we--born-again with a high and
   spiritual birth which brings the priesthood with it! In that day when
   we were begotten, again, unto a lively hope by the Resurrection of
   Jesus Christ from the dead, we assumed our spiritual priesthood. We are
   priests by anointing, too, for if the Spirit of God does not dwell in
   us, neither are we priests of God by whatever names we may aspire to be
   called. But where the Spirit of God, with His Divine anointing has
   descended, that man, that woman, has become a priest unto the living
   God, for in Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female, but of
   whatever sex we are, we are, alike, qualified to exercise this
   priesthood. If we have been anointed of the Holy Spirit, our orders are
   received from Heaven and none can make them void.

   And we have, also, been consecrated. Brothers and Sisters, I shall
   leave it to yourselves as to the reality of that consecration, but some
   of us can solemnly declare that if anything was ever true in our lives,
   it was the giving up of ourselves to God. The priest of old was touched
   with the blood upon his ear--and is not your ear the Lord's to hear His
   Word? The blood was, also, smeared upon his thumb--and is not your hand
   the Lord's, with all its dexterity and force consecrated to Him? He
   was, also, marked with blood upon his big toe, to show that his feet
   belonged to the Lord. And is it not so with you? Do you not feel that
   you would run on His commandments, that you would work in His service
   and that you would listen to the voice of His Word? You acknowledge
   that you are His. You confess that you are not your own but bought with
   a price and, therefore, you present yourselves to Him to be forever His
   in spirit, soul and body. This consecration is a proof of the actual
   process by which you are, in very deed, constituted priests unto God.

   We are priests, Beloved Friends, in the aspect of priesthood towards
   God. Priesthood meant in Israel that these men were set apart to speak
   with God on behalf of the rest of the congregation. They had to offer
   the daily sacrifices and kindle the fire of the incense. Now, you who
   believe in Christ are all priests--priests for mankind--to speak for
   them to God. As man is spokesman for a dumb world, so are you
   intercessors for a sinful race. Whereas fields and hills and rocks and
   cattle cannot speak, nor even the surging waves of the sea--man is the
   world's eye and heart and tongue to speak for them all! But, alas, men,
   themselves, have become as dumb as driven cattle towards God! And as
   dead as the earth they tread upon.

   But you, quickened into life, are to be the priesthood of the universe,
   the ordained intercessors for the sons of men. You are to speak with
   God on man's behalf and bring down, each of you, according to the
   measure of your faith, the blessing upon the sons of men among whom you
   dwell. You stand before God to speak for your fellow men--take care
   that you do this with solemn earnestness. And you are priests towards
   men, also, for the priest was selected from among men to exercise
   necessary offices for man's good. The priests' lips should keep
   knowledge and if you are as you should be, you hold fast the faith once
   delivered to the saints. The priests taught God's Word and so, also,
   must you publish among the people the Divine message of Divine Grace.
   As lights, you must shine in the world, holding forth the Word of Life.
   It is yours to be the nation's teachers! God has consecrated you to the
   office--do not neglect it, lest the blood of men's souls should lie at
   your door.

   The priest, in addition to being the instructor of the people, was,
   also, their intercessor. So must you be. Oh, cease not day or night to
   pray for men till God shall send forth His light into the darkest parts
   of the earth! You that make mention of the Lord, keep not silent till
   the time to favor Zion comes. The priests, also, were to awaken the
   people and, therefore, they had the keeping of the silver trumpets. It
   was theirs to blow them on the new moon and to proclaim the Sabbath and
   the Jubilee. It was theirs to give the alarm of war. It was theirs in
   the wilderness to summon the tribes together, to bid them march or bid
   them halt according as the Lord commanded. O, believing men and women,
   you are to awaken the world! God has quickened you, not for your own
   sakes, alone, for no man lives unto himself in this priesthood--but
   that you may have compassion on the ignorant and those that are out of
   the way--and may seek to awaken the careless and lead them to God.

   The priests were to bless the people. It was their prerogative to
   pronounce God's name upon them. Oh, live a blessed life and, as your
   Master rose to Heaven, went there with outstretched hands blessing His
   people, let your course on earth

   be like that of the Ascended One! Pray it will be a life scattering
   blessings among the sons of men and let its closing scene be full of
   love to those you leave below. Thus shall you be practically the holy
   priesthood which God would have you to be. This is to be your function
   and ministry always and in every place. You are an holy priesthood not
   only on the Lord's Day when you come into this house, but at all times!
   What is this house more than any other? You are a priesthood everywhere
   at all times, owing nothing to the place you stand in or to the garb
   you wear!

   How this invests the Christian's life with dignity! You are to eat,
   drink, sleep, wake and all along to abide in your priesthood. For you
   the chamber, the parlor, the workshop, the open field and the street
   are to be a place for the exercise of your priestly functions. Do you
   not see that it must be so, for you carry your temple with you? You,
   yourselves, make the temple, for you are the Temple of God. You are
   always in your temple, for your body is your temple. You are always in
   your temple, for you are built up into it and stones do not move when
   once built up--so that wherever you dwell, you are in the place of
   service and worship.

   Do you live up to this, my Brothers and Sisters? Do you seek to do so?
   Do you make your ordinary meals into sacraments? Do you turn the common
   garments of your toil into vestments? Do you make your speech to be an
   offering of the sacrifice of thanksgiving? Do you cause your thoughts
   to be as a sweet perfume of incense unto the Most High? This is why you
   are called--to be an holy priesthood. Unholiness in you is a slight
   upon the office with which God has invested you! Unholiness in you is
   as though the High Priest put off His garments of beauty and glory and
   robed Himself in the garments of a fool!

   Now, Brethren, I call you back to the point from which we started. You
   are an holy priesthood only as you are in Christ. Christ is the Elect
   of God and you are elect in Him. He is a King and, therefore, you are a
   royal priesthood in Him. He is a holy Prince and you become a holy
   nation in Him. He is God's peculiar treasure and you become a peculiar
   people in Him. All this is in oneness with Him. If you can be severed
   from Christ, you have lost your priesthood. Only as we abide in our
   Lord do we abide in our condition of honor and privilege.

   III. We must now consider the SACRIFICES which we offer--"spiritual
   sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." We offer spiritual
   sacrifices as opposed to the literal. There were sacrifices of bulls
   and goats under the Law, as you right well know, yet the Lord never
   cared much for them, for the Holy Spirit, when He spoke by men of old,
   frequently set these things in the place of small esteem. In an
   evangelical frame of mind, deeply penitent for sin, the Patriarch David
   was able to see the inefficiency of the legal offerings and he wrote
   thus, "You desire not sacrifice, else would I give it. You delight not
   in burnt offering."

   And again he says concerning thanksgiving, "This, also, shall please
   the Lord better than an ox or bullock that has horns and hoofs." To the
   same effect and even more comprehensive, is that expression in the 40th
   Psalm, "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire. Burnt offering and
   sin offering have You not required." And what follows, "Then said I,
   lo, I come. In the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to
   do Your will, O my God; yes, Your Law is within my heart." Upon which
   remarkably clear passage Paul remarks, "He takes away the first," the
   sacrifices, "that He may establish the second," or set up the doing of
   the Divine will by Christ as the great Sacrifice forever. You and I
   bring no lambs or bulls, but we present a real sacrifice which is far
   more pleasing in His sight, for it is written, "The sacrifices of God
   are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not
   despise."

   The text which I have just quoted shows what our sacrifices are, for we
   imitate our Lord and say, "I delight to do Your will, O God." This is
   the true sacrifice! Had not the Lord before spoken by Samuel and said,
   "To obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams"?
   So this day, Beloved, when you do the will of God from your heart--when
   you studiously strive to find out what God's will is and then
   conscientiously endeavor to attend to it--you are as priests offering
   spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

   This sacrificing takes various forms. "I beseech you, Brethren, that
   you present your bodies a living sacrifice." You are to present
   yourselves, spirit, soul and body, as a sacrifice unto God. You are,
   also, to, "do good and to communicate, for with such sacrifices God is
   well-pleased." To Him, also, you are to, "offer the sacrifice of praise
   continually, the fruit of your lips giving glory to God." To the Lord,
   also, you must present the incense of holy prayer. But all these are
   comprehended, I think, in the expression, "I delight to do Your will, O
   God." That scribe spoke discreetly who replied to our Lord that to love
   God with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul,
   with all the strength and to love his neighbor as himself is more than
   whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. Oh, you saints, live to do
   Jehovah's will!

   Lay self aside! Put self-seeking far away! Live wholly to make Jesus
   great, to make His Gospel known and to perform the will of God which is
   your sanctification! Live unto God and so offer unceasing sacrifice!

   We come back to where we began. The text says, "acceptable to God by
   Jesus Christ," and so reminds us of our dependence upon our Lord Jesus.
   You have no sacrifice to bring apart from His sacrifice and it is only
   as you live in the spirit of the self-sacrificing Jesus that you can
   possibly offer unto God such sacrifice as He will accept. I have done
   when I have said this much to you. Beloved Believers, you see your
   honorable office--rejoice therein! Are you poor? Are you obscure? Have
   you to work hard for a living? Nevertheless behave not yourselves
   before the sons of men as though you were of mean degree, for you are
   priests unto God! I delight to think of God's priests working in our
   fields and toiling in our shops, as well as gathered here at this time
   in a holy convocation! God's priests as much in one place as in
   another!

   Such holy priests are all around you. You know them not by their
   wearing a biretta, or by that hideous long coat and Roman dog collar in
   which the world's priests drape themselves! No, you know the priests of
   God by their practical holiness! If you are holy unto God, you have
   your priestly garments on. And if the world disallows you, as it
   disallowed its Lord, and rejects you as a stone not to be built into
   the temple, it does not matter--"The Lord knows them that are His." He
   has built you into your place in His spiritual Temple and He will dwell
   with you, yes, does dwell with you and will abide with you forever!

   See, now, your responsibility and walk circumspectly, because whatever
   you do will be a part of the acts of "the holy priesthood." The priests
   of God must be pure! "Be you clean that bear the vessels of the Lord."
   The Temple of the Lord must not have buyers and sellers and thieves and
   robbers to defile it. Christ would have it purged. This puts you into
   such a responsible position that I would earnestly implore you, "Be you
   perfect, even as your Father in Heaven is perfect." You must set apart,
   to such an office as this, everything about you to be marked with,
   "Holiness unto the Lord."

   And now, see once more what Divine Grace has been bestowed upon you,
   that you should become priests, who in times past were enemies to God!
   You were not a people, but are now the people of God! You had not
   obtained mercy, but have now obtained mercy! You were sometimes in
   darkness, but now you are light in the Lord! You were once the servants
   of Satan, but now you are priests unto God! Go, and so live, that men
   shall say of you, "They are the priests of the Lord." May you show
   forth the virtues of your God and declare His praises!

   You have received the office--honor it, live up to it--pray for Grace
   to fulfill it. Think how it dignifies you, for the text which I quoted,
   just now, says, "Unto you that believe He is honor"--that is the Greek
   word. It is your honor to have Christ for your Savior! It is your honor
   to be Christ's servants! It is your honor to be like Christ! It is your
   honor to be priests through His Grace and, by-and-by, it will be your
   honor to be with Him, world without end! Amen.

Taking Hold of God

   (No. 1377)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 7, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "There is none that calls upon Your name, that stirs up himself to take
   hold of You." Isaiah 64:7.

   ISAIAH, in the chapter before us, describes a very mournful condition
   of the people of God. He feels the case to be so desperate that he
   sighs for a Divine interposition--"Oh that You would rend the heavens,
   that You would come down." He perceives that the people are so steeped
   in slumber, so utterly under the power of their sins that unless God,
   Himself, shall descend with all the power and terror of Sinai, the
   nation will utterly perish through its iniquity, even as withered
   leaves are blown away by the fierce winds. He longed for a melting fire
   to dissolve their hard hearts--for a swift flame such as burns the
   brushwood on the mountain's side to make a speedy end of their false
   confidences--and for a burning heat, such as makes waters boil, to
   remove the lukewarmness of those who professed to worship the Lord.

   I do not know that the condition of the Church of God at the present
   time is quite so bad as that which is here described. It would be wrong
   to boast of our condition, but it would be worse to despair of it. It
   would not be honest to apply the words of our text to the Church of the
   present day. Blessed be God, we could not say, "There is none that
   calls upon Your name, that stirs up himself to take hold of You," for
   there are many who plead day and night for the prosperity of Zion. Yet,
   in a measure, we are somewhat in the same plight as that which is
   described by the Prophet and there is much to mourn over. Prayer
   languishes in many Churches. Power in intercession is by no means a
   common attainment and Prayer Meetings, as a rule, are thinly attended
   and not much thought of. Sin abounds, empty profession is common,
   hypocrisy is plentiful and the life of God in the soul is but little
   esteemed.

   Notice carefully that according to our text the Prophet traces much of
   the evil which he deplored to the lack of prayer. After he has compared
   their righteousnesses to filthy rags, he adds, "there is none that
   calls upon Your name, that stirs up Himself to take hold of You." When
   there is a degeneracy of public manners, you may be sure that there is,
   also, a serious decline of secret devotion. When the outward service of
   the Church begins to flag and her holiness declines, you may be sure
   that her communion with God has been sadly suspended. Devotion to God
   will be found to be the basis of holiness and the buttress of
   integrity. If you backslide in secret before God, you will soon err in
   public before men.

   You may judge yourselves, my dear Hearers, as to your spiritual state,
   by the condition of your hearts in the matter of prayer. How are you at
   the Mercy Seat? For that is what you really are. Are the consolations
   of God small with you? That is a minor matter. Look deeper--is there
   not a restraining of prayer before the living God? Do you find yourself
   weak in the presence of temptation? That is important--but search below
   the surface and you will find that you have grown lax in supplication
   and have failed to keep up continual communion with God.

   The Prophet, also, reveals the very essence and soul of prayer is a
   stirring up of one's self to take hold of God. If in prayer we do not
   take hold of God we have prayed but feebly, if at all. The very soul of
   devotion lies in realizing the Divine Presence, in dealing with God as
   a real Person, in firm confidence in His faithfulness--in a word--in "
   taking hold of Him." Men do not take hold of a shadow. They cannot
   grasp the unsubstantial fabric of a dream. Taking hold implies
   something real which we grasp and there is needed, to make prayer
   truthful and acceptable with God, the grip and grasp of a tenacious
   faith which believes the fact that God is and that He is the Rewarder
   of them that diligently seek

   Him.

   Taking hold implies a reverent familiarity with the Lord by which we
   use a holy force to win a blessing from His hands. It was because there
   was so little of this in Israel that the nation had fallen into so
   forlorn a state. And if you trace up the evils of the Church of the
   present day to their source, it will come to this--that there are so
   few who stir up themselves to take hold upon the living God, so few who
   grapple with spiritual matters in downright earnest and bring

   them before the Lord with resolute faith. We have few Elijahs, now, and
   Jacobs are hard to find. Why, look, Sirs, there are many whose religion
   is nothing but a mere outward performance! It consists in attendance
   upon a place of worship so many times on the Sabbath, the reading of
   prayers in the family, the repetition of a form of devotion night and
   morning and, perhaps, the mechanical reading of a chapter in the Bible.
   But there is no consciousness that God is near, no conversation with
   Him, no taking hold upon Him!

   In the case of such persons the, "You God see me," of Hagar in the
   wilderness has never leaped from their lips! Neither have they cried
   like David, "Against You, You only, have I sinned, and done this evil
   in Your sight." God is far off from them even when they pray! They
   never dream that they are speaking into His ear. They believe there is
   a God, but they act as if there were none! He does not influence them.
   Their lives are not inspired by His Presence or ennobled by His smile.
   Their religion is practically godless and, therefore, worthless! In
   vain is it that they are regular at services and attentive at sermons
   if their hearts stop short of God Himself! Their service may be, in all
   respects, proper and orderly, but if there is no taking hold of God, it
   is lifeless and useless as a garnished sepulcher! "God with us," in our
   flesh, is our Savior! "God with us," by His Spirit, proves that we are
   saved!

   Laying hold upon God is not the act of a dead man, neither is it the
   deed of one who is destitute of spiritual perception--it is the act of
   one who is quickened and kept alive by the indwelling power of the Holy
   Spirit. Those who are at enmity with God neither can nor will take hold
   of Him, for, "they say unto God, depart from us; for we desire not the
   knowledge of Your ways!" Men will do anything sooner than stir up
   themselves to take hold of God! They will build churches and altars.
   They will say "masses" and perform pilgrimages--and a thousand other
   things--but they do not want God and will not have Him! To go through a
   round of performances is very easy work compared with thought,
   consideration and the yielding of the heart.

   You may, in religious matters, make yourself like the brick maker's
   blind horse which goes round and round at his pugmill, but knows
   nothing about what he is doing! Such worship God regards not! As well
   might we set automatons to pray and wax figures to move in and out of
   church doors. God is a Spirit--and to grasp a spirit is not everyday
   work. Only a spiritual man can do anything of the kind or know what it
   means. A man must be stirred up and have all his faculties awake--and
   his entire mental and spiritual nature thrown into energetic action
   before he will be able to cope with this mystery. Only then, by the
   Grace of God, can he take hold of Him that made the heavens and the
   earth, who is not seen of the eyes nor heard of the ear--and is only to
   be apprehended by the inner spirit of man. I pray God that I may be
   helpful, as He shall please, in stirring up many of you to take hold
   upon the Lord with all your heart and soul and strength!

   If such shall be the case, it will be a great blessing to the Churches
   to which you belong and a great blessing to the society in which you
   move. At this present time I shall not attempt more than the task of
   describing certain forms in which taking hold upon God is exceedingly
   desirable at this present time. The same principle in different stages
   of spiritual life is seen in varying forms--let me point out four of
   the most necessary--and may the Holy Spirit enable some among us to
   stir up themselves for the holy effort.

   I. The first form of taking hold, that which is intended in the text,
   is that in which THE AWAKENED SINNER TAKES HOLD UPON GOD. And here I
   shall be addressing, I hope, many now present who are sincerely anxious
   to find present salvation. If you really wish to be reconciled to God
   and to be pardoned by the great Father at once, listen diligently and
   hear--that your souls may live! Your only hope lies in taking hold upon
   God! Be not startled, but listen and obey! It is great condescension on
   the Lord's part that He should permit it to be so, but so it is, that
   when He bares His right arm to strike you, your safety lies in grasping
   that very hand which apparently is lifted for your destruction!

   He says by the mouth of the Prophet, "Let him lay hold on My strength
   and let him make peace with Me." As a child, when his father is about
   to chasten him, will often seize his father's hand and with many tears
   entreat him to forbear the rod, so will you do if you act wisely. You
   are to run in, as it were, to God and shelter in the very rock which
   frowns upon you. Though He seems to be a destroyer, if you can but
   trust Him, you will find Him to be your Savior! You must say, as John
   Bunyan once did, "I was so driven that I would have run to Christ, even
   if He had stood with a pike in His hand! Yes, I would have run upon the
   very point thereof sooner than be as I then was."

   It is so wretched a thing to be without God that one may gladly dare
   any calamity in venturing to approach Him, though in truth there is no
   cause for fear. God has been pleased to reveal Himself in the Person of
   His dear Son Jesus

   Christ who lived and died for the salvation of men. And whoever will
   trust God, as He is revealed in Christ Jesus, shall find forgiveness
   for all his sins, shall obtain a new nature, shall enter upon a new
   life and shall be the heir of a blessed immortality! This is the way of
   salvation which God appoints, namely, that you now, at once, heartily
   trust in His Son! However strange this method may appear to you, judge
   not according to the sight of the eyes, but accept what the Lord sets
   before you. That must be best for you which God thinks best--if it
   satisfies your Maker it may well satisfy you!

   But, indeed, you have no choice! You are shut up to this one method of
   deliverance. Trust in Christ will save you! But, "there is none other
   name under Heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Do you
   understand me? The way of life is to take hold of God in Christ Jesus!
   You are charged with sin--do not deny it--for such a course will be
   your ruin! Take hold upon the accusation and confess it. Stand where
   the accusation places you in conscious guilt and repent as you stand
   there!

   Then turn to God and say to Him--"It is written in Your own Word, 'This
   is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
   came into the world to save sinners.' Lord, You know I am a sinner and
   I, also, know it. I cast myself upon the faithful saying and trust in
   You to save me through Jesus Christ Your Son." This is taking hold upon
   God! And when you have so done you shall find salvation--yes, you are
   saved! I think I hear you say, "But how shall I take hold on God? I,
   who am so vile, so weak, so far off from Him." He has given you many
   points by which you may grasp Him. You may take hold upon certain of
   His attributes and especially upon His mercy. "He delights in mercy."

   Can you not trust the God who is ready to pardon and eager to receive
   His returning child? Remember His loving kindness and the multitude of
   His tender mercies. Call to mind the fact that He has declared that He
   has no pleasure in the death of him that dies, but that he should turn
   to Him and live. Can you not cast anchor in the harbor of infinite
   mercy as seen in the provision of a Divine Savior? Can you not find
   foothold for faith on that blessed and sure word, "His mercy endures
   forever"? This is the star of the sinner's night, the dawn of his day
   of hope! There is forgiveness with God that He may be feared--with Him
   is plenteous redemption! O poor sinking Soul, take hold of this!
   Believe that God, for Christ's sake, can justly pardon the guilty--and
   plead with Him to do so in your case! Urge your suit upon this plea and
   it will not fail you.

   Perhaps your mind can better settle upon a promise. Well, it will
   little matter which one of them it is, for though they are very many,
   they are all equally certain. But try to take hold of the Lord by one
   or other of those handholds which He has provided on purpose for
   seeking souls. Hold Him by such a word as this, "Let the wicked forsake
   his ways and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto
   the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God, for He will
   abundantly pardon." Or take hold upon that other gracious invitation, "
   Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord; though your sins
   are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they are red
   like crimson, they shall be as wool." There are many such Words of
   Grace and, as I have already told you, they are all equally sure.

   Like the great roads which all meet in London, so any promise will lead
   you to God. Fix your grasp of faith on that which best suits your
   character and condition--and you are, at once, in contact with God.
   Only take hold and do not trifle with the promise, or stagger at it. O
   Sinner, awaken yourself to take hold upon the loving Word! Be in
   earnest, Man, for it is your life, and when you once get hold, let your
   grip be as an iron vice--grapple the promise to you as with hooks of
   steel! Plead after this fashion, "You have said it, O God, and I
   believe it, and I trustfully look to You to be as good as Your Word. On
   this, Your promise, I depend and I am persuaded You will keep Your
   Word."

   Perhaps the Character of our Lord Jesus Christ may furnish you with a
   holdfast. Remember who and what He was and remember that whatever
   Christ was, God is, for He, Himself, testified, "He that has seen Me
   has seen the Father." Remember how Jesus put the message of love, "Come
   unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in
   heart; and you shall find rest unto your souls." Could you not trust
   the meek and lowly One? Say, can you not readily trust Jesus? Do you
   fear Immanuel or dread the Lamb of God? Bleeding on the tree, with no
   thunder in His hands nor terror on His brow, can you not confide in
   Him?

   His dying body, by every wound, invites the sons of men to find a
   shelter in the riven rock! Take at once a firm hold of God! The body of
   His Incarnate Son and all His blessed work stand before you as so many
   points of attraction. Turn not away, but let the God of Love be your
   God now and forever! Can you not take hold of Him through the
   Gospel--the Gospel which publishes salvation to the most ungodly? What
   do you say to this--"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and

   you shall be saved"? "He that believes on Him is not condemned"? "The
   blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin"? What a
   number of persons have laid hold of God through that precious text! It
   stands like an open door with width enough to admit a giant in sin!
   Some who could never find comfort anywhere else have caught at that
   encouragement and found peace with God at once. Why shouldn't you?

   Note this one, also. "Him that comes to Me I will in no wise cast out."
   And this, "Whoever will, let him come and take the water of life
   freely." By some one or other of those Gospel declarations I do, in the
   name of Jesus, entreat every guilty sinner to take hold of God! Again,
   I say, do not run from Him or from the facts of your sad case--do not
   try to forget what you are towards Him, nor forget what He must be
   towards you if you continue in your sin! Come now, in an honest manner,
   and meet the truth face to face. Make this firm resolve, that you will
   be stranger to your God no longer. Say in your soul, "I will take hold
   of God this day, as He presents Himself to me in His Word." Put forth
   your hands and touch the hem of Jesus' garment, if you can do no more,
   and He will not spurn you, but give you immediate salvation!

   The text speaks of a man's stirring himself up to lay hold on God and
   that is the point to which I long to see you brought. I would that
   every unconverted man were, at this moment, awakened out of his deadly
   slumber. You will not take hold on God while you are asleep in sin's
   downy bed! Believe me, no sinner is saved while his mind is in a
   dreamy, hesitating, lethargic condition. You need to be stirred up to
   make your calling and election sure. Surely such a business should be
   earnestly attended to. Let your memory be stirred up to remember your
   sin and may, by God's Grace, your soul repent of it. Let your
   conscience be stirred up to remind you of the guilt of that sin and may
   your heart make a full confession of it with deep shame and bitter
   sorrow.

   Let your fears be stirred up to apprehend the wrath to come and your
   hopes to remind you of the possibilities of everlasting life and glory!
   Let your desires be awakened, this morning, and may you be set longing
   and crying after mercy! And with your desires may your will awaken,
   only not as it has been accustomed to be, in vicious obstinacy, setting
   itself against God, but made willing to obey in the day of the Lord's
   power! May His Holy Spirit awaken reason and thought, understanding and
   the affections, yes, your whole man! As when in business you are about
   to do something of extreme importance, you awaken yourself and endeavor
   to have all your wits about you, so now come to this great business of
   your soul's salvation with all your thoughts awakened and all your
   energies excited, for all these are necessary!

   Is it not a concern of the utmost weight? Since the prize is worth
   winning and the loss will be intolerable, be stirred up with strong
   resolve that, if Grace and mercy are to be had by laying hold on God,
   you will have them at this very hour! Beloved Brothers and Sisters, if
   there are none among us who take hold on God, our Church is in a very
   sad state--a Church without converts is a cloud without rain, a river
   without water!

   I thank God that we are not in such a plight, but we have many in this
   place who have lately taken hold upon the Lord and found Grace in His
   sight. This has been a means of Grace to us all! The oldest and most
   established have been cheered by these new converts. Their coming among
   us has been a dew from the Lord--we have welcomed them as men do
   swallows in the spring! Their addition to our numbers has lit up new
   stars in our sky. Pray, my Brothers and Sisters, that there may be many
   such in all Churches, for it is pre-eminently desirable that every
   awakened sinner should be stirred up to take hold upon God!

   II. We will now consider another character considerably in advance of
   the former, who, also, stirs up himself to take hold of God. We very
   greatly need to have among us many THOROUGH BELIEVERS WHO TAKE HOLD
   UPON GOD BY FIDELITY TO HIM. I have seen applied to Calvin the motto,
   "He took fast hold." If ever a man did take fast hold on invisible
   things, it was that famous Reformer. What he grasped, he held with
   force of clear conviction, intelligent apprehension and devout
   reverence. I am particularly anxious that every member of this Church
   should now look upon himself or herself separately and distinctly--and
   try to follow me in my description of a Believer who takes hold of God.

   He is deeply sincere and thorough in all that he does. Shams and
   pretences are his abhorrence. He feels the solemn importance of dealing
   in spirit and in truth with the Lord--and of taking hold upon God,
   Himself, and not on mere names and words and forms. He says within
   himself, "I am a Christian and I will be so, by God's Grace, not in
   name only, but in deed and in truth. I know that the outward form of
   religion is but a husk and I resolve to feed upon the kernel. I mean to
   have the substance of religion--not its shadows. I will take hold of
   all the outward which God has revealed, but

   I will mainly look to the inward, and my soul and spirit shall deal
   with the living God Himself. If I live, I will live unto Him. Nothing
   short of this shall content me."

   Such a man opens his Bible and resolves to find out what God's will
   is--and he judges for himself--for he knows that he will have to render
   a personal account. He means to take hold for himself of every revealed
   Truth of God, for he wishes not to be taught of man, alone, but to be
   taught of God. He awakens all his wits to understand the doctrine and
   precepts of God's Word, for he has become a disciple and he, therefore,
   wishes to learn. His cry is, "I want to be thorough. I want to go to
   the soul and center of things and know the Truth of God by the teaching
   of the Spirit of God in my own heart!"

   Not content with searching the Word, alone, he takes everything he
   finds there to God, and says, "Lord, I long to lay hold of You in this
   Truth. I desire not merely to know concerning Christ, but to know
   Christ! Not only to believe the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, but to
   feel the power of the Holy Spirit, Himself, upon my soul, for I have
   said in my heart, 'My God, I would know You and commune with You. I
   would love You and serve You. My soul follows hard after You--when
   shall I come and appear before You?'"

   Such a man, dear Brothers and Sisters, when he once knows the will of
   the Lord, has made up his mind to act promptly upon what he knows! His
   mind is expressed in the language of one of old who said, "As for me
   and my house, we will serve the Lord." It is nothing to him what others
   may do, except that he regrets that they should do evil. He puts his
   foot down and will not run with a multitude to do evil. He has made the
   Word of the Lord to be the guide of his life and he will not depart
   from it. His is no borrowed faith--he has embraced the Truth of Jesus
   for himself and he means to follow Him at all hazards. And, as far as
   he can, he will have his household so ordered that all who come around
   him may see that Jesus is his Lord.

   Come fair or come foul, his hold is secure and he will not let go. Such
   a man sets himself to extend the Kingdom of Christ, impelled by inward
   zeal. Having obtained a solid fulcrum of assured knowledge, he now
   begins to use his lever and work upon others. Wherever he is settled in
   Providence, he sets about founding a Church for his Lord. He is glad to
   be a member of a large Church for the sake of Christian fellowship, but
   if he is cast in a desert place he can hold his own, alone, for his
   hold is not on man, but on God! He can testify in the midst of others
   who do not fear God--he would testify in the midst of heathens if he
   were called to it--for opposition and persecution cannot shake him!

   He has taken hold of God--not of the Church, nor of the minister, nor
   of the mere formal creed! He has passed beyond all those things to the
   Lord, Himself, and his confidence is thus above the heavens. He knows
   that he cannot be placed where God is not and, therefore, he feels that
   his best Friend is always near. The eye of man is nothing to him-- the
   Presence of God is first and last with him. He labors with earnest zeal
   to maintain, defend and, also, to spread abroad the Truths of God which
   are verily believed among us. He is a man that calls upon God, not
   merely in prayer, but by confessing His name and acknowledging His
   cause. And he stirs himself up to take hold upon God in the doing of
   all these things.

   Brethren, I earnestly wish that every member of this Church was a man
   of this metal! We should be strong for God if this were the case. We
   have so many professors who are still babes, needing the feeding bottle
   and the baby carriage though they are 40 years of age! What can we do
   with these? Others are unstable. They know something about the Truth of
   God, but not very much--and what they do know they are not sure of--and
   so they are ready to be bamboozled out of it. In the present age, if
   any man can talk well, he will get a following whatever he may teach. I
   am astounded at some professors who can hear this man, today, and that
   man the next, though the two are diametrically opposed! Surely there is
   some difference between truth and error! Surely mere cleverness cannot
   neutralize false doctrine!

   Our forefathers discerned between things that differed and when false
   doctrine came before them they cast it out, notwithstanding the
   eloquence of its advocate. I do not want you to be bigots. God deliver
   us from their bitter spirit, but I do want you to be sound Believers.
   There is a great difference between obstinate bigotry and a decided
   maintenance of that which we have believed. After all, what is the
   chaff to the wheat? There is a difference between the doctrines of men
   and the teachings of the Lord! No lie is of the truth! Garnish it as
   you may, it is still a lie. Oh to be rooted and grounded and built up
   in Christ! One of the most desirable things in this fickle age is to
   see around the minister of Christ a people who know the Truth and feel
   that the Truth binds them fast to their God.

   III. We take a step further in advance when we mention a third form of
   this taking hold of God. We need a development in the form of THE
   WRESTLING PLEADER. The expression is borrowed, as you know, from Jacob
   at the brook of Jabbok. He had begun to pray, alone, by the brook when
   an angel appeared to him, or rather the Prince of angels Himself. When
   Jacob saw the Angel, he laid hold upon Him and there was a wrestling
   match between them all through that night. It was a sight such as never
   seen on earth before. After much weeping and agony, Jacob made a
   desperate clutch at the Angel and cried, "I will not let You go unless
   You bless me."

   In the Church of God we need many wrestling Jacobs! What does the text
   mean when it speaks of a man stirring himself up to take hold of God?
   The transaction takes this form. The good man feels the case
   urgently--the blessing which is needed is laid on his heart and he
   feels that he must have it. He is convinced of the necessity of it and
   he is, also, certain that he cannot have it, except from God. Then he
   looks at the propriety of it and asks, "Is this a case which I can
   lawfully lay before God? I seek such a thing, but may I expect the
   thrice holy God to give it to me? Is it for His Glory? When you have
   done that, dear Friend, you have commenced well!

   Now proceed to business. Go about it in an energetic, but reasonable
   way, and next, turn to the Bible and see if the Lord has ever promised
   that which you seek. Search out promises! Get them at your fingertips!
   Memorize their very words! Then go before God and tell Him your desire
   and honestly declare your reasons for desiring it. Show the Lord that
   you know that He has promised the blessing and then begin to plead with
   Him to fulfill His own Word. Very much of taking hold upon God must be
   in using arguments with Him. The Lord knows the thing is good, but He
   wants you to know it! And in order that you may be well instructed in
   the value of the mercy you seek, He wishes you to produce your
   arguments and bring forth your strong reasons.

   Many teachers use what we call the Socratic method in which the student
   is made to answer questions, not that his teacher may be instructed,
   but that the youth may learn. Set your case in order and mention your
   pleading before the Lord as if you were pleading in a court of justice.
   State why and why this thing should be, and what you fear will happen
   if you are not answered. Return to the work again and again, as Abraham
   did when interceding for Sodom, and each time renew your strength.
   Especially bring forth the Divine promises and say concerning each one
   of them, "Do as You have said. Fulfill this Word unto Your servant,
   upon which You have caused me to hope." Plead the Covenant and the
   faithfulness of God!

   That done, believe that God will keep His promise and begin to expect
   the blessing. Act as if you had obtained it, for it is written,
   "Believe that you have it and you shall have it." If the mercy is not
   then given, ask again--go through the same pleadings as before,
   amending them and increasing their power. The agony of prayer is
   somewhat like a great siege in which one earthwork is cast up and after
   a while it is followed by another yet nearer to the town which is to be
   taken. One after another the besiegers raise their works till the place
   is quite hemmed in--then they bring up their guns and begin to pound
   away upon the walls which they have resolved to capture.

   Thus must we be about to win the blessing which we need, using Divine
   promises as our ramparts and our strong reasons as our great guns.
   Remember, it is not for God's sake that you are called upon to plead,
   but for your own! The Lord desires to convince you of the value of
   mercy--and when He has done it, He intends to grant it to you! A man
   who can take hold of God in prayer will be of the utmost value to the
   Church. Why should we not learn this art? But oh, how few there are who
   call upon His name! How few there are who stir up themselves to take
   hold of God! Sleepy prayers-- God have mercy upon them! Prayers that do
   not mean anything? Prayers of men who can be put off with, "No"? These
   are as common as stones on the road and of less worth! We need
   importunity--the knocking at the gate of Mercy again and again and
   again! We need the unconquerable resolve--"I must have it! It is for
   God's glory and He has promised it. I will not cease until I obtain
   it."

   We need to see the majesty of prayer among us again. If we had hundreds
   of Church members who could take hold upon God, religion would revive
   and we should no more have to complain of barrenness. God will part the
   heavens and come down and the mountains will flow at His Presence when
   once His people take Him at His word and pray as if they believed!

   IV. The fourth point, and the last, is to mention one other form of
   this stirring up of ourselves to lay hold of God. It is one which I
   confess I have but seldom seen, but wish I could see on all sides. I
   have read of it in biographies and past ages have seen it and wondered
   at it. It ought, however, to be common in the Church and to be seen in
   every Christian. I

   mean THE TAKING HOLD OF GOD BY THE STRENGTHENED BELIEVER--the man who
   has got beyond doubts

   and fears--and grasped the eternal Truths. No question, now as to
   whether there is a God or not--he knows Him, speaks with Him, walks
   with Him.

   In sacred communion the Lord has made known His secrets to him and
   shown him His Covenant. Concerning the Gospel and things revealed, he
   does not care to argue. He is as sure of those matters as of the fact
   that there is a sun in the heavens or salt in the sea. He has passed
   beyond argument as to things of this sort. You might as well try to
   shake the earth out of its place as to remove him from his convictions.
   He knows them and, what is a great deal more, he intensely realizes
   them. He as much believes in God and His Gospel as he believes in his
   own existence--and these things have as manifest a power over him as
   the things which are seen and heard have over the human senses. He is
   familiar with God! He talks with Jesus! The Holy Spirit dwells in him!

   He has passed into a spiritual realm and has consciously to do with
   spiritual things. Such a man is now quite sure about God's being with
   him, for he dwells in His Presence and he never dares to act except
   under a sense of that Presence. He is quite sure about God's keeping
   His promises. He dares not doubt that, for he has had too many proofs,
   already, of the faithfulness of God for him to distrust Him. Now, see
   how steadily that man moves about! Trial does not bow him down--he
   expected it and he expects to be delivered out of it. If you rush in
   upon him with the most terrible information it does not distress him,
   for, "He is not afraid of evil tidings. His heart is fixed by trusting
   in the Lord." What a grand character Abraham was and only because he
   was grandly believing!

   Whenever faith gave way in Abraham, as it did now and then, for the
   best of men are only men, then he sank to the ordinary level, as he did
   when he denied his wife and said--"She is my sister." But when his
   faith is strong, what a wonderful man he is! He never disputes with Lot
   about which shall take the fatter pasture. Lot may have what he likes,
   for Abraham has his God. Lot may take the well-watered plain of the
   Jordan if he desires it--Abraham had sooner dwell alone with his God.
   When Lot is carried captive, and Abraham feels it his duty to deliver
   his relative, he does not ask about how strong Chedorlaomer and the
   other three kings may be. That is nothing to him! God is with him and
   he hastens to the conflict.

   He uses such means as are at hand and asks his neighbors to join him in
   the pursuit. And then he marches confidently after Chedorlaomer and
   destroys him--and God gives the plundering host like driven stubble to
   his bow. You never find Abraham fretting. He is always peaceful in
   mind. He is not afraid of men, nor abashed before princes. His faith
   had made him heir of the world and he knew it. He moved majestically
   because he had learned to believe in God. When Isaac was to be offered
   up, how the strong man smothered his emotions and went silently but
   resolutely his three days' journey, with his son, to the hill of which
   God had spoken to him. There the deed would have been done had not the
   angel interposed, for it never entered into Abraham's mind to disobey
   the Lord!

   He believed so firmly in his God that whatever God had bid him, he
   resolved to do. Oh, if you could get to the same realizing faith, how
   calm, quiet, serene, strong, happy and blessed would you be, for you
   would then, to the fullest extent, have taken hold of God! When we have
   such a man in a Church, he is a man of power in all respects. When he
   speaks it is almost as the oracles of God. Other speakers may dazzle
   you with eloquence, but this man overpowers you with Grace and confuses
   the adversaries by his boldness. God gives to the Church, every now and
   then, such a man. Such a one was Martin Luther, a man by no means free
   from faults, but gloriously free from doubt!

   Others think the Gospel is true. Erasmus feels sure that it is, but
   Erasmus wants to die in a whole skin. Luther knows that Justification
   by faith is right and he will thunder it out, whether his skin shall be
   damaged or not! It will be better not to go to Worms, say timid
   advisers. Things have come to such a pass that there will be danger to
   your life--you had better give up the contest, Luther, before you die
   in it. Future ages may take it up, but if you go to Worms, you will
   certainly never come back again!

   Well, says he, I shall go! Yes, if there were as many devils there, as
   there are tiles on the housetops, I should go, for I have to confess
   Christ there and confess Him I will! And when he is asked, "What would
   you do if the Duke, your protector, should no longer harbor you?" "I
   shall take shelter," he says, "beneath the broad shield of the Almighty
   God." What are dukes and princes to such a man? He had taken hold of
   God and he feels stronger than all men and all devils combined! There
   is nothing like this linking of one's self with the Eternal by faith!
   Such a man was Calvin. I

   picture him as he looked when going into the Church of St. Peter, the
   Libertines resolved that they would partake of the Lord's Supper though
   Calvin had declared they should not.

   They are men licentious in life and godless in character, but they mean
   to come to the Table and take the sacred elements, whether Calvin says
   no or not. They care for no one and mean riot and bloodshed. If he
   refuses, they have sent him word that they will kill him in the Church.
   Calvin goes to the Table and breaks the bread and distributes it to the
   people of God--and hands not a mouthful to the profane, upon whom he
   looks with such pitying severity that, awed by the man's courage, they
   retire to learn better manners!

   We have in these days a race of time servers and word spinners to
   succeed the real men! There are hundreds who say it is undoubtedly
   untrue that children are, in their Baptism, made members of Christ,
   children of God, inheritors of the kingdom of Heaven--but still they
   teach children to say so and afterwards will tell them that the words
   mean something else. Is this the way of doing the work of the Lord? Is
   this according to the Gospel of faith, or after the manner of the Truth
   of God? Numbers of others say, "Yes, we see all this, we see popery
   coming back in the form of ritualism, but, at the same time, we cannot
   be decided and shake ourselves clear of the accursed thing. We cannot
   tell what will happen! We will wait and perhaps fate may favor us."

   I know what would happen if we feared God more--we would sooner die
   than remain in any fellowship with popery! Every man who saw any fear
   of his being found in complicity with Antichrist would at once say, "I
   will not have it. Popery is abhorred of the Lord and they who help it
   wear the mark of the beast! I hate Antichrist and, therefore, I
   denounce it and cry, Down with it! Raze it even to the ground."
   Everything that is of the Pope and popery would soon be put aside if
   men were but true to their consciences and their God! This generation
   is credulous and yet unbelieving! It is deluded by the most transparent
   frauds! It swings like a pendulum to this and that--it believes in
   almost anything except its God! In God and His Truth and righteousness
   it will not be made to believe.

   Oh for a John Knox! We need a leader, firm and heroic! We need a man
   strong and stout because he has God with him. He that believes in God
   will make men decide for the right when otherwise they would vacillate.
   He is a commander-in-chief among the sons of men. His brow is like a
   flint and he is not to be abashed. Let criticism rattle upon his armor
   like a hailstorm--he stands fast and defies it all. May God make some
   of you into such heroes! I would to God He would make all of you
   valiant for His Truth, so that in your little circle you would be firm
   for God and Scriptural doctrine and pure worship because you have taken
   hold of Him!

   God save us from the men of willow and gutta-percha and plaster of
   Paris, such as would be dear if you could buy them at a shilling the
   dozen! Take these away, O, Father Time, and give us back men of
   granite, men of backbone, say rather, men of God! Oh that each man
   among us were awakened to take hold of God and that all our faculties
   were stirred to their utmost depth and that then they grasped the Lord!
   Ho, comrades, don't you see the standard? It wavers! Shall it fall? The
   true soldier in the cruel fight, when he sees the standard-bearer
   struck down and the fight thickening all around the banner, stirs up
   all his strength and rushes into the strife as a lion leaps on his
   prey!

   He strains every sinew and throws every nerve into action, dashing
   forward to grasp the standard and to hold it aloft, touch it who dare!
   He strikes right and left and sooner than the banner shall be trailed
   in the mire, he will spill his life in crimson streams upon the ground!
   Up you soldiers of Christ! Up you lion-like men and turn the battle to
   the gate! May God help you to do it for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Righteous Father Known and Loved

   (No. 1378)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 14, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "O righteous Father, the world has not known You. But Ihave known You,
   and these have known that You have sent Me. And Ihave declared unto
   them Your name, and will declare it; that the love with which You have
   loved Me may be in them, and I in them." John 17:25,26.

   THESE are the last sentences of our Lord's most wonderful prayer. May
   they not be regarded as the flower and crown of the whole intercession?
   Minds usually burn and glow and reach their highest fervor as they
   proceed and it will not be wrong to conceive of the Savior as having
   here reached the climax of His pleading, the summit of His
   supplication. He has kept the best wine until now and brings forth His
   richest sentences last. How, then, shall our slender ability attain to
   "the height of this great argument"?

   It is far beyond our little skill to draw forth all the sweets which
   lie within these words like ointment in a box of alabaster. For their
   full consideration, a lifetime would be too brief and the mind of the
   most Grace-taught Believer too feeble! Here are great deeps which
   neither reason nor thought can fathom nor experience fully know. Only
   the scholars of the New Jerusalem who have, for ages, studied the
   manifold wisdom of God in the glorious work of redemption and, perhaps
   not even they, would be able to discover all that the Savior meant by
   these most simple but yet most pregnant words.

   John's Gospel is always easy for the child to read, but it is always
   hard for the man to understand. And these two verses, which are almost
   entirely made up of words of one syllable, contain mysteries which
   baffle the most enlightened understanding. When I consider what they
   veil, I am constrained to cry out, "O the depths!" I can only hope to
   present to you a few grains of gold which have been washed down by the
   streams of meditation--I cannot take you to the secret mines from which
   the treasures have been borne. It shall need your own experience and
   the personal teaching of the Holy Spirit for you to know the height and
   depth of the Truths of Gods spoken here. And even then it shall require
   death and resurrection and a sight of the Eternal Glory to qualify you
   wholly to comprehend them!

   There are two things in the text manifest to every careful reader.
   There is, first, a knowledge which is exceedingly peculiar and
   inestimably precious--"O righteous Father, the world has not known You.
   But I have known You, and these have known that You have sent Me." In
   connection with this knowledge you will observe that there is a great
   Teacher who first knows for Himself that which He teaches--"I have
   known You." And then He communicates His knowledge-- "And I have
   declared unto them Your name, and will declare it." That fruitful theme
   shall furnish the first topic of our meditation. May the Holy Spirit
   lead us into it.

   The second part of the text is not knowledge--it is that to which all
   Divine knowledge is intended to lead, namely, love. The 26th verse
   speaks of wonderful discoveries of a love of infinite excellence--"That
   the love with which You have loved Me may be in them." And you notice
   that in order to bring that love home to us, there is a Divine
   Indweller who goes with it, and without whom it could not be! As a
   Teacher is required to bring us the choice knowledge, so an Indweller
   is necessary to infuse into us the infinite love--"And I in them."
   Jesus must teach us or we shall not know the Father. He must dwell in
   us or we shall not rejoice in His love.

   Thus our first subject is Divine knowledge and the Divine Instructor.
   Our second subject is indwelling love and the indwelling Lord. The two
   are one! The blessed Person of our Lord Jesus is so connected with both
   and so unites both that the subject is one! To know God in Christ Jesus
   is to love Him--and to be loved of Him is the cause of our being made
   to know Him! When Jesus declares the Father's name, we both know and
   love. And when we see the Father in the Son we are filled both with
   instruction and affection.

   I. Our text speaks of A KNOWLEDGE OF INFINITE VALUE AND ITS TEACHER.
   What is that knowledge? Jesus tells us in verse 26--"I have declared
   unto them Your name." God has made man and, naturally, man ought to
   know his Maker. The creature should acquaint itself with its Creator.
   The subject should know the name of his King. But by reason of the
   blindness of our heart, through the depravity engendered by the Fall
   and, also, by reason of each man's personal sin, there is none that
   understands, there is none that seeks after God.

   Whatever else fallen man desires to know (and by nature he is always
   ready to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil), yet he desires
   not to know his God, but says to Him, "Depart from us. We desire not
   the knowledge of Your ways." Yet it is evident that a man can never be
   in a proper state till he knows his God and is at peace with Him. A man
   who is totally ignorant of God must be in a dark state of mind--and
   since he loves that darkness--it is plain that his mind is biased
   against good. His willful ignorance of God proves his enmity to Him.
   While man is opposed to God he cannot be happy, holy, or safe. How can
   he be, when he fights against One who is perfect holiness and love?

   Our Lord Jesus Christ, therefore, in coming to save us, makes it a part
   of His office to reveal the Father to us. He brings us the knowledge of
   the Glory of God, for it shines in His own face. "God was manifest in
   the flesh." Man must know God in order to be saved and, therefore, the
   Lord Jesus of old promised in the 22nd Psalm, "I will declare Your name
   unto My brethren," and here, in our text, He confesses, "I have
   declared unto them Your name, and will declare it." By the term,
   "name," He means the existence of God, the Nature of God, the Character
   of God, the work of God, the Revelation of God, for the word, "name" is
   a peculiarly expressive word in Scripture and comprehends all that by
   which a person is properly described. In this case it comprehends the
   whole of God and our Lord Jesus Christ has come to make God known to us
   to the fullest.

   He says, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father, also."
   This should suggest to each of us a searching question, Do I know the
   Lord? If you do not, it is quite certain that our Lord's Words apply to
   you, "you must be born again." Without a knowledge of God, you bear
   evidence that you are still in Nature's darkness and in the natural
   alienation of your spirit. You belong to that world which lies in the
   Wicked One, of which our Lord said, "O righteous Father, the world has
   not known You." O that by the teaching of the Holy Spirit you may yet
   know the Father!

   In verse 25 there is a testing name given to God, a name by which we
   may decide whether we know the name of the Lord or not. What is that? I
   call your particular attention to it, for my whole subject turns upon
   it. It is this--"O righteous Father." I know of no other place in
   Scripture where God is called by that name. In this prayer Jesus had
   not addressed His Father by that title before. He had spoken of Him as,
   "Father," and also as, "Holy Father," but here, alone, it is--"O
   righteous Father." I say that the knowledge of this name may serve as a
   test as to whether you truly and spiritually know God, or have only a
   notional and outward idea of Him. If you know Him aright, you know and
   understand what is comprehended under those two simple words which are
   so remarkable when found in combination-- "righteous Father.''

   He is "righteous''--having the attributes of a Judge and Ruler. He is
   just, impartial, by no means sparing the guilty. He is "Father"--near
   of kin, loving, tender, forgiving. In His Character and in His dealings
   with His people He blends the two as they were never combined before!
   How can the judge and the father be found in one? When guilty men are
   concerned, how can both characters be carried out to the fullest? How
   is it possible? There is but one answer and that is found in the
   Sacrifice of Jesus which has joined the two in one! In the Atonement of
   our Lord Jesus "mercy and truth are met together--righteousness and
   peace have kissed each other." In the sacred Substitution we see
   declared how God is "righteous," and yet, "Father"--in the sublime
   transactions of Calvary He manifests all the love of a tender Father's
   heart and all the justice of an impartial Ruler's sword!

   This is the knowledge which our Lord has come to declare among the men
   whom He has chosen out of the world. And He assures us, first, that
   this is peculiar knowledge. "O righteous Father, the world has not
   known You." The heathen world knew nothing of a righteous Father--it
   scarcely knew God as Father--though here and there a line of a heathen
   poet might speak of men as the offspring of God, the true idea of
   Divine Fatherhood was unknown to sages and philosophers. As to the
   righteousness of God, they had but clouded notions. A future judgment
   and a system of rewards and punishments they saw by the light of
   natural conscience. But true righteousness in the governing of the
   universe they had not discovered--they knew not because they did not
   wish to know.

   Their gods were generally monsters of iniquity. As to righteousness and
   love being combined, they imagined no such thing! The idea of a god who
   should be at once sternly righteous and yet infinitely tender had not
   occurred to them. How could it? Being themselves unrighteous, they
   sought not after a righteous God! He was not at all in their thoughts.
   Being themselves cruel and loveless, they could not discover a Deity
   whose name is Love. All the wisdom of antiquity went to fabricate gods
   of quite another kind. The world, by wisdom, knew not the God who is
   called "righteous Father." It is more humbling to have to add that the
   Christian world does not know God as a "righteous Father," either, but
   persists in forsaking this grand, glorious and Scriptural view of Him.

   Mark you, I draw a very grave distinction between the Christian Church
   and the Christian world! The Christian world is a conglomeration of
   good and evil--the embodiment of the unreal and unspiritual which,
   nevertheless, desires to bear the Christian name. It is the world
   pretending to be the friend of Christ and you know how hollow is the
   pretense. The Christian Church, made up of the men taught of God and
   born of the Spirit, is another matter! There we have something very
   different, for these know the righteous Father. Skeptics labeled as,
   "thinkers," reject the evangelical idea of God and the Atonement which
   that idea involves. Worldly wisdom talks of "the universal fatherhood
   of God," and babbles forever about that mere dream, that fiction of
   folly against which the Bible is a plain and pointed protest.

   Universal Fatherhood, indeed, when our Lord Jesus said, "If God were
   your Father you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God.
   You are of your father, the devil, and the lusts of your father you
   will do." Is it not described as a special wonder of love that we
   should be called the sons of God? (1 John 3:1.) Did not the Holy Spirit
   say by His servant John, "In this the children of God are manifest, and
   the children of the devil; whoever does not righteousness is not of
   God, neither he that loves not his brother"? The philosophic Christian
   world knows an effeminate, indiscriminate fatherhood, but not, "the
   righteous Father." It will not bow before the majesty of His justice.

   According to the tenor of its teaching, sin is a misfortune,
   transgression a mere trifle, and the souls that suffer for willful
   guilt are objects to be pitied, rather than to be blamed! The world's
   "thinkers" are continually drawing upon our feelings to make us pity
   those who are punished--but they have little to say in order to make us
   hate the evil which deserved the doom. Sin, according to them, does
   not, of itself, demand punishment, but penalties are to be exacted or
   remitted for the general good, if, indeed, they are to be executed at
   all! All necessary and inevitable connection between guilt and its
   punishment is denied. They dare to call justice, revenge, and speak of
   atonement as if were a compensation for private annoyance.

   The Christian world does not seem to have learned the Truth that "a God
   all mercy were a God unjust," and that a God unjust would soon be
   discovered to be a God without love--in fact, no God whatever.
   "Righteous Father!" This is the peculiar Revelation which is received
   by those who have been taught of the Holy Spirit--and to this day Jesus
   Christ may say, "O righteous Father, the world has not known You." Men
   kick against the doctrine of the Atonement, they quarrel with
   Substitution, they are fierce in their sarcasms against the mention of
   the precious blood of Christ and sneer superciliously at those who hold
   fast the old Truths of God. They stumble at this stumbling stone and
   strive evermore to overthrow this rock of the Truth of God! And yet,
   depend upon it, this is the test question by which we shall know
   whether a man knows God aright or knows Him not!

   There is much in this knowledge which renders it very distinctive, for
   it reveals the condition of the mind which receives it. A man who knows
   God as, "righteous Father," shows that he has some knowledge of
   himself. He has perceived the sin within his nature and it has burdened
   him. The righteousness of God has appeared to him in its threatening
   form and he had been bowed before it under a sense of his guilt. You
   can see, too, that the man also knows something of his Savior. He has
   evidently seen the Son, or else he would not know the Father, for of
   old Jesus said, "No man comes unto the Father but by Me." He has seen
   God's great Gift to man and learned His boundless love!

   His knowledge of the "righteous Father" shows that his heart has
   submitted itself to the justice of God. He has been in the place where
   David stood when he said, "Against You, You only, have I sinned and
   done this evil in Your sight; that You might be justified when You
   speak, and be clear when You judge." He has evidently bared his back to
   the lash of punishment and felt that he deserved all the blows which it
   could lay upon him. Inasmuch as it knows the Lord as a "righteous
   Father" you can see that the heart has learned to trust God, for no man
   calls Him, Father, in spirit and in truth till first he possesses a
   living faith and some kindling of Divine love. Submission and trust
   compose a condition of

   character which is peculiar to a renewed soul, but will surely be found
   in a man if he is, indeed, saved, for it is the mark of being saved
   from self-justification and from the hatred bred by despair.

   When we see in a man an unconditional submission to the justice of God
   and yet a trustful hopefulness in His boundless love, we may be sure
   that he is a renewed man. He cries, "You are righteous, O my God, and
   if You destroy me, I can say nothing. But, Father, You will not destroy
   me, for I perceive that you are Love. Though I see You grasp Your sword
   of fire, yet do I trust You, for I still believe You to be gracious and
   loving." The knowledge described in the text is not only peculiar to
   those who are taught of God, but it reveals peculiarities in them which
   Grace has implanted there. They believe because they are Christ's sheep
   and know His voice. The life within them receives the living Truth of
   God. They would not have come to know the "righteous Father" unless
   there had been a change in their character worked by the Spirit of
   God--and that once done, they know Him as of necessity.

   I would next say that this knowledge is eminently consolatory. It is
   but little that I know, but I feel that I would cheerfully part with it
   all so long as I may be allowed to retain the knowledge contained in
   these two words, "righteous Father." This is my life, my light, my
   love, my delight, my Heaven! If all the productions of wit and wisdom
   throughout all past ages could be as effectually consumed as the
   Alexandrian library when it was burned to ashes. If man did but retain
   the knowledge of these two words, "righteous Father," he might be
   content to see the whole mass pass away in smoke! To know the only true
   God and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent, is the climax, the essence, the
   sum total of wisdom! I said that it was consolatory and so it is to the
   last degree. For a man to know that God is his Father is delightful
   beyond measure!

   To feel that God forgives him as the father forgave the prodigal. To
   know that He has received him into His heart and home as the father did
   his once lost boy is unspeakably delightful! But when we further learn
   that all this is done without the violation of justice--that all this
   deed of Grace is done righteously--and so done that even Justice
   demands it should be done, then are we full of wondering love! Beloved,
   God is as just in loving His sinful people as He could have been in
   manifesting His displeasure towards them! He is as just in forgiving as
   He could have been in punishing--and this is the glory of the whole
   matter! This being understood, we see our position in Christ Jesus to
   be unassailable. We see that Justice cannot punish us, for Jesus has
   borne our penalty! It cannot demand more at our hands, for our great
   Substitute has rendered to it the full tale of obedience. In Christ
   Jesus, God is just and yet our Justifier! We are so safe that we begin
   to challenge opposition and cry, "Who shall lay anything to the charge
   of God's elect?" We take up a triumphant note and sing with exceeding
   joy, "If God is for us, who can be against us!" If God is righteous and
   yet my Father, then I am saved and saved in such a way that the
   attributes of God are glorified by my salvation and, therefore, I am
   most securely and certainly saved! Why should I not rejoice?

   One more fact about this knowledge of God as a "righteous Father"--it
   is a knowledge which causes its possessor to enjoy much fellowship with
   Jesus. Notice how our Lord puts it. "O righteous Father, the world has
   not known You. But I have known You, and these have known that You have
   sent Me." "I have known You." Ah, yes, of old the Son of God knew the
   glorious Character of the Godhead! Being Himself God, He knew that
   justice was an essential attribute of Deity, which never, never could
   be tarnished or made to yield a hair's breadth! And He knew, also, that
   God is Love and that His love would never cease to be His special glory
   and delight! He knew of old that, speaking after the manner of men,
   these two attributes were each resolved to suffer no eclipse. He knew
   that each of them must keep its place.

   God must be just, and must be a Father. Consequently, when dealing with
   sinners, He must smite and He must spare. Our Lord saw how these two
   necessities stood like the eternal hills and how our doom seemed to
   roll between--and it was He who condescended, for our sakes, to bring
   these two together by His own endurance of justice and manifestation of
   love. He determined to take upon Himself our Nature and bear our sin
   which was the cause of the quarrel! And then, by enduring the
   punishment of our sins, He magnified justice--and to an equal degree
   glorified love. He came, He saw and solved the difficulty--and now the
   Judge is as righteous as if He were not love and the Father is as
   loving as if righteousness had never been offended! This grand
   Character of God as "righteous Father" was so dear to our Lord and so
   much admired by Him that He died to maintain and vindicate it! And when
   you and I come to know it, I am sure we so much delight in it that we
   feel we would sooner die than give up this Truth of God!

   This great Revelation of God is not a dogma that may or may not be
   accepted--it must be so! I do, in my soul, believe this Truth of God to
   be an article of a standing or of a falling of a Christian Church. If
   you put away the doctrine

   of the Substitutionary Sacrifice of Christ, you have disemboweled the
   Gospel and torn from it, its very heart! Angels need no longer sing
   glory to God in the highest and peace on earth if it is not true the
   union of the Divine Glory and human salvation is found in Jesus! The
   glad news dwindles down very lamentably if the Atonement is denied! But
   it cannot be disproved--God is just and yet the Justifier of him that
   believes! Christ has died that this Truth of God may be clear and His
   people live to declare it and feel that it were worth a thousand
   martyrdoms to maintain it! Herein we have fellowship with Christ, for
   He knows the "righteous Father" and rejoices in Him--and we know the
   "righteous Father," too, in Christ--and love and bless Him and wonder
   at Him every day more and more.

   Thus I have, to the best of my power, described the invaluable
   knowledge. May we all be taught of the Lord and all know Him, from the
   least to the greatest.

   Now, this knowledge comes to us by a Teacher. That Teacher is spoken of
   in verse twenty-six. "I have declared unto them Your name, and will
   declare it." Our Beloved Lord has most fitly declared to us this name
   of "righteous Father," for He, Himself, knows it as none other can know
   it! And He here confesses this intimate knowledge, saying, "but I have
   known You." "No man knows the Father save the Son" and the Son knows
   the rectitude of the Father's government and the love of the Father's
   heart beyond all others. Is He not Himself, "very God of very God"? And
   does He not perceive this wondrous union of the two ranges of
   attributes in the Person of the Father with a clearness of vision which
   no one else possesses? Fit is it, therefore, that He should declare to
   us what He has seen and known of the Father.

   He declared the "righteous Father" in His life, for in His life He
   incarnated Truth and Grace. Jesus Christ on earth was without sin in
   thought, in word and in deed. Point me to a sin He ever committed,
   inculcated, or excused. Righteousness was about Him as the atmosphere
   which He breathed. Well did the Psalmist say of Him, "You love
   righteousness and hate wickedness." And yet what love there was in Him
   and pity for the wandering sheep! He mingled with sinners and yet was
   separate from sinners. He touched their diseases and healed them and
   yet was not defiled by their impurities. He took their infirmities upon
   Himself and yet in Him, personally, there was no trace of sin. Our Lord
   was so righteous that you perceived at once that He was not of this
   world--and yet He was so lovingly human that He was altogether a Man
   among men.

   He was not at all separated from them in the way in which John the
   Baptist was, who "came neither eating nor drinking." Nor was He divided
   from His fellows, as many a man of genius has been, by eccentric modes
   of thought. He was man's Brother and his Physician, his Friend and his
   Savior! When you want to know the Father's righteousness and love, read
   the history of Jesus Christ--no, know the Lord Jesus, Himself and you
   know the Father! His death, however, most gloriously illustrated this
   beyond everything else. Behold, He dies that the "righteous Father" may
   be seen! He has taken upon Himself man's sin and He is brought to the
   place where man must answer for his sin. He is silent before His
   accusers. He is condemned and numbered with the transgressors.

   Now He must die the sinner's death. Look, He is nailed to the Cross and
   now God, Himself, forsakes Him, for He has laid the guilt of man upon
   Him and, therefore, cannot be present to make His spirit glad. The
   deserted Savior cries, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" and
   well He might, when His own Father in righteousness turned His face
   from Him! Beloved, when Jesus Christ died there was a greater display
   of the righteousness and the fatherhood of God than could have been
   possible by any other means! Then the mystery was made plain and the
   depth opened up to its very bottom! O Lord our God, what an abyss of
   adorable goodness have You thus laid bare before us!--

   "How our hearts tremble at Your love immense! In love immense,
   inviolably just! You, rather than Your justice should be stained, Did
   stain the Cross with blood of your own Son."

   And now, today, it is the business of our Lord to continue to reveal
   the righteous fatherhood of God and He does so by the work of His Holy
   Spirit. Do you not remember when He revealed it to you? When you were
   bowed down with grief on account of sin? When you longed to be
   reconciled to God but could not see how, then the Spirit of God came to
   you and pointed you to the full Atonement made, to the utmost ransom
   paid and you clapped your hands for very joy as you perceived that God
   could be your Father and receive you as His child and yet His
   righteousness need not suffer the slightest decrease! That Spirit of
   God working on the behalf of Christ is still declaring this among the
   nations! As the years roll on He is opening the eyes of the blind and
   bringing His own chosen, one by one, to behold the Glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ! And then they can say, "O righteous Father, I
   know You and rejoice in You."

   To each one of us who are saved, Jesus is declaring this "righteous
   Father" more and more. I hope I know more of this than I did 20 years
   ago. Brothers and Sisters, don't you, too? I trust that every day we
   see a little more of the righteous fatherhood of God and shall continue
   to do so, world without end! We shall, as we grow in Grace, look
   further and further into the wondrous mystery of the justice which was
   satisfied and the love which furnished the satisfaction! Beloved, it
   shall be a part of our Lord's joy, even in eternity, to still declare
   to us the name of God, the "righteous Father." Will it not be our joy
   to sit at His feet and learn of Him? Is He not a blessed Teacher? Has
   He not been very patient with us? Blessed be His name for all His care
   and patience towards us. He has taught us much and means to teach us
   more. Let us bend a listening ear and bow a willing heart while, from
   day to day, He shall continue to declare unto us the "righteous
   Father."

   Now, if at any time I should seem to preach the doctrine of the
   Substitution of Christ too often and if you should say, "He is harping
   upon the old string," I shall not hesitate to quote my Master's words
   and say, "I have declared unto them Your name, and will declare it."
   This Truth of God is one that needs continual declaration! It should be
   sounded often in the Christian's ears to keep alive His sense of
   obligation to the Wisdom which devised and the Love which carried out
   the plan of our salvation to the glory of the "righteous Father."

   II. But now, secondly, this heavenly knowledge is not given to us for
   its own sake alone. Even the high and blessed Revelation of the
   "righteous Father" is not made to us that we may know it and end in
   knowing. Our Lord says, "I have declared unto them Your name, and will
   declare it, that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them,
   and I in them." The objective of the knowledge bestowed upon us is the
   infusion of a LOVE UNRIVALLED IN VALUE and extraordinary to the last
   degree! Let us speak upon it. First, notice that this discovery of love
   which is spoken of in the 26th verse is an inward discovery of
   it--"That the love with which You have loved Me may be in them." It was
   always on them, for the Father has always loved His people--but here it
   is spoken of as, "in them."

   What does that mean? I think it means that they may know it, be
   persuaded of it, believe it and enjoy it--that they, through knowing
   the righteous name, may come to perceive the love of God towards them.
   Do you not see the connection? Jesus Christ our Lord dies for us that
   God may be righteous and yet may save us! Is it not clear as a
   pikestaff to you that God loves His people with a very wonderful love
   when He gives His own Son to die and satisfy justice on their behalf?
   Nothing can prove that love so clearly. Nothing can bring it home so
   forcibly as the sacrificial death of the Only Begotten. Therefore does
   Christ declare the blessed name of the "righteous Father," in order
   that it may come home to you with an unconquerable power that the
   Father loves you and loves you beyond conception, seeing that not even
   His dear Son was so loved as to be spared, but He must die that you
   might live and that the justice of God might be satisfied on your
   account!

   There is no way of knowing the love of God like knowing the "righteous
   Father" and the Atonement which that Character necessitated. "Hereby
   perceive we the love of God, because He laid down His life for us." You
   may say, "I see His love in every flower that blooms and every breeze
   that blows." It is true, but it is the same love, after all, which He
   has towards a horse or a cow--for do not flowers bloom and breezes blow
   for them? "We see the love of God," say some, "in giving us meat to eat
   and raiment to put on." So do I, but this, also, is the same love which
   He bears to ravens and to lilies, for does He not feed the one and
   clothe the other? I need something more by way of love than this. "I
   see God's love," says one, "in Christ's coming to teach us and make us
   better." No doubt you do, and so do I, but I do not feel it one half so
   forcibly as when I gaze upon Calvary and see the innocent Victim
   bleeding for my crimes. "Herein is love!"

   When the Divine Father gives up His best Beloved for guilty man, we may
   well say, "Behold how He loved him!" Come and see this spectacle of
   love! It is none other than the Lord of Heaven who must die to
   vindicate the jealous purity of the Divine government! Is He God's only
   begotten Son and must He bear man's guilt? Miracle of miracles! Must
   the spotless Son bear human guilt? He must! He did! Tell it and let
   Heaven be astonished, still, though it has heard the wonder nearly
   2,000 years! Upon Him who never sinned the Lord has laid our
   iniquities! Bearing that guilt, must He suffer? He must. If God loves
   His people, His Son must suffer in their place--must suffer shame, must
   suffer desertion, must suffer death. What? Must He die? Incarnate Deity
   be put to death? A felon's death? Can this be? It has been! It is
   finished! Such was the love of God that "He spared not His only
   begotten Son, but freely delivered Him up for us all." Be astonished, O
   heavens, forever and ever, that love could accomplish such a feat as
   this!

   Now, then, Christ has come on purpose to declare the name of God that
   the love of God may be perceived by us, its power felt, its Glory
   recognized, its greatness wondered at, its infinitude delighted in. But
   now notice, and here is the very heart of our subject, that this love
   was of a most extraordinary kind. "That the love with which You have
   loved Me may be in them." What is the love with which God loved His
   Son? Come, you philosophers and divines! Come, you who have learned to
   blend imagination with cool judgment--come and think this over--the
   love with which the Father loved His Son! Believer, He loves you as He
   loves His best Beloved! He is His only begotten Son--Son in a very
   mysterious manner--for we cannot understand that Divine filiation in
   which the Father is eternal and the Son also eternal.

   He loves you as He loves such a Son. There is more than sonship, there
   is natural unity of Essence, for the Father and Son are one God! And
   how the one God loves, how the Father loves, the Son, I know not,
   except that I know there can be no limit to such love. It must be
   altogether boundless and unspeakable! Now, if you fully know the
   righteous fatherhood of God, as Christ would have you know it, you will
   learn that God loved you as He loved His Son. Do you not see that it is
   so? If He had not loved you as He loved the Son, He would have spared
   His Son! Is not that clear? If He had not loved you as He loved His
   Son, He would have said to His Son, "Son, You shall never leave Heaven
   for that polluted planet. You shall never descend to poverty and
   suffering. You shall never have Your hands and feet pierced. You shall
   never be despised and spit upon and put to a cruel death."

   But because He loved us as He loved His Son, He gave His Son! Does not
   that fact warm your hearts? Does it not burn like coals of juniper
   within your bosoms? "Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable Gift"! No,
   that is not all. We learn from the verse which precedes our text that
   the Father loved our Lord eternally--"For You loved Me before the
   foundation of the world." Perceive, then, that God has also loved you,
   dear child of His, from before the foundation of the world! Before you
   had a being, His prescient eye foresaw your existence and you were the
   object of His love! How or why, I cannot tell you, but He loved you and
   He still loves you as He loves His Son! May the power of that love be
   felt in Your heart, now! It was a love of complacency and delight!

   Remember those words of the Lord which He spoke concerning His Son in
   the day of His Baptism and at two other occasions when the heavens
   opened--"This is My Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Always
   draw a distinction between the love of benevolence, with which God
   loves all His creatures, and the love of complacency which is reserved
   for His own. He calls His Church His Hephzibah, "My delight is in her."
   He says not so of the world! God never said concerning any wicked man,
   "This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," for He is not
   pleased with him, but angry with him every day! But concerning all
   those who know the "righteous Father" it is the prayer of Christ that
   the love with which the Father loves Him may be in them--and by that He
   means that they may feel that the Lord has, in them, a father's
   content.

   Do try, if you can, to realize this high privilege. It is true, O
   Believer, that God, the infinite Father, takes pleasure in you! It is
   true, but it is very surprising! Often have I turned over that Word in
   the Song where the Bridegroom says to the bride, "You are all fair, My
   love. There is no spot on you." How can this be? Why, we are all spots!
   Yet does the Eternal Father view us in Christ! And in Him He takes
   delight in us as a father does in his children. "My delights were with
   the sons of men." "He shall rest in His love, He shall rejoice over you
   with singing." When you know God as "righteous," and yet, "Father,"
   then shall you see that, inasmuch as the righteous way of salvation has
   put away all sin by laying it upon Christ, there is no reason why the
   Lord should be angry with us! And inasmuch as the righteousness of
   Christ is imputed to us, there is a legal reason why He should be
   satisfied with His people. And inasmuch as we have become one with
   Christ, there is good cause why He should take a delight in us, even
   for His Son's sake!

   God the Father loves His Son infinitely! How could He do less? Without
   beginning has He loved Him and without an end will He love Him and,
   also, without change, without limit and without degree! In the same way
   does He love His people, whose hope is fixed in Him as the "righteous
   Father." This love, wherever it reigns in the heart, creates a return
   love to God. You cannot really know all this and enjoy it without
   feeling, "My God, I love You in return." And that high and noble
   passion works to the cleansing of the soul and the purging out of
   sin--and so it becomes a sanctifying influence by which a Christian is
   made to be "holiness unto the Lord."

   To close--this love within the soul comes through an Indweller. Observe
   the last words of the text, "That the love with which You have loved Me
   may be in them, and I in them." What does this mean? I cannot tell you
   all it means. Let

   us skim the surface just for a minute. It means this. The Holy Spirit
   is the representative of Christ now upon earth and if ever the love of
   God the Father is to be known by any one of us, the Lord Jesus, by the
   Spirit, must be in us. Without the Spirit of God actually resident in
   us we cannot know the righteous Father! We are as blind and dead men
   until He quickens and illuminates us--all the letter-teaching in the
   world will benefit us nothing--we must be born again!

   My dear Hearers, there may be some of you to whom all my talk, this
   morning, must seem very strange. You cannot see anything in it. Let the
   fact cause you to suspect that you must be in the dark. When even the
   love of God to His people becomes a dry theme to you, it looks
   suspicious! Surely you have no part nor lot in it, or else you would
   relish a discourse upon it! The reason why you do not comprehend it is
   because you have not the Spirit of Christ--and if you have not the
   Spirit of Christ, you are none of His. May this convince you of your
   condition and may you be led to seek Christ and find everlasting life.

   But when the text says that Christ is in His people, it means, besides
   the indwelling of the Spirit, that Christ is in us! He is in us by
   faith, for we have taken Christ Jesus as the great atoning Sacrifice to
   be our sole and only confidence. Therefore He is in us, trusted and
   loved, fed upon and believed in. If He is so, then it is quite clear
   that we know the "righteous Father!" And when we know the "righteous
   Father," then it follows that we must have some discoveries of His
   great love to us. Are you trusting Christ? Is Jesus, in you, the hope
   of Glory? Do you trust in Him, alone? If so, go and drink to the
   fullest, the sweetness of the text and let no man say you cannot!
   Christ is in you, moreover, by a real and vital union with you. You are
   in Him as a branch is in the vine and He is in you as the sap is in the
   branch.

   You are in Him as a member is in the body and He is in you as the life
   is in all the members. We know that Jesus quickens us and because He
   lives, we live, also. From now on we are one with Christ! It must be
   so, because if God did not see us in Christ, He could not regard us
   with complacency or, in other words, love us as He loves His Son! If He
   did not, in looking upon a man, see the love and the Nature of His Only
   Begotten in Him, how could He love him? He views us as part and parcel
   of His own dear Son and so His delight is in us!

   Beloved, the Lord sees, in addition to all this, something of a
   likeness to Christ in us, worked by His Spirit, for if Jesus is,
   indeed, in us, we shall grow to be like He and shall manifest somewhat
   of His spirit and Nature. The more we have of likeness to Jesus, the
   more will it be evident that the love of God is in us and is working in
   us, "to will and to do of His own good pleasure." May God grant that
   what I have spoken so feebly may, nevertheless, be sweetly enjoyed by
   you, for I am persuaded that in the text there lies many a banquet for
   saints that hunger and thirst after righteousness-- and a depth of
   mystical teaching which it shall be well for you to search into with
   all your powers. God bless you, my Beloved, for Christ's sake. Amen.

The Magnanimity of God

   (No. 1379)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 21, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Behold, God is mighty, and despises not any: He is mighty in strength
   and wisdom" (or, in strength of heart) Job 36:5.

   WE cannot wonder that, in the extreme bitterness of his soul, Job was
   driven to utter some expressions which he would not, afterwards, have
   attempted to justify. Among the rest Job had thought and almost said
   that God had despised him. In the 10th chapter, at the 3rd verse, he
   appealed to Him thus, "Is it good unto You that You should oppress,
   that You should despise the work of Your hands?" Elihu, in his zeal to
   vindicate the righteousness of his Maker, fixes his mind, as I think,
   upon that expression of Job and meets it with a positive denial,
   proving his point from the might and the great-heartedness of the Lord.
   He had promised to fetch his argument from afar and, therefore, he does
   not argue against God's despising any from His mercy or goodness.

   Nor does he give us a commonplace reason for his assertion, such as
   would easily have suggested itself even to the thoughtless, but he
   grounds his declaration that God despises no one and, consequently, not
   Job, upon the fact of God's being mighty. "Behold, God is mighty, and
   despises not any: He is mighty in strength of heart." That form of
   argument would not have naturally occurred to you or to me. We might
   even have been inclined to argue the other way and say-- He is so
   mighty that He cannot be expected to consider such feeble things as His
   creatures and He despises them all! And it is, therefore, little wonder
   that He should despise Job among the rest. Elihu, with far better
   judgment than the most of us possess, draws quite the opposite
   inference and declares that because God is mighty, therefore He
   despises no one!

   Facts are convincing arguments and if you carefully observe, you will
   see that usually those persons who despise others are weak and, if weak
   nowhere else, weak in understanding. Those little men who are dressed
   in brief authority are often harsh and tyrannical, but the truly great
   are courteous, tender and considerate. The strong have no reason to be
   suspicious and jealous and, therefore, they are free from envy. They
   are void of fear of the power of others and, therefore, they become
   anxious that their own power should not be oppressive to the weak ones
   around them. They become considerate of others because this furnishes a
   fit sphere for the use of their strength. Yon man who is only strong in
   appearance and is really feeble, despises others because he dreads
   them--and knowing how much he deserves to be despised, himself, he
   pretends to look down upon his neighbors.

   It is your half-educated man who sneers. It is your pretender to
   gentility who gives himself airs. Wherever anything is mere pretense,
   it endeavors to shield itself from criticism by casting sarcasms upon
   its rivals. It is said of the Pharisees that they trusted in
   themselves, that they were righteous and despised others. Had they been
   truly righteous, they would not have despised others, but because they
   had a mere veneer of religion, a superficial varnish or gilding of
   righteousness--or something that looked like righteousness--they looked
   down with supreme scorn upon all who did not make the same show as
   themselves.

   God is so great in all things that He despises none! He has no rivals
   and has no need to sustain Himself by lowering the good name of others.
   He is supremely real. He is so true and thorough that in Him there can
   never be so much as the thought of despising any in order to guard
   Himself. His power is not soon awakened to war because it has no
   opposition to fear. His might is associated with gentleness--fury is
   not in Him because it is such great might that when it is once in
   action it devours His adversaries as flame consumes the stubble! God is
   too great to be contemptuous, too mighty to be haughty.

   Note, too, that mere brute force may despise the weak, but the might
   here ascribed to the Lord is of a higher order. His might is seen not
   only in that power which rocks the solid world with earthquakes and
   shakes the heavens with tempests, but in that nobler form of might
   which reveals itself in wisdom and nobleness of mind. The power of His
   arm is

   equaled by the greatness of His spirit. His might lies in His heart--in
   His understanding and in His love. He is mighty in spiritual things, in
   sublimity of thought, grandeur of motive, nobleness of spirit and
   loftiness of aim. When you perceive the exaltation of the Divine Mind
   and the sublimity of the Divine Character, you perceive the reason why
   the Lord does not despise any.

   To put my meaning into one cumbersome but expressive word, it is the
   magnanimity of God which prevents His despising any. The sun is so
   glorious that it refuses not to shine upon a dunghill! The rain is so
   plenteous that it declines not to drop into the tiny flower cup! The
   sea is so vast that it does not hesitate to waft a feather and God is
   so mighty that He rejects not the praises of babes and sucklings. If
   God were little, He might despise the little. If He were weak He would
   disdain the weak. If He were untrue He would be supercilious to those
   about Him. But, seeing He is none of these, but is God Over All,
   blessed forever, the Only Wise God, we have to deal with One who,
   though He is high, has respect unto the lowly! Our God is One who,
   though He humbles Himself even to observe the things which are done in
   Heaven, yet despises not the cry of the humble! The magnanimity of God
   is the reason why He despises no one. By the aid of the Holy Spirit we
   will, this morning, first dwell upon the doctrine and then consider its
   practical uses.

   I. First, I want you reverently to consider THE DOCTRINE that God is
   mighty and, therefore, despises not any. Begin at the beginning. The
   Lord is mighty--that is to say, God is so strong that immeasurable and
   inconceivable power belongs to Him. "God has spoken once; twice have I
   heard this; that power belongs unto God." All that God has already done
   proves His power, but we cannot, even from His greatest works, guess at
   what He is yet able to do! "Lo, these are parts of His ways; but how
   little a portion is heard of Him? The thunder of His power, who can
   understand?" Since there is no boundary to His power and it would be
   sinful to attempt to limit the Holy One of Israel, we are free to
   believe that the Lord could work in even a more stupendous scale than
   He has done if it so pleased Him.

   Search as long as you will, and by His help obtain as clear a discovery
   of Divine power as was ever given to mortal mind, but remember that He
   is past finding out and that even if you saw Him stand and measure the
   earth, and drive asunder the nations and cause the everlasting
   mountains to be scattered, and the perpetual hills to bow, you would
   yet have to say with Habakkuk, "There was the hiding of His power."
   With the Lord nothing is impossible! Learn somewhat of His power from
   the following facts. First, all the power there is in the universe came
   from God at first, comes from Him, still, and, at His bidding, would,
   in a single moment, cease! Whatever of force there is in inanimate
   Nature it is but God at work. He set the wheel of Nature in motion and
   at His bidding it would cease to turn.

   Whatever mental faculty there may be in cherub or seraph, angel or man,
   it is but an emanation from His creative energy, a ray from His eternal
   sun which would cease if He restrained His might. If Jehovah willed it,
   yonder enormous orbs, which now revolve in order around the central
   sphere, would rush in wild confusion to inevitable destruction! The law
   of gravitation, which holds all things in their places, would be broken
   in an instant if He withdrew the force which makes the law a power!
   There would be no coherence among atoms--no, the atoms, themselves,
   would dissolve into non-existence and leave one vast sepulcher--one
   universal void!

   Herein is power so great that we cry with Nehemiah, "You, even You, are
   Lord alone! You have made Heaven, the Heaven of heavens, with all their
   hosts, the earth and all things that are therein. The seas and all that
   is therein and You preserve them all and the host of Heaven worships
   you." The great God can do all things without help. He needs no
   assistance from any created thing. Indeed, there could be no such aid,
   since all the power of all other beings is derived from Him! Creatures
   do not contribute to His strength--they only manifest Him, revealing
   the power which they have first of all borrowed from Him. To achieve
   any purpose of His heart He asks none to be His ally, for He does as He
   wills.

   What is more, He could, with equal ease, accomplish all His purposes if
   all created intelligences and forces were against Him. It would make no
   difference to His supremacy of might though all the tremendous powers
   which have now been created should revolt. He that sits in the heavens
   would have them in derision. Even powers which set up their standard
   against Him are beneath His control! His enemies are His footstool--out
   of their rage He brings forth His peaceful purposes--"He makes the
   wrath of men to praise Him and the remainder thereof He does restrain."
   Note well that when God has done all that He pleases, He has not spent
   His strength. "He faints not, neither is weary. There is no searching
   of His understanding."

   He watches always, but He never wearies so as to need to slumber. He
   works always, but He never pauses to take rest because of any weariness
   or exhaustion. When He has done all that He has purposed to do, He
   remains as ready to work

   as before. When He has, according to our notions, gone to the utmost of
   His potency, He is but at the beginning! These are the hems of His
   garments, but His full Glory is not seen. I tremble while I speak upon
   that of which I know so little, but assuredly God is mighty in the most
   emphatic sense that can be conceived by the most enlarged intellect,
   yes, and far beyond all that has entered into the heart of man.

   The text, also, tells us that He is "mighty in strength and in wisdom,"
   so that we have to consider that God is powerful in mind. "There is no
   searching of His understanding." He not only possesses physical might,
   by which He creates, preserves, or destroys, but the higher power of
   understanding, for, "He is wonderful in counsel." "Great is our Lord
   and of great power His understanding is infinite." It is difficult to
   find words to express my meaning, for God is a Spirit and as far as He
   may reverently be spoken of as possessing a mind and intellect, He is
   as Omnipotent in that sphere as in the physical world. This is the
   security of His creatures--that He is a great-minded God! He who has
   great power of hand is to be dreaded unless he has corresponding
   greatness of soul. It is a calamity when the ruler of an empire cannot
   rule his own spirit.

   The world has shuddered at Neros and Domitians and Caligulas who were
   so weak in character that they broke every law of morality and
   humanity--and yet had the destinies of nations under their control.
   Look at the conformation of the heads of those monsters and they strike
   you as resembling both prizefighters and idiots, or a combination of
   the two! And one's blood chills at hearing that such beings were once
   masters of the Roman world. Happy is it for a nation when the master of
   its legions is of a benevolent mind and generous spirit, strong in
   self-restraint and irresistible in the force of virtue. In the highest
   degree we have this in "the Blessed and Only Potentate." God has great
   thoughts, great designs, great wisdom, great goodness! He is mighty in
   all respects and especially in the restraint which He puts upon His
   wrath.

   If you wish to see this, look at the forbearance and long-suffering
   which He manifests towards the disobedient. How matchless is His
   patience! How enduring His mercy! The wicked provoke Him and He feels
   the provocation, but yet He does not smite. Week after week they insult
   Him--they even touch the apple of His eye by persecuting His
   people--but still He lets the lifted thunder drop and gives space for
   repentance. He sends them messages of mercy. He implores them to turn
   from the error of their ways, but they harden their hearts, they
   blaspheme Him, they take His holy name in vain! Still, by the space of
   many years He bears with their incessant rebellions and though He is
   grieved with the hardness of their hearts, He keeps back His
   indignation. This patience is shown not here and there to one of our
   race, but to myriads of the human family--and not for one generation,
   only, but from generation after generation does His good Spirit
   strive--still does He stretch out His hands all the day long even to
   the disobedient and to the gainsayers. Not willing that any should
   perish, He waits long and patiently because He delights in mercy.

   Equally wonderful, I think, is the power which God has over His own
   mind in the ultimate pardoning of many of these transgressors. It is
   marvelous that He should be able to forgive any and so perfectly to
   forgive! It often happens to us that we feel compelled to say, when
   greatly offended, "I can forgive you, but I fear I shall never forget
   the wrong." God goes far beyond this, for He casts all our sins behind
   His back and He declares that He will not remember them against us any
   more, forever. What? Never? Such deep offenses! Such heinous crimes!
   Such provoking transgressions! Shall they never be remembered? What?
   Not ever remembered? Shall there not be at least a frown, or a degree
   of coolness on account of them? No. "I have blotted out, as a thick
   cloud, your transgressions and, as a cloud, your sins."

   It shows the great-mindedness of God that He should be able to act thus
   and to act thus towards the very chief of sinners! "Who is a God like
   unto You, that pardons iniquity and passes by the transgressions of the
   remnant of His heritage? He retains not His anger forever because He
   delights in mercy." Let me add that when He does not forgive, but when
   persistent impenitence demands the final doom, God is great-souled even
   in the punishment of the wicked. He takes no pleasure in the sinner's
   death. Judgment is His strange work. Punishment is never inflicted as a
   matter of arbitrary sovereignty, but always because demanded by
   justice. The Lord, in vindicating His justice, deals not with the poor
   and the obscure, alone, but with the great ones of the earth--plucking
   down from their high places, emperors and kings red-handed with human
   carnage--and casting them down to Hell.

   Nor does He, on the other hand, exercise exceptional severity on the
   great blasphemer, but He deals with the baser sort, also, and does not
   spare the braggart of the streets who profanes His name. Calmly and
   impartially does God deal out justice, "for there is no iniquity with
   the Lord our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts." His
   sentence is so just that none shall be able to criticize it. Thus He
   proves the greatness of His mind, for when He does condemn and

   punish it is never in passion, never in haste, never without exact
   weighing of evidence. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
   "Yes, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty
   pervert judgment." Our God, then, is mighty of heart. Now, the pith of
   the doctrine lies here, that because of His might God, despises not
   any. The proof is very manifest. God is so great and mighty that all
   things must be little to Him. There can be nothing great to the
   infinite

   God.

   There are worlds so ponderous that human reckoning cannot estimate
   their size. There are worlds so numerous that we have to leave them
   uncounted, yet separately or apart, or taken altogether in their
   constellations, all these must be as a drop in a bucket to Him. Since,
   then, all things must be little, it comes to pass that nothing is,
   therefore, more than little and nothing falls much more below the level
   of His greatness than other things which we are known to think much of.
   If the Divine observation and care is to extend to creatures at all,
   then it must be exercised upon insignificance and weakness, since,
   compared with Himself, there is nothing else. If you desire proof that
   the Lord considers the lesser things, look at Creation. The great and
   mighty God has displayed His greatness as much in the tiny objects
   which He has made as in the magnificent worlds which He has fashioned.
   Myriads of creatures disport themselves in a single drop of stagnant
   water and yet in each one of these, Omnipotence is manifested.

   The bodies of those minute beings display, in every part, amazing skill
   and admirable design. Their very minuteness increases our wonder and
   compels us to feel the mightiness of the Divine Creator. For each of
   these infusorial creatures, so small as only to be observed beneath a
   strong microscope, God finds fitting food and puts life-force into each
   part of its organization so that it can exist, grow, mature, enjoy
   life, and transmit it to its successor. He sees to everything that
   concerns a gnat or a fly--and as surely as He watches over seraphim and
   cherubim He guards the worm of the earth and the minnow of the brook!
   God has created tiny things, not as a freak or an experiment, nor as
   the sport of His leisure, but in sober earnest. He has evidently put
   forth as much of His mind in the formation of the minute as in the
   fashioning of the immense!

   And since He has done so, let us not question that He will deal
   tenderly with the poor and needy among men and He will despise none
   that seek Him in sincerity of heart. He who takes care of gnats and
   flies will hear the prayers of humble hearts and will not refuse to
   regard the ignorant and the obscure! Jesus, His Son, was meek and lowly
   in heart, and suffered the little children to come unto Him and,
   therefore, we who are least among men shall not be despised! The same
   respect to the minor things is observable in Providence. The Providence
   of God does not only concern wars between mighty empires and the
   discussions of cabinets and royal councils, but it comprehends within
   its rule everything that transpires. The blooming of each one of the
   millions of daisies in the meadows is arranged by eternal purpose and
   the croaking of a frog in the marsh, or the falling of a leaf from an
   oak in the forest is part of the plan of eternal wisdom!

   The migration of each swallow is as much arranged as the voyage of
   Columbus! The breaking of a fowler's net is as surely ordained as the
   emancipation of a nation! God is in ALL things--not a sparrow lights to
   the ground without your Father--and the very hairs of your head are all
   numbered. A Force which encompasses these little things and condescends
   to make them a part of His eternal purpose most evidently proves that
   the Lord cannot be suspected of despising any! One telling argument to
   prove that the magnanimity of God despises none is found in the fact
   that He has regarded man. David thought so when he surveyed, "the
   heavens, the work of God's fingers, the moon and the stars which He had
   ordained," for he exclaimed, "What is man, that You are mindful of him?
   And the son of man, that You

   visit him?"

   Man is neither the greatest, the strongest, nor the swiftest among
   animals. Lions outmatch him in force, horses in swiftness, eagles in
   power to soar and fish in ability to dive. Leviathan far surpasses him
   in bulk and behemoth exceeds him in the strength of his loins. Man is
   apparently a feeble creature and more likely to be the prey of beasts
   than their destroyer. Look at him in his naked weakness and what a
   defenseless, unprotected creature he appears! And yet he is monarch of
   the world! As David said, "You made him to have dominion over the works
   of Your hands. You have put all things under his feet; all sheep and
   oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field; the fowl of the air and the
   fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas."

   That God should consider man is an instance of that great-mindedness
   which does not look at bulk and strength, but abounds in condescension.
   This is more clear, too, when you think of what sort of men God has
   most of all favored. Who

   are his chosen? Remember that the most intimate love of God has seldom
   fallen to the lot of the great ones of this earth. "Not many mighty,
   not many noble are called; but God has full often chosen the poor of
   this world."--

   "When the Eternal bows the skies

   To visit earthly things,

   With scorn Divine He turns His eyes

   From towers of haughty kings.

   He bears His a wful chariot roll

   Far downward from the skies,

   To visit every humble soul,

   With pleasure in His eyes."

   What does Paul say in His Epistle to the Corinthians? "Things which are
   despised has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to
   nothing things that are." He despises not any, we are sure, for when He
   ordained fathers in His Church and set 12 leaders in the Apostleship,
   He chose to this office neither philosophers, nor senators, nor kings,
   but lowly fishermen! And from that day, to this, it has been His
   pleasure to do His mightiest actions for His people by those who have
   been least esteemed among the sons of men, for He is so mighty that He
   despises not any.

   Brethren, you know, some of you, another sweet proof that He does not
   despise any, for you can say in the language of David, in the 22nd
   Psalm, "He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
   afflicted; neither has He hid His face from him; but when he cried unto
   Him, He heard." You have, some of you, been in very deep waters through
   bodily pain, bereavement, poverty, or persecution. You have found loved
   ones and friends forsake you, for you have been but poor company for
   their merry-makings. But God has not forsaken you! He has been very
   near to you in the time of your distress and thus has He proven that He
   despises not any. To this man, also, has He looked, even to him that is
   poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembles at His Word.

   I need not stay to prove this further, for all history declares that
   God has no esteem for human greatness--that He has no flattery for
   human excellence--but that, on the contrary, He lays the axe at the
   root of the tall and the green trees and brings them down even to the
   ground. But as for those that are lowly and despised and appear to be
   withered, He has pity upon them and blesses them--and so the word of
   His servant, Ezekiel, is fulfilled, "And all the trees of the field
   shall know that I, the Lord, have brought down the high tree, have
   exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree and have made the
   dry tree to flourish. I, the Lord, have spoken and have done it."

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, the proof which I have given you that the
   Lord looks upon little and lowly things shows the greatness of His
   soul. Our God is not like the great ones among men. Kings and princes
   generally esteem those most who can do them or the State most service.
   God needs nothing from any and, therefore, neither esteems the great
   nor despises the little. He is delivered from all consideration of
   self, seeing that He is All in All. Those who can do the State no
   service are usually looked upon by their rulers as the last to be
   considered. Why should they have a voice? Who are they, that their
   interests should be thought of? But seeing God requires not to look to
   any for help, He is not led to look down with despite and contempt upon
   any!

   If you feel an undue esteem for some, it follows almost as a matter of
   course that you should have a lack of consideration for others. But
   because God has no need to ask favors of any of His creatures or, in
   the slightest degree, to care for their strength or wisdom, He makes
   not much of the great and, therefore, on the other hand, He does not
   make little of those who are of lowly rank. God has power, also, to
   protect all interests and this, human rulers say, they cannot do. The
   great ones of the earth will often argue thus, "For the good of the
   general public, a portion of the population must suffer. Great measures
   naturally involve distress here and there, and this is unavoidable. The
   law bears hard upon a few, but we cannot alter it--all regulations do
   so, more or less."

   But God is so mighty that He has no need to perform a deed which
   involves injustice to one of the least of His creatures! Strict justice
   shall be dealt out to every individual as impartially as if He were the
   only creature God had ever made! The Lord knows how to consider
   everyone a separate individual of the human family as carefully as if
   there were no more than that one. He is so great in might and His
   thoughts are so deeply wise that He looks to the interests of all. "The
   Lord is good to all and His tender mercies are over all His works." Let
   us adore and bless Him that this doctrine stands on so sure a basis--He
   is mighty in heart, and despises not any!

   II. Now I come to THE PRACTICAL USES of this great Truth of God. And
   the first use is, it should greatly encourage those who are tried. You
   have not come, my dear Friend, to quite so low a state as that of Job
   when he sat upon a dunghill and scraped his sores with a potsherd. But
   even if you had, you ought not to conclude that you are despised of the
   Lord. He could never despise one of those for whom Christ died. The
   Lord has not thought contemptuously of you and said, "Let Him suffer!
   He is a nobody--it matters not what becomes of him." On the contrary,
   whatever your griefs are today, they have been allotted to you by
   infinite Wisdom and superlative Love. You are in the best condition
   that you could be in. Bad as it appears to you, God knows that your lot
   is rightly ordained.

   If it had been better for you, upon the whole, to have been rolling in
   wealth, you would have been. If it had been better for you never to
   know pang or pain, you would not have known them. But God's great
   purposes and plans, involving you and the rest of His people, render it
   the best thing that you should be tried and, therefore, tried you are.
   If you could have all the facts of the case and all the Divine purposes
   spread before you--and if you could have as clear an understanding as
   God has--you would put yourself just where you are now, for your
   Father's dealings are right and good. He has not put you in the furnace
   because He despises you, but because He values you! He bought you with
   the blood of Jesus and, therefore, you may be sure He prizes you.

   Neither does the Lord think so little of you as to forget you in your
   pains. In all your grief, Jesus has deep sympathy with you. In the
   watches of the night His eyes see your faintness and sleeplessness.
   When nurse and friend must, from very weariness, leave you, He is still
   with you, making your bed in your sickness. You must not say, "My God
   is so busy with Heaven's glories and with the management of the world's
   affairs that He forgot me." Far from it! "Like as a father pities his
   children, so the Lord pities them that fear Him." Depend upon it, the
   great God is too mighty to despise one of His own children!

   He does not say, "It is only a work-girl pining away with consumption,
   she will not be missed." Nor does He say, "It is only a poor old woman,
   worn out and suffering the natural pains of old age, it little matters
   what happens to her." He does not speak contemptuously and say, "It is
   only a man of a small brain who will never do much and is not worth
   caring about--let him sorrow and die--there will only be one grave more
   in the cemetery and one less mouth to feed, and that is all." Oh, no,
   He "despises not any." "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death
   of His saints." He sees your tears and hears your groans, for He is in
   fellowship with the very least of His people! "In all their affliction
   He is afflicted and the angel of His Presence saves them."

   If any of you have come here, this morning, very much cast down because
   your trials are little known to others and nobody sympathizes with you,
   get a grasp of this grand fact--"He despises not any"--and you will be
   much cheered. You are not made to suffer because of any indifference in
   God's heart towards you, but because He loves you! "As many as I love,"
   He says, "I rebuke and chasten." Take these rebukes and chastening as
   tokens of His love and when the rod falls more heavily than usual,
   perceive it to be the rod of the Covenant which is held in a father's
   hand and only comes upon His own beloved!

   A second use of this great Truth of God is one which I pray God to
   render effectual. It should encourage every sinner who is seeking the
   face of God to think that God is mighty and despises no one. You, dear
   Friend, feel now as if God might very well pass you by and suffer you
   to perish. You have begun to seek His face, but you could not blame Him
   if He were to hide Himself from you and leave you to perish, for you
   have such a keen sense of your unworthiness and insignificance. Be
   comforted by this--God is too great to deny you His favor! What profit
   would He have in your blood? What benefit would it be to Him that you
   should go down alive into the Pit? His Justice has been glorified
   sufficiently in the death of His Son, Jesus, and those that believe in
   Him shall, therefore, live!

   Beloved Friend, it may be you say, "I am so ignorant, I know but little
   of the Lord." Will He despise you because of that? If He does, woe unto
   us all, for we are all ignorant--and on that ground He might despise
   even the angels whom He charged with folly! In comparison with His
   Omniscience, all creatures are fools! Little as you know, He will teach
   you and instruct you, but He will not despise you. "Ah," you say, "but
   I have such slender faculties." Suppose you have--the greatest
   intellect that God has created must, in comparison with Him, have
   little enough of capacity and, therefore, He would despise all that He
   has made! But it is not so.

   Does the Lord ask any faculty from us, except the faculty to receive
   His mercy and to lay hold upon His Grace? Your very emptiness and sense
   of need constitute a faculty of receptiveness into which He will pour
   His Grace! Be not

   discouraged, however low in the scale of intelligence you may place
   yourself. God is mighty in heart and despises not any. Your heart is
   broken. Well, it is written, "A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You
   will not despise." Your graces are very weak. You cannot see clear
   marks of the Divine Spirit about you. It is written, "He has not
   despised the day of small things." Even sparks of Grace He never
   tramples out! And although your Grace is but as a smoking flax, which
   may have more of offense about it than of excellence, even that He does
   not quench. The bruised reed, the Grace which seems to be destroyed,
   and out of which no music can be brought, He does not despise or break!
   Others may despise you, but the heavenly Father will not.

   It is possible that you say, "Oh, Sir, I cannot think deep thoughts. I
   try to grasp the great doctrines, but they are beyond me." God is so
   mighty that He does not despise you for that, for He has sent you a
   Gospel which requires no deep thought. The Gospel of, "believe and
   live," is on the level of any man's capacity who desires to understand
   and believe. Christ Jesus has pitched the Gospel note so low that our
   poor cracked bass voices may join in the tune! He has made the steps of
   the Palace Beautiful so easy that little children may climb them! I
   bless Him for that Word, "Suffer the little children to come unto Me,
   and forbid them not," for then I, who feel myself as a mere babe amidst
   the great mysteries of His Kingdom, may come to Him and be sure that He
   despises not any and despises not even me!

   "Ah, but," you say, "I fear that God will cast me away because I shall
   never be eminent for any great Grace even if He saves me. My faith, I
   fear, will always be weak. My love will always be chill, my character
   will be imperfect." Well, beloved Friend, then you will owe more to His
   love than others! And more to His patience and His Grace! But in any
   case He will not despise you. Do you think that the great God needs our
   great graces? It is true He is pleased with great faith, but He would
   be a great God if we had no faith at all! It is true He delights to see
   the heroism of His children, but not because He depends upon that or
   needs it in the slightest degree! He gets nothing out of us! Our
   goodness extends not to Him, therefore is He too mighty to despise us
   if we cannot render anything to Him.

   Yet another replies, "I can understand God's saving a man who
   afterwards becomes an eminent minister or a gifted missionary. But if
   He were to save me, He could not make much of me. What would I be if
   Divine Grace did its best with me? I could only be a humble unknown
   member of the Church drawing greatly upon His resources, but giving Him
   a very small return." Well, Beloved, the Lord is so mighty that He is
   willing to receive multitudes of such! Why should He not? If He did not
   receive them, He would not be enriched by His refusal. If He does
   receive them, He will not be impoverished by what He bestows upon them!

   Believe firmly in the generosity of God! I have known what it is to
   find shelter behind His magnanimity when I have cried, "O that He would
   look upon me in love! I am utterly unworthy and insignificant--will He
   take the trouble to spurn me? Will it be worth His while to refuse me
   His Grace? Surely I am too unimportant for Him to break His promise in
   order to reject me and act contrary to His Nature in order to cast me
   away--and both of these He would have to do if He rejected one poor,
   needy, penitent spirit which dares to trust in Him through Jesus
   Christ!" O poor, discouraged one, believe in God's great-heartedness!
   Throw yourself at the foot of the Cross, Sinner, and say unto God, "By
   Your very greatness I will lay hold upon You. Surely you are too mighty
   to crush a worm like I, too mighty to refuse me, now that I trust the
   blood and merit of Your Son! Display the greatness of Your might by
   saving me, even me, I beseech You."

   Do you not see how full of consolation is the doctrine of the text? May
   faith be given by the Holy Spirit to enable you to grasp it! Lastly,
   this doctrine affords an example for God's people. If our heavenly
   Father is mighty and despises not any, then it clearly follows that if
   we are imitators of God, as dear children we must not despise any. I
   pray you never despise any of your Brothers and Sisters in Christ. Are
   they poorer than you? Do not despise them, but rather help them! If
   they are very, very poor, think what they have to bear and do not add
   to their other sorrows the grief caused by your contempt. Deal gently
   and tenderly with them!

   If they are parts of your Lord's body, you should be glad to serve
   them, for so you wash His feet. You should feel it to be a blessing
   that there are poor saints to whom you can minister because, in doing
   so, you are ministering to Christ. "The poor you have always with you"
   and they are necessary, for if there were no poor saints, we might
   begin crying, "Lord Jesus, what can we do for You? We wish we could
   show our love to You, but now, seeing there are no poor saints, we do
   not know how to clothe You, nor how to visit You in Your sickness, and
   we shall miss the blessing of doing it." If poor saints abound around
   you, esteem them, because it is through them you will be able to be
   commended by your Lord when He will say to you, "I was hungry and you
   gave Me meat. I was thirsty and you gave Me drink."

   Perhaps your poorer Brothers and Sisters are more honorable in God's
   esteem than you are--and probably they love the Master better than you
   do. It is very possible that they show more of the power of godliness
   in their lives than you do in yours and it may be, when Christ will
   come in His Glory, He will put them in a higher seat than some who have
   houses and lands. Brothers and Sisters, do not despise one another! If
   you see a Brother with very little talent doing his best, never sneer
   at him. God may, perhaps, bless his one handful of corn more than He
   will your basketful if he sows in more faith than you do. Do not
   despise young beginners. What if they do not know as much as you do?
   You do not know too much and you know but little to the purpose if you
   have no compassion upon the lambs of the flock.

   Never despise a Brother because of the mistakes he makes in doctrine.
   If you can set him right, do so, but if the love of God is in him, do
   not cast him out for his blunders. Do not say, "I will never associate
   with that man." In the family of Grace there are some strange people.
   Some of the Lord's are such that if He did not choose them in
   sovereignty, I am at a loss to see how else they were chosen. But then,
   if the Lord loves them, you should endeavor to do the same. Never
   despise one of Christ's little ones, or evil will come of it.

   Once more, never despise any. There is a text that some people are very
   pleased with--"Honor the king." Yes, by all means! I trust we shall
   always be very loyal and honor the sovereign of the realm in which we
   dwell. But did you ever notice the precept which comes before it, which
   I recommend to those people who sneer at the poor? It runs thus--
   "Honor all men." This is just as much a duty as, "Honor the king."
   "Honor all men." What? Honor the lower classes? Yes, Sir, "honor all
   men." Honor agricultural laborers? Yes, "all men." Honor paupers,
   crossing-sweepers? Yes, "honor all men." Respect the worker and the
   sufferer? Respect the burden and the burden-bearer? Anything in the
   shape of a man or a woman deserves to be honored, for man was made in
   the image of God!

   You are not to say of the fallen woman, "Away with her! The less said
   about her, the better." Perhaps so, Sister, but the more done the
   better. Nor are you to say of any man, "He is an incorrigible
   character. We can do nothing for him." No, that is not the way Jesus
   deals with men--He despises not any. Upon the worst of characters we
   ought to spend sevenfold love and patience in the hope that we may
   rescue such depraved ones from the depths of sin. If it comes, you
   know, to the matter of despising, and you and I begin despising our
   fellow creatures, God may make short work of us by despising us! He may
   just shut the door of Mercy in our faces and say, "You think little
   enough of one another. You poor people are railing at the rich and you
   rich people are sneering at the poor. By your own judgment you shall
   all be judged."

   The Lord knows if He were to leave a woman to be judged by women, or
   even if He were to leave a man to be judged by men, a whole host of us
   would be lost! But instead of that, He sets wide the door of Grace and
   bids the despised ones come and welcome! For Jesus' sake He looks in
   pity upon men and has a kindness towards them. He sets before us an
   open door of Mercy and cries, "I have given My Son to die, and whoever
   among you will but believe in Him shall prove that I will not despise
   you, but will receive you to My heart, love you in time and love you in
   eternity--and give you to be sharers of the Throne of My only begotten
   Son forever and ever."

   Brothers and Sisters, shake off your pride and love your fellow man,
   for if you love not your brother whom you have seen, how can you love
   God, whom you have not seen? If He is mighty and despises not any, then
   you can be sure that if you despise any it is because you are not the
   mighty body that you think you are! Your contempt of others proves that
   you are a little-souled creature--weak, pitiful, pretentious! You may
   measure yourself by this--if you despise others you ought to be
   despised! But, if on the contrary, your tender heart of sympathy would
   lift even the beggar from the dunghill, you are magnanimous,
   great-souled and like unto God! May the Holy Spirit make you more and
   more so. Amen.

Vanities and Verities

   (No. 1380)

   DELIVERED BY

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "We look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
   notseen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things
   which are not seen are eternal." 2 Corinthians 4:18.

   THE Apostle Paul was by no means a stoic. He had not conquered all
   human feeling and rendered himself a stone man. On the contrary, he was
   exceedingly sensitive. You can see abundant evidence, not only in the
   Acts of the Apostles, but also in the tone of all his Epistles, that he
   has a very tender spirit. He feels acutely any unkindness. If a friend
   forsakes him, he mourns it. Or if friends help him, there is genuine
   emotion in his gratitude. He is sensitive, too, to poverty, sensitive
   to shame--sensitive to all those griefs which he has to bear for
   Christ's sake. He feels them--you can see that he does. He is not an
   invulnerable man in armor--he is a man of flesh and blood whom the
   arrows pierce and pain.

   Yet how bravely he sticks to his work! He faces every danger and never
   dreams of flinching. Never for a single moment does he seem to take
   into consideration what he may have, personally, to suffer for the
   testimony of Christ and the triumph of the Gospel. He remembers the
   pangs when they are past! He looks on the scars when they are healed
   and he sometimes gives a long list of the perils and privations he has
   had to endure, thus showing that he was keenly sensitive, but he never
   tries to shelter himself from any sort of suffering if it is necessary
   to accomplish his lifework. Thus he pressed steadily on through evil
   report and good report, through honor and through dishonor, enjoying
   the love of the Churches at one time and at another time smarting under
   a cruel suspicion of his Apostleship even among his own converts!

   He is now the hero of unbounded popularity, when the people crowd to do
   him honor, and at another time the victim of public hatred and frenzied
   riot when he is dragged out of the city to be stoned to death! "But
   none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto me," he
   could well say. He seemed as if God had thrown him forth from His hands
   even as He hurls a thunderbolt, and he stopped not until he reached the
   end towards which the power of God was hurling him! He cried, "The love
   of Christ constrains us." He reckoned himself, therefore, dead to all
   but Christ. Well may we be curious to know what supported so noble a
   man under his trials and developed such a hero under such a succession
   of oppositions.

   What kept him so calm? What made him so self-possessed and intrepid?
   How was it that when cast down he was not destroyed--that when troubled
   he was not distressed? What sustained him? He gives us the key to this
   fortitude by telling us that he counted his afflictions light because
   they were, in his estimation, but for a moment, and they were working
   out for him a far more exceedingly and eternal weight of glory. He was
   calm and happy midst rage and tumult, violent prejudice, adverse and
   even disastrous circumstances, because, in the language of the text, he
   looked not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are
   unseen, reckoning that the things which are seen are not worth looking
   at, they are so transient--while the things unseen are of priceless
   worth because they are eternal!

   That is our subject at this time. First, things not to be looked at.
   And, second, things to be looked at. The text wears the shape of a
   double paradox. Things that can be seen are, naturally, the things to
   be looked at. What should a man look at but what he can see? And yet
   the Apostle tells us not to look at the things which are seen, but at
   the things which are not seen! How can things invisible be looked at?
   That again is a paradox. How can you look at what you cannot see? This
   is only one paradox of the Christian life which is all paradox--and the
   riddle lies rather in the words than in the sense. We shall soon
   discover that there is no contradiction or incongruity, no difficulty
   whatever.

   I. First, then, let us LOOK AT WHAT CAN BE SEEN and ask what we are to
   understand by this declaration--"We look not at the things which are
   seen." The word for, "look," is used, I think, six times in the New
   Testament and is translated in four or five different ways. I do not
   intend to keep to those translations, but to work them into the
   explanation of what is meant by not looking at the things which are
   seen. It means, first, lightly esteeming both present

   joy and present sorrow, as if they were not worth looking at. The
   present is so soon to be over that Paul does not care to look at it.
   There is so little of it and it lasts such a brief time that he does
   not even care to give it a glance--he looks not at it.

   Here he is persecuted, despised, forsaken. "It will not last long," he
   says. "It is but a pin's prick. It will soon be over and I shall be
   with the goodly fellowship above and behold my Master's face." He will
   not look at it. He ignores it! Thus it behooves us to do if surrounded
   with trials, troubles, present sorrows--we should not think so much of
   them as to fix our attention or rivet our gaze on them. Rather, let us
   treat them with indifference and say, "It is really a very small matter
   whether I am in wealth or in poverty, in health or in sickness--whether
   I am enjoying comforts or whether I am robbed of them. The present will
   so soon be gone that I do not care to look at it. I am like a man who
   stays at an inn for a night while he is on a journey."

   Is the room uncomfortable? When the morning breaks, it is of no use
   making a complaint and so he merely chronicles the fact and hastens on.
   He says to himself, "Never mind, I am up and away at once. It is of no
   use fretting about trifles." If a person is going a long distance in a
   railway carriage, he may be a little particular as to where he shall
   sit to see the country and as to which way he likes to ride. But if it
   is only a short stage between, say, the Borough Road and the Elephant
   and Castle--he does not think about it. He does not care in whose
   company he may be, it is only for a few minutes. He is hardly in before
   he is out again. It is a matter not worth thinking about.

   That is how the Apostle regarded it. He reckoned that his present joys
   and present sorrows were so soon to be over that they were, to him, a
   matter of indifference, not even worth casting his eyes to see what
   they were. "Does Jesus bid me go to Rome?" asks the Apostle. "Then I do
   not look to see whether I shall be housed in Nero's palace or caged in
   Nero's dungeon. It is for so short a while that if I can serve my
   Master better in the dungeon than I can in the palace, so let it be. My
   casual lot shall be my well-contented choice. It shall be a matter, if
   not of cool indifference, yet still of calm serenity, for it will soon
   be over and gone into history. A whole eternity lies beyond and,
   therefore, a short temporal delay dwindles into an insignificant
   trifle." What a blessed philosophy this is which teaches us to not even
   look at passing, transient troubles, but to fix our gaze on eternal
   triumphs!

   He meant more than that, however. He meant that he had learned not to
   regard the things of the present as if they were at all real. He did
   not look upon them as substantial or enduring. Like as clouds when they
   float overhead assume different shapes but change their form while we
   are gazing at them, so events, as they seemed to be transpiring, were
   to him no more than apparitions. When a man looks on a dissolving view,
   knowing that it is going to dissolve, he does not regard it as being
   other than an illusion. It is a shadow cast upon a sheet--there is
   nothing substantial in it. It may please his eyes, but he will say,
   "The subject upon the sheet is not the real thing. The view before me
   is not the scene, itself, and if I turn my eyes away from it, it will
   have melted away into nothingness in a little while. So for all its
   charms or its terrors I will not fret myself."

   You know how Paul explains his own words in another passage when he
   says, "Brethren, the time is short: it remains that both they that have
   wives be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though they
   wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they
   that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world,
   as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away." That is
   so with the earthly joy of the best of men! He should say to himself,
   "This is a dying joy. This will pass away. I look at it as a shadow."
   Is a child born into your house? Read across its brow the word,
   "Mortal," and when it dies you will not be disappointed or be so sad as
   if you dreamed that you were a parent of an immortal! Such a thought
   must be a dream, since your little one may be taken from you as well as
   the child of another.

   When you have riches, do you say to yourself, "This is a solid
   treasure. This is golden gain"? Ah, then it will be your god and if you
   lose it, the loss will eat like a canker into your spirit. But if you
   say, "These are fleeting things. They may take to themselves wings and
   fly away. I will not consider money to be treasure, but only look upon
   it as a shadow and hold it as such--as a thing not to be reckoned with
   substances--because it is seen and temporal." That is the way to do
   with every one of our joys. Do not look upon them as though they were
   substantial, for they are not. They are a part of this life-dream, this
   empty show--they are nothing more at their very best. Oh, how often do
   they prove to us, painfully, that they are unsubstantial!

   Look in the same way upon your circumstances. Say, "Well, I am in
   poverty, but this is not real poverty, because it is not lasting
   poverty. In a short time I shall be among the angels and walk the
   streets of gold and be as beautifully clad as any prince among them!
   Therefore will I not fret and worry, since my poverty will soon be
   over." Anything of loss or suffering that you are called upon to
   endure, always look upon it in the light of time and see what a
   fleeting thing it is. And bear it bravely like a man--no, like a
   Christian--because you have in Heaven a better and an enduring
   substance! These transient things are not worthy to be considered. Look
   upon them as if they were just nothing at all. So the Apostle did.

   Again, I find the word sometimes translated, "mark." "Brethren," says
   the Apostle, "mark them that are unruly." The word is the same as that
   which is here rendered, "look." Dear Friends, we are not to mark the
   things which are seen as if they were worth notice! You know that
   little children, if you give them a new toy, or a new frock, clap their
   hands and otherwise express their delight. That is because they are
   children. Be not children in knowledge, but as men--and as to the
   things of this life, look on them as toys. Do not act towards them as
   children do, but as men! "Oh," says the young man, "I have taken my
   degree at the university today." How he exults! What high importance he
   attaches to it! He wishes to get a newspaper to see if it is recorded
   there. It is to him an event as great as anything in history!

   We, perhaps, are rather amused at his excitement, for we do not
   consider anything of this sort much worthy of marking down. Another man
   finds that he has made some considerable gain and he, too, reckons it
   as a red letter day the day in which he seized these accessions to his
   fortune. If you are doing so, you are making sorrow for yourself, for
   as surely as joy becomes too sweet, sorrow will become too bitter. If I
   care nothing whatever for man's approbation, I reckon little of man's
   disapprobation--one gets to be brave in that way!

   It is not good to be much elated or much depressed by the joys and
   sorrows of life. If you are overjoyed, if you mark down certain matters
   as the very essence of happiness and begin to exult and revel in the
   things which are seen, then, mark you, when the untoward things come to
   you and blight your hopes, you will find that you have rendered
   yourself too sensitive and you will feel the smart far more keenly than
   you would have done if you had exercised wisdom enough to forbear
   reveling in the sweets.

   Look at the wasps and flies in summer. They will see placed for them,
   by your kindness, sweet liquid in which to catch them--sugar or honey
   is employed to hold their wings. The wise fly sips a little and away!
   The unwise insect enjoys the sweet and wades in farther and farther
   till he clogs his wings and he it is who will suffer when you come to
   destroy your prey! It is a blessed thing to be able to sip of this
   world and no more--for to plunge into it is death. Avoid the sweets of
   this world when they begin to tempt you. Say of them, as Solomon did of
   wine--"Look not upon it when it is red, when it gives its color in the
   cup, when it moves itself aright--for who has woe, who has sorrow, who
   has contention, who has babbling, who has wounds without cause, who has
   redness of eyes?"

   Surely the men who make this world to be their highest joy find, at the
   last, it bites like a serpent and stings as an adder. They indulge
   their passions to the destruction of their souls! Do not, therefore,
   mark carnal joy as to be desired. But are we never to have anything
   special to mark? Oh yes! Carefully mark down the eternal things. Did
   the Lord appear to you? Mark that down. Did you win a soul to Christ?
   Mark that down. Did you have sweet answers to prayer? Mark that down.
   Those are things of special note, as I am quite sure Paul thought.
   Though he would not say much about the discomforts of the dungeon of
   the Praetorian, he marked down its consolations. When Onesimus came to
   hear him, he made a note of it. It did not matter to him whether he was
   surrounded with stones or surrounded with applause! Whether he lodged
   in a palace or slept in a prison was to him no more than the incident
   of the hour--he made no account of such trivialities. He never marked
   those things down--the eternal was what he marked, not the transient.

   Another meaning is, take heed. You must put all the translations
   together to get the meaning. In the Gospel according to Luke this word
   is translated, "Take heed." The Apostle meant, no doubt, that he did
   not take heed of the things which were seen. He did not exercise care,
   thought and anxiety about them--his care, thought and anxiety were
   about the things which are not seen. "After all these things," says
   Christ, "do the Gentiles seek." So they do. They are always seeking
   after the world--from early morning till late at night it is the world
   they are after! Well, let the Gentiles follow their pursuits, but the
   child of God should not, for our Lord says unto us, "Take no thought
   for your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, or with what
   you shall be clothed."

   He bids us cast our care upon Him and cease from all anxiety! "Seek
   you," He says, "first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all
   these things shall be added unto you." So the Apostle Paul tells us not
   to care, not to worry or trouble ourselves about things which are seen,
   whether good or bad, prosperous or adverse--never suffering them to eat
   like a corrosive acid into our spirit. We are to spend all our heed
   upon our walk with God, our obedience to His commands, our fulfilling
   His will, our spreading His Kingdom, our getting ready for the coming
   of Christ, our being prepared for Judgment, our being prepared to dwell
   eternally with God at His right hand! About these we ought to take
   heed.

   This is our business, but, alas, our thoughts naturally drift the other
   way. These temporals are more apt to absorb us. There are some who not
   only apologize for themselves, but justify their worldly-mindedness.
   Fitly, therefore, does the Lord Jesus Christ, by the mouth of His
   Apostle, direct our thoughts away from groveling themes and bids us
   take heed of the eternal and let the secular sit lightly on our minds.
   Paul, in the Epistle to the Galatians, uses the word in the sense of
   considering, "considering yourself lest you, also, are tempted." We
   shall dive still more deeply into the meaning if we understand how, in
   certain conditions, the present, the transient, the things most
   palpable to the senses are properly left out of all consideration and
   not taken into the reckoning.

   For instance, if the Apostle knew that he should glorify God by
   preaching the Gospel, what would it matter to him if friend or foe
   should say to him, "Paul, you will risk your life by attempting to do
   so"? Live or die, he would be bold to preach! He never took their
   warnings into consideration. And if they had said, "If you state
   such-and-such a Truth of God, or administer such-and-such a reproof in
   a certain Church, you will be sure to lose their respect. You will lose
   face among them." Again, he would have smiled. It would have had no
   more influence upon him than it would have upon a merchant should you
   say to him, "If you go into such a district you will have to encounter
   clouds of dust." He would reply, "Why, if I can net a thousand pounds,
   what do I care about dust or no dust?"

   If it is my objective to ascend a mountain, am I to be deterred by a
   few cobwebs across my path? What are tiny obstacles to a strong man? So
   Paul did not consider the things which are seen to be worth a thought,
   though there are puny folk who value nothing else! The cost to him
   seemed so little that he would let it go into the scale or not, as men
   pleased. "I reckon that these light afflictions, which are but for a
   moment, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which shall be
   revealed in us." Are you not sometimes placed in this position? You
   know you ought to do right, but you fear that if you do, you will lose
   your situation.

   Well, now, if God's cause is uppermost in your estimation you will not
   consider your loss as the first matter. You will rather say, "I can
   lose anything sooner than lose peace of mind and miss pleasing God." Or
   there is some duty which you know you ought to perform and you are
   told, "Well, if you do that, you will lose your old uncle's love. He
   will strike you out of his will. You must think about it." What is the
   use of thinking about it? It is only an earthly, transient thing! What
   are these transient things, be they what they may, compared with the
   eternal weight of Glory? O Brothers and Sisters, if men lived in the
   light of eternity and judged their position accordingly, how
   differently would they act! But instead of so doing we begin weighing
   those trifles which we may have to endure for Christ's sake and making
   much of them.

   This is playing the traitor to Christ and forsaking Him when we ought
   to be most firm. Shame upon us if we thus treat our Lord! Eternal
   contempt awaits such cowards! From this time forth may we never look
   upon the things which are seen as substantial, but put them down as
   vanity and let the things which are not seen rise before us in all
   their supremacy of value! Perhaps you may get a still clearer
   perception of the meaning of the text if I tell you its full
   interpretation. By, "not looking at the things which are seen," we may
   understand not making them our scope. That is the nearest English word
   I can find to interpret the Greek. Let not these visible objects be the
   scope of your life, for, alas, there are many whose whole scope of life
   is that they may prosper in this world. The next world may go as it
   wills--their scope ends here. To win the esteem of God seems a trifle
   to them. That they may live at ease, enjoy the comforts and, if
   possible, the luxuries of this life, is their sole aim and object. As
   for the eternal things of Heaven they seem dim and unsubstantial.

   Now, it must not be so with us. We should say, "The things eternal I
   pursue. I am no more a citizen of this world, but a pilgrim bound for
   the Celestial City. When I passed through Vanity Fair, they asked me to
   buy this and that and I said, 'I buy the Truth.' I must go through the
   Enchanted Ground, but I will not sleep there, for that is not my rest.
   Whatever I

   see which is enchanting to others shall have no power over me, for the
   scope of my soul's desire and lifework is eternity." Would God we all
   had invisible joys for our objective! To sum up the whole, my dear
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, look not at the things which are seen.
   Do not look upon your comforts as if they were enduring. Do not dote
   upon them. Do not think of them as if you had them otherwise than on
   loan, or as if you had any right to them.

   Be thankful to God for them, but, because they will so soon pass away,
   do not set much store by them. Build not your nest on any of these
   trees, for they are all marked for the axe and before long they will
   all come down. Say not of any mortal man, or woman, or dear child, or
   worldly possession, or knowledge, or pursuit, or honor, "This is much
   to me." Let it be little to you. Put the gifts of God far down in the
   scale compared with Himself! Try, when you have your comforts, to find
   God in them and, when you lose your comforts, just change the words and
   try to find all in God, for, remember, "Man shall not live by bread
   alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall
   man live." You have not to live on the creature comforts--you are
   commanded to live on the living Word of the living God--and you will
   never be fully happy until you do this.

   A man who goes to a town and chooses a house that is dilapidated--the
   foundations gone and the beams decayed-- may say, "This is a very
   comfortable house," but you would not think so highly of its charms.
   "No," you would be ready to say, "I cannot be comfortable in it. The
   rich hangings and costly furniture do not hide the serious defects. It
   may come down at any time about the heads of the sleepers. This is not
   a house for me." You know this is the case in daily life and common
   experience. Well, it is just the same with regard to the things
   eternal. Say, therefore, to yourself, "I must repose my soul upon that
   which is true, real, well-founded and imperishable. Earthly things are
   too transient to afford me any solace or security. I dare not set my
   soul upon them. I cannot drink water out of these broken cisterns. I
   must go to the Fountain from where all satisfying, trustworthy supplies
   flow."

   You must do the same with regard to your sorrows. Although it looks
   rather hard, yet it is the wiser way to take them cheerfully rather
   than to exaggerate their weight by murmuring of them. If a man has
   Grace to live above his joys, that same Grace will enable him to live
   above his sorrows. As I said just now, when earthly joys enchant you
   too much, then, should earthly sorrows overtake you, they will make you
   sorely despondent. Your wisdom is to live above them both--above the
   glee of prosperity and the gloom of adversity. Dear Brother, what ails
   you? Have you lost a child? Lost? Why, you will be where that dear one
   is within so incredibly short a time that you need not worry and fret!
   Coming down from such a domestic grief as that, to a commercial
   anxiety--you have had a sad loss in the City, have you? Some of your
   comforts will be curtailed.

   But if you get nearer to the heart of your Lord and love Him better and
   walk in the light of His Countenance more than you did, you will never
   know you had a loss! You will be so much richer in the fine gold of His
   comfort that you will scarcely miss the silver of this poor world. And
   so, too, if you lose credit, or are discountenanced by old friends, or
   are deprived of anything which men are apt to make great account of
   here below--if you do but remember that it was only a bubble and it has
   burst--you will not be broken-hearted. Say, "It never was more than a
   bubble and I ought to have known that it would soon be gone. The
   comfort I had was never anything but a temporary loan and I ought to
   have remembered that it was borrowed." If you get into that mindset,
   you will live above the cares of this life! May God help you to do so.

   II. Now, for a few minutes let us address ourselves to the second
   point--LOOKING AT THE THINGS WHICH

   ARE NOT SEEN. How can we do that? Well, first, realize them by faith.
   We believe in the resurrection of the dead and in the judgment and in
   life everlasting according to the teaching of the Word of God. Try to
   look at these things to look at them as present facts. Some will never
   do so. They will tell you that they could not see them if they tried.
   But that is just what we, who have been taught of God to look at the
   things which are not seen, can palpably discern. Oh, to look beyond
   death to "the Home over there," beyond the swelling flood where souls
   that were loved of God from before the foundation of the world are safe
   with Jesus! I invite you to do so, especially if you have some dear
   ones there.

   Do you see them? Do you hear their music? Do you behold their joys? Are
   you going to be troubled about them any longer, after having realized
   their certain happiness? By-and-by there comes the Resurrection--the
   trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised. The very body over
   which you wept because it was to be given to the worms shall rise in
   matchless beauty in the likeness of its Lord! Will you not wipe your
   eyes dry, now, and submit to the Divine will, for surely the hope of
   the blessed Resurrection makes amends for the loss by death?

   Then there is to come the Judgment and you and I will be there. A
   soldier, some time ago, was in the valley of Jehoshaphat, where,
   according to tradition, the feet of the Messiah will rest on the Day of
   Judgment. He sat on a stone and said, "And shall we all be present? I
   will sit here in that day." And there, absorbed with the thought, he
   looked up to the sky and so distinctly did he realize the majestic
   vision of the Day of Judgment, that he fell to the ground in amazement,
   oblivious of everything that was transpiring around him! Ah, if all of
   us were living in the light of the Day of the Lord, what trifles these
   ebbs and flows--these ups and downs of passing circumstances would
   seem! How lightly we would bear sorrow and how little we would think of
   earthly fortunes and misfortunes if we could actually forecast the
   tremendous day when, with angels for witnesses, and Christ for our
   Judge, we shall have to stand and be judged according to the things
   done in the body!

   Realize Heaven, Brothers and Sisters--the Heaven of the perfected
   manhood after the Resurrection--the Heaven where we shall see the
   Beloved's face and day and night extol Him forever! Oh, what is it to
   be poor? What is it to be sick? What would it be to go through a
   thousand deaths if we may but at last behold His Glory, world without
   end? And think of Hell, you that forget God and revel in vanities! As
   your trembling spirit best may, think what it must be to be driven from
   His Presence--to hear Him say, "Depart, you cursed, into everlasting
   fire in Hell." Ah, gilded world, how you lose your luster when once I
   see the lurid glare of Tophet! O painted harlot, how I see your haggard
   ugliness when I hear the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth of
   those who chose the broad road and let the Lord, the Savior go! How I
   despise you!

   As the vision opens before the eyes of faith, what zeal it kindles in
   my breast! Would to God I could induce some careless person here who,
   nevertheless, does believe the Scriptures, to sit down, if it were but
   for a half-hour and try, believingly, to picture these things to his
   mind's eye! This sacred volume is full of pictures--pictures of things
   that shall shortly come to pass. Oh that you had the discernment to see
   them! Not as weird fancies, but as veritable facts! The true sayings of
   God! The real thing is what you do not see to be real! The fiction is
   that which you account a solid fact! We are going down, each one of us,
   to the grave, but God lives forever and ever! As for that body of yours
   in which you are sitting in this house--it is not a substance which
   shall abide--it is a shadow which shall dissolve, dissolving into dust
   and exhaling into water.

   Yet there lives within you what you cannot see--the real and true
   self--and that true self of yours will pass into another state! And
   through it into yet another which shall be everlasting! And, oh, may
   God grant that your lot may not be everlasting sorrow, but endless joy!
   In either case the things which are not seen are eternal. Gird up your
   loins and look at them like a man who will have, before long, to dispel
   the illusions of sense and confront the verities of eternity, whether
   he wants to or not! The Christian learns to look on these things with
   the eye of delight. Is it not to you, my dear Brothers and Sisters in
   Christ, a delight to see God? I should not like to go to any place
   where I could not see my God. Yet He is not seen!

   Is it not a wonderful thing to look forward to the Heaven that is
   above--to the City of the blessed? When the Lord indulges our faith
   with a view of that eternal joy--and some of us have known what it
   is--it has been too much for our weak capacity. We can laugh in our
   sleep when we dream of Heaven! And we can sit down in the midst of pain
   and sorrow and feel as if we could not feel more joy than we possess
   because our souls have looked on the pinnacles of our Father's palace
   and seen the gleaming radiance of the 12 bejeweled foundations of the
   Eternal City where there is a house and a crown and a harp for every
   Believer among us! The poor girl who goes home from this joyous place
   of worship to her own little cheerless room would feel miserable,
   indeed, if she looked at the shady side of her condition. But she says,
   "My Lord is in this room," and the place glows as if it were made of
   slabs of gold!

   She settles down and begins to think of the Heaven that is hers and she
   sees herself to be a King's daughter, a true Princess, for she
   possesses in Glory a crown that no head can wear but hers, and there is
   a mansion provided for her which none can live in but herself! Happy,
   therefore, she well may be! O beloved Friends, learn to look at these
   things with intense delight, because they are ours in belief, now, and
   are soon to be ours in possession! On the other hand, if you are not
   converted, I would urge you to look upon the eternal future--for it is
   all eternal--with an intense dread, for without Christ what is there
   for you among the things which are not seen and are eternal, but that
   which will make you wring your hands for poignant grief and gnash your
   teeth for bitter self-reproach if you are resolved to live and to die
   as you now are?

   You see not yet the future state of woe, but like all the unseen
   things, it is eternal. There can be no termination to the misery of an
   immortal soul when once banished from God. I see no "larger hope"
   revealed in Scripture. Let my philosophical Brothers conjecture what
   they will, where God speaks not, I am silent. But I do see the dread
   forebodings of a death that never dies and a fire that is never
   quenched! I would have every man who will not have Christ, or who
   dilly-dallies with salvation and runs risks with his soul, to look at
   what he risks! Face your future, O you who choose your own destruction!
   That was a solemn morning's work for Abraham when he went to the place
   where he was known to meet with God. As he looked toward Sodom he saw
   the smoke of it going up as the smoke of a furnace. O Christians, you
   do well, sometimes, to look that way! Such a contemplation is not
   pleasant to flesh and blood. No, but it will do you good and make you
   feel fervent emotions of gratitude for your own redemption and intense
   desires for the salvation of others.

   But come here, Sinner! Come here! I must have you here! Look, do you
   see it? Do you see it--the smoke of the flame which burns forever and
   ever? That flame is for your burning if you repent not! Do you see it
   as it reddens the heavens? That fire burns for you if you believe not
   in the Lord Jesus Christ! Will you not look? If you will not, you will
   have to feel it! You can not mitigate those woes by refusing to believe
   in their existence. It is the silly trick of the ostrich, so they say,
   when the hunter pursues it, to burrow its head in the sand and fancy
   itself safe--and this is what you are doing with more than equal folly!
   I would gladly bring you back to reason. Look at the things which are
   not seen, for they are eternal!

   I met with a remark the other day which struck me forcibly--If a man
   had no worse pain than a toothache, if he knew that it would last
   forever, he would desire to die that he might escape from it. When we
   have to endure any acute pain for a little while, we begin to cry out
   for relief and find it hard to be quiet. But were any pang to last
   eternally, the horror of such an expectation would even, now, be
   overwhelming! By the dread thought of eternity I implore you see to it
   that your salvation is secured at once! Escape for your life, my
   Friends, and look not behind you, for unless you escape in time, your
   fate will be sealed forever and ever! Those things which are not seen
   are eternal and Hell is one of them! Unless you escape, now, by faith
   in Jesus Christ, you will never escape!

   There is no reprieve nor respite in the world to come--pardon,
   therefore, should be sought at once. By looking into the things which
   are not seen, Paul doubtless meant that he looked to them with hope. To
   his view, the harvest was ripe and he was eager to reap it. I invite
   all Believers to be looking with ardent hope for the things that are
   eternal. Long for the bright appearing of the Lord! Long for your
   translation into the city of Glory! Expect it! Watch for it! It is on
   the way. You may be much nearer than you think. You may be in Heaven
   before next year--indeed, you may be there before tomorrow morning!

   Light is fading from the earth. Dear Friend, look towards Heaven. Look
   towards eternal things! Make it a point to look unto your future home.
   Should there be any young man here who is not 21 and he knows that when
   he comes of age he is to be squire of a village, own a park and enjoy a
   rich heritage--I will be bound to say he has often forestalled the time
   because he is sure of his title. If any one of you had a legacy left
   him of a large estate, he would be off this week to have a look at it.
   One likes to look at one's own--Christian, be sure to survey your own
   possession in the skies! Read much the Book of God which tells you of
   your future inheritance. Say to yourself, "This is all mine. Why should
   I not begin to enjoy it? Did not the Israelites fetch bunches of the
   grapes of Eshcol before they entered Canaan? And why should not I?" I
   hope you will full often enjoy foretastes of bliss till you can sing
   with John Berridge--

   "Too long, alas, I vainly sought

   For happiness below!

   But earthly comforts, dearly bought,

   No solid good bestow.

   At length, through Jesus' Grace, I found

   The good and promised land

   Where milk and honey much abound

   And grapes in clusters stand.

   My soul has tasted of the grapes,

   And now it longs to go

   Where my dear Lord His vineyard keeps,

   And all the clusters grow. Upon the true and living Vine My famished
   soul would feast, And banquet on the fruit Divine, An everlasting
   guest."

   What a sanctifying influence such anticipations would have upon you!
   "Everyone that has this hope in him purifies himself." Pursue eternal
   things with concentrated mind. You must look right on to the end of the
   race for the prize. The runner does not cast a glance to the right or
   to the left, or to the flowers which adorn the pathway, but he keeps
   his eyes on the prize and that helps him run. He stretches every nerve
   to reach the end and win the prize! Brothers and Sisters, make eternal
   things the scope of your life at all times! This I have told you is the
   literal sense of the original Greek. Make them that for which you plot
   and plan--that for which you think and consider--that for which you
   live and act! Throw your whole being into eternal things!

   "Are we, therefore, to neglect business?" you may ask. God forbid!
   Serve God in business! To leave business, or to do business as if it
   were not a part of your religion would be a departure from your
   Master's will and not a fulfillment of it! Sanctify your most common
   actions to the glory of God. "Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you
   do, do all to the glory of God." Have an eye always to eternity! Keep
   your thoughts upon that. Eat and drink as for eternity, remembering
   that what you eat and drink perishes and he that eats will perish, too.
   It is "earth to earth" whenever we eat--therefore let us not make gods
   of our bellies. When you enjoy any earthly thing, do it as in the light
   of eternity and say, "I am plucking a flower that must fade. This is
   not a diamond that will remain with me, always glistening. It is only a
   bright daisy. It looks very pretty at the moment, but it will soon
   fade. The children gather it, but soon let it fall and so

   do I!

   At your peril, put not your soul into that which is sensual. See that
   you pursue, with all your might, things spiritual! As for things
   transient, commit them to God's Providence. Do your best to honor God
   in the use of this world's currency, but make it not your wealth. Look
   at Jonah sitting under his gourd which screened him from the scorching
   sun with its broad leaves. Think of Jonah as he said to himself, "How
   happy I am under this arbor. How cool it makes me." He was content and
   comfortable, but God prepared a worm! The worm destroyed the wretched
   gourd! Though it seemed so beautiful before, it soon became only fit to
   be pulled down and cast upon the dunghill. It may soon be the same with
   your earthly comforts. If you make your gourd your god, it will do you
   no good. Gourds are well enough, but they are not good when you put
   them in the place of eternal comforts.

   I finish with this. Treat the things present as if they were not and
   live like an heir of Heaven's invisible but substantial joys. Higher
   and better things are in store for you! God bless you by His blessed
   Spirit with blessed foretastes of the blessed hereafter. Amen.

A Sunday School Sermon

   (No. 1381)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, OCTOBER 28, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He shall gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom."
   Isaiah 40:11.

   MINISTERS all over England have been specially requested to assist in
   exciting a spirit of prayer in connection with Sunday schools, today,
   and I feel that the training of the young is so important a part of
   Church work that it would be almost sinful to decline the seasonable
   request of the Sunday school Union. Therefore have I selected this
   subject this morning in the hope that God the Holy Spirit may bless it,
   not only to those who are teachers, but to those who ought to be, and
   afterwards to those of us who may be otherwise occupied in the Master's
   vineyard, that we, also, may be led more earnestly to pray for our
   Brothers and Sisters who are watching over the lambs of the flock.

   The words of our text are spoken of One who is, in the 10th verse,
   called, "The Lord God with a strong hand," and of whom we are asked, in
   verse 12, "Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and
   meted out Heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth
   in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
   balance?" It is a wonderful proof of the tenderness of God that very
   generally, when He is spoken of by His glorious titles and is described
   in the infinity of His power, we are, before long, assured of His great
   gentleness by having some special deed of kindness ascribed to Him.

   He is the Lord God with a strong hand and a ruling arm, but He carries
   the lambs in His bosom. He brings out the starry hosts by number. He
   calls them all by names in the greatness of His might and yet He "does
   gently lead those that are with young." How condescending it is on the
   part of the great Lord that He should come to shepherd men! How
   marvelous that it should be said of the Almighty God, "He shall feed
   His flock like a shepherd"--shall act the Shepherd towards His chosen
   among the sons of men--guiding, feeding, protecting, nourishing and
   healing them. It is Jehovah Jesus, who, though He accounted it not
   robbery to be equal with God, yet came down to earth that He might be
   the Shepherd of men!

   A shepherd bears among his flock, in wonderful conjunction, the offices
   of ruler and of servant. He rules and guides and controls his flock,
   but at the same time he waits upon them as the servant of all. Behold,
   in the Lord Jesus you see One who was justly recognized by His
   disciples as their Master and Lord and yet, as the servant of servants,
   He washed the feet of His disciples! He came as God to be a Prince and
   a Savior, but He made Himself of no reputation and took upon Himself
   the form of a Servant. He bowed Himself to save His people, to help
   their infirmities, to sympathize with their sorrows and even to suffer
   for their sins. Behold what manner of love the Great Shepherd of the
   sheep has manifested towards us!

   It is notable that to accomplish this work the Lord is represented as
   coming with strength. "Behold the Lord God will come with a strong hand
   and His arm shall rule for Him." From which I gather that the work of
   saving men is one which requires the putting forth of strength, even
   when He who undertakes it is Divine. He is mighty to save, for it
   requires might to save a soul! If you and I, under God, are called to
   attempt the work of saving souls, we must certainly borrow Divine
   strength if we are to succeed, for what power to save can dwell in an
   arm offlesh? Nor must we ever treat the work of caring for the souls of
   men with indifference, nor go about it with carelessness.

   It is not a secondary work to be pursued at leisure as a species of
   amusement. It filled the Savior's heart and hands, so that the zeal of
   it ate Him up--and unless you have the same power resting upon you
   which, also, dwelt in Him, and something of the same fervor, you will
   never be able to perform it rightly. O servant of the living God, see
   that your loins are girt with Omnipotence for such a task as this, for
   to save the soul of the smallest child in the Sunday school will need
   the same power that raised Christ from the dead!

   The Lord would, also, have you feel that soul-winning can only be done
   in earnest--it requires energy and fervency. We must exercise every
   faculty, use all our intellect, awaken all our affection and continue
   laboring with unbounded perseverance if, by any means, we may save
   some. When I behold the Lord coming forth to save, even the Lord who
   made the heavens and the earth, I know what a work it must be! And when
   I see Him coming with a strong hand, making His arm to rule for Him, I
   comprehend that it is not child's play to be a soul-winner! If God
   Himself puts on strength, then you and I must ask for power beyond our
   own that we may be useful in this heavenly service.

   Beautifully does our text set forth not only the great power exerted by
   our Lord Jesus, but, also His tender love, for not only does He come
   forth to care for men as His sheep, but He undertakes work among the
   lambs, among the feeblest, the smallest, the youngest. No part of His
   work is beneath Him! He does all the work of a good shepherd! It is
   supposed by some that it needs greater genius and ability to care for
   the sheep than for the lambs. I have even known preachers speak of
   bringing their minds down to the comprehension of children! They know
   little of the matter, for to preach a child's sermon or write a really
   good child's book is a very difficult task and requires the highest
   ability.

   Jesus evidently thinks not lightly of the little ones, nor of the
   service which they require. His shoulders may suffice for lost sheep,
   but His bosom is reserved for the lambs--they need and shall have our
   Lord's best! With Divine sweetness and tenderness the Redeemer carries
   the lambs in His fond embrace and lends both His heart and His arm to
   cherish and protect them. We have before us in the text a lovely
   outline portrait of the Good Shepherd. Let us look at the picture and
   notice its main beauties. And when we have sufficiently done so, let us
   see therein an example for the Church and a model for the teacher of
   the young.

   I. We have to examine A PORTRAIT OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD. Let as study it
   with care. "He shall gather the

   lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom." What do I see in this
   picture? First, I see the Lord of angels condescending to personal
   labor. Jesus Christ, Himself, gathers with His own arm and carries in
   His own bosom the lambs of His flock! He does not commit this work to
   an angel, nor does He even leave it to His ministers, but He, Himself,
   by His Spirit, undertakes it. He cared for the lambs while He was here
   below. He suffered the little children to come to Him and He took them
   in His arms and blessed them.

   He spoke very plainly, so that the young could understand His words,
   for He cared for their souls. We have frequent indications that He was
   often followed by a great company of young people and we know that they
   were ready to give Him their hosannas with eager enthusiasm. After He
   had risen from the dead He did not forget the young of the flock, for
   He said to Peter, "Feed My lambs." He was the holy Child, Jesus,
   Himself, all His days and He was a dear lover of the little ones, the
   true "children's Friend." The Spirit of the Lord was upon Him, for the
   Lord had anointed Him to preach glad tidings to the meek and the poor,
   who are as lambs in the flock. He condescended to look after the feeble
   and weak of the flock, Himself, toiling many a weary mile and pleading
   through many a chilly night on their behalf.

   Now, though He reigns in Heaven, His Divine Spirit looks after the
   young converts and causes them to grow up in His fear. Many are the
   Timothies taught from their youth to know the Scriptures whom His Grace
   meets with and saves. And when they are saved, being still His lambs,
   He watches over them, trains them, instructs them, confirms their
   faith, guides them in His way and preserves them to the end. All our
   mercies, as Believers, we owe to our Lord's personal service, "who His
   own self bore our sins in His own body on the tree." Not by proxy did
   He save either His sheep or His lambs!

   He did not stand and bid others do it and merely give the command, but
   He, Himself, spent 30 years here below in personal service among the
   sons of men! At this moment He is personally pleading for His own and
   personally ruling Providence on behalf of His little ones. He still
   gathers and He still carries. And if, dear Brothers and Sisters, we are
   to be at all like Jesus, we must not merely write tracts about how
   Sunday school work is to be done, nor stand in eminence like a
   commander-in-chief and give orders, but we must each one, personally,
   bend our back and stoop to the lambs! We must put out the strength of
   our own arms to gather them and then carry the blessed load of
   infirmity in our own bosom. We must render personal service if we are
   to be like our Lord who gave Himself for us. This first line in the
   portrait is well drawn and adds much to its manly beauty--He
   condescended to personal labor.

   The second noteworthy line in the portrait seems to me to be that Jesus
   was earnest to save and earnest to save little ones. The text does not
   merely say that He carries the lambs in His bosom, but that He gathers
   them. It were great love that He should carry those who come--it is
   greater love that He gathers those who do not come. Constraining Grace

   goes out into the midst of the world to fetch in the wandering sheep
   and lambs--and therein the greatest love is revealed--even the love
   which puts forth its strength while yet we go astray!

   The Good Shepherd sees that even children's hearts are far off from Him
   and will remain so unless His effectual Grace shall go forth to reclaim
   them from the error of their natural estate. And, glory be to His love,
   He still does fetch this one and that one, in early days, to
   Himself--not waiting till they come, but going after them, even as the
   parable of the good shepherd sets forth--for there the shepherd leaves
   the 99 in the wilderness and goes after that which is gone astray until
   he finds it. Brothers and Sisters, if we are to be like Christ--and I
   hold the picture up that we may endeavor to copy it-- we must not only
   rejoice when children are saved and encourage them when we see signs of
   Grace, but we must go after the little tenants of the street, the
   little disorderly members of our class, the young rebels of our family
   and "compel them to come in."

   It must be the aim of our teaching that children, as children, should
   become children of the living God! For this we should pray! For this we
   should seek to be anointed of the Holy Spirit that we may bring in
   these lambs from the dark mountains to the green pastures! Whereas they
   are wayward, inattentive, difficult to rule, forgetful and inept in
   spiritual things, we must, with great patience, gather them, win their
   hearts, impress their minds and introduce them, by Divine Grace, into
   the fold of love! Look at the picture before you and you can see that
   your Lord is earnest to save. His face, His hands, His feet, His side
   all prove what an eager Savior He is! He does not tarry at home till
   wanderers, of their own free will, seek His face, but He goes forth to
   seek the lambs which lie about neglected in these great wilderness
   cities! He finds them in the fields of ignorance and under the hedges
   of vice, pining and perishing for lack of knowledge--and He gathers
   them with His arm.

   Thirdly, a very superficial glance will show us that our Lord is
   willing to receive. If He is so eager to gather those who do not come,
   depend upon it, He is willing to receive all who do seek Him. There is
   never a heart that yearns after Christ, though it is the heart of a
   little child, but Jesus Christ delights to note those early desires.
   There is little knowledge, as yet, in the child's heart about the
   Lord--and little knowledge, as yet, of the evil of sin--but Jesus does
   not expect much from tender youth. Only a feeble ray of light has
   gleamed into the soul. Only a gentle breath of the Divine wind has
   turned the little soul towards Christ--but our Lord perceives it and
   delights in it. It were well if we could copy this trait in our Lord's
   Character.

   I am afraid we are not very quick to notice the first impressions of
   boys and girls, or else we harshly judge that such impressions are
   written in water and, having been frequently disappointed, we have
   grown incredulous of children's convictions and children's faith. But
   it should not be so, for if our Lord gathers the lambs, it is clear
   that He is willing enough to receive those lambs when they come. And if
   you are to be like your Master, I would exhort each of you to receive
   with gladness even the least among your scholars when they come to tell
   you of their newborn faith in Christ. Do not quench the sparks, but fan
   them to a flame! Never crush the bruised reeds, nor throw them away as
   useless, for with a little care they may be so bound up that your Lord
   may get music out of them to His eternal praise!

   Despise not the day of small things! Look not for ripe Graces and
   mature judgment in the early spring of youth, but rejoice in the buds
   and blossoms. Receive the lambs as lambs, though they are the weakest
   and most troublesome of the flock. See what your Lord does. The loving
   tenderness of Christ and His willingness to receive those who seek Him
   early should make our hearts willing to believe in childish piety,
   quick to perceive it and ready to rejoice in it! Wisely may we receive
   those whom Jesus receives! If they are capable of coming to Him and
   lying in His bosom, they will do no dishonor to the bosom of the
   Church.

   In this portrait I see a fourth beautiful feature, namely, that He is
   careful to protect the feeble lambs. Gathering graciously and receiving
   kindly, He next guards securely. To this end the Shepherd places the
   sickly lamb in His flowing garment, close to His bosom, and carries it
   there. He will not let it try to walk, for it is as yet too weak. He
   will not even put it in the fold and leave it with the old sheep, but
   He must, Himself, while it is in a critical state, carry it where it
   shall be at ease and secure from trial or toil. Here in His bosom it
   will not be pinched by the frost--His heart will keep it warm. Here it
   will not die of weakness--His own life will flow into it and fill its
   little struggling heart with vitality. Here the wolf cannot touch it,
   for unless the wolf could rend the Shepherd, it certainly could not
   destroy the beloved burden which He carried on His heart.

   How carefully does Christ watch over the lambs! He is lovingly watchful
   over the entire flock, for not one under His care shall perish--but
   towards these young ones His tenderness is more manifest, for they need
   it more. It is with Him even as with a mother who is more anxious
   concerning her little babe or her sick child than concerning the strong
   of the family. Where the need is greatest, the love is most fervent.
   Christ carries the lambs in His bosom because the greatest need
   requires the most luxurious resting place and the most calm repose.

   Beloved Friends, we must be very careful to protect young Christians if
   we would see them become strong in Christ. We should anxiously endeavor
   to keep them out of temptation. And since they must be tempted, more or
   less, we should endeavor to strengthen them to endure the various forms
   in which it assails the young. Let us lead them away from habits which
   debase and amusements which degrade. Let us try to keep from them many
   of those sinful doubts which have perplexed ourselves and those
   heresies which have been a snare to others. Above all, let us, by a
   pious example, endeavor to preserve them from the corruption that is in
   the world through lust, carrying them in our bosoms to the Throne of
   Grace, to the House of God and to everything which is pure, holy and
   acceptable to God!

   As Mr. Greatheart is described by Bunyan as convoying the women and
   children to the Celestial City and fighting the giants for them, even
   so should we. We must, in the name of the Lord, watch for their souls
   as those that must give account, keeping guard from week to week lest
   our hope should be disappointed. Thus shall we be like the Good
   Shepherd who is ever careful to protect His own--

   "Shepherd of the chosen number, They are safe whom You keep. Other
   shepherds faint and slumber, And forget to watch the sheep. Watchful
   Shepherd! You do wake while others sleep.'

   But our Lord's act means more than that, for He might have put the
   lambs on His shoulders if mere safety were all that He designed. We see
   by the picture before us that He is tender to cherish the little ones.
   It is said that He carries them-- this is mercy! But this is not all,
   for He carries them in His bosom--this is tender mercy! To carry is
   kindness, but to carry in the bosom is loving kindness!

   The shoulders are for power and the back for force, but the bosom is
   the seat of love! Jesus would warm, cheer, comfort and make them happy.
   The Lord wishes all His people to be happy--"Comfort you, comfort you
   My people, says your God." It is a worthy object to try and make any
   Christian happy, but especially a young Believer whose weakness needs
   great gentleness. To clothe religion with gloom is to slander the name
   of Christ! We should always be most eager to prevent young Believers
   from imagining that to follow Christ is to walk in darkness, for,
   indeed, it is not so. Has He not, Himself, said, "He that follows Me
   shall not walk in darkness"? Did not the wise man say concerning
   Wisdom, "Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
   peace"? The Good Shepherd looks to the comfort, peace and enjoyment of
   His lambs--and He carries them where they will be most happy.

   If you are to be like your Master, you will try to take away from young
   Believers' hearts all temptation to despondency. You will set before
   them the richness and freeness of the Gospel, the "exceedingly great
   and precious promises," the oath and Covenant and the stability of the
   engagements of God. Yes, you will try to let them see the preciousness
   of Christ and tell them how exceedingly faithful and true you have
   found Him to be in your own experience. All this will help them to ride
   at ease on the breast of Jesus' love if the Holy Spirit graciously
   assists your endeavors. Do not sow mistrust in their hopeful nature,
   nor instruct them to be as unbelieving as their fathers. Do not sternly
   judge and condemn them. Cruelty to children is the worst of
   cruelty--unkind and harsh judgments upon inexperienced Believers are
   barbarous and unworthy of the Christian name! Endeavor to comfort and
   not to distress, to cheer and not to censure, to gladden and not to
   discourage the babes in Grace, for they are dear to the heart of
   Christ!

   Once more, dear Friends, you see in the text that Christ, the Good
   Shepherd, is loving in His estimate of the lambs. Men carry in their
   bosoms their gems, their jewels--and so does Christ carry the lambs of
   the flock, regarding them as His peculiar treasure! He knows that in
   themselves they are worth nothing, but then He puts an estimate upon
   them according to His own relationship to them. He prizes them because
   His Father gave them to Him of old to be His portion. The little child
   that believes in Christ was given to Christ before the foundations of
   the world and, therefore, He

   looks upon it as a choice treasure and it is exceedingly dear in His
   eyes. "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me," He says.

   He knows, too, what the child cost Him, for to redeem a little child
   from going down into the Pit, He must bear the penalty due to Justice
   and suffer even unto death. He sees the purchase of His agonies in
   every youthful Believer. For him the precious blood flowed from the
   Redeemer's own heart and bought the child to be His own redeemed
   forever. He remembers, moreover, what that child will come to if He
   does not save it by carrying it in His bosom. It has sinned. It has
   knowingly and willfully sinned and, therefore, it lies under the curse
   of the Law and Jesus mourns to see a soul in that condition, obnoxious
   to the wrath of God. A soul is a precious thing to Christ, for He
   believes in its immortality. We know He does, for He speaks of a place,
   "where their worm dies not and their fire is not quenched," and He told
   us that the wicked will be driven away into "everlasting punishment."

   He values souls at a rate unknown to those who dream that men are mere
   animals and will one day cease to exist. If they are to pass away and
   be no more, like things of the dust and of the mist, why should He die
   for them at all? Why should He care to gather them? But because no
   diamond can ever equal in value the soul, even of a beggar's child,
   therefore does Christ carry His little ones in His bosom as exceedingly
   precious to Him. And He knows, too, what may come of that child if He
   saves it--for the possibilities of the blessing within one little saved
   child--who shall estimate but the Lord who knows all things? I read the
   other day a pleasing anecdote of what one lamb may come to. A ewe
   brought forth three lambs and the brutal shepherd threw the third into
   the hedge, that there might be the more milk for the other two.

   A poor woman passing by begged for the thrown away lamb, employed her
   utmost care in nursing it by means of a sucking bottle and reared it
   till it could eat grass for itself. She turned it upon the common and
   in due course it produced her twins. By much care she, at length,
   raised a whole flock of sheep from the single ewe, and in process of
   time she became a woman of considerable estate. See what one poor
   half-dead lamb may yet produce? Who knows what one poor trembling soul
   may yet bring forth? Jesus knows that a boy may be here who will be the
   spiritual father of scores and hundreds of thousands before he dies!
   There may be in the congregation of today a Chrysostom or an Augustine!

   Among us may sit a little Whitefield, or a young Luther, or some other
   honorable character who shall lead many to Christ! There was a dreadful
   snowstorm one Sunday morning when Dr. Tyng, of New York, set out to
   preach. When He reached the Church there was only one poor little girl
   there. Most preachers would have gone home when one child made up the
   whole of the congregation, but Dr. Tyng went through the service as
   earnestly as if the pews had been crowded. He preached to the little
   girl and God gave him that girl's soul--and never was he better repaid!
   To his knowledge she has been the means of bringing some 25 to the Lord
   Jesus--and among them was one of his own sons!

   The greatest orator, the most spiritual teacher, the most useful
   evangelist may not dare to despise one of Christ's little ones! It were
   worthwhile for all the ministers in England to journey round the world
   to save the soul of a single shoeblack or of one girl in the workhouse!
   Value the little ones by their possibilities and you will reckon one
   lamb to be an untold treasure, worthy to be preserved in the jewel case
   of your loving care! Luther's schoolmaster always used to take off his
   hat to his boys when he entered the schoolroom, because, he said, he
   did not know what they might become. Had he known that Martin Luther
   had been there, he could not have done better than he did! Jesus Christ
   knows what He can make of little children in Heaven and so He carries
   them in His bosom because they shall be forever near the Father's
   Throne to behold His face. He has learned to estimate them at their
   eternal value--a value which His Grace has put upon them and which He
   never forgets.

   Now, if there were time to take my text and handle it in another shape
   I should divide my subject thus--first, here are two evils about young
   Believers and young children--wandering and weakness. They are far away
   from God by nature and when they are brought near, they are very weak
   as to Divine things. Secondly, there are two attributes in the Lord
   Jesus to meet with and overcome the two evils. Here is strength to
   gather the wandering with His arm and here is love to cherish weakness
   till it forgets itself and becomes strong. Thirdly, here are two
   operations performed by the two attributes to meet the two
   infirmities--here is gathering and here is carrying.

   It is very delightful to note how our blessed Lord, whose marred face I
   seem to see at this very moment, does the gathering and the carrying
   with equal ease. Even now, by faith, I see His pierced feet pursuing
   the truant lambs, His wounded hands laying hold upon them and His bosom
   so full of the most Divine Love receiving and bearing them. Do

   you not hear His sweet voice saying," Suffer the little children to
   come to Me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven"?
   He is still gathering and still carrying by His Word and Spirit! And so
   will He do until He shall come. God help us in this to imitate Him to
   the end.

   II. Let us now remember in our text we have AN EXAMPLE FOR THE CHURCH.
   There are two great things which a Church ought always to have, namely,
   an arm to gather with and a bosom to carry in. I need to speak to you
   members of the Church, now, not merely about the Sunday school, but
   concerning every other part of our soul-seeking and soul-saving work. I
   want you all to try, in the name of God and in the energy of the Holy
   Spirit, to be the arm to gather with. "He gathers the lambs with His
   arm." They are scattered now, the blood-bought--the ordained of God
   unto eternal life--are scattered here and there and know not the Lord.

   We are bound to gather them from all places into which they have
   wandered. They will not come of themselves. The mass of them despise,
   even, the outward means of Grace. We need a strong arm to gather with
   so that they may be compelled to come in. The Church's arm is partly
   the ministry of the Word in her midst. Preaching should be attractive
   enough to gather the people together, for how shall they believe on Him
   of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear if they will not
   gather around the preacher? Though certain wise persons pretend to
   despise the power to gather the multitudes to hear the Word, you and I
   need not mind their decrying it since we shrewdly suspect that their
   depreciation of the gift is caused by their not possessing it
   themselves--the grapes are always sour if they hang above our reach.

   But we know who has told us that faith comes by hearing and hearing by
   the Word of God. If it is the Gospel that is preached, we should
   rejoice that by any means the people can be gathered to hear it--and it
   is plain as a pikestaff that a part of the preacher's aim should be to
   preach so that men may be gathered to the hearing of it, for if he
   preaches and none gather to hear, to what end does he preach? He might
   as well get away to the woods or to the wilderness and repeat the
   Gospel to himself in solitude if he has no desire that men should
   listen to him. The preacher's voice is to gather, but amid such teeming
   multitudes as those of London, so few preachers can never be expected
   to be the arm of the Lord to gather alone!

   We must gather the young by Sunday schools and endeavor to retain them
   when they grow up! We must gather them by the distribution and sale of
   good books and other pure literature! The bookseller has, in this
   respect, his work to do to gather in the villages and hamlets. We must
   gather them by visiting from house to house--you tract distributors,
   you city missionaries, you Bible women--you must be the arm of the
   Church to gather many! But still, the work will not be done unless we
   have more help than these. Every Christian must be a gatherer! Each one
   must gather his one! In the power of the Holy Spirit we must all seek
   out the wanderers. If you cannot bring sheaves, you must glean ear by
   ear! If you cannot preach to hundreds, you must endeavor to gather
   individuals by your holy conversation, by your pious lives, by the
   orderly ruling of your family and by using every occasion that God
   gives you to speak a good word for Christ.

   Gather! I give you this word, all you dear members of the Church, as
   your watchword! Gather! Gather! Gather the people together! Bring them
   in where Jesus is uplifted and His Gospel sounded forth! Try and find
   them in the lonely places where they are scattered in the cloudy and
   dark day. There are many of you and you can go into all sorts and nooks
   and corners, for you dwell in all sorts of places. Let no spot be
   unvisited in your mission of love! Go, you rich, and gather in from the
   parlor and from the drawing room! Go, you poor, and gather in from the
   cottages and even from the workhouse! Go, you who labor, and gather
   among the sons of toil! Go, you that toil not, neither do you spin, and
   spend your ample leisure in winning souls from among those with whom
   you associate! So shall the blood-redeemed ones be fetched out and
   formed into a goodly flock and Christ, by you, shall gather both lambs
   and sheep with His arm!

   But the Church's second work is to carry in her bosom. Those who are
   brought to Christ need nurture, instruction, example, edification.
   "Feed My sheep," He says, and yet again, "Feed My lambs." The preacher
   should try to do this, suiting his discourse to the weakest and
   feeblest lamb. But since he is but one and takes not upon himself the
   responsibility of others, the whole Church should try to be a nursing
   mother unto those who are born unto her. Beloved, carry the young
   converts! Take the convicted of sin and pity them, cheer them, fight
   against their despondencies, battle with their doubts, enlighten their
   ignorance and so bear them in your bosom.

   And then, when they begin to grow strong and work for Christ, encourage
   them, carry them in the bosom of your earnest prayers, asking God to
   make them workmen not to be ashamed of doing the Master's work right
   wisely and well.

   When they succeed in their service, carry them in the bosom of your
   loving admiration. And when you see them grow in Grace till they are
   strong, carry them in the bosom of your fellowship, remembering that no
   child of God can afford to be unloved and lonely. Those who do not need
   your help will need your love! Those who do not require encouragement
   will, nevertheless, be glad of your sympathy. Carry all your Brothers
   and Sisters in your bosom! You will be Christ-like if you do so. It is
   the Church's work, in this, to imitate her great Lord and let the
   Beloved of Christ be carried in her bosom of affection.

   May your arm always have strength to labor and your heart love with
   which to cherish! May this Church never lack for arms that shall
   encompass the neighboring population and never lack for a heart that
   shall be warm towards those who love our Lord Jesus Christ! Hand and
   heart must go together--by these two our work must be fully done. May
   they be both evermore in full activity, even as they are seen in
   Christ, our blessed Exemplar.

   III. We shall close with a practical word or two upon THE MODEL
   TEACHER. He who gathers the lambs with His arm and carries them in His
   bosom is the Model for a Sunday school teacher. In what points? First
   there should be about the teacher attractiveness in order that he may
   gather. You cannot gather hearts and spirits by force. The Board School
   may gather its children by law, but you must gather yours by love. You
   cannot keep a class of children around you by the fear of punishment.
   It must be by some attraction which will hold them with the cords of
   love and the bands of a man. Our Lord Jesus gathers with His arm
   because He is so full of love and of that which wins love. His
   Character is so amiable that it draws men to it as a loadstone draws
   the needle. This is the arm with which He gathers. Oh that all teachers
   had more of it!

   A little child, one morning, was eating her breakfast with a spoon and
   the sun shone in upon her little mess of broth. As she lifted a
   spoonful to her mouth, she said, "Mother, what do you think? I have
   eaten a spoonful of sunshine." I recommend that diet to all Sunday
   school teachers--take a great many spoonfuls of sunshine into your
   nature and let it shine in your very face and glitter in your talk!
   Your Master had it! The people loved to listen to Him. They felt, when
   they drew near to Him, as if they were like a ship that had entered
   into port and could cast anchor. Even when they did not receive all
   that He said, there was a charm about His manner, His spirit and His
   tone. Ask, O you teachers, ask for yourselves that God would give you
   that holy charm which gathers! Pray that He may deliver you from the
   angry spirit which scatters. Let your charm be in this, "I, if I am
   lifted up, will draw all men unto Me." Carry the love of Christ with
   you and you will not fail to gather the lambs with your arm!

   The next thing is, after you have attracted, lift up. He carries the
   lambs in His bosom and, therefore, He must lift them up! They were on
   the ground till He raised them. Everything about a teacher should tend
   to raise the children. You are to go down to the child, first, and make
   yourself understood. But you are not to stay down and become, yourself,
   childish. To tell children a lot of tales merely to amuse them is but
   to roll in the dust with the lambs and not to carry them. You may tell
   the tale and so come down to the lambs--but it must have its holy
   lesson with which you lift the lamb upward towards better things. Think
   of this and let your whole life act in that direction. Your example,
   your temper, your very dress must be a lifting up for the child.

   How often, in this evil city, do home influences drag the child
   downward? The habits, manners and customs with which it is surrounded
   tend to make it grovel in the earth. You have to lift it up, dear
   Teacher, as the Great Shepherd of the sheep did--away from its
   childishness, away from its worldliness, (for it gets to be worldly
   even while a child)-- away from its sin, away from the corruptions of
   the wicked world. Ask for Grace that every time you see your children
   you may lift them up and that God, the Holy Spirit, would lift you up
   all the while. Lift up your heart, or you cannot lift up your child.

   The third thing to be noticed is that when He lifted up the lamb, He
   laid it on His heart. Oh, Sunday school Teacher, this is a very
   important point with you! If you are to bless the little ones, they
   must be on your heart! You must make them feel the life of your
   religion--there must be a heart and a bosom to it. Let them know that
   there is something in your religion which looks towards them. Let them
   know that you love their souls, that you sorrow if they neglect the
   great salvation and that you will rejoice exceedingly if they are
   brought to Christ! Lift them up and then lay them on your heart and let
   that heart be warm with holy love!

   Next, bear them forward. The lamb is put into the shepherd's bosom, not
   that he may stand still with it all day long, but because the sheep are
   going this way and the lambs must go that way, too, and, therefore, he
   carries it. It is of no use

   for you to lay a child upon a cold heart--your own heart must be
   glowing or it will not be a fit candle for a babe in Grace. And then
   the bosom will be of small service unless the teacher is active as well
   as affectionate. A child in the bosom of a sluggish teacher will make
   no progress. You must be always going forward, yourself, if the child
   is to go forward with you. I do not believe that any preacher will have
   a growing congregation if he does not grow himself, nor will any
   teacher have an advancing class if he or she is not advancing, too.
   Advance in holiness, advance in communion with Christ, advance in
   perfect consecration to your Lord--and as you do so, the dear little
   children who are in your bosom will, by God's Grace, be carried with
   you.

   The next word is guard the children. Did we not say that Christ placed
   the lambs in His bosom to protect them? Good Sunday school teachers try
   to keep the children out of sin and out of harm's way on week days as
   well as on Sundays. Spiritual teachers of the noblest order need to
   know what the children do on ordinary days. They try, if they can, to
   be their guardian angels from the Monday morning to the Saturday night.
   They never relax their endeavors to lead the children away from the
   terrible temptations which surround them in this huge Babylon.

   The next word is cheer. Did I not say that the Good Shepherd laid the
   lamb in His bosom to keep it warm and cherish it? So should the good
   teacher always have a smile for the children and a word of
   encouragement for them in their little battle of life, for to them it
   is a great one. Beloved, do all that you can to comfort the little
   hearts of the young converts. Help them to believe as God helps you. By
   the Divine Spirit try to lead them on in holy joy as the Spirit leads
   you. So shall you be imitators of "that Great Shepherd of the sheep,"
   who--

   "Gently leads the wearied lamb,

   Gently binds the bruised limb.

   And His bosom bears the lamb

   Like an infant dear to Him.

   He the simplest thoughts instiils

   He the mildest rules imparts,

   Arms with power the weakest wills,

   Fills with joy the saddest hearts." And, last of all, delight in them.
   That 10th verse, with which I shall conclude, has a great charm for me.
   "The Lord God will come with strong hand, and His arm shall rule for
   Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His work before Him." Well,
   what did He have before Him but the sheep that He went forth to find
   and the lambs which He gathered and carried in His bosom? They were His
   work, but they were also His reward! Teachers of Sunday schools, your
   work is before you in your class--your reward is before you, too! These
   boys and girls are to cost you service--do not grudge it for they will
   be your reward! Look them in the face and know that they are immortal
   and that these are they whom God is able to win for His Son through
   you, to be the jewels of His diadem and to be your crowns of rejoicing!

   The harder and more stubborn a human heart, the more honor it is to win
   it for the Lord Jesus. The less attention you get at first, the higher
   will be your reward if, winning the attention, you shall, by-and-by,
   win the soul! I reckon that your Master will count you to have served
   Him all the more faithfully if you bring from the ragged school the
   most degraded, the most ignorant, the least taught and the most
   depraved! To bring to Christ the children of godly parents is a thing
   worthy of anyone's ambition, but to gather to Him the children of the
   back slums, the children of the debauched and the depraved--this seems,
   to me, to be a more illustrious ambition!

   Therefore do I say to you as you traverse these streets of
   London--Christian men and women, your work is before you! Your reward
   is before you! The teeming masses are at once your sphere of labor and
   your recompense. There is the soil you have to sow and there is the
   harvest which you have to reap. The fields are white, but they are
   white for the harvest! God give you faith in the Gospel that you teach,
   faith in your Master who taught it before you and faith in your Master
   who teaches it with you! Now, go forth, one and all, each one according
   to his or her ability and calling--and gather with your arms and carry
   in your bosom those for whom Christ died. Amen.

The Touch

   (No. 1382)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 4, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "She said, If I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole." Mark
   5:28.

   THE miracle of the healing of this woman occurred while our Savior was
   on the road to the house of Jairus to raise his daughter and I have not
   much doubt that although, in itself, it was a very remarkable miracle,
   it was not meant to stand quite alone, but had a relation to the Lord's
   dealings with Jairus. If I read the narrative rightly, the ruler of the
   synagogue was about to have his faith severely tried. He had come to
   the Savior saying that his daughter was lying at the point of death. He
   beseeched Jesus to come and heal her, but before He had reached the
   house, other messengers came to say, "Your daughter is dead; why do you
   trouble the Master any further?"

   Now, in order that the faith of Jairus might be prepared for that
   shock, our Lord had afforded him the sight of a special miracle worked
   upon this woman. Our Lord had said to him, "Fear not; only believe, and
   she shall be made whole," and as old Bishop Hall says, "to make this
   good, by the touch of the hem of His garment He revived a woman from
   the verge of death." It is amazing that the case of his little daughter
   of 12 years of age was here placed within the region of hope by our
   Lord's healing a woman who had been exactly the same time subject to a
   grievous and incurable malady. A woman who led a living death is healed
   that Jairus may believe that his dead daughter may be raised to life!

   Brethren, we never know, when God blesses us, how much blessing He is
   incidentally bestowing upon others. It may be that even our conversion
   had a far-reaching but very distinct connection with the conversion of
   others. Grace smiles upon its personal subject, but its object reaches
   beyond the private benefit of the individual. The Lord is strengthening
   the faith of another of His children, or it may be He is actually
   working faith in a convicted soul when He is accepting and honoring our
   faith and saving us!

   We speak of killing two birds with one stone, but our Savior knows how
   to bless two souls, no, 2,000 souls, with one single touch of His hand!
   I will not, however, detain you in the throng of thoughts with which I
   might preface my discourse upon this interesting narrative, for I long
   to bring you near to the glorious Person of the great Healer of men!
   Our Lord worked this miracle while moving on to work another--like the
   sun, He shines while He pursues His course and every beam is full of
   Grace. Not only what He does with full purpose is glorious, but He is
   so full of power and Grace that even what He does incidentally by the
   way is marvelous!

   The main course and design of His life must ever engross our most
   earnest thoughts, but even the minor episodes of His life are rich
   beyond expression. Nor is there ever a point of detail which is without
   instruction. We cannot exhaust the subject, but must be satisfied to
   leave out many interesting matters and come at once to the heart of the
   story. First, I invite you to look at this woman as a patient. Secondly
   to observe the great difficulties with which her faith was surrounded.
   Thirdly, we will come to the vanishing point and see how all her
   difficulties fled like the mists of the morning when she thought of
   Christ. And, lastly, we will dwell upon her grand success.

   It may be the Lord will help us to attain some greater blessing by
   enabling us to follow her example. Come, Holy Spirit, and aid our faith
   that it may bring us into closer and yet closer contact with our Divine
   Lord!

   I. First, then, look at THE PATIENT. She was a woman who had suffered
   from a very grievous malady which had drained away her life. Her
   constitution had been sapped and undermined--her very existence had
   become one of constant suffering and weakness--yet what courage and
   spirit she displayed! She was ready to go through fire and through
   water to obtain health! She must have had a wonderful amount of
   vitality in her, for where others would have been lying upon the bed of
   sickness and long ago despairing, she still, for 12 years continued to
   seek after a cure from one physician after another. Nothing dampened or
   daunted her--she would not give up so long as breath remained!

   When at last she had found the true Physician, she plunged into the
   thick of the crowd to touch Him by some means or other. She asked
   nobody to intercede for her, but with a dauntless courage worthy to be
   associated with her deep humility, she forced her way through the crowd
   to reach the healing Christ. She displayed intense energy and
   unconquerable spirit in pursuit of health. O that men were a tenth as
   much alive to the salvation of their souls! Note, also, her resolute
   determination. She would die hard, if die she must. She would not
   resign herself to the inevitable till she had used every effort to
   preserve life and to regain health.

   For 12 years it appears she had persevered in different ways and in the
   teeth of terrible agonies. We are told that she had suffered many
   things of many physicians. It is bad enough to suffer many things of
   one surgeon, but she had suffered many things from many practitioners.
   The physicians of those days were a great deal more to be dreaded than
   the worst diseases. If I were, now, to read to you even a brief account
   of the surgery practiced in olden times, you would shudder and beg me
   to close the book. Any reasonable person might prefer to suffer from
   any form of natural disorder rather than submit himself to the hands of
   the doctors of those days!

   As for their prescriptions, they were horrible! Even those of a couple
   hundred years ago, found in such books as "Culpepper's Herbal," are
   such a mess and mass of all manner of abominations that it would surely
   be better to die than to be drenched with such detestable concoctions.
   What with cupping, leeching and cutting--cauterizing, blistering and
   incision--strapping, puncturing and putting in set-ons, patients were
   made to undergo all manner of unimaginable tortures. The physicians of
   her day were worthy to have been administrators of the Inquisition, for
   they had reached perfection in the arts of torment.

   Yet the heroic woman before us endured every process which was supposed
   to have virtue in it. I know not how many operations she had endured,
   nor how many gallons of nauseous drugs she had swallowed, but they had
   certainly caused her a vast amount of suffering and bitter
   disappointment. Meanwhile her money had been paid away freely till she
   had nothing left to procure her comforts when she most needed them. As
   long as her money lasted, she never held back a single penny of it. The
   resolution of the woman is well worthy of being observed. She is
   determined that if beneath the sky there is a cure, that cure she will
   have--and as long as there is life left in her, that life shall be
   spent somehow or other seeking to baffle Death of his immediate prey.

   I am glad, when I see such resolution in an awakened soul, but how
   seldom is it to be seen! I am happy when a man, however ignorant of the
   way of salvation, nevertheless resolves, "I will be saved if salvation
   is obtainable. Whatever is to be suffered, whatever is to be given up,
   whatever is to be done, if there is any way of salvation procurable by
   any means, I will have it. The whole world shall not be reckoned too
   great an expense! Self-denial of the most arduous kind shall be a
   trifle to me if I may but be saved." Surely, Brothers and Sisters, the
   salvation of our immortal soul is worthy of all the intensity of zeal,
   constancy of purpose and resoluteness of determination of which we are
   capable! Who shall count its worth? Against what shall we weigh the
   soul?

   Fine gold of the merchants is as dross compared with our undying
   spirit! The diamond and the costly crystal are not to be named in
   comparison with it! Job said, "Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has
   will he give for his life." And truly the ransom of the soul is
   precious. It is a hopeful sign, a gracious token when there is a
   determination worked in men that, if saved they can be, saved they will
   be! I admire, also, this woman's marvelous hopefulness. She still
   believes that she can be cured. She ought to have given up the idea
   long ago, according to the ordinary processes of reasoning, for
   generally we put several instances together and from these several
   instances we deduce a certain inference.

   She might have put the many physicians together, and their many
   failures, and have rationally inferred that her case was hopeless. She
   might have said, "My disease is incurable. I must ask for patience to
   bear it till I die, but no longer dream of a cure." But no, bright-eyed
   woman as I have no doubt she was, she saw hope where others would have
   despaired! Something within her buoyed her up and she still had hopes
   of better days! And so when she heard of Jesus, her heart leaped within
   her. Her hope said, "The blessing has come at last! I have long waited
   for it and now God has sent it to me! Here it is and I will seize it at
   once. Now has the Sun of Righteousness arisen upon me with healing
   beneath His wings and I will bathe in His sunlight. Now I have escaped
   from mere pretenders and have found One who has real power

   to heal!"

   You see, then, the patient. A woman of spirit, of resolution and of
   hopefulness. Such persons make grand workers when they are converted!
   May God grant that I may have many such men and women before me and may
   the Master come, this morning, by His Spirit, and do His healing work
   upon them!

   II. But now, secondly, I beg you to join with me in considering THE
   DIFFICULTIES OF THIS WOMAN'S FAITH. They must be weighed in order to
   show its strength. The difficulties of her faith must have been as
   follows. First, she could hardly forget that the disease was, in
   itself, incurable, and that she had long suffered from it. Taken early,
   many maladies may be greatly mitigated, if not altogether removed. But
   it was now very late in the day with this poor sufferer. Twelve
   years--it is a long, long portion of human life during which to have
   been continually drained of the very sustenance of that life. To pine
   and bleed for 12 years is enough to render one hopeless.

   Can a cure be possible? Can the disease which has taken root in the
   body for 12 years be eradicated? Can the incurable be healed, after
   all? Her heart would naturally enquire, how can this thing be? Do you
   wonder that after being so long weakened by her complaint and rendered
   more and more infirm by its long continuance--do you wonder, I say, if
   it looked to her to be an utter impossibility that she should be
   healed? Yet observe her conduct and admire it! She staggered not, but
   believed in Jesus!

   But then, again, she had endured frequent disappointments. And all
   these must have supplied her with terrible reasons for doubting. "Yes,"
   she might have said, "I remember the first physician I applied to, how
   he told me it was a very small matter and that if I would purchase a
   bottle of the large size of his Egyptian elixir, which he had imported
   from the tombs of the Pharaohs at enormous expense, I should speedily
   be well. Alas, he only relieved me of my gold. Then another famous
   professor assured me that his pills would do the work if I took them
   some three hundred times and was careful to purchase them only from
   him, as he, alone, possessed the secret, and no one else could prepare
   the genuine article. He had no doubt that I should be greatly improved
   after the three hundredth box. But, alas, after tedious delay, I was no
   better."

   She remembered how, under each new treatment, she interpreted every
   little change in herself into a hopeful sign, but soon found herself
   rudely shaken out of her dream by an increase of the evil. Her
   adventures were many, but all alike sad in their end. She remembered
   the grave old physician to whom she went some years ago, who shook his
   learned head and assured her that he had scarcely ever met with a more
   terrible case. It was a great mercy for her that she had come to him,
   for there was not another man in Palestine who understood the disease.
   He believed that he could certainly stop the issue of blood by the
   daily use of his Balm of Lebanon, prepared from the best gums of the
   cedar and the richest juices of odoriferous herbs and mixed in an
   extraordinary manner in accordance with the suggestions of the ancients
   and the observations of many years of practice.

   It was a mercy, indeed, that he had a little left of this matchless
   balm which she could have at a very moderate price considering how much
   expense it was to him. She had taken it, but it had made her feel a new
   pain and had brought on a fresh disease. She had paid heavily to endure
   two maladies instead of one! She had changed her doctor and this time
   engaged a Greek physician who heartily condemned all his predecessors
   as fools! He taught a system so profound that the poor woman could not
   understand him at all, but believed in him, none the less, for she set
   it down to her own ignorance and his deep learning. He failed, however,
   and she then tried a Roman doctor, a plain, blunt, practical man who
   talked no Greek, but was greatly skilled in the rough and ready
   treatment of wounded soldiers.

   After trying medicines for a very considerable time, he informed her
   that hers was a very suitable case for a famous operation which he had,
   himself, first practiced--a beautiful operation, indeed! He had tried
   it on scores of soldiers and although none had recovered, he believed
   that his treatment was the best known. She had declined that heroic
   operation, but she had endured another and another, until she moved
   about painfully, with the scars in her flesh of wounds which she had
   received in the house of her medical friends.

   When we consider the long story of which I have thus tried to make a
   rough draft, it would not have been at all extraordinary if she had
   said, "I cannot trust anybody else! Now I give it up. I would sooner
   die than be tortured any more. Better to let Nature alone than that I
   should put myself into the hands of any more of these infallible
   deceivers." Yet she was not dismayed--her faith rose superior to her
   bitter experience and she believed in the Lord. It is easier for me to
   tell this to you than it is for any of us to realize what her
   difficulty really must have been. If you, too, have tried by good
   works, by ceremonies, by prayers and tears to obtain salvation and have
   been defeated at all points--it is not a

   mystery that you should be slow to believe that you can ever be saved.
   May your faith, also, like hers, swim over the crests of the billows of
   disappointment and may you hope in the Almighty Savior!

   There was, also, another difficulty in her way and that was her vivid
   sense of her unworthiness. When she thought of Jesus, she viewed Him as
   a Person who was holy as well as powerful. She reverenced as well as
   trusted Him. I am sure she did, for though she summoned courage enough
   to touch Him, her modesty led her to go behind Him, as unworthy to be
   seen. She was evidently afraid to face Him, lest He, knowing her
   unworthiness, as she knew it, should spurn her and forbid her approach.
   She was an unclean woman, according to the ceremonial Law, and the
   shame of her disease prevented her venturing upon any verbal request or
   open application. She had great confidence in His power and mercy, but
   she had equal awe of His purity and, therefore, feared that He would be
   angry if she touched Him.

   This must have very much hampered her. "How shall I venture to draw
   near to Him? The other physicians I could approach, for I knew them to
   be like myself. But concerning Him I find that He is a Prophet mighty
   in word and deed--a man of God--and something more. How shall I dare to
   approach Mm?" The thought that she would go behind shows her ignorance
   of the Lord's Divinity or her forgetfulness of the attribute of
   Omniscience, but still, it proves that she labored under a sense of
   unworthiness and yet she believed. Ah, dear Hearers, when you are bowed
   down with a sense of your own sin and folly, may the Holy Spirit lead
   you to believe that Jesus Christ is able to make you whole!

   I do not know whether the other difficulty did occur to her at all, but
   it would to me, namely, that she had, now, no money. She had spent all
   her living, we are told--all her living. The physicians whom she had
   previously consulted had all been great in the matter of fees--they
   could diminish her wealth if they could not establish her health! She
   had carefully approached them with promises of large reward, assuring
   them that anything she could give would be freely rendered if she could
   but be cured. But now she can offer nothing. Her disease remains, but
   her estate is gone! She is reduced to poverty by her efforts after
   health--how shall she come before the Great Physician of whom she has
   heard so much?

   I should not wonder but what the thought of His great-heartedness and
   the many cures which He had worked gratuitously helped her to get over
   that difficulty. But still, it occurs to many to dream of purchasing
   salvation and to this day many need to be reminded that Jesus gives His
   Grace to those who have no money nor any other price to offer Him! His
   terms are--"without money and without price!" But many awakened
   consciences forget this. Perhaps the worst difficulty of all was her
   extreme sickness at that time. We read that she was not better, but
   rather grew worse. She had been bad enough before, but the doctors had
   aggravated the disease with their strong acrid medicines, sharp
   incisions and fierce blisters. They had made her worse than Nature
   would have left her if it had been let alone!

   She had reached a frightful stage of the disease and was confessedly
   beyond all human help. She was as bad as she could be to crawl about at
   all. Usually such a sickness depresses the spirits, unnerves the mind
   and makes the sufferer feel a lack of energy, so that, resolute woman
   as she was, we should little have marveled if she had said, "No, I can
   do no more. I must yield. There is nothing now but to lay down and die,
   for I am in such a condition that all attempts to gain health are
   futile."

   What a grand faith was hers which made her rise above her weakness,
   overcome her depression of spirit, throw aside the lethargy which was
   creeping over her and believe that everything was altered, for she had
   no longer to deal with a pretender who would fail her, but with One
   sent of God and clothed with infinite power, who could meet her
   case--even hers!

   III. So now we come to our third point, which is THE VANISHING POINT OF
   ALL HER DIFFICULTIES. We

   read of her, first, that she had heard of Jesus. It is Mark who tells
   us that, "When she had heard of Jesus." "Faith comes by hearing." What
   had she heard of Him? Is it not more than probable that she had been
   told of that scene which is pictured in Luke's Gospel, in the 6th
   chapter and the 19th verse, when, "The whole multitude sought to touch
   Him; for there went virtue out of Him, and healed them all." On one
   special day great multitudes followed our Lord and pressed upon Him to
   touch Him, for whoever touched Him was healed of whatever disease He
   had! What a wonderful scene that must have been when men were so
   enthusiastic to be blessed that they thronged the great Physician!

   Not that our Lord was more able to save on one day than on another, but
   there were certain days in which the power seemed to emanate from His
   Person more mightily than at other times, always, as I judge, in
   proportion to the faith of the people who surrounded Him. On that
   occasion, being followed by a great company who believed in His healing

   power, they saw such wonders worked that they made a general rush at
   His blessed Person and all who touched obtained healing! Some conceive
   that even the healthy touched Him and gained greater vigor from the
   touch. I should not wonder! In spiritual things it is so. The woman had
   heard of all the wondrous cures He had worked and she said to herself,
   "Then I will touch Him and be healed! For if these reports are true,
   then if I may but touch Him I, too, shall be made whole."

   She seems to have believed Christ to be charged with marvelous power,
   somewhat like a Leyden jar charged with electricity which gives forth
   its power most freely. She was not a woman of any great wisdom. Her
   chief quality was energy. She made a great blunder about our Lord and
   His garments, but it did not touch the vital point--she so thought of
   Him as to glorify His power--and it sufficed. She truly believed in
   Him. And if you believe in Christ, though you are in the dark about a
   thousand things, your faith will save you! If you do but really believe
   in Jesus, all your mistakes about Him will not really destroy His power
   to bless you, nor set His heart against you, nor destroy the value of
   your faith. "If I touch but His clothes," she says, "He is so full of
   power that He will heal me."

   The point to notice most distinctly is this. The poor woman believed
   that the faintest contact with Christ would heal her. Notice the words
   of my text--"If I may touch but His clothes." It is not, "If I may but
   touch His clothes"--no, the point does not lie in the touch, it lies in
   what was touched. "If I may touch but His clothes. If I cannot get near
   enough to Him to touch His flesh, if I may touch but His clothes. Such
   is the power which dwells in Him that it overflows even into His
   garments! And while He wears them they are charged with the virtue
   which I need--it reaches even to the blue fringe which, as a Hebrew, He
   wears upon the edge of His robe. I am sure if I touch but that fringe,
   if I cannot do any more, there will be a connection between Him and me
   and I shall be healed."

   Splendid faith! It was not more than Christ deserved, but yet it was
   remarkable! It was a kind of faith which I desire to possess! The
   slenderest contact with Christ healed the body and will heal the
   soul--yes, the faintest communication! Do but become united to Jesus
   and the blessed work is done! Effect the junction and the virtue comes
   to you. "If I touch but His clothes, I shall be made whole." I want you
   carefully to observe that the woman did not seem to think anything
   about herself. You could not lay the stress upon the pronoun, "If I
   touch but His clothes, I shall be made whole." It would not be in
   accordance with the context. No, it is, "If I touch but His clothes."
   It does not matter who I may be, what my uncleanness may be, what my
   character may be, what my state of mind may be--if I touch but His
   clothes, contact being established--I shall be healed!

   Every person who comes into contact with Jesus by the touch of faith
   will partake of His healing power! She knew this and shut her eyes to
   all other considerations. She lays no stress upon any mode of touching.
   No. "If I touch but His clothes"--not embrace Him, nor grasp Him, hold
   Him, wrestle with Him--no, she believes that any sort of contact will
   answer the purpose. Now it is always a blessed thing when a man is
   taught of God to forget himself--and even to forget his faith--and only
   think upon the Lord Jesus who is the Object of our trust. I admire this
   woman's resoluteness. She sees nothing but Jesus! Dear Heart, she felt
   that the virtue to heal was all in Him and not in her, nor in her
   touch. She knew that whatever she might be, His power could master
   every difficulty of her case and that the result did not depend upon
   the mode of her touch, nor the length during which it lasted, but on
   Him alone!

   It was from Him that the virtue was to come and come it would, however
   slender the contact. This faith is worth cultivating. To forget
   everything else and only to consider the Lord Jesus and His power to
   bless is wisdom! Here am I, a poor lost sinner, but if I can only get
   to Jesus I shall be forgiven and saved! Here am I, vexed with unruly
   passions, diseased with this sin and that, but if I may only touch Him,
   He is so full of healing power that, mass of spiritual disease though I
   may have, the moment I touch Him, His virtue will battle with my
   disease and vanquish it forever! Behold this woman! Again fix your eye
   upon her till you have become like she is! All her thoughts have gone
   towards the Lord Jesus. She has forgotten herself, forgotten the
   rampant fury of her disease, forgotten her being behind and out of
   sight--even her own touch of Him she has put into a secondary place.
   Everything she looks for must come out of Him!

   She knows that connected with Him she will obtain the blessing, but
   apart from Him she will abide in her misery. "If I may touch but His
   clothes"--not because His garments are in themselves powerful, but
   because they are, "His clothes"--the garments which He is wearing and
   which, consequently, will be a medium of communication with Himself.
   There is the vanishing point, then--she has come to think of Jesus and
   of the certainty of cure through contact with Him. If you, seeking
   Sinners, would but think more of Christ, all would be well. You who
   cannot believe--if you would relinquish your perpetual thoughts about
   your faith and even about your sin, and begin to think of Him--the

   Son of God, exalted to be a Priest and a Savior, the Christ whose
   finished work is all for sinners, the Christ of the Resurrection, Jesus
   the Ever Living, Jesus in whom all power dwells--I think you would soon
   obtain eternal salvation!

   When your whole heart sets itself upon Him and no more upon itself, you
   will enter into peace and enjoy rest for your souls.

   IV. Fourthly, let us speak of HER GRAND SUCCESS. Let me remind you
   again, however, of how she gained her end. She gave to the Lord Jesus
   an intentional and voluntary touch. Upon the intentional character of
   it, I must insist for a minute. She pressed into the crowd. She was
   hustled about, I do not doubt, and in her weak state, ready to faint,
   or even to die. In the midst of those rough men who pressed about the
   Savior, she found no sympathy. But she is desperately bound, by hook or
   by crook, to touch His clothes. She presses in behind, for she cares
   not where she touches Him, but touch Him she must.

   In the throng, the garments of Christ became entangled and at some
   little distance from Him she perceives just a bit of the blue fringe
   hanging out behind. Now is her time--she has only to touch that--so
   strong is her faith that even the hem of His garment suffices her, for
   it will make a connection between her and the Savior and that is all
   she needs. Her finger is put out and the deed is done. Yet note that
   she was not healed by a contact with the Lord or with His garment
   against her will! She was not pushed against Him accidentally, but the
   touch was active and not merely passive. "You see," said one of the
   Apostles, "the multitude thronging You and pressing You." There was
   nothing remarkable or efficacious about such unavoidable and
   involuntary touches. Her touch was her own distinct, intentional,
   voluntary act and it was done under the persuasion that it would bring
   her a cure. Such is the faith which brings salvation.

   It is not every contact with Christ that saves men. It is the awakening
   of yourself to come near to Him, the determinate, the personal,
   resolute, believing touch of Jesus Christ which saves! We must believe
   for ourselves. The Spirit helps us, but we, ourselves, believe. Some of
   you sit still and hope that the Lord will visit you. You wait by the
   pool till an angel comes and stirs the water and all that kind of
   thing. But that is not according to the tenor of the Gospel command.
   The Gospel does not come to you and say, "Whoever waits for impressions
   shall be saved." No, it says, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, for He
   that believes and is baptized shall be saved." Exercise the personal,
   voluntary, intentional act of faith and you shall be saved!

   Oh, I would to God that some sinner here, deeply conscious of his
   guilt, might be awakened to perform that act this morning! However
   little your knowledge, believe in Jesus as far as you know Him. Though
   you can only come into contact with that part of Christ which you have
   learned from the Scriptures, that little of Christ is a part of Himself
   and you will have touched Him! You may not be acquainted with the deep
   things of God, nor with the high doctrines which honor our adorable
   Lord, but what you do know will suffice for faith. If you say, "I will
   trust the Lamb of God," and really do so, then you have come into
   contact with Him and you are saved! Yes, though it is but a believing
   prayer, a believing sigh, a believing tear--you have really reached Him
   and you are made whole! But the touch of faith must be your own act and
   deed. Nobody is saved in His sleep. Nobody may claim to have been
   transformed into a living soul unless he can prove it by the living act
   of trust. There must be this appropriating faith--and this the woman
   had.

   And now see her grand success! She no sooner touched than she was
   healed! In a moment, swift as electricity, the touch was given, the
   contact was made, the fountain of her blood was dried up and health
   beamed in her face immediately. Immediate salvation! I heard a person
   say, the other day, that he had heard of immediate conversion, but he
   did not know what to make of it. Now, herein is a marvelous thing, for
   such cases are common enough among us! In every case spiritual
   quickening must be instantaneous! However long the preparatory process
   may be, there must be a time in which the dead soul begins to live!
   There must be a time in which the babe is not born and a moment in
   which it is born. We are pardoned, or else condemned!

   There must be a moment in which the man is not pardoned, and another in
   which he is--and that must be an inappreciable period of time! I grant
   you that many workings of conscience, and so on, may go before and melt
   into the actual reception of life, so as to make it appear a gradual
   work. But the actual birth--the Divine quickening by which the man is
   made to live in Christ--must be instantaneous in every case! A man is
   brought by degrees to a deep sense of sin, to the renunciation of self
   and so on--but there is no period in which a man lies between death and
   life--he either is alive unto God or he is dead in sin! If he is dead,
   he is dead! And if he is alive, he is alive--there is no state between
   the two. A man is either regenerate or unregenerate! There is no
   borderland or neutral territory between the two conditions.

   This woman was healed in a moment and God can save you, my dear
   Hearers, in an instant. May He do it now! If you now believe, it is
   done! There may be cases in which a blessing comes to a man and he is
   scarcely aware of it, but this woman knew that she was saved. She felt
   in herself that she was whole of her plague. I do not say that I would
   like to have undergone her 12 years of suffering for the sake of that
   moment's joy, but I am sure she was quite content to have done so. The
   joy of the first hour in which you know you are saved! It is almost too
   much to live with! It is well that it does not continue in all its
   vehemence and ecstasy! That flash of light, brighter than the sun! That
   flush, that flood, that torrent of unutterable bliss which bears all
   before it, when, at last, we can say, "My sins are assuredly removed
   from me--I am saved and know it within myself!"--that joy, I say, is
   beyond all description!

   Blessed be God if we have known that bliss! Blessed be God, I say, and
   I would repeat the thanks a thousand times! Oh, touch the Savior, poor
   Sinner! The Lord deliver you from anything of your own and bring you,
   now, to look for all to Jesus and you shall know in yourself that you
   are whole of your plague! She had, next, the assurance from Christ
   Himself that it was so, but she did not obtain that assurance till she
   had made an open confession. She felt in herself that she was whole,
   but there was more comfort in reserve for her. The Lord Jesus Christ
   would have those who follow Him come forward and no longer hide in the
   crowd. Those who believe ought to be baptized on confession of their
   faith. He, who in His heart believes, should with His mouth make
   confession of Him.

   So Christ turned round and said, "Who touched My clothes?" At the
   hearing of that enquiry the newly-kindled flame of her joy began to
   dampen under the fear of losing what she had stolen. Down went her
   spirits below zero! Then the officious disciples said, "You see the
   multitude thronging You, and pressing You and You say, who touched Me?"
   But Jesus said, as He looked around again, "Somebody has touched Me."
   For not His clothes, alone, but He had been touched by somebody. That
   poor "somebody" wanted to sink into the earth! I know she did! She
   trembled as Jesus looked for her. Those blessed eyes looked around and,
   by-and-by, they lighted upon her. And as she gazed upon them she did
   not feel so much alarmed as before, but still afraid and trembling, she
   came and fell down before Him and told Him the truth.

   Then He gently raised her up and said, "Daughter, your faith has made
   you whole. Go in peace and be whole of your plague." Now she knew her
   cure from Christ's lips as well as from her own consciousness! She had,
   now the, Divine Witness bearing witness with her spirit that she was,
   indeed, a healed one! Mark then, that those of you who desire to obtain
   the Witness of the Spirit should come forward and confess your faith
   and tell what the Lord has done for you-- then shall you receive the
   sealing Witness of the Spirit with your spirit that you are, indeed,
   born of God! God help you tremblers who have, at last touched my
   Master's hem, to acknowledge it bravely before all and specially before
   Him!

   Brothers and Sisters, the wine which comes out of these grapes is
   this--the slightest connection with Jesus will bless us! I desire to
   send you away with this one Truth of God upon your minds. Whether you
   are a child of God or not a child of God, hear this weighty doctrine!
   This woman believed the matchless Truth that the least touch of Christ
   will cure. "If I may touch but His clothes, I shall be made whole."
   Believe this, I pray you, each one for himself. If you, dear child of
   God, feel very depressed this morning--coldhearted, dead, sluggish--if
   you touch but His clothes you shall become warm-hearted again! You
   shall get all your life and vigor and enthusiasm back if you only draw
   near to your Lord.

   Do I hear you say "I seem so full of doubts, so depressed in spirits,
   so unhappy. I trust I am converted, but I cannot rejoice." Then,
   Brother, get a fresh hold of your Lord, for if you touch but His
   clothes you shall be made whole of the plague of doubting! Only draw
   near to Jesus, your risen Lord, by a prayer, or a believing thought and
   it is done! Be it ever so slight a touch, you shall be made whole!
   Perhaps you say, "I feel so discouraged in my Christian work and even
   feel as if I must give it up. I have seen no conversions lately and,
   therefore, I cannot go about my work with the spirit I once had."

   Brother, you are falling into a spiritual lethargy! But if you but
   touch your Lord, again, you shall be made whole! Did not the Lord Jesus
   heal you at the first? He can heal still! He loses no virtue when He
   gives forth His power. If a master takes a scholar and fills him full
   of wisdom, the master is just as wise afterwards as he was at first.
   And when our Lord grants us a fullness of Grace, He remains just as
   full of Grace as He was originally. Come to Him, then, you downcast
   saints. Come now! Come always! If any of you have backslidden. If you
   have become altogether wrong and out of sorts. If your spiritual
   digestion is bad. If your spiritual eyes are dim so that you cannot see
   afar off. If your knees are

   weak and if your hands hang down. If your whole head is sick and your
   heart faint, yet still, if you touch but your Lord's garments you shall
   be made whole!

   This wonderful medicine has boundless power to restore from relapses as
   well as to heal the first disease. I cannot help reminding you of the
   Church at Laodicea, which was in so horrible a state that our Lord,
   Himself, said He must spit it out of His mouth--and yet He
   added--"Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear My
   voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him,
   and he with Me." Communion with our Master is the cure for
   lukewarmness! When you have fallen so low that even Christ, Himself, is
   sick of you--and it must be a very bad case when He becomes sick of a
   Church--yet even then, if you but sup with Him and He with you, all
   will be well! Only get into communion with Him who has life in Himself
   and your own life shall become full of vigor. Oh, dear children of God,
   if you have fallen into an unhappy state, put in practice the example
   of the woman and see whether Jesus is not, still, the same! A touch is
   a very simple matter, but do not, therefore, doubt its value.

   As for you who fear that you are not His children, behold, I set before
   you an open door, this morning, and I pray God that you may be enabled
   to enter into it! If you touch but the Redeemer's clothes you shall be
   made whole! Whatever the transgression, the iniquity, the sin of which
   you have been guilty--come into contact with the bleeding Lamb and you
   shall be forgiven! You need not even so much as touch, for there is
   life in a look. A look will set up sufficient contact to bring
   salvation! "Look unto Me and be you saved, all you ends of the earth."
   "They looked unto Him and were lightened, and their faces were not
   ashamed."

   Do but look! Do but get out of yourself to Him, somehow or other, and
   it is done! Though a glance will not carry a thread as thin as a
   spider's cobweb, yet it will establish a connection! The ray of light
   which comes from Jesus' wounds to your eyes will be link enough--and
   along it eternal salvation will come to you! Get to Christ, Sinner! Get
   to Christ at once! Have you come to Him? Then you are saved! Confess
   your faith and give Jesus honor. Love Him with all your heart and while
   angels are rejoicing over you, be glad, also! Christ has saved you!
   Praise Him forever and ever! May the Lord add His blessing for Jesus'
   sake. Amen.

The Cause And Cure Of Weariness In Sunday School Teachers

   (No. 1383)

   DELIVERED ON THURSDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 8, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON,

   "Let us not be weary in doing good: for in due season we shall reap, if
   we faint not." Galatians 6:9.

   [AT A CONVENTION OF THE SUNDAY SCHOOL UNION.]

   THIS verse occurs in the Epistle to the Galatians, which so plainly
   sets forth the grand doctrine of Justification by Faith and teaches us
   most plainly that salvation is not of works, but of Grace. As if to
   confuse forever those who say that the doctrine of Free Grace is
   unpractical, the Apostle, before he closes his Epistle, exhorts
   Believers to labor. And in the verse before us gives us a sentence
   worthy to be printed in letters of gold and hung up forever before the
   eyes of all Christian workers, "Be not weary in doing good." It is
   true, my Brothers and Sisters, that you are not to save yourselves by
   doing good. Your motive is not selfish, but because you are saved
   already, you desire to manifest the power of gratitude and to prove to
   all the world that those who receive a free salvation are the very men
   who most cheerfully labor to please God and to bring glory to His name.
   O you who are debtors to infinite mercy, "Be not weary in doing good."

   The Apostle, at the time he wrote our text, had in his mind's eye the
   doing good which, by its alms, does good unto all men and, also, that
   kindness which leads hearers of the Gospel to communicate in all good
   things unto him that teaches. Truly it is easy to be weary in these
   matters. Giving alms is certainly disheartening work. One is so
   continually being deceived that giving to the poor becomes a weary
   business. Impostors abound on all sides! This city of London swarms
   with impostors who would deceive Solomon himself. I do not wonder that
   men are driven to organize their charity--but which frequently means
   bringing it to an end!

   The tendency is to excuse themselves because at some time or other they
   have been victimized. A cruel hardness is abroad which talks philosophy
   and renounces giving alms for fear of disturbing our delightful social
   economy. Alms giving, if we are to believe some men, has become a crime
   and the truly good man is he who never interferes with the work of the
   poor. To these people it seems odd that our Lord should have commended
   anything so inconsistent with political economy as giving to the poor!
   According to the modern school, we may expect those to be blessed who
   see people hungry and give them no meat, thirsty and give them no
   drink, sick and in prison and never visit them because hungry people
   should go to the parish and thirsty people to the pump!

   I trust, however, that the Christian spirit which is pitiful to the
   poor will never die out among us and that, notwithstanding all the
   difficulties under which we may have to labor, we may not be weary in
   doing good, for despite all deceits and impositions, in due season we
   shall reap if we faint not. I am sure I shall not be wrong in taking
   the text from its immediate connection and applying it to the work of
   Sunday schools, for, first of all, I am sure, Brothers and Sisters,
   that your work is well described in the text--it is doing good.

   Secondly, I am equally clear that you are liable to the evils mentioned
   here, which are common to all Christian service--weariness and
   faintness. And it is equally clear that the consolation and
   encouragement of the text may truthfully be enjoyed by you. "In due
   season we shall reap, if we faint not."

   I. First, then, I know you will all agree with me that YOUR WORK IS
   WELL DESCRIBED IN THE TEXT. It may be set forth in so many words as
   doing good. You entered upon it because you felt it to be so and you
   continue in it for the same reason. Another description of Christian
   work is implied in the promise of reaping--your work is sowing. Take
   the two ideas of doing good and sowing and they will both be found to
   be exceedingly well embodied in holy labor among the young. Sunday
   school work is doing good. How can it be otherwise, for it is an act of
   obedience! I trust you

   have entered upon it because you call Jesus your Master and Lord and
   you wish to fulfill the great command, "Go you into all the world and
   preach the Gospel to every creature."

   You find children to be creatures--fallen creatures--but still lovable
   little things, full of vigor, life and glee. You see them to be a
   component part of the race and you conclude at once that your Master's
   command applies to them. You are not like the disciples who would put
   them back, for you have learned from their mistake and you remember the
   words of their Master and yours, "Suffer the little children to come
   unto Me, and forbid them not." You know, too, that "out of the mouths
   of babes and sucklings He has ordained strength because of the
   adversary," so that you are sure that He included the little ones in
   the general commission when He said, "Preach the Gospel to every
   creature."

   You are doubly sure that you are obeying His will because you have
   certain special precepts which relate to the little ones, such as,
   "Feed My lambs" and, "Train up a child in the way he should go and when
   he is old, he shall not depart from it." You know that it is our duty
   to preserve a testimony in the world and, therefore, you are anxious to
   teach the Word of God to your children that they may teach it to their
   children, that so, from generation to generation, the Word of the Lord
   may be made known. Be the task pleasant or irksome to you, it is not
   yours to hesitate, but to obey. The love which has redeemed you, also
   constrains you. You feel the touch of the sacred hand upon your
   shoulder, the hand which once was pierced, and you hear your Redeemer
   say, "As My Father has sent Me, even so send I you."

   And, because of that sending, you go forth to the little ones in
   obedience to His will. He who obeys is doing good and in this sense
   your service among the little ones is doing good. Doing good it is,
   again, because it brings glory to God. We must always continue to
   receive from God, who is the great Fountain of goodness and blessing,
   but yet, in infinite condescension, He permits us to give Him some
   return. As the dewdrop reflects the beam with which the great sun
   adorns it, so may we, in our measure, make the light of our great
   Father to sparkle before the eyes of men. Our lives may be as the
   rivers which run into the sea from where they originally came. Whenever
   we attempt that which will clearly promote the Divine Glory, we are
   doing good.

   When we make known Jehovah's Grace. When we work in accordance with His
   purposes of love. When we speak forth the Truth of God which honors His
   beloved Son. Whenever, indeed, the Holy Spirit, through us, bears
   witness to the eternal Truths of the Gospel, there is doing good
   towards God. We cannot increase His intrinsic Glory, but through His
   Spirit we can make His Glory to be more widely seen--and among the
   choicest ways of doing this we give a high place to the teaching of
   children the fear of the Lord in order that they may be a seed to serve
   Him and to rejoice in His salvation. And who shall doubt that Sunday
   school work is doing good towards man? The highest form of charity is
   to teach our fellow man the Gospel of Jesus Christ!

   You may give bread to your fellow, but when he has eaten it, is gone.
   If you give him the Bread of Life, it abides with him forever. You may
   give him bread in plenty, but in due time he will die as his fathers
   have done before him. But if you give him the Bread of Heaven and he
   eats thereof, he shall live forever! God has enabled you to hand out to
   him immortal food, even Jesus, who is "that Bread from Heaven." What a
   blessing it is to a man if you are the instrument of changing his heart
   and so of emancipating him from vice and making him free unto holiness!
   To lead a soul to Christ is to lead it to Heaven!

   It is assuredly a noble part of benevolence to deliver the Gospel to
   the sons of men and, if possible, this benevolence is of a still higher
   kind when you deliver the Truth of God to children, for as prevention
   is better than a cure, so is it better to prevent a life of vice than
   to rescue from it. And as the earlier a soul has light, the shorter is
   its night of darkness, so the earlier in life salvation comes to the
   heart, the better and greater is the benediction. To receive the dew of
   Grace while we are yet in the dew of youth is a double blessing!
   Brethren, your work is one of doing good of the most thorough and
   radical kind, for you strike at the very root of sin in the child by
   seeking his regeneration. You desire, by the Grace of God, to win the
   heart for Christ at the beginning of life and this is the best of
   blessings!

   I hope you are not among those who only hope to see your children
   converted when they are grown up and feel satisfied to let them remain
   in their sins while they are children. I hope that you pray for the
   conversion of children as children and are working to that end by the
   Spirit's gracious aid. If you are doing so, I know of no service more
   fit to engage the angels of Heaven if they could be permitted to
   undertake it! Surely, if they could teach the Gospel to mankind and had
   their choice of learners, they might well pass those by who are already
   hardened in sin and who can only give

   their tottering age to Christ--and gather for Him the young whose day
   is but dawning! We may not set one work against another, but at any
   rate we may count ourselves happy if our sphere is among the young.

   Let us gather the rosebuds for Jesus! Let us bring to Him the virgin in
   her earliest beauty and the young man in his first vigor before sin and
   age have spoiled them of their charms! Let us find for Him those who
   can give Him a whole life and honor Him from dawn till its eve! Oh, it
   is glorious to have such work for Jesus! Go to your youthful charges
   rejoicing in your work, for it is doing good! It is by no means
   difficult to see that Sunday school work is sowing. Upon this I will
   not speak much, for the emblem is easy to be understood. Your schools
   are the field, the Gospel is the seed and you are the sowers. Suffer me
   only to say that yours is a work in which there are great outgoings and
   apparent losses. Even as the sower casts his seed into the earth,
   buries it and it is lost to him, so do you spend your strength, your
   thought, your love, your talent, your time and, at first, see no
   return.

   You are sacrificing your leisure and much of the religious privileges
   of your fellow Christians. You are, as some say, burying yourselves in
   the school--surrendering ease and repose for unremunerated work. I
   speak after the manner of men. You engage in these self-denials because
   you believe that the Truth of God, like a seed, ought to be sown and
   that it is your duty to sow it. It is frequently said that "truth is
   mighty and will prevail" but this must be qualified by the reflection
   that Truth does nothing by way of conquest till it is spoken out by
   earnest men. I doubt not that there are hundreds of great Truths of
   God, in the shape of social reforms, now lying on the shelf and having
   little or no power because they have not yet found a brave and earnest
   tongue to proclaim them. When the man shall come who is ordained to be
   their spokesman they will ring out like a clarion and hosts will gather
   to their standard, but meanwhile they lie like sleeping giants whose
   might sleeps with them.

   There is power in the Truth of God, as there is life in seed, but it
   will be hidden till, like seed, it is sown in favorable soil! It needs
   a sower and feeling that the Truth ought to be sown, you consecrate
   yourselves to that work. You have, moreover, looked at the children and
   you have felt that the soil of their minds ought to be sown. You hope
   to find good soil, at least, in some cases, and it strikes you that to
   delay to sow will be culpable neglect. You are sure that if you do not
   sow, the devil will, and that weeds will spring up if wheat is not
   sown. And you wish, if you can, to get the start of some, at least, of
   the devil's servants and drop in the seeds of Divine Truth before the
   grosser vices have come to maturity.

   You know that abundant seed of noxious plants lies hidden in that plot
   of ground, by nature, as the result of the Fall, but still, before they
   have grown into rank luxuriance, you desire to choke the weeds with the
   rapid growth of Heaven's own corn. Your present occupation is to sow
   the children's minds. You are delighted when you see the seed spring up
   immediately, but where it tries your patience you still sow. When I had
   a little garden of my own and put in mustard and cress, I went the next
   morning to see if it was sprouting and was not satisfied to wait for
   the due season.

   I turned over the dirt and I dare say I prevented the growth of the
   seed by my haste. It is quite possible for teachers to commit the same
   folly by an unbelieving hurry--expecting to reap tomorrow what they
   have sown today. Immediate fruit may come, for God works marvelously,
   but whether it does or not, your plain duty is to sow. Reap you shall,
   but meanwhile you must be satisfied to go on sowing, sowing, sowing,
   even to the end. Reaping is your reward, but sowing is your work.
   Sowing, sowing, ever sowing till the hand is palsied in death and the
   seed basket is carried on another arm! Doing good by sowing the seed is
   your work.

   II. Now, secondly, it appears from the text that in your service YOU
   WILL MEET WITH EVILS common to Christian workers of all descriptions.
   You will especially be liable to weariness and faintness. Take the
   first word as it stands in our version--you will be tempted to grow
   weary. Hard work, this teaching children! Some good souls seem born to
   it--they do it splendidly and enjoy it. To others it is a stern labor.
   Some are by constitution exceedingly inept at it, but I do not think
   that they should excuse themselves by that fact, but should educate
   themselves into loving the work--many people around us are very inept
   at anything which would cause them to sweat--but we call them lazy and
   goad them on.

   It is no new thing for men to attempt to escape the army by pretending
   to be in bad health, but we must have none of this cowardly malingering
   in Christ's army--we must be ready for anything and everything! We must
   compel ourselves to duty when it goes against the grain. When it is a
   clear duty, obedience must master our aversion. I have no doubt,
   whatever, that teaching is, to some, very toilsome work, but then it
   has to be done, all the same. I delight to hear you speak, dear
   Brothers and Sisters, with holy enthusiasm for the privilege of
   teaching children and I fully believe in it! But I

   know, also, that it requires no small degree of self-denial on your
   part, self-denial for which the Church does not always give you due
   credit. To continue from Sunday to Sunday drilling some little Biblical
   knowledge into those noisy boys and trying to sober down those giddy
   girls is no light amusement or pretty pastime! It must be a toil and,
   therefore, it is not difficult to become weary.

   Teachers may the more readily tire because the work lasts on year after
   year. If you are all Sunday school teachers I am very happy to perceive
   so many gray and bald heads among you. It looks well. I admire the
   veterans of your army! There ought to be an "Old Guard" as well as new
   regiments. Why leave this work to young beginners? Did not David say,
   "Come, you children, hearken unto me, and I will teach you the fear of
   the Lord," when he was in the prime of life? Why, then, do so many
   cease to teach when they are best qualified to do so? Have not many
   aged persons a gentleness and an impressiveness which peculiarly
   qualify them to arrest the attention of the young? As they know more by
   experience than most of us, should they not be all the readier to
   impart instruction?

   It was always my delight to sit at my grandfather's feet when he told
   of his experiences of the Grace of God. When he was 80 years old or
   more, his witness to the faithfulness of God was worth going many miles
   to hear! There are scores of aged men and women whose life story ought
   to be often told among children. With their loving ways and cheerful
   manners they would be an acquisition to any school for the children's
   sake--while to the teachers their weight and wisdom would be an
   incalculable benefit! Die in harness, my Brothers and Sisters, if your
   mental and physical vigor will permit! Still, the long round of many
   years' labor must tend to make the worker weary--and the more so if the
   work is allowed to become monotonous--as it certainly is in some
   schools.

   You go to the same dingy room and sit on the same chair before the same
   class of boys. It is true the boys are not the same boys, for though
   the proverb says, "Boys will be boys," I find that they will not be
   boys, but that they will be men--but still, one boy is so much like
   another boy that the class seems to be always the same. The lessons
   vary but the Truth is the same and the work of teaching is like the
   sowing of seed--very much the same thing over and over again. Lovers of
   change will hardly find, in regular Sunday school work, a field for
   their fickleness. The text says, "Be not weary." Come, Brother, are you
   tired out? How long have you been teaching? A thousand years? You smile
   and I smile, too, and say--do not be weary with any period of service
   short of that!

   Our Lord deserves a whole eternity to be spent in His praise and we
   hope so to spend it! And, therefore, let us not be weary with the few
   years which constitute the ordinary life of man. I find the Greek word
   contains the idea of being "disheartened." "Let us not lose heart."
   This is a soul-weariness against which we must resolutely fight. It
   comes to many good workers and shows itself in different ways. Some
   think the work less important than they did at first. Others fear that
   their part of it will prove an utter failure. This is heart-weariness.
   When a Sunday school is going down--when there are not so many children
   as in former years, or, what is equally bad--when there are not enough
   teachers, the poor superintendent falls into great anxiety and the
   teachers at the teachers' meetings are not in the best of spirits.

   By the way, I am not sure that you teachers always edify one another at
   those meetings, or that you always have the Spirit of God among you. I
   have heard otherwise, sometimes, and yet I cannot blame you, for I have
   heard of Church meetings, too, which have not been "like a little
   Heaven below," nor would I say of them, "I have been there and still
   would go." When the condition of the school is disorder and decline,
   the best of teachers become discouraged and weary. At such times, good
   teachers hardly know how to go to their work at all, for there is not
   that loving spirit in the school which renders it a happy
   family--neither is there that power in prayer which secures the great
   Father's Presence and, therefore, many become distressed and tire of
   the service.

   Now comes in my text, "Be not weary in doing good." Pluck up courage!
   Do not be a coward! Hope on, hope always! Work on, even though the task
   becomes more and more trying to you. Do not despise your vocation, nor
   stay your hand, be not weary in doing good! Our text next speaks of our
   fainting. The original word has at its base the idea of being loosened.
   There is a girding up of the loins which means work and there is a
   loosening, not merely of garments, but of sinews, which means that the
   man will do no more. Some Sunday school teachers get, as the saying is,
   upon the loose. They display an utter lack of energy--they are
   unstrung. They do not teach their classes with all their heart, soul
   and strength--they get through in a "slipshod" fashion--like a man
   trudging along with loosened sandals.

   They teach, but put no honest work into it--their heart is no longer
   bound to the altar. The school work is performed in routine fashion and
   it might almost as well have been left alone. I have seen a man at work
   in such a sleepy

   style that I have been ready to cry out, "Dear me! Dear me! I cannot
   endure to see such crawling and creeping! Stand away! Give me your
   tools and let me have a turn at it!" And even so might one feel the
   same about certain teachers. A chapter is read and remarks made upon it
   which cost neither thought nor reading. Hymns are sung without the
   slightest sign of life and prayer offered without heart. A living
   Sunday school teacher standing by has been ready to weep to see how the
   children become indifferent because the teacher is trifling.

   There must be life, force, fire, heart, energy and intensity put into
   your service or it will be valueless! Dear Friends, do not fall into a
   loose state! You shall bind your sheaves, soon, if you do not become
   loose in your own minds. You shall reap if you do not become languid
   and lethargic. How is it that we ever fall into that state? What are
   the excuses that we make for ourselves when we faint? At times we are
   tempted to give it all up. We feel that there is no good being done
   and, therefore, we cannot hold on any longer. What makes us talk so? Is
   it not the old Adam--our carnal nature? Should we not mortify him and
   say, "Now, old Adam, you want me to give up the Sunday school and I
   shall refuse to do so for that very reason"?

   My idle flesh is saying to me, "Take things a little more leisurely. Do
   not take extra work upon yourself." Ah, Flesh, proud Flesh! If I bow to
   you I shall reap corruption! What a horrible thing it is, that reaping
   of corruption! The very word seems to swarm with living and moving
   abominations--its meaning is intensely abhorrent to the pure mind. We
   must at once reply, "No, Flesh, I cannot bow to you and reap corruption
   and, therefore, you must be denied. I shall mortify you and continue
   with my class at the school. I had thought of giving it up, but I will
   not indulge you so much. By God's Grace I will persevere."

   Do you not think that, at times, our getting lax in Christian work
   arises from our being very low in Grace? As a rule, you cannot get out
   of a man that which is not in him. You cannot go forth, yourself, to
   your class and do your work vigorously if you have lost inward vigor.
   You cannot minister before the Lord with the unction of the Holy One if
   that unction is not upon you. If you are not living near to God and in
   the power of God, then the power of God will not go forth through you
   to the children in your care! Therefore I think we should judge, when
   we become discontented and down-hearted, that we are out of sorts
   spiritually. Let us say to ourselves, "Come, my Soul! What ails you?
   This faint heart is a sign that you are out of health. Go to the Great
   Physician and obtain from Him a tonic which shall brace you! Come, play
   the man! Have none of these whims! Away with your idleness! The reaping
   time will come, therefore thrust in the plow."

   Is not another reason why we become down-hearted to be found in the
   coldness and indifference of our fellow Christians? We see others doing
   the Lord's work carelessly and when we are all on fire, ourselves, we
   find them to be cold as ice. We get among people in the Church who do
   not seem to care whether the souls of the children are saved or not and
   thus we are apt to be discouraged. The idleness of others should be an
   argument for our being more diligent ourselves. If our Master's work is
   suffering at the hands of our fellow servants, should we not try to do
   twice as much, ourselves, to make up for their deficiencies? Ought not
   the laggards to be warnings to us lest we, also, come into the same
   lukewarm condition? To argue that I ought to be a sluggard because
   others loiter is poor logic.

   Sometimes, too--I am ashamed to mention it--I have heard of teachers
   becoming weary from lack of being appreciated. Their work has not been
   sufficiently noticed by the pastor and praised by the superintendent.
   Sufficient notice has not been taken of them and their class by their
   fellow teachers. I will not say much about this cause of faintness
   because it is so small an affair that it is quite below a Christian.
   Appreciation! Do we expect it in this world? The Jewish nation despised
   and rejected their King and even if we were as holy as the Lord Jesus
   we might still fail to be rightly judged and properly esteemed. What
   does it matter? If God accepts us, we need not be dismayed though all
   should pass us

   by.

   Perhaps, however, the work itself may suggest to us a little more
   excuse for being weary. It is hard work to sow on the highway and
   amidst the thorns--hard work to be casting good seed upon the rock,
   year after year. Well, if I had done so for many years and was enabled
   by the Holy Spirit, I would say to myself, "I shall not give up my work
   because I have not yet received a recompense in it. I perceive that in
   the Lord's parable three sowings did not succeed and yet the one piece
   of good ground paid for all! Perhaps I have gone through my three
   unsuccessful sowings and now is my time to enjoy my fourth, in which
   the seed will fall upon good ground."

   It is a pity, dear Brother, when you have had some years of rough work,
   to give it all up. Why, now you are going to enjoy the sweets of your
   former labor! It would be a pity, my dear Sister, just when you have
   mastered your class and prepared the way for a blessing, for you to run
   away from it! There is so much less difficulty for you to overcome now
   that you already overcome so much! He who has passed so many miles of a
   rough voyage will not have to go over those miles again--do not let him
   think of going back! To go back, indeed, in this pilgrimage would be
   shameful--and as we have no armor for our backs--it would be dangerous.
   Putting our hand to this plow and looking back will prove that we were
   unworthy of the kingdom!

   If there are a hundred reasons for giving up your work of faith, there
   are 50,000 for going on with it! Though there are many arguments for
   fainting, there are far more arguments for persevering. Though we might
   be weary and do sometimes feel so, let us wait upon the Lord and renew
   our strength and we shall mount up with wings as eagles, forget our
   weariness and be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might!

   III. That observation brings me to the last part of my subject which is
   that WE HAVE ABUNDANT ENCOURAGEMENT in the prospect of reward which is
   afforded in the text, "In due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
   The first remark upon that promise shall be that reaping time will
   come. Our chief business is to glorify God by teaching His Truth
   whether souls are saved or not. But still, I object to the statement
   that we may go on preaching the Gospel for years and years and even all
   our lifetime and yet no result may follow. They say, "Paul may preach
   and Apollos may water, but God gives the increase." I should like them
   to find that passage in the Bible. In my English Bible it runs thus--
   "I, (Paul), have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase."
   There is not the slightest intent to teach us that when Paul planted
   and Apollos watered God would arbitrarily refuse the increase!

   All the Glory is claimed for the Lord, but honest labor is not
   despised. I do not say that there is the same relation between teaching
   the Truth of God and conversion as there is between cause and effect so
   that they are invariably connected. But I will maintain that it is the
   rule of the kingdom that they should be connected through the power of
   the Holy Spirit. Some causes will not produce effects because certain
   obstacles intervene to prevent. A person may teach the Gospel in a bad
   spirit--that would spoil it. A person may teach only part of the Gospel
   and He may put that the wrong way upwards. God may bless it somewhat,
   but yet the good man may greatly retard the blessing by the mistaken
   manner in which he delivers the Truth.

   Take it as a rule that the Truth of God prayed over, spoken in the fear
   of the Lord and with the Holy Spirit dwelling in the man who speaks it,
   will produce the effect which is natural to it. As the rain climbs not
   up to the skies and the snow flakes never take to themselves wings to
   rise to Heaven, so neither shall the Word of God return unto Him void
   but it shall accomplish that which He pleases. We have not spent our
   strength in vain. Not a verse taught to a little girl, nor a text
   dropped into the ear of a careless boy, nor an earnest warning given to
   an obdurate young sinner, nor a loving farewell to one of the senior
   girls shall be without some result or other to the Glory of God! And,
   taking it all together as a whole, though this handful of seed may be
   eaten of the birds and that other seed may die on the hard rock, yet,
   as a whole, the seed shall spring up in sufficient abundance to
   plentifully reward the sower and the giver of the seed!

   We know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord! I do not come into
   this pulpit with any fear that I shall preach in vain. It does not
   occur to me that such a thing can happen! I thought so once, when I
   thought more of myself than now--but now I am assured that if I speak
   out God's message in the best way I can--and with much prayer leave it
   all with God, He will take care of it! I expect to see people
   converted--not because there is any good in them, but because the Lord
   works as He pleases and will call whom He pleases and will give to His
   own Truth victory and honor. Go to your classes with this persuasion,
   "I shall not labor in vain, or spend my strength for nothing."
   "According to your faith, so is it unto you." Take a little measure and
   you shall have it filled with the manna of success, but take a great
   omer and in its fullness you shall have abundance! Believe in the power
   of the Truth you preach! Believe in the power of Christ about whom you
   speak! Believe in the Omnipotence of the Holy Spirit whose help you
   have invoked in earnest prayer! Go to your sowing and count upon
   reaping!

   I want to call your particular attention to a word in the text which is
   very full of encouragement. "Let us not be weary, for we shall reap."
   We shall reap. Dear Brothers and Sisters, we shall reap. It is not, "We
   shall do the work and our successors shall reap after we are gone." We
   ought to be very pleased, even with that, and no doubt such is often
   the case. But we shall reap, too. Yes, I shall have my sheaves and you
   will have yours. The plot which I have toiled and wept

   over shall yield me my sheaves of harvest and I shall personally gather
   them. I shall reap. "I never thought much of myself as a teacher," says
   one, "I always fear that I am hardly competent and I notice that the
   superintendent has only trusted me with the little children. But I am
   so glad to hear that I shall reap. I shall reap! I shall have a dear
   little one, saved in the Lord, to be my portion!"

   I pray you, dear Friends, if you have never reaped yet, begin to hope.
   You teachers who are always punctual, I mean--of course, if you do not
   come on time, you do not care whether you reap or not. But I speak to
   punctual teachers. I speak, also, to earnest teachers--for if you are
   not earnest you will never reap. You punctual, earnest, prayerful
   teachers shall reap! Some teachers do not go in for reaping and they
   will not enjoy it. But I am speaking now to real, hard-working, earnest
   Sunday school teachers who give their hearts to it and yet have seen no
   results. According to the text, you shall reap! Come, my persevering
   comrades, let us not be discouraged--"In due season we shall reap,"
   even we! You shall have your share with others. Though you feel as
   though you must give it up, you shall yet reap! After sowing all this
   while, do not cease from labor when reaping time is so near!

   It I were a farmer, if I gave up my farm, it should be before I sowed
   my wheat. If I had done all the plowing and the sowing, I should not
   say to my landlord, "There are six weeks and then comes harvest, but I
   desire to let another tenant come in." No, no! I would want to stop and
   see the harvest gathered and the wheat taken to market! I would want to
   have my reward. So, dear Brothers and Sisters, wait for your
   recompense, specially you that have been discouraged-- "In due time we
   shall reap, if we faint not." We who have thought least of our service
   and, perhaps, have exercised least faith and endured most searchings of
   heart and most groaning and crying before the Lord, we, also, "in due
   season, shall reap if we faint not."

   This harvest will come "in due season." There is even among men a due
   season for a reward. They say, "He is a bad paymaster who pays
   beforehand." So he is. You must always keep a little in hand for
   Saturday night, or you may miss your man before the week is ended.
   Sometimes our Lord keeps back His people's reward that they may have
   something cheerful on before them, something, also, to try their mettle
   and to bring out all their powers. I like to see a brave man driven
   into a corner, baffled and defeated--and yet resolved to overcome--then
   his true heroism comes out. Hear him say, "I have been working that
   ragged school for months, but I make no impression upon the young
   roughs. There is a disturbance and disorder almost every night. I do
   not know what to do. I am at my wit's end--but there is one thing I
   know--if it is to be done it shall be done. In the name of God I will
   continue at work till a change is effected."

   There you see the man strengthened by the Holy Spirit to labor! That is
   the man who will find out how to tame the Arabs! He the man who will
   draw teachers round him and build up a noble school. Our true manhood
   often lies deep and needs to be pursued into its den and stirred into
   action. When once it is thoroughly awakened, it is grand to see it leap
   forth in passionate earnestness to achieve its purpose. I love to hear
   a man say, "This is impossible to men, but God will enable me." This is
   the triumph of faith and blessed is he that believes, for the due
   season of reaping is near for him! The due season is often when you are
   in a right state--when your faith has been tried, when your resolve has
   become fixed, when you are down on your face before God in prayer--when
   you are emptied out and have no strength of your own but go to God and
   cry to Him, alone, for help, then your due season will come! The due
   season for harvest is not the day after sowing the seed, but we must
   wait awhile and not be weary. The harvest will come as the Lord
   appoints. As all fruits are the sweeter for being in season, so is the
   reward of Christian service when it comes in God's time.

   Now, lastly, when this reward comes, it will abundantly repay us. What
   is the reward of Sunday school teachers? Taking you, beloved Brothers
   and Sisters, on a broad scale, I would say that your reward lies
   chiefly in seeing the conversion of your children. There are a great
   many very excellent manuals upon the management of Sunday schools and I
   hope you will read them all and dwell with special attention upon the
   prize essays until your school is order, itself. Still I have heard of
   beautifully managed schools from which there are very few conversions.
   Order may be Heaven's first law, but it is not Heaven's first
   objective. Order is very desirable in a garden, but fruit is the main
   purpose.

   I know a school which is generally in a muddle, but yet children are
   saved in it continually. I wish it were more orderly, but yet I do not
   fret much about it so long as the grand result is gained. You may form
   so many rules and orders that you may rule your hearts out of your
   work--mind you, do not fall into that error! Your great business is to
   have those children saved--systematically if you can--but saved. You
   must have those children convicted of sin by the Holy Spirit and led to
   Christ. You must not be satisfied to trim off your Sunday school in the
   neatest style unless there is real

   fruit unto the Lord. And what shall I say? What reward can equal the
   conversion of these young immortals? Is it not the highest joy that we
   can enjoy on earth, next to communion with our Lord, to see these
   little ones saved?

   Taking the Sunday school, however, on a broad scale, I think your
   reward partly lies in rearing up a generation of worship-loving people.
   We cannot get at the great masses of London, do what we may. We shall
   open this house next Sunday night to all comers, but who will come? The
   great mass of them will be persons who have always gone to the house of
   prayer, but only a few of the outsiders will enter. Go into what
   evangelistic assembly you may, you will soon detect, from the manner of
   the singing, that the bulk of the people have been accustomed to sacred
   song. We do not know how to get at the great tens of thousands--but you
   do. You reach them while they are little and you send them home to sing
   their hymns to their fathers who will not come and sing them here.

   They go and tell their mothers all about Jesus so that the children of
   London are the missionaries of our city! They are Christ's heralds to
   the families where ministers would be totally shut out! You are
   training them up and if you do this work well, (and I charge you to
   look well to the connecting link between your senior classes and the
   Church), if you do this work well we shall require more places of
   worship and more earnest ministers, for the people of London will take
   to coming to the house of prayer! When that day arrives there will be a
   grand time for the preachers of the Word. In some villages of England
   and especially in Scotland, you will scarcely find a single person
   absent when the House of God is open! They all go to the Kirk, or to
   the meeting house!

   Alas, it is not so in London! We have hundreds of thousands who forget
   the Sabbath. We have, I fear, more than a million of our fellow
   citizens who go so seldom to a place of worship that they may be said
   to be habitually absent. It will be a grand thing if you can change all
   this and give us Church-going millions! And then, I believe, Brothers
   and Sisters, that to you there will be another reward, namely, that of
   saturating the whole population with religious Truths of God. All
   children are now to be taught to read. Shall they read so as to grow up
   highwaymen and thieves, or shall they read so as to become servants of
   the living God? Very much of that must depend upon you. You will, in
   due subordination to all other objectives, take care to introduce your
   children to interesting but sound literature. Your boys must read and
   if you are the teacher of a boy who reads "Jack Sheppard," you will be
   sadly to blame if he continues to delight in such an abomination!

   I trust that your leaven will leaven the whole lump of our
   country--that you will be the means of improving the moral tone of
   society--and as generation follows generation I trust we shall see a
   nation bright with religious knowledge, devout with religious thought
   and in all things exalted by justice and the Truth of God. What an army
   you are here tonight! May your Captain come into the midst of you and,
   as He reviews you, may He cast a look of love into the heart of every
   one of you and cheer you and send you away invigorated!

   I am delighted to have had the opportunity of speaking this word to
   you, feeble though it is, for God may make it powerful by His Spirit.
   Go, Beloved, and train the children well! You have undertaken the
   work--be faithful in the discharge of it. It is worth doing well, for
   so much depends upon it. If you do it badly, the results will accuse
   you throughout eternity! Go and teach with all your heart, soul and
   might. Be not weary! Be not slack! Your reaping time is coming. The
   next generation will, even more than the present, show what you have
   been doing! And the next and the next will each more fully declare it
   till this blessed island, first gem of the sea, shall shine as a very
   priceless jewel in the diadem of Christ!

A Round of Delights

   (No. 1384)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 11, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now the God of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that
   you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit." Romans
   15:13.

   THIS is one of the richest passages in the Word of God. It is so full
   of instruction that I cannot hope to bring out even so much as a tenth
   of its teaching. The Apostle desired that the Roman Christians might be
   in the most delightful state of mind, that they should be filled with
   joy and peace and that this should lead on to yet further expectations
   and create an abundance of hope in their souls. See, dear Friends, the
   value of prayer, for if Paul longs to see his friends attain the
   highest possible condition, he prays for them! What will prayer not do?
   Whatever you desire for yourself or for another, let your desire be
   prepared like sweet spices and compounded into a supplication--then
   present it to God and the benediction will come.

   I gather, also, from Paul's making this state of happiness a subject of
   request unto God, that it is possible for it to be attained. We may be
   filled with joy and peace in believing and may abound in hope! There is
   no reason why we should hang our heads and live in perpetual doubt. We
   may not only be somewhat comforted, but we may be full of joy! We may
   not only have occasional quiet, but we may dwell in peace and delight
   ourselves in the abundance of it. These great privileges are
   attainable, or the Apostle would not have made them the subjects of
   prayer. Yes, and they are possible for us, as the meaning of the
   Epistle to the Romans was not exclusively for the Romans, so this text
   belongs to us, also. The words still rise to Heaven as the prayer of
   the Apostle for us, upon whom the ends of the earth are come, that we,
   also, may be filled with joy and peace and abound in hope through the
   Holy Spirit.

   The sweetest delights are still grown in Zion's gardens and are to be
   enjoyed by us--and shall they be within our reach and not be grasped?
   Shall a life of joy and peace be attainable and shall we miss it
   through unbelief? God forbid! Let us, as Believers, resolve that
   whatever privilege is to be enjoyed we will enjoy--whatever lofty
   experience is to be realized, we will, by God's gracious help, ascend
   to it, for we wish to know to the fullest the things which are freely
   given to us of God. Not, however, in our own strength will we thus
   resolve, for this condition of faith, joy and peace must be worked in
   us by God alone.

   This is clear enough in the text, for it is the God of Hope who, alone,
   can fill us with joy and peace. And yet again, our hope which is to
   abound will only abound through the power of the Holy Spirit. The fact
   that the happy condition described is sought by prayer is a plain
   evidence that the blessing comes from a Divine source and the prayer
   itself is so worded that the doctrine is prominently presented to the
   mind. So, Brothers and Sisters, while we resolve to obtain everything
   of privilege that is obtainable, let us set about our efforts in Divine
   power, not depending upon our resolutions, but looking for the power of
   the Holy Spirit and the energy of the God of Hope.

   I shall need you to follow me while I notice, concerning the blessed
   state of fullness of joy and peace, first, from where it comes.
   Secondly, what it is, taking its delights in detail. And then, thirdly,
   what it leads to. We are to be filled with joy and peace that, "we may
   abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit."

   I. If there is, then, such a condition as being divinely filled with
   all joy and peace in believing, FROM WHERE DOES IT COME? The answer is,
   it comes from "the God of Hope." But in order that we may see how it
   comes, let us look a little at the chapter in which we find our text,
   for the connection is instructive. To know joy and peace through
   believing, we must begin by knowing what is to be believed--and this we
   must learn from Holy Scripture, for there God is revealed as the God of
   Hope. Unless God had revealed Himself, we could not have guessed at
   hope, but the Scriptures of Truth are windows of hope to us.

   Will you kindly read the 4th verse of the chapter and note how
   strikingly parallel it is to our text--"For whatever things were
   written before, were written for our learning, that we, through
   patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope." See, then, the
   God of Hope is revealed in Scripture with the design of inspiring us
   with hope! If we would be filled with faith, joy and peace, it must be
   by believing the Truths of God set forth in the Scriptures. Before we
   have any inward ground of hope, God Himself, as revealed in the Bible,
   must be our hope. We must not ask for joy, first, and then found our
   faith upon it, but our joy must grow out of our faith--and that must
   rest only upon God.

   Our Apostle sets us an example of how to use the Scriptures, for in
   this chapter he searches out the Truth from Moses, David and Isaiah,
   and then places one text with another and gets a clear view of the
   testimony of God. What is very much to our point, he sees in those
   Scriptures that to us Gentiles, God has of old been set forth in the
   Scriptures as the God of Hope. Before it seemed as if salvation were of
   the Jews and of the Jews, alone, and we were shut out. But now, on
   turning to the Old Testament itself, we discover that God had spoken
   good things concerning us before we knew Him. There was always hope for
   the Gentiles--and though Israel perceived it not--Patriarchs and kings
   and Prophets full often spoke words which could not be interpreted
   otherwise.

   "In you and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed"
   is a promise which leaped over the bounds of Canaan! As, then, by
   searching, the Apostle found in the Word of God hope for the Gentiles,
   so will the most heavy laden and burdened spirit discover sources of
   consolation if the Bible is diligently read and faithfully believed.
   Every promise is meant to inspire the Believer with hope--therefore use
   it to that end. Use the written Word as the source of comfort and do
   not look for dreams, excitements, impressions or feelings. Faith deals
   with the Scriptures and with the God of Hope as therein revealed and
   out of these it draws its fullness of joy and peace. Beloved, if you
   desire to get faith in Christ, or to increase it, be diligent in
   knowing and understanding the Gospel of your salvation as set forth in
   the Word of God.

   "Faith comes by hearing," or by reading the Word of God. How shall you
   believe that which you do not know? Do not, at once, make an effort to
   believe before you are instructed. First know what God has revealed.
   See how He has displayed to you the hope of everlasting life and then
   believe with all your heart the testimony of God. Every promise and
   Word of God must be to you a foundation most sure and steadfast whereon
   to build your hope. Let your anchor grasp and hold to each revealed
   Truth of God, whatever your feelings may be.

   We begin, then, by saying that fullness of joy and peace comes to us
   from the God of Hope as He reveals Himself in Holy Scriptures. As it is
   written, "Hear, and your soul shall live," so do we find that we must
   hear if our soul is to rejoice. Now, it so happens that the Scriptures
   were not only written that the Gentiles might have hope, but that they
   might have joy. I ask you to notice the passages quoted by the Apostle,
   for at least the last three of them call us to joy. Thus in verse 10,
   Moses says, " Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His people." If there is any
   joy for the elect nation, it is for us, also, who believe. If there is
   any joy for Israel, redeemed out of Egypt, led through the Red Sea, fed
   with manna and brought to the borders of Canaan, that joy is for us,
   also!

   If there is any joy for the Jews over the burnt offering. If any joy at
   the paschal supper. If any delight at the Jubilee. All that joy may be
   shared by us, for thus says the Lord, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His
   people." Joy in their joy! Again, David says (verse 11), "Praise the
   Lord, all you Gentiles; and laud Him, all you people." Now, where there
   is praise, there is joy, for joy is a component element of it! They
   that praise the Lord aright, rejoice before Him. Go, you Gentiles, when
   David bids you, and unite with Israel in praising God! He bids you take
   full possession of the joy which moves the favored nation to magnify
   the Lord!

   Again, Isaiah says, "There shall be a root of Jesse, and He that shall
   rise to reign over the Gentiles; in Him shall the Gentiles trust," or,
   as it should be translated, "hope." Now, hope is ever the source ofjoy!
   So, then, in the Scriptures we see God is the God of Hope. And on
   further search we see that the hope of the Gentiles permits them to
   rejoice with His people. In fact, we see that God Himself is the hope
   of all those who know Him--and the consequent source of joy and peace.
   Again, then, I am brought to this, that, to begin with, the joy and
   peace which we all desire to obtain must be sought through a knowledge
   of the God of Hope as He is revealed to us in the Scriptures. We must
   begin with that sure Word of testimony where we do well if we take heed
   as unto a light that shines in a dark place.

   There must be belief in God as revealed in the Word, even though as yet
   we see no change within ourselves, nor any conceivable internal ground
   in our nature for hope or joy! Blessed is he who has not seen and yet
   has believed--he who can hang upon God without the comfort of inward
   experience is on the high road to being filled with joy and peace! The

   Apostle, in the text, leads us through the Scriptures to God, Himself,
   who is personally to fill us with joy and peace, by which I understand
   that He is to become the great Object of our joy! As Israel in the Red
   Sea triumphed in the Lord, even so do we joy in God by our Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   Like David, we say, "Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my
   exceeding joy." And with Isaiah we sing, "I will greatly rejoice in the
   Lord; my soul shall be joyful in my God." When first the Lord looked
   upon us through the windows of His Word we began to hope. By-and-by His
   good Spirit caused our hoping to grow into believing. And since then,
   as our knowledge of the Lord has increased, our believing has risen to
   fullness of joy! Our God is a blessed God, so that to believe in Him is
   to find rest unto the soul and to commune with Him is to dwell in
   bliss! Beloved, when you think of God, the Just One, apart from Christ,
   you might well tremble, but when you see Him in Jesus, His very justice
   becomes precious to you as "the amazing crystal," and you learn to
   build it into the foundation of your joy!

   The holiness of God, which before awed you, becomes supremely
   attractive when you see it revealed in the Person of Jesus Christ your
   Lord! How charming is "the glory of God in the face of Christ." As for
   the love of God, as you see it set forth in this Book and in His Son,
   it inspires you with every sacred passion. As for His eternal
   Immutability, it becomes the groundwork of your peace, for if He
   changes not, then all His promises will stand sure to you and to all
   His people from generation to generation. His power, which was once so
   terrible in the thunder and in the storm, now becomes delightful to you
   as you see it yoked to the promise that the promise may be fulfilled
   and behold it concentrated in the Man, Christ Jesus, that His purposes
   may be achieved.

   In fact, there is no attribute of God, there is no purpose of God,
   there is no deed of God, there is no aspect under which God is seen,
   but what becomes the object of the Christian's joy when he has seen Him
   and believed in Him as revealed in the Scriptures! To the Believer, God
   is his sun, his shield, his portion, his delight, his all! His soul
   delights herself in the Lord. At first he hoped in God that, perhaps,
   He would smile upon him. He turned to the Scriptures and he found,
   there, many a cheering declaration and these he knew to be true and,
   therefore, he believed God that He would do as He had said! And now not
   only has his hope become faith, but his faith has budded and blossomed
   and brought forth the almonds of joy and peace.

   You see, then, how the Lord is the Author of all our holy gladness. Our
   God is, however, called the God of Hope, not only because He is the
   Object of our hope and the ground of our joy and peace, but because He
   it is that works hope and joy in us. No joy is worth having unless the
   Lord is the beginning and the end of it. And no joy is worth receiving
   unless it springs from hope in Him. He must breathe peace upon us, or
   else the storm-tossed waters of our spirit will never rest--nor is it
   desirable that they should--for peace without God is stupefaction, joy
   without God is madness and hope without God is presumption!

   In true Believers their hope, faith, joy and peace are all of Divine
   workmanship. Our spiritual raiment is never homespun--we are Divinely
   arrayed from head to foot. This blessed name of "God of Hope" belongs
   to the New Testament and is a truly Gospel title. Livy tells us that
   the Romans had a god of hope, but he says that the temple was struck by
   lightning and in a later book he adds that it was burned to the ground.
   Exceedingly typical this is of whatever hope can come to nations which
   worship gods of their own making. All idol hopes must perish beneath
   the wrath of the Most High! The god of unenlightened human nature is
   only sufficiently enlightened to discover its sin and is the God of
   Terror! In fact, to many, the Lord is the God of Despair.

   But when you turn to the Revelation of God in Scripture, you find Him
   to be a God whose gracious Character inspires hope and from then on you
   turn away from everything else to fix your hope on God alone. "My soul,
   wait you only upon God, for my expectation is from Him." God, in Christ
   Jesus, has ceased to be the dread of men and has become their hope! Our
   Father and our Friend, we look for all to You! And, blessed be God, the
   hope which He excites is a hope worthy of Him! It is a God-like hope--a
   hope which helps us to purify ourselves. At first we hope in God for
   cleansing from every sin and then for acceptance here and hereafter. We
   hope for pardon through the Atonement which is in Christ Jesus and when
   we have it, we hope for sanctification by the Spirit.

   Our hope never ceases to rise higher and higher and to receive
   fulfillment after fulfillment--and we know that it shall continue to do
   so till we rise to dwell at His right hand forever and ever. He who
   grasps this hope has a soul-satisfying portion for which a man might
   well be content to suffer a thousand martyrdoms if he might but abide
   in it! It is a hope which only God could have contrived for man--a hope
   founded in Himself--a hope presented to the sons of

   men in Christ Jesus because His sacrifice has been presented and
   accepted. It is a hope which God alone can inspire in men, for even if
   they hear the Gospel they do not find hope till He comes in power to
   their souls! It is a hope which always adores God and lies low at His
   feet, never dreaming of being independent of Him. It is a hope which
   lays her crown at His feet and takes Him to be her Lord forever and
   ever. This is the hope which is the mother of our joy and peace--and
   only as it is worked in us by the Lord can we be truly happy and
   restful.

   II. Secondly, let us enquire, WHAT IS THIS BLESSED STATE OF MIND of
   which we have spoken a little? Let us look into the words. He says,
   "That the God of Hope may fill you with all joy and peace in
   believing." This is a state of mind most pleasant, for to be filled
   with joy is a rare delight, reminding one of Heaven. It is, however, a
   state as safe as it is pleasant, for the man who has the joy which God
   gives him may be quite easy in the enjoyment of it. The best of the
   world's joy is but for a season--while you are enjoying it you fear it
   will soon be over--and what then? Earth's best candles will soon burn
   out. The day of this world's mirth will end in a night of misery!

   These thoughts mar and sour all fleeting joys. But the joy which God
   gives has no afterthought about it. It is wholesome and safe and
   abiding. We may drink our full without being sickened, yes, revel in it
   without worry. At the same time it is most profitable joy, for the more
   a man has of this joy the better man he will be. It will not soften him
   and render him effeminate, for it has a singular strengthening power
   about it. There is, doubtless, a tonic influence in sorrow, but holy
   joy is, also, exceedingly invigorating, for it is written, "The joy of
   the Lord is your strength." The more happy we can be in our God, the
   more thoroughly will the will of Christ be fulfilled in us, for He
   desired that our joy might be full.

   The more you rejoice in God, the more you will recommend true religion.
   The more full of delight you are, especially in trying times, the more
   you will glorify God! Few things are at the same time both pleasant and
   profitable, but holy joy and peace possess that double excellence.
   Fullness of spiritual joy is both the index and the means of spiritual
   strength. I commend this state, therefore, to you! I trust that we
   shall not be so unbelieving as to be afraid of Heaven's own
   consolations, nor so unreasonable as to decline to be filled with joy
   and peace when they may be had by believing.

   Now, notice, that it is a state which has varieties in it. It is joy
   and peace--and it may be either. Sometimes the Believer is full of joy.
   Joy is active and expressive. It sparkles and flashes like a diamond.
   It sings and dances like David before the Ark. To be filled with holy
   joy is a delicious excitement of the sweetest kind! May you often
   experience it until strangers are compelled to infer that the Lord has
   done great things for you! Nevertheless, the flesh is weak and might
   hardly endure continuous delight and so there comes a relief, in the
   lovely form of peace, in which the heart is really joyous but after a
   calm and quiet manner.

   I have seen the ringers make the pinnacles of a Church tower reel to
   and fro while they have made the joy bells sound out to the fullest.
   And then they have played quietly and let the fabric settle down again.
   Even thus does joy strain the man, but peace comes in to give him rest.
   In this peace there is not much to exhilarate, not much which could
   fittingly be spoken out in song--but silence, full of infinite
   meaning--becomes the floodgate of the soul. You seek not the exulting
   assembly, but the calm shade and the quiet chamber. You are as happy as
   you were in your joy, but not so stirred and moved. Peace is resting
   joy--joy is dancing peace! Joy cries hosanna before the Well-Beloved,
   but peace leans her head on His bosom.

   In the midst of bereavements and sickness we may scarcely be able to
   rejoice, but we may be at peace. When faith cannot break through a
   troop with her sacred joy, she stands still and sees the salvation of
   God in hallowed peace. We work with joy and rest with peace. What a
   blessing it is that when we come to die, if we cannot depart with the
   banners of triumphant joy all flying in the breeze, we can yet fall
   asleep safely in the arms of peace. How pleasant a life do they lead
   who are not the subjects of any great excitement, but maintain calm and
   quiet communion with God. Their heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.
   They neither soar nor sink, but keep the even tenor of their way.

   It is a state of mind, then, which admits of variations, and I really
   do not know which to choose out of its two forms. I should not like to
   be without joy and yet I think there is something so solid about peace
   that I might almost give it the preference. I think I love the quiet
   sister the better of the two. That famous text in Isaiah--"They shall
   mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; and
   they shall walk and not faint" looks somewhat like an anti-climax. It
   would appear to place the greatest, first, and then the less--and then
   the least--but it is not so. The mounting up

   with wings as eagles must always be more or less temporary--we are not
   eagles and cannot always be on the wing. The Lord renews our strength
   like the eagles and this shows we are not always up to the eagle's
   mark.

   Well, though it is a grand thing to be able to fly, it is a better
   thing to be able to run! This is more like a man, involves less danger
   and is more practically useful. It is good to run, but even that is not
   the best journey pace! It is best of all to walk, for this is a steady,
   persevering pace in which to move. "Enoch walked with God." This is
   God's pace, who even when He makes clouds, His chariot is described as
   walking upon the wings of the wind. We read of the walk of faith and
   the walk of holiness, for walking is practical and is meant for every
   day. You young people, I like to see you run and I am glad to take a
   turn at it myself, but, after all, steady, sober, unwearied walking is
   the best. To walk without fainting is a high experimental attainment
   and is none the less valuable because at first sight there seems
   nothing striking about it. Walking is the emblem of peace and running
   and mounting up with wings as eagles are the emblems of joy.

   But, Beloved, this blessed state is, also, a compound, for we are bid
   at one and the same time to receive both wine and milk--wine
   exhilarating with joy and milk satisfying with peace. "You shall go out
   with joy, and be led forth with peace." You shall lie down in the green
   pastures of delight and be led by the still waters of quietness. Our
   heart may be as an ocean, gloriously casting upward its spray of joy
   and lifting up its waves on high in delight, as one claps his hands for
   joy. And yet, at the same time, as down deep in the coral caverns all
   is still and undisturbed, so may the heart be quiet as a sleeping babe.
   We see no difficulty in understanding both lines of the hymn--

   "My heart is resting, O my God, I will give thanks and sing."

   We rest and praise--as trees hold to the earth by their roots and
   perfume the air with their blooms--as morning comes without the sound
   of a trumpet and yet awakens the music of birds by its arising. Ours is
   no froth of joy--there is solid peace beneath our effervescence of
   delight. Happy are we to have learned how to combine two such choice
   things--

   "Joy is a fruit that will not grow

   In nature's barren soil.

   All we can boast, till Christ we know,

   Is vanity and toil.

   But where the Lord has planted Grace, And made His glories known, These
   fruits of heavenlyjoy and peace Are found, and there alone."

   Now, I need you to lay stress on the next observation I am about to
   make because I began with it and wish to leave it upon your minds as
   the chief thought. The joy and peace here spoken of are through
   believing. You come to know the God of Hope through the Scriptures
   which reveal Him. By this you are led to believe in Him and it is
   through that believing that you become filled with joy and peace!

   It is not by working, nor by feeling that we become full of joy! Our
   peace does not arise from the marks, evidences and experiences which
   testify to us that we are the sons of God, but simply from believing.
   Our central joy and peace must always come to us, not as an inference
   from the internal work of the Spirit in our souls, but from the
   finished work of the Lord Jesus and the promises of God contained in
   the Scriptures. We must continue to look out of self to the written
   Word wherein the Lord is set forth before us. And we must rest in God
   in Christ Jesus as the main basis of our hope--not depending upon any
   other arguments than those supplied by the Bible, itself. I will show,
   by-and-by, how we shall afterwards reach to a hope which flows out of
   the work of the Spirit within us, but at the first, and, I think,
   permanently and continuously, the main ground of the surest joy and
   truest peace must come to us through simply believing in Jesus Christ.

   Beloved, I know that I have been converted, for I am sure that there is
   a change of heart in me. Nevertheless, my hope of eternal life does not
   hang upon the inward fact. I rest in the external fact that God has
   revealed Himself in Jesus as blotting out the sin of all His believing
   people, and, as a Believer, I have the Word of God as my guarantee of
   forgiveness. This is my rest! Because I am a Believer in Christ Jesus,
   therefore I have hope, therefore I have joy and peace, since God has
   declared that, "He that believes in Him has everlasting life." This joy
   can only safely come through believing and I pray, Brothers and
   Sisters, you never drift away from child-like faith in what God has
   said! It is very easy to obtain a

   temporary joy and peace through your present easy experience, but how
   will you do when all things within take a troublous turn?

   Those who live by feeling change with the weather! If you ever put
   aside your faith in the finished work to drink from the cup of your own
   inward sensations, you will find yourself bitterly disappointed. Your
   honey will turn to gall, your sunshine into blackness--for all things
   which come of man are fickle and deceptive. The God of Hope will fill
   you with joy and peace, but it will only be through believing! You will
   still have to stand as a poor sinner at the foot of the Cross, trusting
   to the complete Atonement. You will never have joy and peace unless you
   do. If you once begin to say, "I am a saint, there is something good in
   me," and so on, you will find joy evaporate and peace depart. Hold on
   to your believing!

   Come back to the text, again, and you will find that this joy and
   peace, according to Paul, are of a superlative character, for, after
   his manner, Paul makes language for himself. He often manufactures a
   superlative by the use of the word "all," as here, "Fill you with all
   joy." He means with the best and highest degree of joy! He means with
   as much joy as you can hold--with the very choicest and most full of
   joys in earth or in Heaven. God give you the joy of joys, the light of
   delight, the Heaven of Heaven! Then notice the comprehensiveness of his
   prayer. "All joy"--that is joy in God the Father's love, joy in God the
   Son's redeeming blood, joy in God the Holy Spirit's indwelling--joy in
   the Covenant of Grace, joy in the seal and witness of it, joy in the
   promises, joy in the decrees, joy in the doctrines, joy in the
   precepts, joy in everything which comes from God! "All joy." Paul also
   requests for them all peace--peace with God, peace of conscience, peace
   with one another, peace, even, with the outside world, as far as peace
   may be. May you all have it.

   And now observe the degree of joy and peace which he wishes for
   them--"that you may be filled"--and that by the God of Hope, Himself!
   God alone knows our capacity and where the vacuum lies which most needs
   filling. A man might try to fill us and fail, but God, who made us,
   knows every corner and cranny of our nature and can pour in joy and
   peace till every portion of our being is flooded, saturated and
   overflowed with delight! I like to remember David's words, "The rain,
   also, fills the pools," for even thus does the Lord pour His Grace upon
   the thirsty soil of our hearts till it stands in pools! As the sun
   fills the world with light and enters into all places, even so the God
   of Hope, by His Presence, lights up every part of our nature with the
   golden light of joyous peace till there is not a corner left for
   sadness or foreboding!

   This is Paul's prayer and he expects its answer to come to us through
   believing and in no other way. He does not ask for mysterious
   revelations, dreams, visions, or presumptuous persuasions. He seeks for
   us no excitement of fanaticism nor the intoxication of great crowds and
   pleasing oratory. Neither does he seek that we may imagine ourselves to
   be perfect and all that kind of lumber, but that we may be happy
   through simply believing in the God of Hope as He is set forth in the
   Bible! I take this Book of God into my hands and say, "Whatever things
   are written here were written for my learning, that through patience
   and comfort of the Scriptures I might have hope." I do have hope, for I
   believe this Book and now I feel joy and peace welling up within my
   soul! Brethren, receive this benediction! O Lord, fulfill it in the
   heart of every Believer before You!

   III. Now thirdly, WHAT DOES THIS LEAD TO? "Lead to?" asks one, "Lead
   to, why surely it is enough in itself. What more is needed?" When a man
   brings you into a chamber vaulted with diamonds and amethysts, and
   pearls and rubies--with walls composed of slabs of gold and the floor
   made of solid pavements of silver--we would be astonished if he said,
   "This is a passage to something richer, still." Yet the Apostle directs
   us to this fullness ofjoy and peace through believing that we may, by
   its means, reach to something else-- "that you may abound in hope
   through the power of the Holy Spirit." How often do great things in the
   Bible, like the perpetual cycles of Nature, begin where they end and
   end where they begin? If we begin with the God of Hope, we are wound up
   into holy joy and peace that we may come back to hope again and to
   abounding in it by the power of the Holy Spirit!

   First, I notice that the hope here mentioned arises, not out of pure
   believing, but out of the joy created in us by our having believed!
   Hope led to faith, faith to joy and now joy back, again, to hope. This
   is the story as far as I am concerned--I began with believing. I felt
   nothing good within me, but I believed in what God revealed concerning
   Himself. I saw nothing, but I believed on the ground that God said so.
   I soon had joy and peace in my soul as the result of my faith and now,
   because of this joy and peace, I hope and expect further blessings!
   Though still resting my soul upon the finished work of Jesus, yet hopes
   do arise from the work of the Holy Spirit within me! The God who has
   caused me,

   by believing, to rejoice that the past is all atoned for and who has
   given me peace because my sins are forgiven for His name's sake, will
   not dash that joy by revoking my pardon!

   He who has given me joy because He has quickened me and has, up to this
   day, preserved me, will not, I am persuaded, forsake me and suffer me
   to perish! Surely He will never leave me, after having done so much for
   me! My present joy gives me a hope, most sure and steadfast, that He
   will never turn His back upon me. If He did not intend to bless me in
   the future, He would not have done so much for me in the past--and He
   could not and would not be doing so much for me now. This hope, you
   perceive, drinks its life at the fountain of personal experience. The
   first hope we ever know comes together with our simply believing the
   Word of God. But now there arises in us an abounding of hope which is
   the outgrowth of the inward life. Fear is banished, now, for we have
   looked to the God of Hope and found acceptance in the Beloved.

   Now, therefore, in the chamber where Fear formerly dwelt, Hope takes up
   its residence--azure-winged, bright-eyed Hope makes its nest there and
   sings to us all the day long! The text speaks of an abounding hope and
   if you consider, for a while, you will see that very much hope must
   arise to a Christian out of his spiritual joy. If you have once been in
   the bosom of Jesus and known His joy, your hope will overflow! For
   instance, you will argue--He has pardoned my sins and made me to
   rejoice as a forgiven man--will He condemn me, after all? What does the
   pardon mean if, after all, the transgressions are to be laid upon me
   and I am to suffer for my sins?

   The Believer has great joy because God's love is shed abroad in his
   soul and he argues that if the Lord loves him so intensely now, He will
   not undergo a change and remove His love. He who in love redeemed me by
   the blood of His Son will love me eternally, for He changes not! Is not
   this a sound argument? Grace enjoyed is a pledge of Glory! Redeeming
   love is the guarantee of preserving love! Acceptance with God today
   creates a blessed hope of acceptance forever! Faith and joy within the
   soul sing to one another somewhat after this fashion--

   "His smiles ha ve freed my heart from pain,

   My drooping spirits cheered

   And will He not appear again

   Where He has once appeared?

   Has He not formed my soul anew,

   And caused my light to shine

   And will He now His work undo,

   Or break His Word Divine?"

   Perfectly assured of the Lord's goodness, the man confronts the future
   without fear and, in due time, approaches death without dismay. Since
   the Lord has begun to make us like His Son, we conclude that He will
   perfect His work and raise us from our graves in the full image of our
   Redeemer.

   He has already given us to know something of the joy of Christ who
   prayed that His joy might be fulfilled in us that our joy might be full
   and, therefore, we are sure that we shall bask in the joy of Heaven. We
   will, therefore, lie down in peace and rest when our last day on earth
   shall come, for we shall rise with Jesus--of this we have no doubt. We
   shall enter into the joy of the Lord, for we have entered into it
   already! Thus out of peace and joy there grow the noblest of human
   hopes. Little enjoyment, like a weak telescope, gives us but a faint
   prospect, but great enjoyment is an optic glass of marvelous power and
   brings great things near to us.

   Joy and peace are specimens of Heaven's felicities and set the soul
   both hoping and hungering. Having tasted of the grapes of Eshcol, we
   believe in the land which flows with milk and honey and long to rest
   under the branches which bear such luscious clusters! We have seen the
   Celestial City far away, but the light of it is so surpassing that we
   have longed to walk its golden streets, yes, and have felt sure of
   doing so before long! He who has seen a little of the light of the
   morning expects more eagerly the noonday. He who has waded into the
   river of joy up to the ankles, becomes eager to enter it still further
   till he finds it a river to swim in, "wherein the soul is borne along
   by a sacred current of unutterable delight."

   Up, you saints, to your Pisgah of joy, for there you shall have a full
   view of Canaan which stretches before you and is soon to be yours!
   Whatever your joy and peace may be now, you ought to see at once that
   they are meant to be only a platform from which you are to look for
   something brighter and better--you are filled with joy and peace that
   you may abound in hope! Our Apostle rightly adds, "by the power of the
   Holy Spirit," for I take it that this is partly mentioned

   by way of caution because there are hopes rising out of inward
   experience which may turn out to be fallacious and, therefore, we must
   discriminate between the hope of Nature and the hope of Grace.

   I have heard young people say, "I know I am saved, because I am so
   happy." Be not too sure of that. Many people think themselves very
   happy and yet they are not saved. The world has a happiness which is a
   fatal sign and a peace which is the token of spiritual death.
   Discernment, therefore, is needed, lest we mistake the calm before a
   storm for the rest which the Lord gives to those who come unto Him.
   Hope may arise out of our joy, but we must mind that we do not fix our
   confidence in it or we shall have a sandy foundation. The solid Grace
   of hope which abides and remains in the soul is born of faith through
   the Word of God!

   Let me begin again with you lest there should be any mistake. You hear
   of the God of Hope and are led to believe in God as He is revealed in
   Scripture. So far all is plain sailing. If you believe in the Christ of
   God, you obtain joy and peace, but these are results, not causes! You
   must not begin with your own joy and peace and say, "My hope of
   salvation is built upon the happiness I have felt of late." This will
   never do! Begin, first of all, with the Scriptures, not with your
   feelings or fancies, nor with your impressions and excitements--these
   will be ruinous as a foundation! Begin with God revealed in Christ
   Jesus as the God of Hope and let your joy and your peace come from your
   believing in Him!

   Then afterwards it will be fair enough to draw arguments for the
   abounding hope, but it must be by the Holy Spirit. That hope which is
   worth having, which springs from inward experience, must still be
   worked in us by the Holy Spirit and I will show you how it is natural
   that it should be so. We ask ourselves, "How shall I hold on to the
   end?" The answer will be suggested by another question, "How have I
   held on till now?" I feel, now, a joy and peace because my faith has
   been sustained until this day--how have I been preserved up to now? By
   the Holy Spirit! Then He is able to keep me to the end!

   I feel joy and peace, already, because in some measure sin is conquered
   in me. How will my soul be yet further sanctified and sin cast out of
   me? Why, by the same Holy Spirit who has already renewed me! I have had
   an earnest of what He can do and, therefore, I have an abounding of
   hope of what He will do. My joyful experience of His indwelling,
   comforting, illuminating and sanctifying power leads me into a full and
   confident assurance that He will carry on the work of Grace and present
   me complete at the Last Great Day. Beloved, go forward, keeping close
   to the groundwork of faith, and you will feel joy and peace in your
   hearts!

   Expect what you will. "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
   entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for
   them that love Him." Expect great things, expect things beyond all
   expectation! Your largest hopes shall all be exceeded! Hope and hope,
   and yet hope again, and each time hope more and more, but the Lord will
   give you more than you have hoped for! When you enter His palace gates
   at the last, you will say, "My imagination never conceived it! My
   desires never compassed it! My hope never expected it! The glory
   surpasses all! The tenth has not been told me of the things which God
   had provided for me!" "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say,
   rejoice." Amen.

Jesus Interceding For Transgressors

   (No. 1385)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 18, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And made intercession for the transgressors." Isaiah 53:12.

   Our blessed Lord made intercession for transgressors in so many words
   while He was being crucified, for He was heard to say, "Father, forgive
   them, for they know not what they do." It is generally thought that He
   uttered this prayer at the moment when the nails were piercing His
   hands and feet and the Roman soldiers were roughly performing their
   duty as executioners. At the very commencement of His passion He begins
   to bless His enemies with His prayers. As soon as the Rock of our
   salvation was smitten, there flowed forth from Him a blessed stream of
   intercession. Our Lord fixed His eyes upon that point in the character
   of His persecutors which was most favorable to them, namely, that they
   knew not what they did.

   He could not plead their innocence and, therefore, He pleaded their
   ignorance. Ignorance could not excuse their deed, but it did lighten
   their guilt and, therefore, our Lord was quick to mention it as in some
   measure an extenuating circumstance. The Roman soldiers, of course,
   knew nothing of His higher mission--they were the mere tools of those
   who were in power--and though they "mocked Him, coming to Him, and
   offering Him vinegar," they did so because they misunderstood His
   claims and regarded Him as a foolish rival of Caesar, only worthy to be
   ridiculed. No doubt the Savior included these rough Gentiles in His
   supplications. And perhaps their centurion who "glorified God, saying,
   Certainly this was a righteous Man," was converted in answer to our
   Lord's prayer.

   As for the Jews, though they had some measure of light, yet they, also,
   acted in the dark. Peter, who would not have flattered any man, yet
   said, "And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance you did it, as
   did, also, your rulers." It is doubtless true that, had they known,
   they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory, though it is equally
   clear that they ought to have known Him, for His credentials were clear
   as noonday! Our Redeemer, in that dying prayer of His, shows how quick
   He is to see anything which is, in any degree, favorable to the poor
   clients whose cause He has undertaken. He spied out in a moment the
   only fact upon which compassion could find a foothold and He secretly
   breathed out His loving heart in the cry, "Father, forgive them, for
   they know not what they do."

   Our great Advocate will be sure to plead wisely and efficiently on our
   behalf! He will urge every argument which can be discovered, for His
   eyes, quickened by love, will suffer nothing to pass which may be in
   our favor. The Prophet, however, does not, I suppose, intend to confine
   our thoughts to the one incident which is recorded by the Evangelists,
   for the intercession of Christ was an essential part of His entire
   lifework. The mountain's side often heard Him, beneath the chilly
   night, pouring out His heart in supplications. He might as fitly be
   called the Man of Prayers as, "the Man of Sorrows."

   He was always praying, even when His lips moved not. While He was
   teaching and working miracles by day, He was silently communing with
   God and making supplication for men. And His nights, instead of being
   spent in seeking restoration from His exhausting labors, were
   frequently occupied with intercession. Indeed, our Lord's whole life is
   a prayer! His career on earth was intercession worked out in actions.
   Since "He prays best who loves best," He was a mass of prayer, for He
   is altogether Love. He is not only the channel and the example of
   prayer, but He is the life and force of prayer. The greatest plea with
   God is Christ, Himself! The argument which always prevails with God is
   Christ Incarnate, Christ fulfilling the Law and Christ bearing the
   penalty.

   Jesus Himself is the reasoning and logic of prayer and He Himself is an
   ever living prayer unto the Most High. It was part of our Lord's
   official work to make intercession for the transgressors. He is a
   Priest and as such He brings His offering and presents prayer on behalf
   of the people. Our Lord is the Great High Priest of our profession and
   in fulfilling this office we read that He offered up prayers and
   supplications with strong cries and tears. And we know that He is now

   offering up prayers for the souls of men. This, indeed, is the great
   work which He is carrying on today. We rejoice in His finished work,
   and rest in it, but that relates to His atoning Sacrifice. His
   intercession springs out of His Atonement and it will never cease while
   the blood of His Sacrifice retains its power.

   The blood of sprinkling continues to speak better things than that of
   Abel. Jesus is pleading now and will be pleading till the heavens shall
   be no more. For all that come to God by Him He still presents His
   merits to the Father and pleads the causes of their souls. He urges the
   grand argument derived from His life and death and so obtains
   innumerable blessings for the rebellious sons of men.

   I. I have to direct your attention, this morning, to our ever-living
   Lord making intercession for the transgressors. And as I do so I shall
   pray God, in the first place, that all of us may be roused to
   admiration for His Grace. Come, Brothers and Sisters, gather up your
   scattered thoughts and meditate upon Him who alone was found fit to
   stand in the gap and turn away wrath by His pleading! If you will
   consider His intercession for transgressors, I think you will be struck
   with the love, tenderness and graciousness of His heart when you
   remember that He offered intercession verbally while He was standing in
   the midst of their sin.

   Sin heard of and sin seen are two very different things. We read of
   crimes in the newspapers, but we are not at all so horrified as if we
   had seen them for ourselves. Our Lord actually saw human sin--saw it
   unfettered and unrestrained-- saw it at its worst. Transgressors
   surrounded His Person and, by their sins, darted 10,000 arrows into His
   sacred heart--and yet while they pierced Him, He prayed for them! The
   mob compassed Him round about, yelling, "Crucify Him, crucify Him," and
   His answer was, "Father, forgive them." He knew their cruelty and
   ingratitude, and felt them most keenly, but answered them only with a
   prayer.

   The great ones of the earth were there, too, sneering and
   jesting--Pharisee and Sadducee and Herodian--He saw their selfishness,
   conceit, falsehood and bloodthirstiness, yet He prayed! Strong bulls of
   Bashan had beset Him round and dogs had compassed Him, yet He
   interceded for men! Man's sin had stirred up all its strength to slay
   God's Love and, therefore, sin had arrived at its worst point--and yet
   Mercy kept pace with Malice and outran it, for He sought forgiveness
   for His tormentors! After killing Prophets and other messengers, the
   wicked murderers were now saying, "This is the Heir! Come, let us kill
   Him that the inheritance may be ours." And yet that Heir of all things,
   who might have called fire from Heaven upon them, died crying, "Father,
   forgive them"!

   He knew that what they did was sin, or He would not have prayed,
   "forgive them," but yet He set their deed in the least unfavorable
   light and said, "they know not what they do." He set His own Sonship to
   work on their behalf and appealed to His Father's love to pardon them
   for His sake. Never was virtue set in so fair a frame! Never goodness
   came so adorned with abundant love as in the Person of the Lord
   Jesus--and yet they hated Him all the more for His loveliness and
   gathered around Him with the deeper spite because of His infinite
   goodness! He saw it all and felt the sin as you and I cannot feel it,
   for His heart was purer and, therefore, more tender than ours.

   He saw that the tendency of sin was to put Him to death and all like
   He, yes, and to slay God, Himself if it could achieve its purpose, for
   man had become a Deicide and must crucify his God--and yet, though His
   holy soul saw and loathed all this tendency and atrocity of
   transgression--He still made intercession for the transgressors! I do
   not know whether I convey my own idea, but to me it seems wonderful
   beyond measure that He should know sin so thoroughly, understand its
   heinousness, see the drift of it, feel it so wantonly assailing Him
   when He was doing nothing but deeds of kindness--and yet with all that
   vivid sense of the vileness of sin upon Him--even then and there He
   made intercession for the transgressors, saying, "Father, forgive them,
   for they know not what they do."

   Another point of His graciousness was clear on that occasion, namely,
   that He should thus intercede while in agony! It is marvelous that He
   should be able to call His mind away from His own pains to consider
   their transgressions. You and I, if we are subject to great pains of
   the body, do not find it easy to command our minds and especially to
   collect our thoughts and restrain them so as to forgive the person
   inflicting the pain and even to invoke blessings on his head! Remember
   that your Lord was suffering while He made intercession. He was
   beginning to suffer the pangs of death, suffering in soul as well as in
   body, for He had freshly come from the Garden where His soul was
   exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death.

   Yet in the midst of that depression of spirit which might well have
   made Him forgetful of the wretched beings who were putting Him to
   death, He forgets Himself and He only thinks of them and pleads for
   them! I am sure that we should

   have been taken up with our pains, even if we had not been moved to
   some measure of resentment against our tormentors. But we hear no
   complaints from our Lord, no accusations lodged with God, no angry
   replies to them such as Paul once gave--"God shall smite you, you
   whited wall!" Jesus uttered not even a word of mourning or of complaint
   concerning the indignities which He endured, but His dear heart all
   ascended to Heaven in that one blessed petition for His enemies, which
   then and there He presented to His Father.

   But I will not confine your thoughts to that incident, because, as I
   have already said, the Prophet's words had a wider range. To me it is
   marvelous that He, being pure, should plead for transgressors at all!
   For you and for me among them--let the wonder begin there. Sinners by
   nature, sinners by practice, willful sinners, sinners who cling to sin
   with a terrible tenacity, sinners who come back to sin after we have
   smarted for it--and yet the Just One has espoused our cause and has
   become a suitor for our pardon! We are sinners who omit duties when
   they are pleasures and who follow after sins which are known to involve
   sorrow. We are sinners, therefore, of the most foolish kind--wanton,
   willful sinners-- and yet He who hates all sin has deigned to take our
   part and plead the causes of our souls!

   Our Lord's hatred of sin is as great as His love to sinners. His
   indignation against everything impure is as great as that of the thrice
   holy God who revenges and is furious when He comes into contact with
   evil. And yet this Divine Prince, of whom we sing, "You love
   righteousness and hate wickedness," espouses the cause of transgressors
   and pleads for them! Oh, matchless Grace! Surely angels wonder at this
   stretch of condescending love! Brothers and Sisters, words fail me to
   speak of it. I ask you to adore!

   Further, it is to me a very wonderful fact that in His Glory He should
   still be pleading for sinners. There are some men who, when they have
   reached high positions, forget their former associates. They knew the
   poor and needy friend, once, for, as the proverb has it, poverty brings
   us strange bedfellows. But when they have risen out of such conditions,
   they are ashamed of the people whom once they knew. Our Lord is not
   thus forgetful of the degraded clients whose cause He espoused in the
   days of His humiliation. Yet though I know His constancy, I marvel and
   admire! The Son of Man on earth pleading for sinners is very gracious,
   but I am overwhelmed when I think of His interceding for sinners now
   that He reigns yonder where harps, unnumbered, tune His praise and
   cherubim and seraphim count it their glory to be less than nothing at
   His feet!

   I am amazed to think that where all the Glory of His Father is
   resplendent in Himself and He sits at the right hand of God in Divine
   favor and majesty unspeakable, He is still interceding for
   transgressors! How can we hear without amazement that the King of kings
   and Lord of lords occupies Himself with caring for
   transgressors--caring, indeed, for you and me?! It is condescension
   that He should commune with the blood-washed before His Throne and
   allow the perfect spirits to be His companions! But that His heart
   should steal away from all Heaven's joys to remember such poor
   creatures as we are and make incessant prayer on our behalf--this is
   like His own loving Self--it is Christ-like, Godlike!

   I think I see at this moment our great High Priest pleading before the
   Throne. He is wearing His jeweled breastplate and His garments of glory
   and beauty--wearing our names upon His breast and His shoulders in the
   Most Holy Place. What a vision of incomparable love! It is a fact and
   no mere dream. He is within the Holy of Holies, presenting the one
   sacrifice. His prayers are always heard and heard for us--but the
   marvel is that the Son of God should condescend to exercise such an
   office and make intercession for transgressors! This matchless Grace
   well near seals my lips, but it opens the floodgates of my soul and I
   would gladly pause to worship Him whom my words fail to set forth.

   Again, it is gloriously gracious that our Lord should continue to do
   this, for lo, these 1,800 years and more He has gone into His Glory,
   yet He has never ceased to make intercession for transgressors. Never
   on Heaven's most joyous holiday, when all His armies are marshaled and,
   as their glittering squadrons pass in review before the King of kings,
   has He forgotten His redeemed ones! The splendors of Heaven have not
   made Him indifferent to the sorrows of earth. Never, though, for all we
   know, He may have created myriads of worlds, and though assuredly He
   has been ruling the courses of the entire universe, never once, I say,
   has He suspended His incessant pleading for the transgressors!

   Nor will He, for the Holy Scriptures lead us to believe that as long as
   He lives as Mediator He will intercede--"He is able to save them to the
   uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever lives to make
   intercession for them." He lived and lives to intercede, as if this
   were the express objective of His living. Beloved, as long as the great
   Redeemer lives and there is a sinner still to come to Him, He will
   still continue to intercede! Oh, my Master, how shall I praise You? Had
   You undertaken such an office, now and then, and had You gone into the
   royal Presence only once in a while to intercede

   for some special cases, it would have been divinely gracious on Your
   part. But that You should always be a Suppliant and never cease to
   intercede, surpasses all our praise! Wonderful are His words as written
   in prophecy by Isaiah--"For Zion's sake will I not hold My peace, and
   for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof
   goes forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that
   burns."

   As the lamp in the temple never went out, so neither has our Advocate
   ceased to plead day nor night! Unwearied in His labor of love, without
   a pause, He has urged our case before the Father's face! Beloved, I
   will not enlarge. I cannot, for adoration of such love quite masters
   me! But let your hearts be enlarged with abounding love to such an
   Intercessor as this, who made, who does make and who will always make
   intercession for transgressors! I have said, "will make," and, indeed,
   this is no bare assertion of mine, for my text may be read in the
   future as well as in the past--indeed, as you will perceive upon a
   little thought--it must have been meant to be understood in the future
   since the prophecy was written some 700 years before our Lord had
   breathed His intercessory prayer at the Cross!

   Although the Prophet, in order to make his language pictorial and
   vivid, puts it in the past tense, it was actually in the future to him
   and, therefore, we cannot err in reading it in the future, as I have
   done--"He shall make intercession for the transgressors." Constant love
   puts up a ceaseless plan! Endless compassion breathes its endless
   prayer. Till the last of the redeemed has been gathered Home, that
   interceding breath shall never pause, nor cease to prevail!

   II. Thus have I called you to feel admiration for His Grace. And now,
   secondly, I do earnestly pray that we may be led of the Holy Spirit to
   view His intercession for transgressors as to put our confidence in
   Him. There is ground for a sinner's confidence in Christ and there is
   abundant argument for the Believer's complete reliance in Him from the
   fact of His perpetual intercession. Let me show you this, first,
   because, Beloved, His intercession succeeds. God hears Him, of that we
   have no doubt, but what is the basis of this intercession? For whatever
   that is, seeing it makes the intercession to be successful, we may
   safely rest on it.

   Read carefully the verse--"Because He has poured out His soul unto
   death: and He was numbered with the transgressors and He bore the sin
   of many." See, then, the success of His plea arises out of His
   Substitution. He pleads and prevails because He has borne the sin of
   those for whom He intercedes! The main stay and strength of His
   prevalence in His intercession lies in the completeness of the
   Sacrifice which He offered when He bore the sin of many. Come, then, my
   Soul, if Christ's prayer prevails because of this, so will your faith!
   Resting on the same Foundation, your faith will be equally secure of
   acceptance. Come, my Heart, rest on that Truth of God--"He bore the sin
   of many." Throw yourself with all your sin upon His substitution and
   feel that this is a safe resting place for your believing, because it
   is a solid basis for your Lord's intercession. The perfect Sacrifice
   will bear all the strain which can possibly come upon it--test it by
   the strongest faith and see for yourself! Plead it with the boldest
   requests and learn its boundless prevalence! You may urge the plea of
   the precious blood with the Father, seeing the Lord Jesus has urged it
   and has never failed.

   Now, again, there is reason for transgressors to come and trust in
   Jesus Christ, seeing He pleads for them. You never need be afraid that
   Christ will cast you out when you can hear Him pleading for you! If a
   son had been disobedient and had left his father's house and were to
   come back, again, if he had any fear about his father's receiving him,
   it would all disappear if he stood listening at the door and heard his
   father praying for him. "Oh," he would say, "my coming back is an
   answer to my father's prayers! He will gladly enough receive me."

   Whenever a soul comes to Christ it need have no hesitancy, seeing
   Christ has already prayed for it that it might be saved. I tell you
   transgressors, Christ prays for you when you do not pray for
   yourselves! Did He not say of His believing people, "Neither pray I for
   these, alone, but for them, also, which shall believe on Me through
   their word"? Before His elect become Believers they have a place in His
   supplications! Before you know yourselves to be transgressors and have
   any desire for pardon--while as yet you are lying dead in sin--His
   intercession has gone up even for such as you! "Father, forgive them,"
   was a prayer for those who had never sought forgiveness for themselves!
   And when you dare not pray for yourselves, He is still praying for you!
   When, under a sense of sin, you dare not lift so much as your eyes
   toward Heaven. When you think, "Surely it would be in vain for me to
   seek my heavenly Father's face," He is pleading for you!

   Yes, and when you cannot plead. When, through deep distress of mind you
   feel choked in the very attempt to pray. When the language of
   supplication seems to blister your lips because you feel yourself to be
   so unworthy. When you cannot force, even, a holy groan from your
   despairing heart--He still pleads for you! Oh, what encouragement this
   ought to give you! If you cannot pray, He can! And if you feel as if
   your prayers must be shut out, yet His intercession

   cannot be denied! Come and trust Him! Come and trust Him! He who pleads
   for you will not reject you--do not entertain so unkind a thought--but
   come and cast yourself upon Him. Has He not said, "Him that comes to Me
   I will in no wise cast out"? Venture upon the assured truth of that
   Word and you will be received into the abode of His love.

   I am sure, too that if Jesus Christ pleads for transgressors as
   transgressors, while as yet they have not begun to pray for themselves,
   He will be sure to hear them when they are, at last, led to pray. When
   the transgressor becomes a penitent. When he weeps because he has gone
   astray--let us be quite sure that the Lord of Mercy, who went after him
   in his sin, will come to meet him, now that he returns! There can be no
   doubt about that! I have known what it is to catch at this text when I
   have been heavy in heart. I have seen my sinfulness and I have been
   filled with distress, but I have blessed the Lord Jesus Christ that He
   makes intercession for the transgressors, for then I may venture to
   believe that He intercedes for me since I am a transgressor beyond all
   doubt.

   Then again, when my spirit has revived, and I have said, "But yet I am
   a child of God and I know I am born from above," then I have drawn a
   further inference--if He makes intercession for transgressors, then
   depend upon it--He is even more intent upon pleading for His own
   people! If He is heard for those who are out of the way, assuredly He
   will be heard for those who have returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop
   of their souls. For them, above all others, He will be sure to plead,
   for He lives to intercede for all who come unto God by Him! In order
   that our confidence may be increased, consider the effect of our Lord's
   intercession for transgressors. Remember, first, that many of the worst
   of transgressors have been preserved in life in answer to Christ's
   prayer.

   Had it not been for His pleading, they would have been dead long ago.
   You know the parable of the fig tree that cumbered the ground, bearing
   no fruit and impoverishing the soil? The master of the vineyard said,
   "Cut it down," but the vinedresser said, "Let it alone this year, also,
   till I shall dig about it and fertilize it: and if it bears fruit,
   well." Need I say who He is that stops the axe which, otherwise, had
   long ago been laid at the root of the barren tree? I tell you ungodly
   men and women that you owe your very lives to my Lord's interference on
   your behalf! You did not hear the intercession, but the great Owner of
   the vineyard heard it--and in answer to the gracious entreaties of His
   Son, He has let you live a little longer!

   Still, are you where the Gospel can come at you and where the Holy
   Spirit can renew you? Is there no ground for faith in this gracious
   fact? Can you not trust in Him through whose instrumentality you are
   yet alive? Say to your heavenly Father--

   "Lord, and am I yet alive, Not in torments, not in Hell! Still does
   Your good Spirit strive-- With the chief of sinners dwell?" I do not
   doubt but that between the prayer of Christ for His murderers and the
   outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, there was an intimate
   connection. As the prayer of Stephen brought Saul into the Church and
   made him an Apostle, so the prayer of Christ brought in 3,000 at
   Pentecost to become His disciples. The Spirit of God was given "to the
   rebellious, also," in answer to the pleading of our Lord!

   Now, it is a great blessing to have the Spirit of God given to the sons
   of men. And if this comes through Jesus' prayers, let us trust in Him,
   for what will not come if we rely upon His power? Upon sinners He will
   still display His power--they will be pricked in their hearts and will
   believe in Him whom they have pierced. It is through Christ's
   intercession that our poor prayers are accepted with God. John, in
   Revelation, saw another angel standing at the altar, having a golden
   censer, to whom there was given much incense that he should offer it
   with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before
   the Throne.

   From where did all the incense come? What is it but Jesus' merits? Our
   prayers are only accepted because of His prayers. If, then, the
   intercession of Christ for transgressors has made the prayers of
   transgressors to be accepted, let us, without wavering, put our trust
   in Him and let us show it by offering our supplications with a full
   assurance of faith and an unstaggering confidence in the promise of our
   Covenant God! Are not all the promises, yes and amen, in Christ Jesus?
   Let us remember Him and ask in faith, nothing wavering.

   It is through the prayers of Christ, too, that we are kept in the hour
   of temptation. Remember what He said to Peter, "I have prayed for you,
   that your faith fail not," when Satan desired to have him and sift him
   as wheat. "Father, keep them from the Evil One" is a part of our Lord's
   supplication--and His Father always hears Him! Well, if we are kept in

   the midst of temptation from being destroyed because Christ pleads for
   us, let us never fear to trust ourselves in His kind, careful hands! He
   can keep us, for He has kept us! If His prayers have delivered us out
   of the hands of Satan, His eternal power can bring us safely home
   though Death lies in the way. Indeed, it is because He pleads that we
   are saved at all! He is "able, also, to save them to the uttermost that
   come unto God by Him, seeing He ever lives to make intercession for

   them."

   This, also, is one grand reason why we are able to challenge all the
   accusations of the world and of the devil, for, "Who is he that
   condemns? It is Christ that died, yes, rather, that is risen again, who
   is even at the right hand of God, who, also, makes intercession for
   us." Satan's charges are all answered by our Advocate! He defends us at
   the Judgment Seat when we stand there like Joshua in filthy garments,
   accused by the devil and the verdict is always given in our favor--
   "Take away his filthy garments from him." Oh, you that would bring
   slanderous accusations against the saints of God, they will not damage
   us in the court of the great King, for, "if any man sins, we have an
   Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous."

   Think, my dear Brothers and Sisters, of what the intercession of Jesus
   has done, and you will clearly perceive great inducements to place your
   sole reliance in your Lord. You who have never trusted Him, will you,
   this very morning, begin to do so? Come, weary Heart, take the Lord
   Jesus to be your confidence--what more do you need? Can you desire a
   better Friend than He is, a more prevalent Advocate before the Throne?
   Come, leave all other trusts and yield yourselves to Him this morning!
   I pray you, accept this advice of love! And you, you saints, if you are
   foolish enough to have doubts and fears, come, see how Jesus pleads for
   you! Give Him your burden to bear, leave with Him your anxieties at
   this moment that He may care for you. He will carry your case before
   the Eternal Throne and carry it through to success!

   He who engages a solicitor to manage his legal business among men
   leaves his affairs in his hands. And he who has such a pleader before
   God as Christ Jesus, the Wonderful Counselor, has no need to torment
   himself with anxieties! Rather, let him rest in Jesus, and wait for the
   result with patience--

   "Give Him, my Soul,

   Your cause to plead,

   Nor doubt the Father's Grace." So much, then, for the duty of
   exercising confidence in Him. May the Holy Spirit fill you with faith
   and peace!

   III. And now, in the third place, I pray that our text may inspire us
   with the spirit of obedience to His example. I say obedience to His
   example, for I take the example of Christ to be an embodied precept as
   much binding upon us as His written commands. The life of Christ is a
   precept to those who profess to be His disciples. Now, Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ, may I put a few practical matters before you and
   will you endeavor, by the help of God's Spirit, to carry them

   out?

   First, then, your Lord makes intercession for the
   transgressors--therefore imitate Him by forgiving all transgressions
   against yourself. Have any offended you? Let the very recollection of
   the offense, as far as possible, pass from your minds, for none have
   ever injured you as men injured Him! Let me say as you, yourself, have
   injured Him! They have not nailed you to a cross, nor pierced your
   hands, feet and side. Yet, if He said, "Father, forgive them," well may
   you say the same. Ten thousand talents did you owe? Yet He forgave you
   all that debt, not without a grievous outlay to Himself--your brother
   owes you but a hundred pence--will you take him by the throat? Will you
   not, rather, freely forgive him even to 70 times seven?

   Can you not forgive him? If you find it to be impossible, I will not
   speak to you any longer as a Christian, because I must doubt if you are
   a Believer at all! The Lord cannot accept you while you are unforgiving
   since He, Himself, says, "Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar
   and there remember that your brother has anything against you; leave
   there your gift before the altar and go your way. First be reconciled
   to your brother and then come and offer your gift." If peace is not
   made, you will not be accepted! God does not hear those in whose hearts
   malice and enmity find a lodging! Yet I would speak to you in tones of
   love rather than with words of threats--as a follower of the gentle
   Christ, I beseech you imitate Him in this and you shall find rest and
   comfort for your soul.

   From the day in which Christ forgives you, rise to that nobility of
   character which finds pleasure in forgiving all offenses fully and
   frankly for Christ's sake. Surely, the Atonement which He offered, if
   it satisfied God, may well satisfy

   you and make amends for the sin of your brother against you as well as
   against the Lord! Jesus took upon Himself the transgressions of the
   second table of the Law, as well as of the first--and will you bring a
   suit against your brother for the sin which Jesus bore? Brothers and
   Sisters, you must forgive, for the blood has blotted out the record!
   Let these words of Scripture drop upon your hearts like gentle dew from
   Heaven--"Be you kind, one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one
   another, even as God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you."

   Next, imitate Christ, dear Friends, in pleading for yourselves. Since
   you are transgressors and you see that Jesus intercedes for
   transgressors, make bold to say, "If He pleads for such as I am, I will
   put in my humble petition and hope to be heard through Him. Since I
   hear Him cry, 'Father, forgive them,' I will humbly weep at His feet
   and try to mingle my faint and trembling plea with His all-prevalent
   supplication." When Jesus says, "Father, forgive them," it will be your
   wisdom to cry, "Father, forgive me!" Dear Hearer, that is the way to be
   saved! Let your prayers hang like the golden bells upon the skirts of
   the great High Priest! He will carry them within the veil and make them
   ring out sweetly there. As music borne on the breeze is heard afar, so
   shall your prayers have a Listener in Heaven because Jesus wafts them
   there. Since your prayers are feeble, yoke them to the Omnipotence of
   His intercession! Let His merits be as wings on which they may soar and
   His power as hands with which they may grasp the priceless blessings.

   What shall I say to those who refuse to pray when they have such an
   encouragement as the aid of Jesus? Tones of tenderness are suitable
   when addressing the ungodly when we would persuade them to pray. But if
   they refuse the intercession of Jesus Christ, Himself, then must we add
   our solemn warnings! If you perish, your blood is on your own heads--we
   must say, Amen, to your condemnation and bear witness that you deserve
   to be doubly punished! Rejecters of great mercy must expect great
   wrath. The intercession of your Savior, when refused, will be visited
   upon you most terribly in the day when He becomes your Judge.

   Let us imitate our Lord in a third point, dear Friends, namely, if we
   have been forgiven our transgressions, let us now intercede for
   transgressors, since Jesus does so. He is the great Example of all His
   disciples, and, if He makes it His constant business to supplicate for
   sinners, should not His people unite with Him? Therefore would I stir
   up your pure minds by way of remembrance to come together in your
   hundreds and in your thousands to pray. Never let our Prayer Meetings
   decline! Let us, as a Church, make intercession for transgressors and
   never rest from seeking the conversion of all around us. I trust that
   every day, so often as you bow the knee for yourselves, you will make
   intercession for the transgressors!

   Poor things, many of them are sinning against their own souls, but they
   know not what they do! They think to find pleasure in sin! In this,
   also, they know not what they do. They break the Sabbath. They despise
   the sanctuary. They reject Christ. They go downward to Hell with mirth,
   singing merry glees as if they were going to a wedding feast! They know
   not what they do! But you know what they are doing. By your
   humanity--scarcely shall I need to urge a stronger motive--I say, by
   mere humanity I beseech you, do all you can for these poor souls and
   especially pray for them! It is not much you are asked to do--you are
   not pointed to the Cross and bid to bleed there for sinners! You are
   but asked to make intercession.

   Intercession is an honorable service. It is an ennobling thing that a
   sinner like yourself should be allowed to entreat the King for others.
   If you could have permission to frequent the Queen's courts, you would
   not think it a hardship to be asked to present a petition for another.
   It would be a delight to be enjoyed, a privilege to be snatched at
   eagerly that you should be permitted to present requests for others.
   Oh, stand where Abraham stood and plead for sinners! Sodom could
   scarcely be worse than many portions of the world at this hour. Plead,
   then, with all your hearts! Plead again and again, and again with the
   Lord, though you are but dust and ashes--and cease not till the Lord
   says, "I have heard the petition. I will bless the city. I will save
   the millions and my Son shall be glorified."

   I have not quite done, for I have a further duty to speak of, and it is
   this. Let us take care, dear Friends, that if we do plead for others,
   we mix with it the doing of good to them, because it is not recorded
   that He made intercession for transgressors until it is first written,
   "He bore the sin of many." For us to pray for sinners without
   instructing them, without exerting ourselves to awaken them, or making
   any sacrifice for their conversion--without using any likely means for
   their impression and conviction--would be a piece of mere formality on
   our part. According to our ability, we must prove the sincerity of our
   petitions by our actions. Prayer without effort is falsehood--and that
   cannot be pleasing to God. Yield up yourselves to seek the good of
   others and then may you intercede with honest hearts.

   Lastly, if Christ appears in Heaven for us, let us be glad to appear on
   earth for Him. He acknowledges us before God and the holy angels--let
   us not be ashamed to confess Him before men and devils. If Christ
   pleads with God for men, let us not be backward to plead with men for
   God. If He, by His intercession, saves us to the uttermost, let us
   hasten to serve Him to the uttermost. If He spends eternity in
   intercession for us, let us spend our time in intercession for His
   cause. If He thinks of us, we ought, also, to think of His people and
   especially supplicate for His afflicted. If He watches our cases and
   adapts His prayers to our necessities, let us observe the needs of His
   people and plead for them with understanding.

   Alas, how soon do men weary of pleading for our Lord! If a whole day is
   set apart for prayer and the meeting is not carefully managed, it
   readily becomes a weariness of the flesh. Prayer Meetings very easily
   lose their flame and burn low. Shame on these laggard spirits and this
   heavy flesh of ours which needs to be pampered with liveliness and
   brevity or we go to sleep at our devotions! "Forever" is not too long
   for Him to plead and yet an hour tries us! On and on and on through all
   the ages His intercession rises to the Throne of God and yet we weaken
   and our prayers are half dead in a short season!

   Look, Moses lets his hands hang down and Amalek is defeating Joshua in
   the plain! Can we endure to be losing victories and causing the enemy
   to triumph? If our ministers are unsuccessful. If our laborers for
   Christ in foreign lands make little headway. If the work of Christ
   drags, is it not because in the secret place of intercession we have
   but little strength? The lack of prayer is the weakness of the Church!
   If we awakened ourselves to lay hold upon the Covenant Angel and
   resolutely cried, "I will not let You go, except You bless me," we
   should enrich ourselves and our age! If we used more of the strong
   reasons which make up the weapon of all-prayer, our victories would not
   be so few and far between!

   Our interceding Lord is hindered for lack of an interceding Church! The
   kingdom comes not because so little use is made of the Throne of Grace.
   Get to your knees, my Brothers and Sisters, for on your knees you
   conquer! Go to the Mercy Seat and remain there! What better argument
   can I use with you than this--Jesus is there--and if you desire His
   company you must ofttimes resort there. If you want to taste His
   dearest, sweetest love, do what He is doing--union of work will create
   a new communion of heart. Let us never be absent when praying men meet
   together! Let us make a point of frequenting assemblies gathered for
   prayer, even if we give up other occupations. While we live, let us be,
   above all things, men of prayer! And when we die, if nothing else can
   be said of us, may men give us this epitaph, which is, also, our Lord's
   memorial--"He made intercession for the transgressors." Amen.

Sins Of Ignorance

   (No. 1386)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 25, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And if a soul sins and commits any of these things which are forbidden
   to be done by the commandments of the Lord; though he knew it not, yet
   is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. And he shall bring a ram
   without blemish out of the flock, with your estimation, for a trespass
   offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for
   him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew it not, and it
   shall be forgiven him." Leviticus 5:17,18.

   IT is supposed in our text that men might commit forbidden things
   without knowing it. No, it is not merely supposed, but it is taken for
   granted and provided for. The Levitical law had special statutes for
   sins of ignorance and one of its sections begins with these words, "If
   a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of
   the Lord." If you will, at your leisure, read the 4th and 5th chapters
   of Leviticus, you will find, first of all, it is supposed that a priest
   may sin. They knew nothing of infallible priests and infallible popes
   under the Mosaic Law! It was known and recognized that priests might
   sin and sin through ignorance, too.

   "The priest's lips should keep knowledge," but as they were compassed
   with infirmities, they learned to have compassion on the ignorant by
   being made, themselves, conscious that they were not perfect in
   understanding. In the 4th chapter a sacrifice is prescribed for "the
   priest that is anointed, if he sins according to the sin of the
   people." The highest in office, who ought to be best read in the things
   of God, might, nevertheless, err through misunderstanding,
   forgetfulness, or ignorance. The priests were teachers, but they
   needed, also, to be taught. As Trapp says, "The sins of teachers are
   teachers of sins" and, therefore, they were not overlooked but had to
   be expiated by trespass offerings.

   Further on in the chapter it is supposed that a ruler may sin (see
   verse 22). A ruler should be thoroughly acquainted with the Law which
   he has to dispense, but yet he might not know every point and,
   therefore, might err. Therefore it is written, "When a ruler has
   sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the
   commandments of the Lord his God concerning things which should not be
   done, and is guilty. Or if his sin, wherein he has sinned, comes to his
   knowledge; he shall bring his offering." There existed no fiction among
   the Jews that the king can do no wrong-- however excellent his
   intentions, he might be misinformed upon the Divine Law and so fall
   into error. Errors in leaders are apt to breed mischief and, therefore,
   they were to be repented of and put away by an expiatory sacrifice.

   It was, also, according to the Law, regarded as very likely that any
   man might fall into sins of ignorance, for in chapter four, verse 27,
   we read, "And if any one of the common people sins through ignorance,
   while he does somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord."
   The sin even of the most common person was not to be winked at and
   passed over as a mere trifle, even though he could plead ignorance of
   the Law! It was not to be said, "Oh, he is quite an insignificant
   person and he did it in ignorance and, therefore, there is no need to
   take any note of it." No, on the contrary, he was, also, to bring his
   trespass offering that the priest might make an atonement for him.
   Ignorance was common enough among the common people, but it did not
   constitute a license for them, nor screen them from guilt.

   But we need not, dear Friends, go to these Scripture references, for we
   are well assured by our own observation and the verdict of our own
   experience that sins of ignorance are possible, for we have often,
   ourselves, sinned in this fashion, and we have had to mourn deeply over
   the fact when we have been convinced of it. Very much in which we once
   allowed ourselves we would not do again, for we see the evil of it,
   though once we judged it to be right enough. An enlightened conscience
   mourns over sins of ignorance which it would never do if they were
   innocent mistakes.

   The word rendered, "ignorance," may, also, bear the translation of
   inadvertence. Inadvertence is a kind of acted ignorance--a man
   frequently does wrong for lack of thought, through not considering the
   outcome of his actions--or

   even thinking at all. He carelessly and hastily blunders into the
   course which first suggests itself and errs because he did not think
   about whether or not it was right. There is very much sin of this kind
   committed every day. There is no intent to do wrong and yet wrong is
   done. Culpable neglect creates a thousand faults. "Evil is worked by
   lack of thought as well as lack of heart." Sins of inadvertence,
   therefore, are undoubtedly abundant among us and in these busy,
   thoughtless, railway days they are apt to increase.

   We do not take time enough to examine our actions! We do not take good
   heed to our steps. Life should be a careful work of art in which every
   single line and tint should be the fruit of study and thought, like the
   paintings of the great master who was apt to say, "I paint for
   eternity." But, alas, life is often slurred over like those hasty
   productions of the scene painter in which present effect, alone, is
   studied, and the canvas becomes a mere daub of colors hastily laid on.
   We seem intent to do much rather than to do well--we want to cover
   space rather than to reach perfection. This is not wise. O that every
   single thought were conformed to the will of God!

   Now, seeing that there are sins of ignorance and sins of inadvertence,
   what about them? Is there any actual guilt in them? In our text we have
   the Lord's mind and judgment--not that of the Church or of some eminent
   Divine--but of the Lord God Himself and, therefore, let me read it to
   you once again. "If a soul sins and commits any of these things which
   are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord; though he
   knew it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity." Sins of
   ignorance, then, are really sins needing atonement because they involve
   us in guilt! Yet let us clearly understand that they greatly differ in
   degree of guilt from known and willful sins.

   Our Lord teaches us this in the Gospels and our own conscience tells us
   that it must be so. The Savior puts it, "That servant, which knew his
   lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his
   will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did
   commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes." He
   who knew not his lord's will was less punished than the intentional
   offender, but he was still beaten--and beaten with stripes, of which a
   few will be far more than you and I may wish to bear! The fewest
   stripes that will come from the hand of justice will be enough to
   grievously afflict us!

   One stroke has made good men lie in the dust and moan in sorrow. Sins
   caused by ignorance are punished, for the Prophet says (Isaiah 5:13),
   "My people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge." And
   again in Hosea, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge." Paul,
   also, tells us, "the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven with His
   mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not
   God." These are to be punished, it seems, though their sinful ignorance
   is mentioned in the threat. Yes, and according to my text there is sin
   in ignorance, itself, for the 18th verse declares, "the priest shall
   make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred."

   Ignorance of the Law among those who dwelt in the camp of Israel was
   essentially sinful. The Israelite had no business to be ignorant. The
   Law was plain and within his reach. If he neglected to study the
   statute, his breach of the statute could not be excused by his neglect,
   seeing the neglect was, in itself, an act of omission of a censurable
   kind. Willful ignorance of the Lord's will is, in itself, sin, and the
   sin which comes of it is grievous in the sight of the Lord our God.
   Blessed be God, the solemn declaration of the text concerning the guilt
   of sins of ignorance needs not drive us to despair, for a sacrifice is
   permitted for it!

   The offender, on discovering his error, might bring his offering and
   pay the trespass money for any damage which he had caused by his
   action. And there was a promise given in connection with the atoning
   sacrifice which was, no doubt, often realized by the contrite in
   heart-- "It shall be forgiven him." Be it ours, this morning not to
   attempt excuses but to seek forgiveness! May the Spirit of God work in
   us a tender-hearted confession of that sin which we did not, before,
   know to be sin. And while we are confessing it, may the Divine Spirit
   apply the precious blood that we may have a sweet sense of pardon. May
   the Lord make us rejoice in the Truth of God that, "the blood of Jesus
   Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin."

   The teaching of my text does three things, of which I shall speak.
   First, by it the commandment is honored. Secondly, by it the conscience
   is enlightened. And thirdly, by it the Sacrifice is endeared.

   I. By the Divine declaration that sins of ignorance are really sins,
   THE COMMANDMENT OF GOD IS HONORED. I need not multiply words to prove
   it so. The Law of God is, by this solemn sentence, lifted into a place
   of dignity. If it is really so, that to break one of its precepts
   involves us in guilt, even if we did not know that we were offending,
   then is the Law, indeed, enthroned upon a terrible eminence and girt
   around with fire. Enlarging upon this

   thought I would observe, first, dear Friends, that hereby the Law is
   declared to be the supreme authority over men. The Law is supreme, not
   conscience.

   Conscience is differently enlightened in different men and the ultimate
   appeal as to right and wrong cannot be to your half-blinded conscience
   or to mine. I might condemn what you allow and you would scarcely
   tolerate what I approve--we are, neither of us, judges, but both
   culprits upon trial when we come under the Law. The ultimate appeal
   will be to, "Thus says the Lord"--to the Law itself, which is the only
   perfect standard by which the deeds and actions of men can be measured.
   The Law of God, from the supremacy into which this text lifts it, says
   to us, "You will not be excused because your conscience was
   unenlightened, nor because it was so perverse as to put bitter for
   sweet and sweet for bitter. My demands are the same in every jot and
   tittle, whatever your conscience may condemn or allow."

   Conscience has lost much of its sensitiveness through the Fall and
   through our actual sins, but the Law is not lowered to suit our
   perverted understanding. If we break the Law, although our conscience
   may not blame us, or even inform us of the wrong, the deed is still
   recorded against us--we must bear our iniquity. The Law is, also, set
   above human opinion, for this man says, "You may do that," and a second
   claims that he may do the other, but the Law changes not according to
   man's judgment and does not bend itself to the spirit of the age or the
   tastes of the period. It is the supreme judge, from whose Infallible
   decision there is no appeal. Right is right though all condemn, and
   wrong is wrong though all approve. The Law is the balance of the
   sanctuary, accurate to a hair, sensitive, even to the small dust of the
   balance.

   Opinions continually differ, but the Law of God is one and invariable.
   According to the moral sensitiveness of a man will be his estimate of
   the act which he performs, but would you have the Law of God vary
   according to man's fickle judgment? If you would desire such a thing,
   God's infinite wisdom forbids it. The Law is a fixed quantity, a
   settled standard and if we fall short of it, though we know it not, yet
   are we guilty and must bear our iniquity unless an atonement is made.
   This exalts the Law above the custom of nations and periods, for men
   are very apt to say, "It is true I did so-and-so, which I could not
   have defended in itself--but then, it is the way of the trade--other
   houses do so, general opinion and public consent have endorsed the
   custom. I do not, therefore, see how I can act differently from others,
   for if I did so, I should be very singular and should probably be a
   loser through my scruples."

   Yes, but the customs of men are not the standard of right! Where they
   have been, at first, correct through strong Christian influence, the
   tendency is for them to deteriorate and sink below the proper standard.
   Habit, perpetuity and universality of wrong at last enable men to call
   the false by the same name as the true--but there is no real change
   worked thereby--the customary wrong is still a wrong, the universal lie
   is still a falsehood. God's Law is not changed! Our Lord Jesus said,
   "It is easier for Heaven and earth to pass away than one tittle of the
   Law to fail." The Divine Law overrides custom, tradition and
   opinion--these have no more effect upon the eternal standard than the
   fall of a leaf upon the stars of Heaven.

   "If a man does any of these things which are forbidden to be done by
   the commandments of the Lord; though he knew it not, yet is he guilty."
   All the customs in the world cannot make wrong right! if everybody that
   ever lived from Adam down to this hour had done a wrong thing and
   declared it to be righteous, yet would it make no moral difference in
   the evil deed. A thousand ages of whitewashing cannot make a vice a
   virtue. God's commands stand fast forever and he who breaks it must
   bear his punishment. Thus you see that by the declaration of my text,
   the Law of God is enshrined in the place of reverence.

   Note again, if a sin of ignorance renders us guilty, what must a
   willful sin do? Do you not perceive at once how the Law is, again, set
   on high by this? For if an inadvertent transgression covers the soul
   with guilt which cannot be put away without a sacrifice, then what
   shall we say of those who knowingly and advisedly, with malice
   aforethought, break the commands of God? What shall we say of those
   who, again and again and again, being often reproved, harden their
   necks and go on in their iniquities? Surely their sin is exceedingly
   sinful! If I may become a transgressor by breaking a Law of God which I
   did not know, by what name shall I be called if, when I do know, I
   presumptuously lift up my hand to defy the Lawgiver and violate His
   statutes?

   Thus again, dear Friends, by the teaching of our text, men were driven
   to study the Law, for if they were at all right-hearted they said, "Let
   us know what God would have us do. We do not wish to be leaving His
   commands undone, or committing transgressions against His precepts
   through not knowing better." They would, therefore, run to the

   Prophets and other teachers and ask them, "Tell us, what are the
   statutes of the Law of God? What has Jehovah ordained?" And
   right-minded men would be led by a desire to obey, to become earnest
   students of the will of God, as I trust, beloved Friends, we, also,
   shall be moved to be. Lest we should break the Law through not knowing
   its commands, let us make it our continual study. Let us search it day
   and night! Let it be the man of our counsels and the guide of our
   lives.

   Let this be the prayer of each one of us--"What I know not, O my God,
   teach me. Make me to understand the way of Your precepts. Let me not be
   as the horse and the mule which have no understanding, but enlighten me
   in my inmost heart lest I ignorantly transgress Your commandments."
   Thus, you see, the Law was glorified in the midst of Israel and men
   were led to search it to know what the Lord required of them. A holy
   fear, lest they should inadvertently fall into sin, moved them to
   diligent reading of the commands. Thus they were often checked when
   about to perform a hasty deed, and were made to ask themselves, "What
   would the Lord have us do?"

   Without such an ordinance as our text, they might have acted hurriedly
   and so have sinned, and sinned again in the blundering haste of a
   thoughtless spirit. But by this they were checked in their
   heedlessness, called to consideration and made to have the fear of God
   always before them. They were thereby warned to look at their actions
   and examine their ways lest, through thoughtlessness, they should sin
   against the Law of God. And you will see at once, Beloved, that this
   would lead every earnest Israelite to teach his children God's Law,
   lest his sons should err through ignorance or inadvertence. The pious
   Jew carefully taught his children all things concerning the Passover
   and the yearly feasts, the daily sacrifice, the worship in the Temple
   and what was due to the service of God.

   He made him learn the moral Law and endeavored, as far as he could, to
   enlighten his conscience, knowing that "for the soul to be without
   knowledge is not good." He said to his son, "Take fast hold of
   instruction. Let her not go. Keep her, for she is your life." Without
   knowledge a man will fall into many pitfalls and snares which the true
   light would have enabled him to avoid. Good men, therefore, spent much
   of their time in training their families. "Come, children," they said,
   "hearken unto me. I will teach you the fear of the Lord." They were,
   also, zealous to make known the Law of God as far as they could, saying
   each one to his fellow, "Know the Lord." Fear of committing sins of
   ignorance was a spur to national education and tended greatly to make
   all Israel honor the Law of the Lord.

   I close these thoughts by noting that to me the sin-revealing power of
   the Law of God is wonderfully displayed as I read my text. I know the
   Law to be exceedingly broad. I know its eye to be like that of an eagle
   and I know its hand to be heavy as iron. But when I find that it
   accuses me of sins which I knew not, that it searches the secret parts
   of my soul and brings to light what my own eyes of self-examination
   have never seen, then I am filled with trembling! When I discover that
   I may stand before the bar of God charged with iniquities which I shall
   be quite unable to deny, but of which, at this moment, I am not at all
   conscious, then am I bowed in the dust! What a Law this must be! What a
   light is this in which our conduct is placed!

   If you set your character side by side with that of your fellow man,
   you may begin to compliment yourself. If you look at it by the dim
   candlelight of public opinion, you may begin to flatter yourself. If
   you go no further than a diligent search by the aid of your own
   judgment, you may still be somewhat at ease. But if the light in which
   we shall stand at last will be the light of Jehovah's own ineffable
   purity! If His Omniscience detects iniquity where we have not perceived
   it and if His justice will visit sin even where we were not cognizant
   of it, our position is solemn, indeed! What a Law this is by which men
   are bound! How severe and searching! How holy and how pure must God,
   Himself, be?

   O thrice holy Jehovah, we are filled with awe of You! The heavens are
   not clear in Your sight and You charged Your angels with folly! How,
   then, can we be just with You? After reading this, Your own Word, we
   see how justly You will charge us with folly and how impossible it is
   for us to hope to be justified in Your sight by any righteousness of
   our own! Thus, my Brothers and Sisters, we see that the Law of God is
   honored.

   II. Secondly, by the teaching of the text, THE CONSCIENCE IS AWAKENED.
   I feel, when I read these words, as if a great gulf opens at my feet!
   "If a soul sins and commits any of these things which are forbidden to
   be done by the commandments of the Lord; though he knew it not, yet is
   he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity." You know, dear Friend, that
   you are a willful sinner and have broken God's Law consciously. But if
   you may be a sinner though you knew it not, how the solid earth rolls
   away from under you as in a dreadful earthquake and, almost like Korah,
   Dathan and Abiram, you stand in dread as the devouring fire pours forth
   from the mysterious abyss!

   Nothing which is human can be thought certain after this. Think of the
   sins you may have committed--sins of thoughts which have too rapidly
   flitted through your mind for you remember them--thoughts which pass
   over your mind as mere imaginations, like clouds floating aloft in the
   sky which cast a flying shadow over the landscape and are gone. Think
   of your evil thoughts, your pleasure in hearing of uncleanness, your
   desires, wishes and excuses of evil-- these are all iniquities. Then,
   too, our words, our hurried words of anger, of falsehood, of petulance
   and pride. Our idle words, our murmuring words, our unbelieving words,
   our irreverent words--words scarcely meant which fell from us without
   thought! What a multitude of these may be laid at our door and all of
   them are full of sin!

   And actions in which we have excused ourselves very thoroughly because
   we have never looked at them in God's light, but have been content to
   regard them in the dim ray of custom--are there not many of these which
   contain sin? When I think of all the forms of evil, I am compelled to
   fear that much of our life may have been a continuous sin and yet we
   may have never condemned ourselves, or even thought about it! Remember
   that great command, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your
   heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all
   your strength." How far short of that you and I have come!

   Mentally we have not served God to perfection, neither have the
   affections loved Him with all possible intensity, nor has the soul,
   with its desires, gone after Him so eagerly as it should. Truly we are
   guilty, guilty much more than we have ever imagined! And as to that
   second Commandment, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself"--who
   among us has done so? Have we loved our fellow man with a love that
   even approximated to our love to ourselves? O God, amid the varied
   lights of Your Ten Commandments, all comprehended in the white light of
   that one word, "love," we stand convicted and we perceive that our
   ignorance affords no covering for us! We hear Your voice and tremble
   before it while You say, "Though he knew it not, yet is he guilty, and
   shall bear his iniquity."

   Our ignorance, dear Friends, is evidently very great. I do not suppose
   that the best instructed Christian here will claim to possess much
   wisdom. The usual rule is that the more we really know, the more
   conscious we are of the littleness of our knowledge. Our ignorance,
   therefore, I may take for granted all round, has been very great. What
   scope, then, has there been beneath the mantle of that mist of
   ignorance for sin to hide and multiply! As the conies swarm in the
   holes of the rocks, the bats in the sunless caves of the earth and the
   fish in the deep abysses of the sea, so do our sins swarm in the hidden
   parts of our nature. "Who can understand his errors? Cleanse me from
   secret faults!"

   The ignorance of very many persons is, to a large degree, willful. Many
   do not read the Bible at all, or very seldom, and then without desiring
   to know its meaning. Even some professing Christians take their
   religion from a monthly magazine, or from some standard book written by
   a human author and adopted by their sect--few go to the Word of God
   itself--they are content to drink of the muddied streams of human
   teaching instead of filling their cups at the crystal fountain of
   Revelation itself.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, if you are ignorant of anything concerning
   God's mind and will, it is not, in the case of any of you, for lack of
   the Bible, nor for lack of a willing guide to instruct you in it for,
   behold, the Holy Spirit waits to be gracious to you in this respect.
   "If any man lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives liberally, and
   upbraids not." If we do not know, we may know it. Our ignorance has
   been willful if, in this privileged country, we remain ignorant of the
   Gospel. Where there is confessedly such a mass of willful ignorance,
   who among us can imagine what myriads of evil shapes of sin swarm in
   the grim darkness? The Prince of Darkness holds his court in the
   blackness of that ignorance which we, ourselves, have willfully created
   by refusing to come to the Light of God.

   The enemy sows the seed of evil by night and amid Egyptian darkness the
   accursed grain grows to an awful ripeness and brings forth a
   hundred-fold! Break in, O eternal Light! Break in upon the dimness of
   our ignorance, lest it thickens into the eternal midnight of Hell! Now,
   it will be vain for any man to say in his mind, as I fear some will do,
   "God is harsh in thus dealing with us." If you say thus, O Man, I ask
   you to remember God's answer. Christ puts your rebellious speech into
   the mouth of the unfaithful one who hid his talent. He said, "I knew
   that you were an austere man, gathering where you had not sown."

   What did his master say? Instead of excusing him, which is far beneath
   the dignity of our great God to do, he took the man at his own
   confession and said, "You knew that I was an austere man, taking up
   that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow. Why, then, did
   you not put my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have
   required my own with interest?" If you know God to be harsh, or say you
   think so, then remember how earnest you ought to be to

   come up to His standard, for, call that standard what you like, it is
   the standard! Count it to be severe if you will, it is binding upon you
   for all that--and by it you will have to be tried, at the last, so that
   there is no escape for any of us by impeaching our Maker!

   Wiser, far, is it to submit and beg for mercy. Let us remember, in
   order that our doctrine may appear less strange, that it is according
   to the analogy of Nature that when God's Laws are broken, ignorance of
   those Laws should not prevent the penalty from falling upon the
   offenders. The natural law is an instructive type of the moral and
   spiritual Laws of God and from it we may gather much teaching. Here is
   the law of gravitation, by which objects are attracted to each other.
   It is inevitable that heavy matters will fall to the earth. A man
   thinks that he can fly--he puts on his wings and climbs to the top of a
   tower. He is fully persuaded that he is about to fly like a bird.
   Spectators are invited to behold the wonder and expectations are
   excited. The law of gravitation is against the inventor, but he does
   not think so. Poor man, he firmly believes in his ability to fly. But
   the moment he leaps from the tower he falls to the earth and is
   gathered up a mangled corpse.

   Why did not God suspend His natural law because the man did not
   intentionally violate it? No, the law is stern and changes not, and he
   who offends in ignorance pays the penalty. I have read that the Chinese
   at Peking often endure severe winters. They have coal just under them,
   but they refuse to dig the coal for fear they should disturb the
   equilibrium of the earth and cause the celestial empire, which is now
   at the top of the universe, to turn over to the bottom. The celestials
   are thoroughly conscientious in this belief, but does the weather alter
   to suit their philosophy? Does God make them warm in winter without
   coal? By no means! If they refuse the means of warmth, they will be
   cold--their ignorance does not raise the temperature so much as half a
   degree!

   A physician, with the best possible motive, endeavors to discover a new
   drug so that he may alleviate pain. In conducting his experiments, he
   inhales a deadly gas which he did not know to be fatal. He dies as
   surely as if he had willfully taken poison. The law is not suspended to
   reward his benevolence and avert the fatal result of his mistake.
   Whatever his motives may have been, he has broken a natural law and the
   appointed penalty is exacted of him. Truly, as it is in the natural so
   will you find it to be in the spiritual world!

   But let us go into the question a little, by way of argument. It is
   necessary that it should be according to this declaration. It is not
   possible that ignorance should be a justification of sin, for, first,
   if it did so, it would follow that the more ignorant a man was the more
   innocent he would be! It would then assuredly be true that ignorance is
   bliss, for perfect ignorance would be under no responsibilities and
   free from all sin! All that you and I would have to do, in order to be
   perfectly clear from all charges, would be to know nothing. To burn the
   Bible, refuse to hear the Gospel and rush away from civilization would
   be the nearest way to freedom from all guilt!

   Do you not see that if things were so, knowledge might be regarded as a
   curse and that the light which Christ comes to bring into the world
   would be a man's most solemn affliction if it shone upon him? I
   proclaim that, in my unregenerate state, if I had been sure that
   ignorance would have rid me of responsibility, I would have closed
   every avenue of knowledge and would have labored to abide in darkness!
   But such a supposition is not to be borne--it is inconsistent with the
   first principles of common sense! If, again, the guilt of an action
   depended entirely upon a man's knowledge, we should have no fixed
   standard at all by which to judge right and wrong! It would be variable
   according to the enlightenment of each man and there would be no
   ultimate and infallible court of appeal.

   Suppose the statute book of our own country should be constructed on
   the principle that in proportion only to a man's knowing the law should
   be his guilt in breaking it? We should have numbers of persons
   truthfully pleading ignorance and a great many more endeavoring to do
   so--and such a simple and easy method of obtaining acquittal would
   become popular at once! The art of forgetting would be diligently
   studied and ignorance would become an enviable inheritance. We would
   have gentlemen brought up for being drunk and disorderly who had paid
   40 shillings and costs a score of times, who would still say that they
   did not know that they could be punished again since they had paid the
   fine so often! Ignorance would be so continually pleaded that there
   would be practically an end of all law and the very foundations of the
   State would be undermined! The thing cannot be endured--it is absurd
   upon its very face.

   Moreover, ignorance of the Law of God is, itself a breach of the Law,
   since we are bid to know and remember it. Thus spoke the Lord by His
   servant Moses--"You shall lay up these, My Words, in your heart and in
   your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as
   frontlets between your eyes. And you shall teach them to your

   children, speaking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk
   by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. And you shall
   write them upon the doorposts of your house, and upon your gates."
   Knowledge of the Law was a duty and ignorance a crime.

   Can it be possible, then, that one sin is to be an excuse for another?
   It is a sin, on a man's part, to refuse to search into the Word of God.
   Can it be that because he commits this sin, he is to be excused for the
   faults into which his willful ignorance leads him? It is out of the
   question! If sins of ignorance are not sins, then Christ's intercession
   was altogether a superfluity. You remember that our text, last Sunday
   morning was, "He made intercession for the transgressors," and we
   illustrated it by the text, "Father, forgive them; for they know not
   what they do." But if there is no sin when a man does not know what he
   does, why did our Lord pray for pardon for ignorant transgressors? Why
   ask forgiveness, if there is no wrong? The correct way of putting it
   would have been, "Father, I do not ask You to forgive, for there is no
   offense, seeing that they know not what they do." But by the fact of
   His having pleaded for forgiveness, it is clearly proved that there is
   guilt in the sin of ignorance.

   The work of the Holy Spirit, too, would be an evil instead of a good
   work in the hearts of men if ignorance were an excuse for sin, for He
   has come to convict the world of sin. But if unconvicted of sin they
   are innocent of sin, why convict them of it? Of what use is it to
   quicken a conscience and to enlighten it and make it bleed over a
   transgression if it would be no transgression, provided that conscience
   had never been made cognizant of it? Who is he that shall so blaspheme
   the Holy Spirit as to say that His work is needless and even idle? Sins
   of ignorance, therefore, must be sinful! Look at one other consequence
   which would follow from the contrary doctrine.

   The more wicked a man is, the more hardened he becomes and the more
   ignorant he grows as to the beauty of holiness. Everybody knows that. A
   sin which troubles a child when at home with his godly father will not
   trouble him at all when he gets to be 50 years of age, provided he has
   indulged in a course of vice. From one sin to another the man descends,
   and, as he descends, his mental and moral eyes grow dim and he
   perceives less and less the sinfulness of sin. If a man who has arrived
   at the utmost pitch of infamy can commit any atrocity without the
   smallest idea of its being wrong--if he can cheat, lie, swear and I
   know not what and yet call it all nothing and wipe his mouth--if that
   man is guilty of less sin because of the growing deadness of his
   conscience and the limited degree of his spiritual knowledge, then,
   truly, things are turned upside down!

   But it is not so. The test of the guilt of an action is not a man's
   conscience, nor his perception of evil, nor his knowledge, but the Law
   itself! Sin is a transgression of the Law of God, whether that Law is
   known or unknown. The statute stands immovable and immutable--and the
   sinner, blind though he may be--if he falls upon it shall be broken.
   Once again, I am sure that many of us now present must have felt the
   truth of this in our own hearts. You who love the Lord and hate
   unrighteousness, must, in your lives have come to a point of greater
   illumination where you have said, "I see a certain action to be wrong.
   I have been doing it for years, but God knows I would not have done it
   if I had thought it wrong. Even now I see that other people are doing
   it and thinking it right, but I cannot do so any more. My conscience
   has, at last, received new light and I must make a change at once."

   In such circumstances, did it ever come to your mind to say, "What I
   have done was not wrong because I did not know it to be wrong"? Far
   from it! You have justly said to yourself, "My sin in this matter is
   not so great as if I had transgressed willfully with my eyes open,
   knowing it to be sin." But yet you have accused yourself of the fault
   and mourned over it. At least I know I have. A man like John Newton,
   who in his early years had been connected with the slave trade and
   thought it right, as most Christian men did in those times, did not
   excuse himself in his later years when his conscience was awakened to
   the iniquity of slavery.

   Do you think that the good man would say, "I was quite right in doing
   as I did because everybody else did it and I knew no better"? Ah, no!
   It was right or wrong whether he knew it or not and his conscience,
   when it became enlightened, told him so. My conscience and your
   conscience may need to be enlightened about several matters which now
   we are doing complacently enough, without any notion that we are
   sinning--but the action bears its own character of right or
   wrong--whatever our judgment may be. Does not this show us the utter
   impossibility of salvation by works? If you expect to be saved by
   keeping the Law of God, you must be a bolder man than I dare to be! I
   know that I cannot keep the Law of God and the doctrine of my text
   makes it impossible beyond all other impossibility, because the Law
   accuses me of doing wrong even when I do not intend it and am not
   conscious of it!

   you who hope to be saved by works, how can you ever enjoy a moment's
   peace? If you think your righteousness will save you if it is perfect,
   how can you ever be sure that it is perfect? You may have sinned
   ignorantly and that will spoil it all! Think of this and be dismayed! I
   beseech you, believe our testimony when we assure you that the road to
   Heaven by your own righteousness is blocked! Ten great Krupp guns which
   fling, each one of them, a bolt huge enough to dash your soul to Hell,
   stand pointed against you if you attempt to make your way to Heaven by
   that steep ascent!

   There is another path! Yonder Cross directs you to it, for it is the
   signpost of the King's highway! That royal road to Heaven is paved with
   Divine Grace--God freely forgives the guilty because they trust in
   Christ! That path is so safe that no lion shall be there, neither shall
   any ravenous beast go up on it--but as for the road of Legal
   Righteousness, attempt it not, but listen to what we have further to
   say to you!

   III. By the grand and awful truth of the text, THE SACRIFICE IS
   ENDEARED. Just according to our sense of sin must be our value of the
   Sacrifice! God's way of delivering those who sinned ignorantly was not
   by denying their sin and passing over it, but by accepting an atonement
   for it. "The priest shall make an atonement concerning his sin wherein
   he has erred, and knew it not, and it shall be forgiven him." The
   forgiveness was to come through atonement! How greatly you and I need
   an atonement for our sins of ignorance, seeing our ignorance is great!

   blood of Christ, how much we need You! Divine Substitute, how greatly
   do we require Your cleansing blood! How gracious it is on God's part to
   be willing to accept an Atonement, for if His Law had said there shall
   be no atonement possible, it would have been just--but infinite Grace
   devised the plan by which, through the Sacrifice of Another, pardon is
   possible for the ignorant sinner! Behold how generous God is, for He
   has Himself provided this Sacrifice! The man who had erred under the
   Law had to bring an offering, himself, but ours is brought for us!
   Jesus, the Son of God, was not spared by the great Father, but He gave
   Him out of His bosom that He might bleed and die!

   The Incarnate God is the great Bearer of the sin of ignorance! And
   today He can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out
   of the way, for He has made an Atonement for them. Under the Law this
   atonement was to be a ram without blemish. Our Lord had no sin, nor
   shade of sin. He is the spotless Victim which the Law of God requires.
   All that Justice, in his most severe mood, could require from man by
   way of penalty, our Lord Jesus Christ has rendered, for in addition to
   His Sacrifice for the sin, He has presented a recompense for the
   damage, as the person who sinned ignorantly was bound to do.

   He has recompensed the honor of God and He has recompensed every man
   whom we have injured. My Brothers and Sisters, has another injured you?
   Well, since Christ has given Himself to you, there is a full recompense
   made to you, even as there has been made to God! Blessed be His name,
   we may rest in this Sacrifice! How supremely efficacious it is! It
   takes away iniquity, transgression and sin. My dear Hearers, you are
   bound to confess your sins to God--but if pardon were offered you upon
   the condition that you should mention every sin you have committed--not
   one of you would ever be saved! We do not know, and if we ever did
   know, we cannot remember all our shortcomings and all our
   transgressions!

   But the mercy is, though we do not know them, HE does and He can blot
   them out! Though we cannot weep over them with a distinct knowledge of
   them because they are not known to us, yet Jesus bled for them with a
   distinct knowledge of them all--and they are all put away by His
   unknown sufferings--all cast into the deeps where an angel's eye can
   never trace them! By the immense and unsearchable agonies He endured
   for us and by His merits, infinite as His Divine Nature, our Redeemer
   has taken away that thick darkness of iniquity which we were not
   capable of comprehending!

   believing Sinner, the debt you know not, your glorious Surety has
   nevertheless borne and discharged for you! Blessings on His name. Rest
   in Him and then go your way and rejoice! Amen.

God's Thoughts and Ways Far Above Ours

   (No. 1387)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 2, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,
   says the Lord. For as the hea vens are higher than the earth, so are My
   ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts." Isaiah
   55:8,9.

   VERY often must the great Truth of God expressed by this Scripture have
   forced itself upon every thoughtful mind. Though we think and are so
   far like God because, being intelligent beings, we have thoughts of our
   own, yet our thoughts must forever be weak and fragmentary as compared
   with His thoughts. And though, as free agents, we have ways of our own
   choice--in some of which we move with great show of wisdom--yet our
   ways are upon the earth and cannot attain to the ways of the Lord which
   are far above us. This is true as to His proceedings in Providence.
   God's designs are vast and far-reaching and His methods are frequently
   strange and inscrutable, though always wise.

   We have little plans to suit our little foresight and power, but His
   ways are unsearchable! Oftentimes He brings light of excessive
   brightness out of darkness more dense than usual and produces superior
   joys out of extraordinary sorrows. In infinite wisdom He causes the
   most furious storms to cast up upon the shore the pearl of peace. He is
   wonderful both in counsel and in working and always chooses that way in
   which His Glory is most abundantly displayed. Our way, which for a time
   we think to be the best, when scanned by the enlightened eye soon turns
   out to be as much beneath God's way of accomplishing the desired
   purpose as the earth is beneath the heavens. Compared with Him our
   wisdom is folly and our prudence madness.

   Indeed, we may not compare ourselves with the Lord, for there is no
   comparison! Call it a contrast and you have the word. So sublime is
   Providence that we do not comprehend it! So good is it that we are
   filled with wonder as we see its designs unfolded. We see its bright
   side at times and sun ourselves in its warm light and then we adore and
   magnify the Lord. Yet, we never knew the half of the hidden benefits
   which He is working out for us, nor do we suspect the Lord of a tenth
   of the goodness which He stores up for us. At other times we have felt
   the night side of Providence and have sorrowed in its chill shade. Yes,
   and perhaps we have even rebelled against it. And yet at that very time
   the Lord's purposes have been divinely rich toward us and the night has
   been the choicest season of benediction.

   We have not the wings of eagles on which to soar to the exceeding
   height of the dealings of the Lord. We walk below and look up
   wonderingly, as men gaze on the stars--we are sure that we are safe
   beneath the sublime all-covering power, but we are equally clear that
   the longest experience and the most profound thought will never measure
   the height of the thoughts and ways of the Eternal! The words, "As the
   heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your
   ways," are equally true in reference to the things of Divine Grace, for
   there the Lord of Love has altogether left our thoughts behind.

   Could man have dreamed that he was the object of eternal love and that
   God would assume his nature? Could we have imagined that the Almighty
   would give His only-begotten Son to die for guilty man? The Atonement
   was a thought which never would have crossed man's mind if it had not,
   first of all, been revealed to him by the great Father. The Divine way
   of lifting up the poor from the dust and the needy from the dunghill,
   by His rich, free, Omnipotent Grace, is not of man nor by man! The
   Lord's thought of choosing the base things of this world, and things
   that are not to bring to nothing the things that are--His thoughts of
   sovereignty and thoughts of Grace--all consistent with His thoughts of
   justice, are far above human invention and out of man's range of
   thought.

   Even when the Lord explains His thoughts and ways to us, and brings
   them down to our comprehension as far as they can be, yet we cannot
   fail to wonder at their elevation and grandeur--

   "Great God of wonders! All Your ways

   Are matchless, Godlike, and Divine."

   Have you not often stood in mute astonishment as you have discovered
   some fresh blessing of the Covenant unknown to you before? Like a miner
   who turns over another nugget in the mine and stands in amazed delight,
   so have you mingled faith with astonishment! Have you not known what it
   is to do as David did when Nathan brought him tidings of the Lord's
   Covenant with him--"Then went king David in and sat before the Lord,
   and he said, Who am I, O Lord God? And what is my house, that You have
   brought me up to now? And is this the manner of man, O Lord God?"

   Have not such fits of astonishment been upon you, also? Have you not
   cried with the Apostle, "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom
   and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and His ways
   past finding out!"? Hundreds of times between now and Heaven will the
   same glad astonishment seize us--and perhaps in Heaven, itself,
   wondering will be a leading part of our enjoyment! We shall--

   "Sing with wonder and surprise At His loving kindness in the skies." Do
   not the victorious hosts which stand upon the sea of glass, having the
   harps of God, sing the song of Moses, the servant of the Lord and of
   the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God
   Almighty"? The thoughts of God will even, in Heaven, be above our most
   sublime thoughts and His ways, even then, above our most heavenly ways.
   How exalted is the Lord! His glory is above the earth and heavens!

   How tenderly does He overpower us with the splendor of His goodness,
   soothing where He might confound! In Grace and love, who is like You, O
   Lord? Among the gods who is like You? Understanding faints in
   attempting to ascend to You! Imagination, to which You have given a
   half-creative faculty, cannot beget a thought of equal height to Your
   thoughts, nor conceive a way which may bear comparison with Your ways!
   What better can we do, great God, than bow our heads and reverently
   adore?

   This morning, in trying to discuss our text, we will endeavor to
   illustrate it by its own connection. There are many ways of handling
   Scripture, but to my mind the freshest and most instructive is to
   expound it by its surroundings. To pick out a plum here and there is
   the children's method, but hardly satisfies students of the Word of
   God. "Let us not tear it," is exceedingly good advice with regard to
   Scripture, which is, in some sense, the garment of God. I will take
   hold of the central part of the rich piece of silken Truth contained in
   this chapter and I will lift up the whole fabric before you and bid you
   observe its texture and note how wonderfully it is worked throughout.

   Exposition is ever nourishing to the Lord's people and this it is which
   we shall aim at. I think there are three things which are very clear in
   the text if viewed in its connection. First, in the text there is
   rebuke administered. Secondly, there is repentance encouraged. And,
   thirdly, there is expectation excited.

   I. First in the text there is REBUKE ADMINISTERED, for thus it
   runs--"Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon
   him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon. For My thoughts are
   not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways." Do you not observe a
   sort of ringing of the changes upon the words, "thoughts," and, "ways"?
   This proves to my mind that the connection mainly lies in this first
   point.

   The Lord says, "Forsake your ways, for they are not My ways. Leave your
   thoughts, for they are not My thoughts. Your ways ought to be My ways.
   Your thoughts ought to be My thoughts, so far as the weakness of
   creatureship will allow. But it is not so. You have wandered away from
   Me. You think not such thoughts as I would have you think. You walk not
   in such a way as I would have you choose--therefore forsake your ways
   and your thoughts and turn unto your God." It is a remonstrance
   tenderly administered, mixed up with such sweet exhortation that no
   degree of bitterness is perceptible in it. The rebuke is enveloped in
   love and made into a sugar-coated pill. The sweet promise of abundant
   pardon conceals the reproof.

   Now let us take the rebuke and notice, first, the fault of man's
   thoughts--"My thoughts are not your thoughts." As between each other,
   God's thoughts are not man's, though they ought to be. God's thoughts
   are love, pity, tenderness. Ours are forgetfulness, ingratitude and
   hard-heartedness. He thinks of us as lost sheep are thought of by the
   shepherd, as a prodigal child is thought of by his father. But our
   thoughts are not of the same kind. In its wandering state, the sheep
   has no thought of returning to the shepherd and the prodigal son, until
   converting Grace meets with him, has no

   reciprocal affection towards his father. It is sad that the God of Love
   should have to say, "My thoughts are not your thoughts."

   God's thoughts to us are thoughts of love, but not so ours to Him. He
   is tender of our comfort, but we are not tender of His honor. He
   considers our interests, but we think not of His Glory. He watches over
   our safety, but we are not watchful to keep His statutes. He loads us
   with benefits, but we only load Him with our sins. He has given us all
   that we have, but we bring Him cold thanks in return. You love, O
   ungodly men, to live without remembering God! He is not in all your
   thoughts. You have no consideration for your Maker, no deference for
   your Preserver, no care for your best Friend. He feels your ungenerous
   conduct, for He says, "If then, I am a Father, where is My honor? And
   if I am a Master, where is My fear?"

   Alas, man returns not according to the benefit received, but often
   renders evil for good! When the Lord deigned to visit earth as the
   Incarnate God, the acts of man proved that His thoughts are not God's
   thoughts. God's thoughts were all goodness to men, but men found Him
   here in human form and their thoughts and ways were full of enmity and
   murder towards Him! They cried, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!" How
   terribly has man departed from His God! Your thoughts as to your
   conduct are not God's thoughts. He considers that the creatures He has
   made should obey Him, but you judge that it matters not what a man does
   towards His Maker so long as he is just towards his fellow men.

   God declares that no conduct can justify a man unless it is absolutely
   perfect and wholly conformed to His Law. But man imagines that if he
   does his best it will suffice and that even if he does not do his best,
   a little profession of repentance will wipe off old scores and he may
   stand self-justified before God. Man thinks that he has done wondrously
   if he gives, now and then, a little attention to outward religion, even
   though his heart may be far from God. But the Lord looks at the heart
   and searches the secret places of the mind. He values nothing but what
   is done out of love to Him. Man slights the inward and only regards the
   outward, for God's thoughts are not his thoughts. Oh you that are
   satisfied with your own conduct and perfectly content that things are
   well enough with you, I beseech you to remember that your
   self-congratulatory thoughts are not the thoughts of God! He looks into
   the soul's secrets and He is not deceived by the words and professions
   of those who draw near to Him with their lips, but in secret continue
   in their iniquity!

   God's thoughts, again, as to the life which a man needs in order to
   salvation are very different from man's thoughts. Did you notice how in
   this chapter He says, "Hear, and your soul shall live"? He reckons,
   then, that man is dead till he has heard the Word of God in his soul.
   Man reckons that he is alive enough--he is perfectly satisfied with the
   mental life which he possesses and does not desire spiritual life--for
   as yet he cannot apprehend it. Here is a wide difference! God thinks of
   you, O Sinner, as dead and beginning to corrupt! He thinks of you as we
   think of a corpse when we cry, "Bury my dead out of my sight."

   But you think of yourself as of a creature fair to look upon, filled
   with beauty, abounding with ability and able to perform all spiritual
   acts at pleasure. Your boast is that you have freedom of will and force
   of heart to set all things right whenever it pleases you--and courage
   and resolution to right every wrong which may assail you. You are as
   strong as Goliath and as brave as David in your own esteem! But God
   doesn't think so. His eternal Spirit knows that you are dead--and He
   has come to bring you life--take heed that you do not reject it! Do not
   say in your heart, "I have life enough and need nothing from the Most
   High," for this would be your sure destruction!

   God's thoughts are not our thoughts, again, in reference to the Truth
   of God. God's thoughts of His Truth are evidently not man's, for
   nothing but Divine Grace can bring man to believe the doctrines of the
   Gospel, or keep him faithful to them. Each generation seems to bring
   forth its own set of men who set themselves to oppose God's Truth from
   some fresh point. These scribes and counters of the towers are
   wonderfully busy just now. We have among us a great company of men who
   have attained repute through daring to assail established Truths of
   God--wise men if we take their own judgment of themselves--for they are
   never more at home than when sounding the praises of their own culture
   and breadth of mind.

   These Philistines have intruded into the temple under the pretense of
   trimming our lamps but their aim is to put them out. Evangelistic light
   is too clear for them and they seek to obscure it--therefore they give
   new readings to texts which are translated by better scholars than they
   will ever be and put new interpretations upon the doctrines which their
   fathers held--interpretations which their sires would indignantly
   repudiate! Roughly speaking, these men deny everything which faith
   holds dear and yet expect to be considered to be Christians! They tear
   the vitals from every Truth

   of God and yet pretend to believe it! Their advanced thought, like a
   vampire, sucks the blood out of the veins of Truth and he who would
   drive away the foul thing is called a bigot and a fool!

   These reverend infidels are to be tolerated as our ministers, or if we
   decline to reckon those to be Christian ministers who spend all their
   energies in undermining Christianity, we are in danger of being
   ridiculed by the sage party which now clamors in the public ear. Well,
   it was always so! Man thinks himself so wise and good that he does not
   like God's thoughts concerning himself--his fall, his guilt and his
   danger. He tries to think Revelation over again. He places it upside
   down and then he calls his maundering, "culture," and, "thought." To
   get away from the plain teaching of Scripture he babbles about
   advancement--an advancement which consists in going away from the
   Light--an advancement which will bring us back to stark naked
   infidelity unless God, in infinite mercy, shall stop it. Man likes not
   the thoughts of God!

   If God thinks of man as depraved, he will not have it--he feels that it
   is a shameful thing to speak thus of such a noble being as himself! If
   God declares that man is so fallen that he must be born again, he will
   not have it--he will sprinkle a few drops of water on a baby's
   face--say some mumbo jumbo and presto!--The thing is done! If God
   thinks that the sinner shall be cast into Hell where their worm dies
   not--men's fears are quieted by being assured by some great Divine that
   there is no Hell--that he cannot find mention of it in the Bible and
   that at the worst, he will only cease to be. Thus do they think, in
   opposition to the Divine thinking, for it is always true, "My thoughts
   are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, says the Lord."

   In the matter of salvation, God's thoughts are not man's thoughts, for
   God thinks that man has so sinned that he must be condemned unless a
   Substitute is found. Man doesn't think so. God sets before him pardon,
   freely presented through the precious blood of Jesus Christ--man thinks
   to buy it by his devotions, or to win it by his merits! Therefore the
   language preceding our text--"Why do you spend money for that which is
   not bread? And why do you labor for that which satisfies not? Hearken
   diligently unto Me, and eat that which is good and let your soul
   delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear and come unto Me: hear, and
   your soul shall live" and so on. Those verses hold in solution the
   thought of our text--"My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are
   your ways My ways, says the Lord."

   See then, dear Friends, that this is a call to repentance! Man, if you
   think rightly, you will submit to think as God thinks! If your thoughts
   are what they should be, they will not contradict God's thoughts, for
   He knows more than you and knows better than you. The Infinite, the
   Eternal--is He to be judged by man's judgment? Is He to be analyzed in
   the chemist's laboratory? Are His thoughts to be ridiculed because they
   are contrary to the reigning philosophy which is probably no more true
   than the many other forms of human ignorance which have come and gone
   in the centuries of the past? Will not the present dreams of mortal
   wisdom melt like a mist before the sun of Gospel Truth? Is God's great
   system of Salvation and Providence to be called to the bar of the
   scientists, who can do no more than dote after the manner of their
   predecessors?

   Shall Divine Revelation be judged and condemned as men try a thief? No,
   worse than this--these sages so despise the teaching of the Lord that
   one would think they were a committee of doctors examining a maniac!
   Let us abhor the presumption of skepticism and let us be wise enough to
   know our folly! We must be rational enough to feel that God is to be
   obeyed and not questioned--and that His Revelation is to be believed
   and not criticized. Though we think crookedly, God's thoughts are
   upright. Though we think grovellingly, God thinks sublimely. Though we
   think upon a finite and erroneous scale, God thinks infinitely and
   Infallibly! It is our lot to continually correct our thoughts by the
   Infallible Word of God so that our minds are kept in harmony with the
   sure utterances of the Holy Spirit.

   Now, the text advances to say that man's ways are not like God's--"My
   ways are not your ways." Our ways are the outward actions which spring
   out of our thoughts. God's ways are ways of holiness and purity. God
   has never done anything unjust to His creature or unrighteous to
   Himself. But our ways are not so--they are full of error, marred with
   evil, polluted with impurity. By nature we love that which we ought to
   hate! We often put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. Oh, Brothers
   and Sisters, when you think of the Character of God and then think of
   the best man that ever lived--truly "as high as the heavens are above
   the earth" are His ways above our ways!

   God's ways are ways of love and tenderness. He is very loving and full
   of compassion. But our ways are not so--we are often very harsh to one
   another and we do not return a filial love to God. I mean not unless
   His Grace meets with us. And even then we fall far short of walking in
   the love of God as He walks in love toward us. God's ways are ways of

   truth--He never lies, He has never been unfaithful to us or untrue to
   His promises. But we, on the other hand, have proved false to Him many
   times. "You have dealt very treacherously," said the Prophet of old,
   and the charge lies against us to this day. We have been traitors to
   God, but He has been fidelity, itself, to us!

   Our good resolves have dissolved in air. Our promises have been broken.
   Our vows have all been forgotten. God is all truth and faithfulness to
   us and we are all mistrust and doubt and treachery towards Him! Were it
   not for His Divine Grace we would have even fallen into apostasy--and
   been like the son of perdition who betrayed his Lord! God's ways are
   ways of forgiveness and peace. He does not desire the death of the
   sinner. He is very patient, He suffers long, He bears continually with
   our provocations. He is desirous that men should acquaint themselves
   with Him and be at peace. His ways are ways of reconciliation, ways of
   forgiveness, ways of love and kindness!

   But you can see, can't you, that the ways of the natural man are
   perverse? By nature we do not desire to be at amity with God. On the
   contrary, we seize upon anything that can aggravate our transgression
   and widen the breach between ourselves and our offended Lord! We have
   no patience--we cannot even bear with a little suffering or trial from
   Him without complaint and murmur. There are men around us who will turn
   round and curse Him to His face when His hand is smiting and correcting
   them for their own good--yes, and they will do it wantonly without a
   shadow of reason. Our ways are not God's ways. This is true of every
   sinner under Heaven and, in some measure, true of the best of men-- "My
   ways are not your ways, says the Lord."

   Well, now, Beloved, two cannot walk together in Heaven except they are
   of one mind! Therefore our ways and God's ways must be made to be alike
   in character. Now, it is not possible for us to conceive of God's
   making His thoughts to be like our thoughts. Who would wish such a
   thing? Who would desire that the wise and good should stoop to think
   our folly and act our madness? Who could wish that the Glorious and the
   Perfect should come down to think and act after the manner of unjust,
   unrighteous man? His thoughts cannot be reduced to ours--what then?
   Why, we must rise to Him! Not, of course, to His majesty and sublimity,
   but we must rise to His holiness, truth and love. Therefore the command
   which comes before our text, "Seek you the Lord while He may be found,
   call you upon Him while He is near: let the wicked forsake his ways and
   the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord."

   If infinite purity cannot be expected to become impure, let us ask that
   our impurity may be taken away and that we may be made clean in the
   Lord's sight so as to hold fellowship with Him! And now I ask you to
   consider the difficulty of this. "As the heavens are higher than the
   earth, so are My ways higher than your ways." Turn your eyes here, O
   Self-Sufficiency! Can you vault into Heaven? Standing here upon this
   lower earth can you, with a spring, leap above yon stars, ascend into
   the holiness of God and become a partaker of the Divine Nature?

   Surely you have a task set before you which will make you confess your
   inability! Yet such a rising up must be accomplished if we are to dwell
   with God and have fellowship with Him! These miry, filthy ways of earth
   must become like the pure and perfect path of the thrice Holy One or we
   cannot walk with Him! How, then, are we to be lifted up from earth to
   Heaven? The word that answers the question is that matchless syllable,
   "Grace." God in Christ Jesus, by His almighty Grace, must raise us up
   together with Christ! He who brought, again, from the dead, our Lord
   Jesus Christ, must stoop down to lift us up from the grave of sin and
   quicken us into eternal life --or we shall never think His thoughts or
   follow His ways!

   Into the Light wherein He dwells, we can never go except by the
   operations of His Divine Spirit. Jesus says, "No man comes unto the
   Father but by Me," and, "No man can come unto Me except the Father
   which has sent Me draw him." The Holy Spirit must quicken us out of our
   trespasses and sins! He must deliver us from the ways in which we walk
   according to the course of this world! He must redeem us from the
   dominion of the carnal mind which is enmity against God! By
   sanctification He must deliver us from our indwelling corruption and
   continue the process till He conforms us perfectly to the image of the
   peerless Son of God! And likeness to Jesus He will work in all
   Believers! And it shall be said of us--"They are without fault before
   the Throne of God!" And Christ, Himself, shall say, "They shall walk
   with Me in white, for they are worthy." It is clear, then, that our
   text is a gentle but earnest rebuke, veiled in abounding love!

   II. Now, secondly, we shall view the text under another aspect. Here we
   have REPENTANCE ENCOURAGED. Kindly look at the 7th verse--"Let him
   return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God,
   for He will abundantly pardon. For My thoughts are not your thoughts."
   It is clear that there is a connecting link between the

   abundance of pardon and the lofty Character of God--and that men are
   encouraged to forsake their ways and thoughts by the hope of pardon
   derived from the greatness of the Divine thoughts and ways.

   First, O Sinner, turn from your ways at once, and seek the Lord! Do not
   stand back because you cannot understand God. It is not necessary that
   you should comprehend His ways and thoughts--you are not asked to do
   so! In fact, you are told in the text that you cannot do anything of
   the kind! You are bid to forsake your ways and receive mercy by hearing
   His Word and believing it, for as the heavens are high above the earth,
   so high are His ways above your ways. You cannot understand it--you
   waste time while raising this question and that, prying into God's
   eternal purposes, gazing into the dazzling light of
   sovereignty--questioning electing love, diving into mysteries of the
   Trinity and the like! You are to "hear, and your soul shall live."

   Return unto your God and He will abundantly pardon you. Though you
   cannot grapple with His sublimity, submit to His mercy! You may
   conclude that it is not intended that you should understand the
   Infinite, for you are told that His thoughts and ways are far above
   you. But you are required to seek Him while He may be found and call
   upon Him while He is near! Come and close with His free invitation to
   give you wine and milk without money and without price! Forsaking your
   sin, come and be at peace with Him at once! Do not stand back because
   you cannot find a parallel to the Grace which God declares that He will
   display towards you. What if you have looked over all the history of
   man and you can find nothing among men that can equal the abundance of
   Divine pardon? Do not, therefore, hesitate to believe, for God's
   thoughts are above all human thoughts.

   Man finds it hard to forgive at all. One of the sternest lessons which
   some men have to learn is to forgive their brothers unto 70 times
   seven. Man can, with difficulty, forgive repeated offenses--but he
   usually draws an argument for anger from the repetition of the
   provocation. Nor can he forgive a large number of offenders--he might
   pardon one-- but to forgive many is more than most men will even
   attempt to do! They are filled with indignation and resist those who
   annoy them. When offenses are aggravated willfully, when they provoke
   by being committed against love and against kindness, men will not
   forgive. Even the most forgiving become, at last, incensed--but God
   passes by myriads of transgressions! Do not wait until you find a man
   who will forgive you--God can do what man never dreams of doing. His
   thoughts are above your thoughts and His ways above your ways.

   Perhaps conscience has been busy as to your shortcomings and you feel
   yourself to be self-condemned. In the honesty of your judgment you have
   felt compelled to cry, "I could not do otherwise than pass sentence of
   condemnation upon myself if I were made my own judge." 'Tis a right
   verdict, but do not forget that Jesus died for sinners and now, far
   above all thoughts of ours, Mercy's wing can mount! Yes, for time
   everlasting, mountains of Jehovah's forgiving love are above the
   heavens--Divine Grace is above all things! Think of this, O repenting
   Sinner, and be encouraged! Man's forgiveness is seldom free, like that
   of God's, who delights to pardon sin! No sooner do we transgress than
   God is ready to forgive!

   Man's forgiveness is never so full as God's, for the Lord harbors no
   resentment. He preserves no memory of our transgressions--He casts them
   into the depths of the sea and remembers them no more! Man's
   forgiveness is seldom so real as God's, for though man says he has
   forgiven, he does not, afterwards, delight in the offender as he may
   have done before. There is a chill in his heart towards the person who
   injured him and by his cautious dealing he shows that he remembers the
   wrong. But the Lord God so effectually and wholly forgets transgression
   that He presses the offender to His heart, adopts him into His family
   and lifts him up to dwell forever with Him above!

   Now, Beloved, according to our text, whatever your ways towards God
   shall be in the future, He will exceed them! Are your ways now right
   towards your Father? Do you begin with trembling footsteps to seek His
   house? Lo, He runs to meet you! The prodigal's Father meets him far
   more than half way, for His ways are above our ways! Do you stand
   before Him weeping? It is well--these ways of repentance are good, but
   better are the ways of God--for Jesus stands before you, bleeding for
   your sake. He gives blood instead of tears! Do you love the Redeemer
   because of His dying for you? Alas, you do not love so greatly as He
   loves you--His love is a sea and yours a tiny brook. Will you, from now
   on, give Him all your life? Yet not such a life as He gives to you--a
   life perfect and eternal--and all for you!

   He lives for you and says, "Because I live, you shall live, also." Come
   back, O Penitent, for when you do come back, if Divine Grace has put
   some goodness into your ways, yet there shall still be infinitely more
   goodness in the ways of God! And as to your thoughts--can you think of
   how He will receive you? Oh, you cannot dream how gladly He will meet
   you and how kindly He will receive you! You are about to cry, "I am not
   worthy to be called Your son," but He will

   say to His servants, "Bring forth the best robe and put it on him! Put
   a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet!" You hope that there will be
   gladness when you are restored, but you have no idea of the music and
   the dancing which will flood Heaven, itself, with rejoicing!

   You faintly hope that God will love you, but you have no idea how much,
   nor what great things His love will do for you! The half has never been
   told you by the most faithful witness for God. Those who have
   experienced most of the Divine Love have never been able to communicate
   to you any idea of what that love is! God's thoughts are above your
   thoughts as much as the heavens are above the earth! Come, then, to
   Him! Infinite Grace awaits you. A tender reception, a perfect
   cleansing, a Divine adorning--eternal security and endless bliss shall
   all be yours! Why do you linger? The life of God shall be in you and
   the joy of Christ shall fill you to the full! If this does not
   encourage men to repent, what can?

   III. And now let us touch upon the third point, which is
   this--EXPECTATION EXCITED. I said I was going to keep to the connection
   of the text and so I will. But this time the link is forward instead of
   backward. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways
   higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts. For"--you
   see there is the link word, "for," to join our text to that which
   follows--"For as the rain comes down and the snow from Heaven and
   returns not there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and
   bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater, so
   shall My Word be."

   Now, if you listen to the Lord and take His thoughts to be your
   thoughts--and earnestly pray Him to make His ways to be your ways from
   this time forth and forever--you may justly indulge the highest
   expectations and they shall be exceeded! This chapter tells you what to
   expect. First, you are to expect that the Lord's Word will be unfailing
   to you. What is this "Word"? You see we have had "thoughts" and "ways"
   and now we come to "Word." God's Word is His thoughts spoken, and God's
   Word is, also, His ways, for, "He speaks and it is done. He commands
   and it stands fast." His "Word" is "thoughts" and "ways" put together!

   Now that "Word" of His shall never be broken to you, poor Sinner.
   Forsake your ways, forsake your thoughts-- and come and trust in God
   and His Word shall be like Himself--Immutable, Eternal, Infallible and
   full of boundless blessing to you! It shall be powerful to bless you,
   mighty to grow you--it shall be like rain and snow which go not back to
   Heaven, but sink into the earth to make it bring forth and bud. From
   that day forward, when you are reconciled to God, you may take any
   promise you find in the Word of God and say, "Lord, fulfill this Word
   unto Your servant which You have caused me to hope," and it shall be
   so. Come and trust Him--and promises which now appear before you as far
   too rich for such a poor worm as you are, shall be fulfilled! They
   shall come down upon your soul like gentle showers and make you full of
   gladness. Such is the fullness of its power that you shall be able to
   respond to God's Word by a holy and gracious life--and your soul,
   barren as it now is--shall be made to bring forth and bud. That is one
   blessed thing which you may confidently expect, for you are coming to a
   God of great ways and thoughts!

   The next is that you are returning to a God whose ways are so much
   above your ways and His thoughts so much above your thoughts that your
   heart shall be filled with joy--"you shall go out with joy, and be led
   forth with peace." God will not merely break off your chains and say in
   cold accents, "You are free," but He will release you amid the music of
   the spheres! And angels shall lead you forth in peace and your tongue
   shall sing, "I am forgiven! I am forgiven! I am accepted! I am
   redeemed! Behold, now do I go forth out of my captivity with joy and
   God's angels lead me forth with peace." Who would not be a penitent if
   such things may be expected from the sublime grandeur of the goodness
   of God?

   Next to this, all your surroundings shall minister to your gladness.
   "The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing.
   And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands." In your journey
   through life, mountains have, up to now, been hard to climb and forests
   tangled and dark have been your dread. But now so greatly good is God
   to those whose ways become His ways, that the mountain which you feared
   shall break forth into song and the forest at which you trembled shall
   become an orchestra in which every tree shall clap its hands for joy!
   You do not know what awaits coming sinners!

   You that are willing to hear that your soul may live--you that are
   willing to accept the Covenant which God made with great David's
   greater Son--you shall see the whole world robed in the garments of
   praise and your heart shall be so filled with gladness that it shall
   overflow and flood all Nature with joy! And then there shall happen to
   you wonderful transformations. Because God's ways are above your ways,
   He will do what you never thought could be done! The thorns shall be
   transmuted into fir trees and the briers into myrtles! There shall be a
   change in you, such a wonderful change,

   that all things shall become new! There shall be a change in all that
   concerns you--the Bible shall become a treasure and the Sabbath a
   delight! The Mercy Seat a loved resort and the path of obedience a way
   of pleasantness!

   Sin shall be uprooted and virtue shall be implanted! Evil habits shall
   be withered and holy principles shall be nourished! You do not know and
   you cannot guess what honor, pleasure, dignity and glory it is to be in
   Christ! You who have never come to God cannot conceive the bliss of
   life with God by Jesus Christ! As a deaf man can have no notion of
   music. As a man born blind can have no conception of the splendor of
   the rainbow, so you deaf and blind, you do not know what the Christian
   life is for excellence and happiness--but you may guess that it is
   surpassingly delightful when you hear that as high as the heavens are
   above the earth, so high are the Lord's ways above our ways!

   Last of all, this mercy is to endure forever. Man's thoughts are
   temporary and his ways but for a season. God is eternal--when He
   thinks, His thoughts abide forever--and when He acts, His ways are
   everlasting. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance--He
   never changes His mind! Perhaps you think that salvation is a thing to
   be found and lost, to be gained and forfeited, to be enjoyed today and
   deplored tomorrow--and truly, there are some who tell us so. But so
   speaks not the Word of the Lord, for it is written, "It shall be to the
   Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off."

   Once come and walk in the ways of God and His Grace will keep you in
   them and you shall find a growing delight in them! Once come and learn
   the thoughts of God and surrender your intellect and heart entirely to
   His supremacy--and if it is a sincere surrender--His Holy Spirit will,
   from now on, guide your thoughts and direct your beliefs so that you
   shall continue steadfast in His fear and your path shall be that of the
   just which shines more and more unto the perfect day. Oh, who would not
   yield to such a God as our God, whose goodness excels our largest
   desires? If I were engaged upon the wretched errand of charging you to
   submit to a remorseless tyrant who would never forgive, my message
   would be hard to deliver! But because Jesus, the Son of God, has died
   and by His death has expiated sin, we are authorized and empowered to
   cry in the name of God, "Let the wicked forsake his ways and the
   unrighteous man his thoughts! And let him return unto the Lord and He
   will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for He will abundantly
   pardon."

   If all this should seem to be too good to be true, as often it has
   done--if the sinner should feel unable to believe that he can obtain
   immediate forgiveness for a long life of transgression--we are then
   commanded to tell you that you must not measure God by yourself. You
   must not calculate what He can do by what your fellow man can perform.
   The Lord can forgive what otherwise could never be forgiven. He can
   pour out mercies so multiplied as to baffle human arithmetic! He can
   bless you beyond your desires. He can delight you beyond a dream and He
   can finally give you a Heaven which "eye has not seen nor ear heard,
   neither has entered into the heart of man."

   Close in with Him, Soul, at once, while yet in the Person of the Lord
   Jesus He commands your faith! Go not about by good works and prayers
   and tears to obtain forgiveness! Spend not your money on that which is
   not bread, but come, penniless and poor as you are, and buy the wine
   and milk of Covenant blessings without money and without price!! Lend
   the willing ear and yield the believing heart. "Hear, and your soul
   shall live!" Believe, and you shall be saved! Through Jesus Christ we
   proclaim the Good News and, for His sake, we implore a blessing upon
   it. Amen.

Jesus Christ Himself

   (No. 1388)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY MORNING, DECEMBER 9, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Jesus Christ Himself." Ephesians 2:20.

   "Jesus Christ Himself is to occupy all our thoughts this morning. What
   an ocean opens up before me! Here is room in the sea for the largest
   ship! In which direction shall I turn your thoughts? I am embarrassed
   with riches. I know not where to begin--and when I once begin, where
   shall I end? Assuredly we need not go abroad for joys this morning, for
   we have a feast at home! The words are few, but the meaning
   vast--"Jesus Christ Himself." Beloved, the religion of our Lord Jesus
   Christ contains in it nothing so wonderful as Himself. It is a mass of
   marvels, but He is THE miracle of it! The wonder of wonders is "The
   Wonderful" Himself!

   If proof is asked of the Truths of God which He proclaimed, we point
   men to Jesus Christ Himself. His Character is unique. We defy
   unbelievers to imagine another like He. He is God and yet Man--and we
   challenge them to compose a narrative in which the two apparently
   incongruous characters shall be so harmoniously blended--in which the
   human and Divine shall be so marvelously apparent without the one
   overshadowing the other! They question the authenticity of the four
   Gospels--will they try and write a fifth? Will they even attempt to add
   a few incidents to the life which shall be worthy of the sacred
   biography and congruous with those facts which are already described?

   If it is all a forgery, will they be so good as to show us how it is
   done? Will they find a novelist who will write another biography of a
   man of any century they choose, of any nationality, or of any degree of
   experience, or any rank or station and let us see if they can describe,
   in that imaginary life, a devotion, a self-sacrifice, a truthfulness, a
   completeness of character at all comparable to that of Jesus Christ
   Himself? Can they invent another perfect character even if the Divine
   element is left out? They must fail, for there is none like Jesus!

   The Character of Jesus has commanded respect even from those who have
   abhorred His teaching. It has been a stumbling block to all objectors
   who have preserved a shade of candor. They could refute Jesus'
   doctrine, they say. They boast they could improve His precepts. They
   claim His system is narrow and outworn. But what can they do with Him?
   They must admire Him even if they will not adore Him--and having done
   so, they have admired a Person who must be Divine--or else He willfully
   left His disciples to believe a lie. How do they surmount this
   difficulty? They cannot do so by railing at Him, for they have no
   material for accusation. Jesus Christ Himself silences their criticism!

   This is a file at which these asps bite, but break their teeth. Beyond
   all argument or miracle, Jesus Christ Himself is the proof of His own
   Gospel. And as He is the proof of it, so, Beloved, He is the marrow and
   essence of it. When the Apostle Paul meant that the Gospel was
   preached, He said, "Christ is preached," for the Gospel is Christ
   Himself! If you want to know what Jesus taught, know Him! He is the
   incarnation of that Truth of God which by Him and in Him is revealed to
   the sons of men. Did He not, Himself say, "I am the way, the truth, and
   the life"?

   You have not to take down innumerable books, nor to pore over
   mysterious sentences of double meaning in order to know what our great
   Teacher has revealed. You have but to turn and gaze upon His
   countenance, behold His actions and note His spirit and you know His
   teaching. He lived what He taught. If we wish to know Him, we may hear
   His gentle voice saying, "Come and see." Study His wounds and you
   understand His innermost philosophy. "To know Him and the power of His
   Resurrection" is the highest degree of spiritual learning. He is the
   end of the Law and the soul of the Gospel--and when we have preached
   His Word to the fullest, we may close by saying, "Now, of the things
   which we have spoken, this is the sum--we have an High Priest who is
   set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens."

   Nor is He, alone, the proof of His Gospel and the substance of it, but
   He is the power and force by which it spreads. When a heart is truly
   broken of sin, it is by Him that it is bound up. If a man is converted,
   it is by Christ, the power of

   God. If we enter into peace and salvation, it is by the gracious
   manifestation of Jesus Himself. If men have enthusiastically loved
   Christianity, it is because, first of all, they loved Christ! Apostles
   labored for Him and for Him confessors were brave. For Him saints have
   suffered the loss of all things and for Him martyrs have died. The
   power which creates heroic consecration is "Jesus Christ Himself." The
   memories stirred by His name have more influence over men's hearts than
   all things else in earth or Heaven. The enthusiasm which is the very
   life of our holy cause comes from Himself.

   They who know not Jesus know not the life of truth, but those who dwell
   in Him are filled with power and overflow so that out of the midst of
   them streams forth living water! Nor is it only so, Beloved, for the
   power which propagates the Gospel is Jesus Himself. In Heaven He pleads
   and, therefore, does His Kingdom come. "The pleasure of the Lord shall
   prosper in His hand." It is from Heaven that He rules all things so as
   to promote the advance of the Truth of God. All power is given unto Him
   in Heaven and in earth and, therefore, are we to proclaim His
   life-giving Word with full assurance of success.

   He causes the wheels of Providence to revolve in such a manner as to
   help His cause. He abridges the power of tyrants, overrules the
   scourges of war, establishes liberty in nations, opens the mysteries of
   continents long unknown, breaks down systems of error and guides the
   current of human thought. He works by a thousand means preparing the
   way of the Lord. It is from Heaven that He shall shortly come and when
   He comes, when Christ Himself shall put forth all His might, then shall
   the wildernesses rejoice and the solitary places be glad! The reserve
   force of the Gospel is Christ Jesus Himself. The latent power which
   shall at last break every bond and win universal dominion is the
   energy, the life, the Omnipotence of Jesus Himself!

   He sleeps in the vessel now, but when He arises and chides the storm
   there will be a deep calm. He now, for awhile, conceals Himself in the
   ivory palaces of Glory, but when He is manifested, in that day His
   chariot wheels shall bring victory to His Church militant. If these
   things are so, I have a theme before me which I cannot compass! I
   forbear the impossible task and I shall but briefly note some few
   apparent matters which lie upon the surface of the subject. Brethren,
   "Jesus Christ Himself" should always be the prominent thought of our
   minds as Christians! Our theology should be framed upon the fact that
   He is the Center and Head of all. We must remember that "in Him are hid
   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."

   Some of our Brothers are mainly taken up with the doctrines of the
   Gospel and are somewhat bitter in their narrow orthodoxy. We are to
   love every Word of our Lord Jesus and His Apostles and are to contend
   earnestly for the faith once delivered unto the saints, but yet it is
   always well to hold the Truth of God in connection with Jesus and not
   as in itself, alone, the sum of all things. Truth isolated from the
   Person of Jesus grows hard and cold. We know some in whom the slightest
   variation from their system arouses their indignation even though they
   admit that the Brother is full of the Spirit of Christ. It is with them
   doctrine, doctrine, doctrine--whereas with us, I trust, it is Christ
   Himself! True doctrine is, to us priceless as a Throne for our living
   Lord. But our chief delight is not in the vacant Throne, but in the
   King's Presence!

   Give me not His garments, though I prize every thread, but the blessed
   Wearer whose sacred energy made even the hem to heal with a touch!
   There are others of our Brothers who delight above measure in what they
   call experimental preaching which sets forth the inner life of the
   Believer--both the rage of depravity and the triumph of Grace. This is
   well in due proportion, according to the analogy of faith, but still,
   Jesus Himself should be more conspicuous than our experiences and
   feelings, doubts and fears, struggles and victories. We may get to
   study the action of our own hearts so much that we fall into
   despondency and despair. "Looking unto Jesus" is better than looking
   unto our own progress! Self-examination has its necessary uses, but to
   have done with self and live by faith in Jesus Christ Himself is the
   best course for a Christian.

   Then, there are others who rightly admire the precepts of the Gospel
   and are never so happy as when they are hearing them enforced, as,
   indeed, they ought to be. But after all, the commands of our Lord are
   not our Lord Himself, and they derive their value to us and their power
   over our obedience from the fact that they are His Words and that He
   said, "If you love Me, keep My commandments." We know the truth of His
   declaration, "If a man loves Me he will keep My sayings," but there
   must be the personal love to begin with! Brothers and Sisters, all the
   benefits of these three schools will be ours if we live upon Jesus
   Himself!

   They each gather a flower, but our Divine "plant of renown" has all the
   beauty and all the fragrance of all that they can gather--and without
   the thorns which are so apt to grow on their peculiar roses. Jesus
   Christ Himself is to us precept, for He is the Way. He is to us
   doctrine, for He is the Truth. He is to us experience, for He is the
   Life. Let us make Him the pole star of our religious life in all
   things! Let Him be first, last and middle! Yes, let us say, "He is all
   my salvation and all my desire." And yet do not, I beseech you, disdain
   the doctrine, lest marring the doctrine you should be guilty of insult
   to Jesus Himself. To trifle with the Truth of God is to despise Jesus
   as our Prophet.

   Do not, for a moment, underrate experience, lest in neglecting the
   inner self, you also despise your Lord Himself as your cleansing
   Priest! And never for a moment forget His commandments, lest if you
   break them you transgress against Jesus Himself as your King. All
   things which touch upon His Kingdom are to be treated reverently by us
   for the sake of Himself. His Bible, His day, His Church, His ordinances
   must all be precious to us, because they have to do with Him. But in
   the forefront of all must always stand "Jesus Christ Himself," the
   personal, living, loving Jesus! Christ in us the hope of Glory. Christ
   for us our full redemption. Christ with us our guide and our solace and
   Christ above us pleading and preparing our place in Heaven. Jesus
   Christ Himself is our Captain, our armor, our strength and our victory!
   We inscribe His name upon our banner, for it is Hell's terror, Heaven's
   delight and earth's hope. We bear this upon our hearts in the heat of
   the conflict, for this is our breastplate and coat of mail.

   I shall not endeavor to say anything this morning which will strike you
   as beautiful in language, for to endeavor to decorate the Altogether
   Lovely One would be blasphemy. To hang flowers upon the Cross is
   ridiculous and to endeavor to adorn Him whose head is as the finest
   gold and whose Person is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires would
   be profane. I shall but tell you simple things in simple language--yet
   are these the most precious and soul-satisfying of the Truths of
   Revelation.

   I. With Jesus Christ Himself we begin by saying, first, that Jesus
   Himself is THE ESSENCE OF HIS OWN WORK and, therefore, how readily we
   ought to trust Him. Jesus Himself is the soul of His own salvation. How
   does the Apostle describe it? "He loved me, and gave Himself for me."
   He gave His crown, His Throne and His joys in Heaven for us, but that
   was not all--He gave Himself. He gave His life on earth and renounced
   all the comforts of existence. He bore all its woes. He gave His body,
   He gave His agony, He gave His heart's blood--but the summary of it is
   He gave Himself for me.

   "Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it." "Who His own self
   bore our sins in His own body on the tree." No proxy service here! No
   sacrifice which runs as far as His own Person and there stops! There
   was no limit to the grief of Jesus like that set upon the suffering of
   Job-- "Only on himself lay not your hand," or, "Only spare his life."
   No, every reserve was taken down, for He gave Himself. "He saved
   others, Himself He could not save," because He Himself was the very
   essence of His own sacrifice on our behalf. It is because He is what He
   is that He was able to redeem us! The dignity of His Person imparted
   efficacy to His Atonement. He is Divine, God over all, blessed forever
   and, therefore, infinite virtue is found in Him.

   He is Human and perfect in that humanity and, therefore, capable of
   obedience and suffering in man's place. He is able to save us because
   He is Immanuel--"God with us." If it were conceivable that an angel
   could have suffered the same agonies and have performed the same labors
   as our Lord, yet it is not conceivable that the same result would have
   followed. The pre-eminence of His Person imparted weight to His work.
   Always think, then, when you view the Atonement, that it is Jesus
   Himself who is the soul of it. Indeed the efficacy of His sacrifice
   lies there. Therefore the Apostle, in Hebrews, speaks of Him as having
   "by Himself purged our sins." This purging was worked by His Sacrifice,
   but the sacrifice was Himself!

   Paul says, "He offered up Himself." He stood as a Priest at the altar
   offering a bloody Sacrifice, but the offering was neither bullock, nor
   ram, nor turtle dove--it was Himself. "Once in the end of the world has
   He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself." The sole
   reason why we are well-pleasing with God is because of Him, for He is
   our sweet-smelling Offering. And the only cause for the putting away of
   our sin is found in Him because He is our Sin Offering. The cleansing
   by the blood and the washing by the water are the result, not of the
   blood and the water in and of themselves and separate from Him, but
   because they were the essentials of Himself. You see this, I am
   persuaded, without my enlarging upon it.

   Now, because of this, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself is the Object of
   our faith. Is He not always so described in Scripture? "Look unto Me
   and be you saved, all you ends of the earth"--not, "Look to My Cross,"
   nor, "Look to My life," nor, "to My death," much less, "to My
   sacraments or to My servants," but, "Look to ME." From His own lips the
   words sound forth, "Come unto Me all you that labor and are heavy
   laden, and I will give you rest." In fact, it is the Christian's life
   motto, "Looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith." May
   I not go farther and say how very simple and how very easy and natural
   ought faith to be from now on?

   I might be puzzled with various theories of the Atonement, but I can
   believe in Jesus Himself! I might be staggered by the many different
   mysteries which concern theology and overpower even masterminds, but I
   can confide in Jesus Himself! He is one whom it is difficult to
   distrust--His goodness, gentleness and truth command our confidence. We
   can and do trust in Jesus Himself! If He is proposed to me as my
   Savior, and if faith in Him is that which saves me, then at His dear
   feet I cast myself unreservedly and feel myself secure while He looks
   down on me. He who bled that sinners might be saved cannot be doubted
   any more! "Lord, I believe; help You my unbelief."

   Now you who have been looking to your faith, I want you to look to
   Jesus Himself rather than at your poor feeble faith. Now you who have
   been studying the results of faith in yourselves and are dissatisfied,
   I beseech you turn your eyes away from yourselves and look to Jesus
   Himself. Now you who cannot understand this and cannot understand that,
   give up wanting to understand, for a while, and come and look at Jesus
   Christ Himself, "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
   Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
   knowledge of Him." The Lord grant us Grace to view Jesus Christ Himself
   in the matter of our salvation as All in All, so that we may have
   personal dealings with Him and no longer think of Him as a mere idea,
   or as an historical personage, but as a personal Savior standing in the
   midst of us and bidding us enter into peace through Him!

   II. "Jesus Christ Himself' is, as we have said, THE SUBSTANCE OF THE
   GOSPEL and, therefore, how closely should we study Him. While He was
   here He taught His disciples, and the object of His teaching was that
   they might know Himself and through Him might know the Father. They did
   not learn very fast, but you see what He meant them to learn by the
   observation He made to Philip, "Have I been so long a time with you and
   yet have you not known Me, Philip?" He meant them to know Himself--and
   when He had risen from the dead the same objective was still before

   Him.

   As He walked with the two disciples to Emmaus they had a wide choice of
   subjects for conversation, but He chose the old theme and, "beginning
   at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded unto them in all the
   Scriptures the things concerning Himself." No topic was half as
   important or profitable! No mere man may come to teach himself, but
   this Divine One can have nothing better to reveal, for He Himself, the
   Incarnate God, is the chief of all the Truths of God! Therefore our
   Lord was concerned to be known to His people and, therefore, again and
   again we read that, "Jesus showed Himself unto His disciples."

   Whatever else they may be ignorant of, it is essential to disciples
   that they know their Lord, His Nature, His Character, His mind, His
   Spirit, His objective, His power--we must know in a word--we must know
   Jesus Himself. This also, Beloved, is the work of the Holy Spirit. "He
   shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of Me, and shall show it unto
   you." The Holy Spirit reveals Christ to us and in us. Whatever things
   Christ has spoken while He was here, the Holy Spirit opens to the mind
   and to the understanding. Thus by speaking of Christ within us, He
   carries on the work which our Lord began when here below. The Comforter
   is the Instructor and Jesus is the Lesson. I dare say you long to know
   a thousand things, but the main point of knowledge to be desired is
   Jesus Himself.

   This was His teaching and this is the Holy Spirit's teaching--and this
   is the end and objective of the Bible. Moses, Isaiah and all the
   Prophets spoke of Him--and the things which are recorded in this Book
   were written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ and, that
   believing, you might have life through His name. Precious is this Book,
   but its main preciousness lies in its revealing Jesus Himself. It is
   the field which contains the pearl of great price, the case which
   encloses Heaven's brightest jewel. We have missed our way in the Bible
   if its silken clue has not led us to the central chamber where we see
   Jesus Himself!

   We have never been truly taught of the Holy Spirit and we have missed
   the teaching of the life of Christ unless we have come to abide in
   Jesus Himself. To know Him is our beginning of wisdom and our crown of
   wisdom. To know Him is our first lesson on repentance and our last
   attainment as we enter Heaven. Our ambition is that we may know the
   love

   of Christ by which passes knowledge. Here is our life study and we have
   good in it, for these things the angels desire to look into. May the
   Lord grant that the eyes of your understanding may be enlightened so
   that you may know what is the hope of His calling and the riches of the
   glory of His inheritance in the saints.

   Beloved, because Jesus is the sum of the Gospel, He must be our
   constant theme. "God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross of
   our Lord Jesus Christ." "I determined not to know anything among you
   save Jesus Christ and Him crucified." So spoke men of old and so say
   we. When we have done preaching Christ we had better have done
   preaching--when you have done teaching in your classes Jesus Christ
   Himself, give up Sunday school work, for nothing else is worthy of your
   pains. Put out the sun and light is gone, life is gone, all is gone.
   When Jesus is pushed into the background or left out of a minister's
   teaching, the darkness is darkness that might be felt and the people
   escape from it into Gospel light as soon as they can.

   A sermon without Jesus in it is savorless and worthless to God's tried
   saints--they soon seek other food. The more of Christ in our testimony,
   the more of light and life and power to save. Some preachers are guilty
   of the most weary tautology, but this is not laid to their charge when
   their theme is Jesus! I have heard hearers declare that their minister
   appeared to have bought a barrel organ on which he could grind five or
   six tunes and no more--and these he ground out forever and ever, amen!
   They have been weary, very weary, of such vain repetitions. But to this
   day I never heard of anybody against whom the complaint was urged that
   he preached Christ too much, too often, too earnestly, or too joyfully!

   I never recollect seeing a single Christian man coming out of a
   congregation with a sorrowful face saying, "He extolled the Redeemer
   too highly. He grossly exaggerated the praises of our Savior." I do not
   remember ever meeting with a case in which the sick upon the bed of
   languishing have complained that thoughts of Jesus were burdensome to
   them. I never recollect that a single book has been denounced by
   earnest Christian men because it spoke too highly of the Lord and made
   Him too prominent. No, my Brethren, He who is the study of the saints
   must be the daily theme of ministers if they would feed the flock of
   God! No theme so moves the heart, so awakens the conscience, so
   satisfies the desires and so calms the fears. God forbid we should ever
   fail to preach Jesus Himself! There is no fear of exhausting the
   subject, nor of our driving away our hearers, for His words are still
   true, "I, if I am lifted up, will draw all men unto

   Me."

   III. Jesus Christ Himself is THE OBJECT OF OUR LOVE and how dear He
   should be. We can, all of us who are really saved, declare that, "We
   love Him because He first loved us." We have an intense affection for
   His blessed Person as well as gratitude for His salvation. The
   personality of Christ is a fact always to be kept prominently in our
   thoughts. The love of a truth is all very well, but the love of a
   person has far more power in it. We have heard of men dying for an
   idea, but it is infinitely more easy to awaken enthusiasm for a person.

   When an idea becomes embodied in a man, it has a force which in its
   abstract form is never wielded. Jesus Christ is loved by us as the
   embodiment of everything that is lovely, true, pure and of good report.
   He Himself is incarnate perfection inspired by love. We love His
   offices, we love the types which describe Him, we love the ordinances
   by which He is set forth--but we love Himself best of all. He Himself
   is our Beloved--our heart rests only in Him. Because we love Him we
   love His people and through Him we enter into union with them. Our text
   is taken from a verse which says, "Jesus Christ Himself being the chief
   cornerstone." He is the binder at the corner, joining Jew and Gentile
   in one temple. In Jesus those ancient differences cease, for He "has
   made both one and has broken down the middle wall of partition between
   us; to make in Himself of two one new man, so making peace."

   We are at one with every man who is at one with Christ. Only let our
   Lord say, "I love that man," and we love him at once. Let us only hope
   that our friend can say, "I love Jesus," and we hasten to respond, "And
   I love you for Jesus' sake." So warm is the fire of our love to Jesus
   that all His friends may sit at it and welcome! Our circle of affection
   comprehends all who in any shape or form have truly to do with Jesus
   Himself. Because we love Him we delight to render service to Him.
   Whatever service we do for His Church and for His Truth, we do for His
   sake. Even if we can only render it to the least of His brethren, we do
   it unto Him. The woman with the alabaster box of precious ointment is a
   type which we greatly prize, for she would only break the precious box
   for Him--and every drop of its delicious contents must be poured only
   upon His head.

   The bystanders complained of waste, but there can be no waste in
   anything that is done for Jesus. If the whole world, the heavens and
   the Heaven of heavens were all one great alabaster box, and if all the
   sweets which can be conceived were hidden within it, we would wish to
   see the whole broken, that every drop of the sweetness might be poured
   out for Jesus Christ Himself--

   "Jesus is worthy to receive Honor and power Divine. And blessings more
   than we can give Be, Lord, forever Thine."

   Oh our Beloved, if we can do anything for You, we are charmed at
   possessing such a privilege! If we are allowed to wash Your disciples'
   feet, or to care for the poorest of Your poor, or the least lamb of
   Your flock, we accept the office as a high honor, for we love You with
   all our hearts!

   Our love to Jesus should be as much a matter of fact as our affection
   for our husband, wife, or child--and it should be far more influential
   upon our lives. Love to our Lord is, I trust, moving all of you to
   personal service. You might have paid a subscription and allowed others
   to work, but you cannot do it when you see that Jesus gave Himself for
   you. Jesus Himself demands that I, myself, should be consecrated to His
   praise. Personal service is due to a personal Christ who personally
   loved and personally died for us! When nothing moves us to zeal, the
   jaded spirit cannot follow up its industries unless Jesus Himself
   appears and straightway our passions are all on fire and the fiery
   spirit compels the flesh to warm to its work. We even glory in
   infirmity when Jesus is near! And we venture upon works which otherwise
   had seemed impossible! We can do anything and everything for "Jesus
   Christ Himself."

   IV. Fourthly, our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is THE SOURCE OF ALL OUR
   JOY. We ought to rejoice when we have such a springing well of
   blessedness! In times of sorrow our solace is Jesus Himself. It is no
   small ground of comfort to a mourner that Jesus Himself is a Man. How
   cheering to read, "For as much as the children are partakers of flesh
   and blood, He, also, took part of the same." The humanity of Christ has
   a charm about it which only the quietly sorrowful discover. I have
   known what it is to gaze upon the Incarnation with calm repose of heart
   when my brain has seemed to be on fire with anguish.

   If Jesus is, indeed, my Brother, there is hope at all times! This is
   better balm than that of Gilead, "He Himself took our infirmities and
   bore our sicknesses." "For in that He Himself has suffered, being
   tempted, He is able, also, to succor them that are tempted." Pain,
   hunger, thirst, desertion, scorn and agony Jesus Himself has borne!
   Tempted in all like as we are, though without sin, He has become the
   Comforter of the sorrowful. Many and many a sufferer in the lone
   watches of the night has thought of Him and felt his strength renewed.
   Our patience revives when we see the Man of Sorrows silent before His
   accusers. Who can refuse to drink of His cup and to be baptized with
   His baptism?--

   "His way was much rougher and darker than mine. Did Christ, my Lord,
   suffer, and shall I repine?"

   The darkness of Gethsemane has been light to many an agonized soul and
   the passion, even unto death, has made the dying sing for joy of heart.
   Jesus Himself is the solace of our soul in sorrow--and when we emerge
   from the storm of distress into the deep calm of peace, as we often
   do--blessed be His name, He is our Peace! He left us peace by legacy
   and peace He creates in us. We never know deep peace of heart until we
   know the Lord Jesus Himself. Do you remember that sweet word when the
   disciples were met together, the doors being shut for fear of the
   Jews--"Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them and said, Peace be unto
   you"? Jesus Himself, you see, brought the message, for nothing but His
   Presence could make it effectual!

   When we see Him our spirit smells a sweet savor of rest. Where can an
   aching head find such another pillow as His bosom? On high days and
   holidays our spirits soar beyond rest--we ascend into the Heaven of joy
   and exultation--but it is our Lord's joy which is in us making our joy
   full. "Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord," and then
   are we, also, glad. By faith we see Jesus Himself enthroned and this
   has filled us with delight, for His glorification is our satisfaction.
   "Him, also, has God highly exalted and given Him a name which is above
   every name." I care not what becomes of me so long as He is glorified!

   The soldier dies happy when the shout of victory salutes his ear and
   his failing sight beholds his prince triumphant. What a joy to think
   that Jesus is risen--risen to die no more! The joy of Resurrection is
   superlative! What bliss to know that He has ascended, leading captivity
   captive! That He sits, now, enthroned in a happy state, and that He
   will come in

   all the glory of the Father to break His enemies in pieces as with a
   rod of iron! Here lies the grandest joy of His expectant Church--she
   has in reserve a mighty thunder of hosannas for that auspicious day! If
   there is any joy to be had, O Christian, that is both safe and sweet, a
   joy of which none can know too much, it is to be found in Him whom as
   yet you see not, but in whom believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable
   and full of glory!

   We must tear ourselves away from that thought to turn to another, but
   assuredly it is rich in happy memories and in blessed expectations.

   V. Fifthly, JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF IS THE MODEL OF OUR LIFE and,
   therefore, how blessed it is to be like

   He. As to our rule for life, we are like the disciples on the Mount of
   Transfiguration when Moses and Elijah had vanished, for we see "no man
   save Jesus only." Every virtue found in other men we find in Him in
   greater perfection! We admire the Grace of God in them, but Jesus
   Himself is our pattern. It was once said of Henry VIII, by a severe
   critic, that if the characteristics of all the tyrants that had ever
   lived had been forgotten, they might all have been seen come to life in
   that one king. We may more truly say of Jesus, if all graces, virtues
   and sweetnesses which have ever been seen in good men could all be
   forgotten, you might find them all in Him--for in Him dwells all that
   is good and great.

   We, therefore, desire to copy His Character and put our feet into His
   footprints. Be it ours to follow the Lamb wherever He goes! What says
   our Lord Himself? "Follow Me," and again, "Take My yoke upon you and
   learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest
   unto your souls." Not Christ's Apostle, but Christ Himself is our
   guide! We may not take a secondary model, but must imitate Jesus
   Himself. By the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and His gracious
   operations, we are developing into the image of Christ till Christ is
   formed in us. And we thus develop because the heavenly life in us is
   His own life. "I in them," said He. And again, "I am the life." For "we
   are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God." "He that has the Son
   has life, and he that has not the Son has not life."

   It is not passing through Baptism, nor bearing the name of Christ--it
   is having Jesus Himself in our hearts that makes us Christians--and in
   proportion as He is formed in us and the new life grows, we become more
   and more like He. And this is our prospect for eternity, that we are to
   be with Him and like He, for "when He shall appear, we shall be like
   He, for we shall see Him as He is." Think of Him, you that mourn your
   imperfectness today--think of Jesus Christ Himself--and then be assured
   that you are to be like He is! What a picture! Come, artist, bring your
   best skill! What can you do? All pencils fail to depict Him. It needs a
   poet's eye as well as an artist's hand to picture the Lovely One.

   But what can the poet do? Ah, you, also, fail. You cannot sing Him any
   more than your friend can paint Him. Fruitful conception and soaring
   imagination may come to your aid, but they cannot prevent your failure!
   He is too beautiful to be described--He must be seen. Yet here comes
   the marvel--"We shall be like He is"--like Jesus Christ Himself! O
   saint, when you are risen from the dead how lovely you will be! Will
   you know yourself? Today you are wrinkled with old age, scarred with
   the marks of disease and pain. Perhaps you are deformed by accident, or
   blanched with consumption--but none of these shall blemish you then!
   You will be without spot or wrinkle, faultless before the Throne--

   "O glorious hour!

   blessed abode!

   1 shall be near And like my God!"

   And not only in bodily form shall we be like He is whose eyes are as
   the eyes of doves and whose cheeks are as beds of spices--but in spirit
   and in soul shall we be perfectly conformed to the Well-Beloved! We
   shall be holy, even as He is holy and happy as He is happy. We shall
   enter into the joy of our Lord--the joy of Jesus Himself! I don't say
   that we can be Divine--that cannot be--but still, Brothers and Sisters,
   we shall be very near the Throne. O what rapture to know that my next
   of kin lives and when He shall stand, in the last day, upon the earth,
   I shall not only see God in this, my flesh, but I shall be like He is,
   for I shall see Him as He is! Christ Himself, then, becomes to us
   unspeakably precious, as the model of our present life and the image of
   the perfection towards which the Holy Spirit is working us.

   VI. Lastly, HE IS THE LORD OF OUR SOUL. How sweet it will be to with
   Him. We find, today, that His beloved

   company makes us move pleasantly whether we run in the way of His
   commands or the valley of the shadow of death. Saints have lain in
   dungeons and yet they have walked at liberty when He has been there!
   They have been stretched on the rack and even called it a bed of roses
   when He has stood by. One lay on a gridiron, with the hot fires beneath
   him, but amidst the flames he challenged his tormentors to do their
   worst! He laughed them to scorn, for his Lord was there!

   Martyrs have been seen to clap their hands when every finger burned
   like a lighted candle and they have been heard to cry," Christ is All,"
   "Christ is All!" When the Fourth, like unto the Son of God, walks in
   the furnace, all the fire can do is but snap their bonds and set the
   sufferers free! Oh, Brothers and Sisters, I am sure your only happiness
   that has been worth having has been found in knowing that He loved you
   and was near you! If you have ever rejoiced in the abundance of your
   corn and wine and oil, it has been a sorry joy--it has soon palled upon
   your taste--it never touched the great deeps of your spirit and soon it
   has gone and left you sorely wearied in heart.

   If you have rejoiced in your children, your kinsfolk and your bodily
   health, how readily has God sent a blight upon them all. But when you
   have rejoiced in Jesus, you have heard a voice bidding you proceed to
   further delights! That voice has cried, "Drink, O Friends, yes, drink
   abundantly, O Beloved." To be inebriated with such joy as this is to
   come to the best condition of mind and to fix the soul where it should
   be! We are never right till we come out of ourselves and into Jesus.
   But when the ecstatic state comes and we stand right out of self and
   stand in Him so that whether in the body or out of the body we can
   scarcely tell, God knows! Then are we getting back to where God meant
   man to have been when He walked with him in Eden--getting near to where
   God means we shall be when we shall see Him face to face!

   Brethren, what must the unveiled vision be! If the sight of Him, here,
   is so sweet, what must it be to see Him hereafter! It may be we shall
   not live till He comes, for the Master may tarry. But if He does not
   come and we, therefore, are called to pass through the gate of Death,
   we need not fear! I should not wonder if when we pass under the veil
   and come out in the disembodied state, one of our astonishments will be
   to find Jesus Himself there waiting to receive us! The soul hoped that
   a convoy of ministering angels would be near the bed and would escort
   it across the stream and up the mountains to the Celestial City--but
   no, instead thereof--our spirit will be saluted by the Lord Himself!

   Will it be amazed and cry, "It is He, even He, my best Beloved, Jesus
   Himself! He has come to meet me! Heaven might have been too great a
   surprise. Even my disembodied spirit might have swooned away, but it is
   He, the Man Christ Jesus whom I trusted down below and who was the dear
   companion of my dying hours! I have changed my place and state, but I
   have not changed my Friend nor changed my joy, for here He is." What a
   glance of love will that be which He will give to us and which we shall
   return to Him! Shall we ever take our eyes away from Him? Shall we ever
   wish to do so? Will not the poet's words be true--

   "Millions of years my wondering eyes, Shall over Your beauties rove.
   And endless ages I'll adore

   The glories of Your love."

   Within a week it may be our meeting with Jesus Himself may take place!
   Perhaps within an hour! A poor girl lying in the hospital was told by
   the doctor or the nurse that she could only live another hour. She
   waited patiently and when there remained only one quarter of an hour
   more, she exclaimed, "One more quarter of an hour and then"--she could
   not say what! Neither can I--but Jesus Himself has said, "Father, I
   will that they, also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am
   that they may behold My Glory." And as He has prayed, so shall it be
   and so let it be! Amen and Amen.

A Gospel Sermon To Outsiders

   (No. 1389)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, AUGUST 19, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Be of good comfort, rise; He calls you." Mark 10:49.

   Preached on a night when the Tabernacle was free to all comers, the
   regular congregation having vacated their seats.

   THESE open services, as most of you will judge, are intended to be
   purely evangelistic. No doubt a large number of Believers are here,
   many of them well-established in the faith, who would like to hear a
   doctrine argued, a type interpreted, or an apocalyptic symbol unfolded.
   But really, I cannot attend to you this evening. I feel something like
   Luther when preaching to a mixed assembly. He said, as nearly as I can
   remember, words to this effect, "I perceive in the Church Dr. Justus
   Jonas and Melancthon and other learned doctors. Now, if I preach to
   their edification, what is to become of the rest? Therefore, by their
   leave, I shall forget that Dr. Jonas is here at all and preach to the
   multitude." So must I do at this good hour, asking those of you who are
   advanced in the Divine life to unite your prayers with mine, which will
   continually ascend, that the Word of the Gospel may be blessed to the
   unconverted.

   Dear Friends, there are so many of you that have been, for years,
   listening to the proclamation of the Gospel. You are dwellers, almost,
   in Emmanuel's land, but not quite--that is why I feel most earnest that
   this night should be the time of your decision for the Savior--that you
   should not remain, any longer, hearers only, but should become
   believers and afterwards doers of the Word of God! There are gentlemen
   in England who can afford to drive a coach and four from town to town
   and carry nobody, performing their journeys for their own amusement,
   but I am not able or willing to do anything of that kind. Unless I can
   have my coach loaded with passengers to Heaven, I would sooner it were
   never started and had rather my team stayed in the stable.

   We must carry some souls to Heaven, for our call is from above and our
   time is too precious to throw away on mere pretense of doing good! We
   cannot play at preaching--we preach for eternity. We cannot feel
   satisfied merely to deliver sermons to senseless throngs, or to the
   most attentive crowds. Whatever smiles may greet us as we start and
   whatever salutation may welcome us at our close, we are not content
   unless Jesus works salvation by us! Our desire is that Grace should be
   magnified and that sinners should be saved. They used to jeer at the
   Tabernacle in Moorfields and the one in Tottenham Court Road. They
   called them Mr. Whitfield's soul traps. A very excellent name for a
   place of worship!

   Such may this Tabernacle always be! It ought to be a soul trap and we
   shall be disappointed, indeed, if there are not some souls taken in the
   trap tonight! If God does not bless the Word and make it so potent that
   some of you shall really close in with the Gospel proclamation and
   enter into eternal life, I shall be heavy of heart. Before I attempt to
   deal with my text, let me describe to you the plan of salvation. You
   know it, most of you. Oh that we could get at the thousands of London
   who do not know it! The multitudes that never enter a house of prayer
   or yield attention to the Gospel message! Our heart yearns over
   them--but what more can we do for them? They are perishing in willful
   ignorance.

   Thanks be to God that so many are here tonight! I will seize the
   opportunity to declare the plan of Grace. Though so many of you know
   it, let me tell it to you again. By sin, by unrighteousness, by
   violation of God's Law, we have broken our peace with God. We are lost,
   for He must punish sin. It is not possible that He should be the
   righteous Governor of the universe and allow sin to go unpunished! To
   punish sin is no arbitrary purpose of an angry God. It is inevitable in
   the universe that where there is evil, there should be suffering. If
   not in this life, yet in another life, which will shortly succeed that
   which now is, every transgression must receive its meet recompense of
   reward.

   The question is, how can we be forgiven? How, consistently with Divine
   Justice, can our iniquities be blotted out? This is not an impossible
   problem left for us to work out--God's way of peace is made clear by
   Divine Revelation. God,

   in His Infallible Word, has told us the means and appliances by which
   guilty sinners can be made righteous before Him. And, instead of being
   driven from His Presence at the last, he may be accepted and dwell at
   His right hand! He tells us that inasmuch as the first sin that ruined
   us was not ours, but Adam's, and by the transgression of one man we all
   fell, so it became possible for Him, in consistency with justice, to
   ordain that another Man should be forthcoming in whom we may rise and
   be restored!

   That other Man has come--"the second Adam, the Lord from Heaven." But
   the task of lifting up was much harder than that of casting down. A
   mere man could ruin us, but a mere man could not redeem and rescue us.
   Therefore, God Himself, the Ever-Blessed, clothed Himself with the
   nature of man, was born of a woman, lay in Bethlehem's manger, lived
   here on earth a life of humiliation and self-denial and, at the last,
   took upon Himself the sins of men in one vast load. Even as the fabled
   Atlas was said to carry the world upon his shoulders, so He took sin
   and guilt upon Him and bore it in His own body on the tree. Jesus hung
   on the Cross as the Substitute for all of our race that ever will
   believe on Him and then and there He put away, by His suffering, all
   the transgression and iniquity of believing men so that now we can
   preach to mankind and say, "He that believes in Him is not condemned.
   He that believes on the Son of God has everlasting life."

   When you go to a foreign city for the first time and stay at an inn, it
   may be that you miss your way when you go out and are not able to get
   back, again, as easily as you wish. It is generally expedient,
   therefore, for travelers to learn the main streets of every town which
   they visit. In Rome we come to know which way the Corso runs and when
   we get an idea of the run of that main thoroughfare we, by-and-by, are
   able to pick our way through the city. Now, the main street of the
   Gospel is Substitution. "He made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin,
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him." The main street
   of the Gospel runs crosswise--follow it and you will know the ins and
   outs of the other great streets before long. This is the high street of
   the City of Grace--"Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law,
   being made a curse for us."

   Christ stood in our place and suffered that we might not suffer. He
   "died, the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God." Whoever believes
   in Christ is saved from the damning power of sin and delivered from the
   wrath to come. Take this fact in all its breadth and length--and never
   doubt it--and you have the key of the Gospel. Whoever, I say, trusts
   his soul with the Lord Jesus Christ, relying on that Sacrifice which He
   offered, and that death which He endured, is saved! Let him not doubt
   it. He has God's Word for it--let him believe it and rejoice in it.
   "Whoever believes in Him is not condemned," for, "like as Moses lifted
   up the serpent in the wilderness, even so has the Son of Man been
   lifted up that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life." Simple, child-like reliance upon the Lord Jesus
   gives immediate and complete salvation to the trustful soul!

   Well, that is the main street of the city. Now how to get into it is
   the question. I earnestly desire and devoutly hope to be the means, if
   God will help me, of leading some there. May the Holy Spirit now bear
   witness with the Truth of God and make it the power of God unto
   salvation! Our text says, "Be of good comfort, rise; He calls you." Our
   first point is that some who are seeking Christ greatly need
   comforting. Secondly, their very best comfort lies in the fact that
   Jesus calls them. But, thirdly, if they take the comfort of that call,
   it urges them to immediate action--"Arise." "Be of good comfort, rise;
   He calls you."

   I. First, then, MANY PERSONS WHO ARE REALLY SEEKING THE SAVIOR GREATLY
   NEED COMFORTING. I know there are many such here tonight. You long
   after everlasting life. God has worked in you a desire to be reconciled
   to Himself but you need encouraging, for you labor under a sort of
   undefined fear that these good things are not for you. Partly your
   conscience, partly your unbelief and partly Satan--these three have
   joined together to throw a darkness over you--and you really think that
   you cannot be forgiven. You would not like to put it into exactly those
   words, but such is the tenor of your thoughts.

   There is a hazy idea about you that there are many very good saintly
   people who will be saved and, indeed, that there are some great
   transgressors who will be saved--but you do not think that you can be.
   Oh that I could destroy that unbelieving thought! There is salvation,
   there is mercy, there is forgiveness and it is free to every soul that
   will come and take it! It is as free as the air you breathe, or as the
   water leaping from the street fountain yonder. "Whoever will, let him
   come and take of the Water of Life freely." You are mistaken in your
   gloomy reflections! You write bitter things against yourself, but God
   has not written them! What if you should take heart and get
   hope--"Perhaps I may tonight find

   eternal life. Perhaps I may tonight go out of this house relieved of
   the burden of my sin"? It were a good beginning if you had such a hope,
   but you may with confidence go a great deal further than that!

   It may be that you are cast down because you think that you have been
   seeking in vain. You began to pray a few months ago, young man, and I
   am glad to hear of it! But you have not yet obtained peace. Do not give
   up praying! I know you are discouraged, but do not cease seeking. I,
   myself, was for many months an earnest seeker after God by the way of
   prayer. I thought that by importunate prayer I should find pardon. I
   did not understand that He had said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
   and you shall be saved." So I set to work praying. Nevertheless, I am
   thankful that I did not cease from prayer, though it often seemed as if
   I wasted my words and spent my tears for nothing. Be not discouraged.
   This blind man was not heard at first, though he cried earnestly. He
   had to cry for sight again and again, increasing in vehemence each
   time.

   Do not be driven to despair! There may be delays, but there shall never
   be denials to those who cry in earnest. Be of good comfort. Press on,
   dear Heart, press on, and you shall find peace and comfort! Perhaps,
   too, you are sad because there are many round you who discourage you.
   They tell you there is nothing in religion. How should they know?
   Theirs is a strange infatuation. There are a great many individuals in
   the world who are considered to be honest in business-- you would take
   their note of hand and you would trust their word about any goods they
   were selling. And yet when these good folks begin to say that they are
   conscious of a new life within them. That they have found out that God
   is real and spiritual--and that they have received a Spirit which
   dwells within them, or that they commune with God--straightway a number
   of people say that it is not true! In effect they are calling them
   liars.

   But why not true? On what ground are they to be discredited? Simply
   because the aforesaid people who deny it say that they never saw such a
   thing themselves and never felt such a thing themselves? But if there
   were a world full of blind people and among them a few persons blessed
   with sight, whose eyes had been opened--if these began to talk of
   sunlight and color, all the blind men might say, "It is not true!" Why?
   "Because we never saw the sunlight or the color." Does that prove that
   it is not true? Though you do not possess the faculties of vision,
   others do. If those men are honest in other things, they have as much
   right to be believed in this thing as in the rest. We solemnly assert
   that there is something real in religion! It is not a creed--alone, it
   is a life!

   The regenerate belong to a new creation. If any man is in Christ, he is
   a new creature with new faculties and new powers so that he is
   introduced into altogether a new world. Do not believe those, then, who
   tell you that there is nothing in it, for they do not know and,
   therefore, are not fair witnesses! They can witness to nothing but the
   fact that they are not in the secret. The man who was brought up for a
   murder which was sworn against him by six witnesses said that he ought
   not to be condemned because he could bring 60 witnesses who did not see
   him do it. Of course he could! And so we can bring 60,000 people to say
   there is no spiritual life because they have never felt it! What does
   that prove? It only proves that they know nothing about it!

   But if you bring a few--even though they should be but a
   few--straightforward, honest, simple-minded people whom you would
   believe in other things, you are bound to accept their testimony about
   this. There is something real in faith in Jesus! There is a peace which
   passes all understanding obtained through pardoned sin. There is a new
   birth, for we have felt it! There is a new life, for we enjoy it! There
   is a joy that leaps over earth's narrow bounds. There is a rest of
   heart akin to the rest of the blessed in Heaven and it can be enjoyed
   here and now! Thousands of us bear witness that it is so! Do not be
   discouraged then, for we tell you no old wives' fables, but the very
   Truth of God which we have, ourselves, tasted and handled! You that are
   seeking after eternal life need not be baffled by skeptics. We are true
   men and tell you what we have proved for ourselves. You will yet find
   it to be as God declares.

   One reason why you have not obtained comfort is, perhaps, because you
   do not know all the Gospel yet. Good news half told may often seem to
   be bad news. I have read that in the days of the flag and light
   signals, a message came across to England concerning the Duke of
   Wellington and half the message was read as it appeared, and astonished
   all England with the sad intelligence. It ran thus, "Wellington
   defeated." Everybody was distressed as they read it but it so happened
   that they had not seen all the message. Fog had intervened, and when,
   by-and-by, the air was clearer and the lights flashed out a second
   time, it was read thus--"Wellington defeated the French"--quite another
   thing! It was quite the reverse, indeed, of what half the message had
   led men to fear. Thus when you hear half the Gospel it may appear to
   condemn you--but you have only to hear the other half to find out its
   encouraging tidings.

   I would say be diligent in hearing the Gospel. Be diligent in searching
   it out in the sacred Book which God has given us. And when you know the
   Truths of God more fully you will find faith comes to you by the
   hearing and the understanding of the Word of God. Leave those ministers
   who preach only a portion of the Gospel--try to know all the message of
   love and you will, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, soon lose your
   fears. Do you not think, too, that some seekers miss comfort because
   they forget that Jesus Christ is alive? The Christ of the Church of
   Rome is always depicted in one of two positions--either as a babe in
   His mother's arms, or else as dead.

   That is Rome's Christ! But our Christ is alive. Jesus who rose has
   "left the dead no more to die." I was requested in Turin to join with
   others in asking to see the shroud in which the Savior was buried. I
   must confess that I had not faith enough to believe in the shroud, nor
   had I curiosity enough to wish to look at the fictitious linen. I would
   not care a penny for the article even if I knew it to be genuine! Our
   Lord has left His shroud and sepulcher and lives in Heaven! Tonight He
   so lives that a sigh of yours will reach Him, a tear will find Him, a
   desire in your heart will bring Him to you! Only seek Him as a loving,
   living Savior and put your trust in Him as risen from the dead no more
   to die, and comfort will, I trust, come into your spirit.

   Perhaps, too, you have a notion that conversion is something very
   difficult. A young woman came to me, the other day, after a service, to
   ask me whether I really meant what I said when I declared that he that
   believed in Jesus Christ was saved then and there. "Yes," I said, and I
   gave her the Scriptural guarantee for it. "Why," she said, "my
   grandfather told me that when he found religion it took him six months
   and they had nearly to put him into a lunatic asylum, he was in such a
   dreadful state of mind." "Well, well," I said, "that sometimes happens.
   But that distress of his did not save him! That was simply his
   conscience and Satan keeping him away from Christ. When he was saved it
   was not by his deep feelings--it was by his believing in Jesus Christ."
   I then went on to set Christ before her as our only ground of hope in
   opposition to inward feelings.

   "I see it," she said! And I rejoiced as I noticed the bright light that
   passed over her face--a flash of heavenly sunlight which I have often
   seen on the countenances of those who have believed in Jesus
   Christ--when peace fills the soul even to the brim and lights up the
   countenance with a minor transfiguration. It is so. You have but to
   trust Christ and it is done! But you are afraid. Have you ever heard of
   the man who lost his way, one night, and came to the edge of a
   precipice, as he thought, and fell over? He clutched at some old tree
   and hung there, clinging to his frail support with all his might, for
   he felt that he should be dashed to pieces if he fell. There he hung
   till he got into a desperate state of fever and his hands could hold
   his body no longer! So at last he dropped and fell--about six
   inches--onto a smooth mossy bank where he lay, altogether unhurt, and
   quite safe.

   Now, there are many who think that sure destruction must await them if
   they confess sin and resign all into the hands of God. It is an idle
   fear! Give up your hold upon everything but Christ and drop down! Soft
   and mossy shall the bank be which receives you! Jesus Christ, by His
   love and by the efficacy of His precious blood, shall give you
   immediate rest and peace. Only drop now. Drop down at once! This is the
   major part of faith--the giving up of every other hold and simply
   falling upon Christ. That dropping down will bring you present
   salvation.

   II. Now, in the second place, the greatest comfort which I can very
   well conceive is that which is conveyed in the text.

   It is this--"BE OF GOOD COMFORT, RISE; HE CALLS YOU"--a good word for
   the blind man, for he knew that

   Jesus did not call him to mock him, and that He did not say, "come
   here" that He might merely tell him, "your eyes cannot be opened."
   Jesus did not call him to sport with him and send him away
   disappointed. Christ's calls are honest calls and guarantee blessing to
   those who accept them.

   Now, beloved Friends, there are two calls mentioned in Scripture. The
   one is the general call of the Gospel and the other is the effectual
   call, the personal call, by which men are saved. The general universal
   call ought to yield great comfort to any seeking soul. In the Word of
   God, you, dear Hearer, are called to come to Christ, even you! Why do I
   know that? Because when Jesus gave the commission to His disciples He
   said, "Go you into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
   creature." You are a creature, are you not? Well, then, you must be
   included in that range! We are to preach the Gospel to you. And then
   again, "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that
   Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners."

   You are a sinner, are you not? Do you admit that? Very well, then,
   according to the text that faithful saying is to be addressed to you.
   And you, dear Seeker, feel a burden upon your soul, do you not? You are
   laboring hard to get

   salvation. Therefore, the Gospel call must be addressed to you. "Come
   unto Me all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest." Indeed there are many such calls, but there is another which
   must include you--"Whoever will, let him come and take the Water of
   Life freely." Are you willing to come? Then you are undoubtedly called
   to come to Christ! Should not that fact comfort you? Remember, as I
   have already said, He does not call you to mock you, or invite you to
   come without intending to bless you. Oh hear His honest call! Pluck up
   courage and come to Him!

   Nobody feels any trouble about going where there is a general
   invitation. Did you ever cross the Mont St. Bernard? If so, I do not
   suppose you needed much pressing to turn into the hospice, there, and
   spend the night! When they came out and told you that everybody was
   welcome, rich and poor, and that travelers nearly all stayed there, you
   turned in! I went the other day to St. Cross Hospital, near Winchester,
   which some of you may know. There they give away a piece of bread to
   everybody who knocks at the door. I knocked as bold as brass. Why
   shouldn't I? If they gave the bread away to everybody, why should not I
   have my piece? And so, of course, the hatch was opened and I had my
   little piece of bread with the friends who were with me. It was a gift
   to be given to everybody that called. I did not humble myself
   particularly and make anything special of it. It was for all and I came
   and received as one of the people who were willing to knock.

   Now, even so, if the Gospel is to be preached to every creature, why do
   you stand higgling and haggling when you need the Bread of Life? Why
   should you waste time in raising question after question when you only
   need to take what Jesus freely gives? I guarantee you do not raise such
   quibbles against yourselves in money matters! If an estate is
   bequeathed you, you do not employ a solicitor to hunt for flaws in the
   title, or to invent objections to the will! Why do men raise
   difficulties against their own salvation, instead of cheerfully
   accepting what the infinite mercy of God so graciously provides for all
   who, with broken hearts and willing minds, are ready to take what God
   the Ever-Bountiful is so pleased to give? The invitation is so large
   and there is this to be noted concerning it--no one was ever refused
   yet!

   There is a well-known institution in London which bears across the
   front of it, "No destitute boy ever refused." Well may we put this over
   Christ's great house of mercy--"No destitute soul ever refused." I can
   imagine two boys standing on the pavement in front of Dr. Barnardo's
   institution and one saying to the other, "Can we go in there?" "Yes,"
   says the other, "I should rather think we could. We are destitute,
   aren't we? Look here, my clothes are all in rags and I have not a penny
   in the world, and no father and no mother. I slept under a dry arch
   last night. I am a destitute boy, and no mistake of that." I can only
   suppose that the other might boastfully say, "I ain't destitute, not I!
   I can earn my living any day and I have got a half-crown in my pocket."

   Now, that fellow has no claim to be admitted because he is not
   destitute. But the boy who is hungry and ragged and homeless is sure to
   be welcomed. As he reads those lines, "No destitute boy ever refused,"
   he says, "There is hope for me, then." Now, then, destitute Soul, Jesus
   Christ never refused one like you yet! If you have a store of merit of
   your own--if you believe you can be saved by your good works--you do
   not come under the heading of "destitute." "The whole have no need of a
   physician, but they that are sick." But if you are stripped of all
   boasting. If you are brought to bankruptcy as to personal merit. If you
   have come down to absolute poverty as to any hope in yourself, then, as
   no destitute soul ever was rejected or ever shall be, come to Jesus at
   once! Come at once, I say. "Be of good comfort, rise; He calls you."

   But, dear Friends, I said that there was another and an effectual call.
   That call the Holy Spirit directs to individuals and when it comes, it
   is not resisted, or if resisted for a while, it is ultimately yielded
   to, so that the man is constrained to come. O Holy Spirit, give that
   call tonight! There were two brothers fishing and Jesus said to them,
   "Follow Me." They threw down their nets and followed Him. Matthew was
   sitting at the receipt of customs with his pen behind his ear and his
   account books before him. Jesus said, "Follow Me." Up Matthew rose and
   followed Him at once. That little fellow, the tax gatherer, had climbed
   up a tree because, being short of stature, he could not see over the
   heads of the crowd. While he was looking down from among the leafy
   branches, the Master stood at the bottom of the tree and said,
   "Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must abide in your
   house."

   Down came Zacchaeus! How could he help it? The Spirit of God had given
   the effectual call and Christ was in that man's house shortly
   after--and the man gave abundant evidence of a change of heart. Oh, may
   the eternal Spirit speak in that fashion to some here present so that
   they may at once yield and follow Jesus Christ! That call, wherever it
   comes, casts a sweet softness over the soul. The man cannot make it
   out, but he feels so differently from what he did before. The iron
   sinew of his neck is gone. The cold stone within his breast has melted
   into flesh. He listens to the Gospel which once

   he despised. Listening, he thinks--and it is a grand matter to get a
   man to think about himself, his God, eternity, Heaven, Hell, the
   Redeemer. As he thinks, he sees his life in a different light.

   He perceives that there has been sin in it--very much more of sin than
   he ever thought could have been there--and as he sees his sin, he
   mourns over it. He almost wishes that he had never been born rather
   than have transgressed as he has done. His heart softens under the
   influence of the Law of God. He lays aside his proud boasts and
   confesses that he is full of transgression and sin. Next to this
   thoughtfulness and repentance comes a little hope--he perceives that
   there is a salvation worth having and he asks himself why he should not
   have it. Then comes faith--he perceives that Jesus is the Son of God
   and he says to himself, "the Divine, He can save even me!" He trusts
   and, as he trusts, the darkness which enveloped him begins to
   disappear. He obtains a little light and yet a little more! And at last
   he cries, "I do believe that Jesus died for me. I rest my soul in His
   pierced hands. I am forgiven--I am saved."

   That man has been called by the blessed Spirit! It is very strange,
   too, how God calls some men. I have known it happen many times in this
   Tabernacle. I have been preaching and I have made a remark which has
   suited the case as well as if I had been that man's companion or
   better. How was it? I will tell you. God had been at work on that man
   and He led His servant to work to the same point. The Lord was, by His
   Providence, tunneling one side of the mountain of the man's
   indifference and then He set me to work on the other side by guiding me
   in my thoughts so that I preached the Gospel in a suitable manner. Just
   as when they made the Mont Cenis tunnel, one set of engineers were
   boring one way and one set the other way--and then they met in the
   heart of the great mass.

   A pious mother has been boring away at the mountain by her entreaties,
   or an earnest Christian teacher, or a wife or a sister has been at the
   same work. Perhaps sickness, like the diamond boring rod, has been
   piercing into the man and then, at last, in this place, the Word of the
   Lord has exactly hit the case so that the tunnel through the soul has
   been completed, and eternal salvation has been the result! Perhaps the
   chance words of this night are no chance words to some of you now
   present, but the very words of God sent straight to your soul! O God,
   grant that it may be so and You shall have the praise. O Blessed
   Spirit, let it be!

   III. Now, lest I weary you, I am going to close with the third head
   which is THE COMFORT DRAWN FROM OUR CALLING SHOULD LEAD TO IMMEDIATE
   ACTION. "Be of good comfort, rise; He calls you." That exhortation to
   rise means instant decision. You have been hesitating and hanging like
   the scales of a balance, trembling between Heaven and Hell. Which is it
   to be? May the Holy Spirit call you so that it shall be Christ,
   salvation, eternal life! I am not always sorry when men grow angry
   while hearing a sermon. The worst thing that can happen to me tonight
   is for you all to be satisfied! But when some people get very angry
   they will think--and thinking they will feel--and feeling they may turn

   to God.

   Despite their anger they will come again. The hook is in the man's
   jaws. We shall have that fish! Let him draw out the line further and
   further, for it will hold him. Let him have play. We shall have him
   back, again, before long. Have the landing net ready! There is nothing
   better for some men than to have their antagonism to the Gospel
   awakened for a time. The Truth of God has come home to them. It is at
   work on them and, before long, we trust the blessed work will be
   complete and the soul will be saved! This is the point aimed at.
   "Rise," says the text. That is, do not let it be any longer a question,
   "Shall it be?" or, "Shall it not be?" but decide tonight, "It shall be!
   By the Grace of God I will be a Christian. By the Grace of God, if
   there is salvation to be had, I will have it." I do not ask you to come
   to that decision for the mere sake of making a decision which you will
   cordially adopt and then carelessly forget. But I ask the Grace of God
   to lead you to say with purpose of heart, "It shall be."

   Alas, very many of you come and go! You hear and hear without
   profit--for it ends in hearing and never ripens into decision. Too many
   of our regular hearers still remain unconverted though occasional
   hearers have been saved. When you take hold of a piece of India rubber,
   you may make any impression that you like all over it, but finally it
   resumes its old shape. There are hosts of hearers of that kind--very
   impressible, but they quickly return to their old tastes and habits.
   But you meet with other people who seem to be hard as rock. I have
   observed some who have sat in the aisle biting their lips who have
   never intended to believe the Gospel--and yet with one blow of the
   Master's hammer, their hearts have gone to shivers at once! Their armor
   of resistance and their mail of defiance have been broken through--and
   they have proven, afterwards, the heartiest and most earnest of
   Christian converts!

   That is an unfortunate impressibility which ends in indecision. Those
   who show this plastic character mean to be right, but they manage to
   remain in the wrong. They intend to go to Heaven, but, alas, alas,
   little hope is there that they will ever reach the Celestial City of
   the blessed. The probabilities are against it--they have passed so many
   years in procrastination that their indecision has become chronic and
   fetters them to their sins! After the many seasons in which fair leaves
   have disappointed the hope of sweet fruits, our despondency is, we
   fear, the herald of their despair. There seems so little probability
   that they will ever decide for God and for His Christ that we scarcely
   hope with trembling-- no, we tremble to hope! Would God it were not so.
   Oh dear Friends! I pray you listen to the text--"Be of good comfort,
   rise; He calls you." Rise! Rise to something more than decision--rise
   to resolution!

   You have all heard of the poor woman who could not get justice done her
   by the judge. She called on him a great many times, but he would not
   listen to her. At length she made up her mind that he should attend to
   her. So she was present on the first court day and as soon as the judge
   came in she rose and said, "My Lord--" "Have I not told you not to
   trouble me?" "But, my Lord," she cried again. "I tell you to sit down."
   She sits down, but before the court is up, she says, "Can't I have a
   hearing?" "I cannot attend to you now, my good woman." But when the
   judge comes out of court to go home, there she is, standing at the
   carriage window, saying, "When will you hear my case? There are my poor
   children starving."

   She goes to the judge's house and knocks at untimely hours. "Who is
   it?" the judge asks. And his servants tell him, "It is that poor woman
   who wants her case to be heard." He bids them chase her from his gate.
   She goes home, sad but determined, and the next morning she is in court
   again. The unjust judge had commanded the ushers not to let her in, but
   she has entered somehow, and the first thing that is heard is that
   shrill voice-- "My Lord, will you hear me?" At last he grows tired and
   he says, "Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow
   troubles me I will avenge her." And he does avenge her! Though the just
   God bears no resemblance to an unjust judge, yet the widow's
   importunity that prevailed in the teeth of such unpromising surrounding
   may urge you to incessant prayer!

   Treat the great God with the importunity which Christ, by so bold a
   simile, counsels and commends. Say thus to yourself--"I cannot perish.
   But I must perish if I do not have salvation and, therefore, I will
   have it! I will die at the foot of the Cross if die I must, but I will
   have it." It happened to me some few years ago to have to lecture at
   the City Hall, Glasgow. I went at the hour appointed to keep my
   engagement and the Provost of Glasgow went to the hall with me, but the
   policeman said that he could not let us in, for we had no tickets and
   his orders were to admit none without them. That was a pretty state of
   things. So the Lord Provost said, "But you must let us in." The
   policeman said that he could not, no matter who we were.

   I said, "This is the Lord Provost," but the policeman said he did not
   know that, neither did he care who he was--he should not let us pass
   against rules. He had received orders from the inspector to let nobody
   in and he was sure no Lord Provost would wish him to disobey orders.
   Then the Lord Provost said, "But this is Mr. Spurgeon. He has got to
   deliver the lecture." "I cannot help that. I have my orders and he
   shall not come in without a ticket." What do you think we did? Did we
   take, "No," for an answer? Not so! We meant to get in. So we talked and
   parleyed and reasoned, but he, like a good policeman, did his duty and
   would take no commands from us which were contrary to orders. There we
   stopped. At last he was condescending enough to let us send our cards
   in to his inspector and straightway we were admitted.

   Now, if we had taken, "No," for an answer and had gone away, I should
   have had, to this day, the reputation of having gathered the people
   together to disappoint them. No, I knew I had a right to go in and I
   meant to get in--and I did get in. You must do the same. Even though
   your sin should condemn you, the Law should denounce you and the
   officer of Justice should refuse you and say, "You cannot come in! No
   sinner comes this way," yet insist upon it that you are a creature and
   a sinner--that the Gospel is sent to every creature and specially
   invites sinners and, therefore, you mean to go in to the feast of
   Grace, no matter who may oppose! Stand to it that you will enter and,
   as surely as God is true, if there is this resolve and perseverance in
   you, you shall enter into the banquet of love--you shall inherit
   eternal life--and rejoice forevermore!

   But, dear Friends, if you get to that decision and resolution, there is
   one thing more, and that is, cast away everything that hinders you from
   finding salvation. The poor blind man cast away his garment. Now, if
   you would be saved you must resolve in your soul, by the blessing of
   the Holy Spirit, that every sin and every habit of yours which hinders
   your finding Christ shall, at once, be given up. There is no pleasure
   worth keeping at the price of your soul! No

   sin is worth preserving on any account whatever--let all your old
   pleasures and habits go! Let them all go and give yourself up to Jesus
   Christ! How I wish that many, tonight, might be led to say, "There is
   salvation, then, for me by believing. I believe that the Word of God is
   true and I take Christ to be mine." Give yourselves up wholly to
   Christ. No half measures! No hesitating and halting now!

   You know what Cortez did when he went to Mexico and intended to conquer
   it? The soldiers that were with him were few and dispirited. The
   Mexicans were many and the enterprise very dangerous. The soldiers
   would have gone back to Spain, but Cortez took two or three chosen
   heroes with him and went down to the seaside and destroyed up all his
   ships. "Now," he said, we must conquer or die! We cannot go back." Burn
   your boats! Get rid of all thoughts of return! Leave sin and abhor it!
   God help you to do it, for this is His Gospel--"Repent and be
   converted, every one of you." Forsake sin and believe in Jesus Christ!
   And let the boats be burned, making this your resolution--that there
   shall be no going back to sin!

   Thus have I told you what should be done, but God alone can make you do
   it. We can lead a horse to the water, but we cannot make him drink--so
   we can set the plan of salvation before men, but we cannot induce them
   to accept it, except only as, in answer to prayer, the eternal Spirit
   moves in the souls of men. He is moving upon you now! We are conscious
   that He is brooding over some of you at this hour! Do not resist Him!
   Yield yourselves wholly to His monitions. As the bulrushes in the
   stream bow their heads to the passing breeze, so bow before the motions
   of the ever-blessed Spirit! May He help you to do so, for Jesus' sake.
   Amen.

Brief, Silent Prayer

   (No. 1390)

   DELIVERED ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 9, 1877,

   BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "So I prayed to the God of Heaven." Nehemiah 2:4.

   Nehemiah had made inquiry as to the state of the city of Jerusalem and
   the tidings he heard caused him bitter grief. "Why should not my
   countenance be sad," he said, "when the city, the place of my fathers'
   sepulchers, lies waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?"
   He could not endure that it should be a mere ruinous heap--that city
   which was once beautiful and the joy of the whole earth! Laying the
   matter to heart, he did not begin to speak to other people about what
   they would do, nor did he draw up a wonderful scheme about what might
   be done if so many thousand people joined in the enterprise.

   No, it occurred to him that he should do something himself. This is
   just the way that practical men start a matter. The unpractical will
   plan, arrange and speculate about what may be done, but the genuine,
   thorough-going lover of Zion puts this question to himself--"What can
   you do? Nehemiah, what can you, yourself, do? Come, it has to be done,
   and you are the man that is to do it--at least, to do your share. What
   can you do?" Coming so far, he resolved to set apart a time for prayer.
   It never left his thoughts for nearly four months! Day and night
   Jerusalem seemed written on his heart, as if the name was painted on
   his eyeballs. He could only see Jerusalem. When he slept he dreamed
   about Jerusalem. When he woke, the first thought was, "Poor Jerusalem!"
   and before he fell asleep again his evening prayer was for the ruined
   walls of Jerusalem.

   The man of one thing, you know, is a terrible man--and when one single
   passion has absorbed the whole of his manhood, something will be sure
   to come of it. Depend upon that. The desire of his heart will develop
   into some open demonstration, especially if he talks the matter over
   with God in prayer. Something did come of this. Before long Nehemiah
   had an opportunity. Men of God, if you want to serve God and cannot
   find the propitious occasion, wait awhile in prayer and your
   opportunity will break on your path like a sunbeam! There was never a
   true and valiant heart that failed to find a fitting sphere somewhere
   or other in God's service. Every diligent laborer is needed in some
   part of His vineyard. You may have to linger. You may seem as if you
   stood in the market idle because your Master would not engage you, but
   wait there in prayer--and with your heart boiling over with a warm
   purpose--your chance will come.

   The hour will need its man and if you are ready, you, as a man, shall
   not be without your hour. God sent Nehemiah an opportunity. That
   opportunity came, 'tis true, in a way which he could not have expected.
   It came through his own sadness of heart. This matter preyed upon his
   mind till he began to look exceedingly unhappy. I cannot tell whether
   others noticed it, but the king whom he served, when he went into court
   with the royal goblet, noticed the distress on the cupbearer's
   countenance and said to him, "Why is your countenance sad, seeing you
   are not sick? This is nothing else but sorrow of heart."

   Nehemiah little knew that his prayer was making the occasion for him.
   The prayer was registering itself upon his face. His fasting was making
   its marks upon his visage and, though he did not know it, he was, in
   that way, preparing the opportunity for himself when he went in before
   the king. But you see, when the opportunity did come, there was trouble
   with it, for he says, "I was very sore afraid." You want to serve God,
   young man. You want to be at work. Perhaps you do not know what that
   work involves. It is not all pleasure. You are longing for the battle,
   young soldier--you have not smelled powder, yet, and when you have been
   in a battle and have had a few cuts, or a bullet or two have pierced
   you-- you may not feel quite so eager for the fray!

   Yet the courageous man sets those things aside and is ready to serve
   his country or his sovereign. And so the courageous Christian puts all
   difficulty aside and he is ready to serve his comrades and his God,
   cost what it may! What if I should be sore afraid? Yet so let it be, my
   God, if thus there shall be an opportunity to seek and to secure the
   welfare of

   Jerusalem for Your servant who longs to promote it with all his heart.
   Thus have we traced Nehemiah up to the particular point where our text
   concerns him. The king, Artaxerxes, having asked him why he was sad, he
   had an opportunity of telling him that the city of his fathers was a
   ruin. Thereupon the king asks him what he really wishes. By the manner
   of the question he would seem to imply an assurance that he means to
   help Nehemiah.

   And here we are somewhat surprised to find that instead of promptly
   answering the king--the answer is not given immediately--an incident
   occurs, a fact is related. Though he was a man who had lately given
   himself up to prayer and fasting, this little parenthesis occurs--"So I
   prayed to the God of Heaven." My preamble leads up to this parenthesis.
   Upon this prayer I propose to preach. The fact that Nehemiah prayed
   challenges attention! He had been asked a question by his sovereign.
   The proper thing, you would suppose, was to answer it. Not so. Before
   he answered, he prayed to the God of Heaven. I do not suppose the king
   noticed the pause. Probably the interval was not long enough to be
   noticed, but it was long enough for God to notice it--long enough for
   Nehemiah to have sought and have obtained guidance from God as to how
   to frame his answer to the king.

   Are you not surprised to find a man of God having time to pray to God
   between a question and an answer? Yet Nehemiah found that time. We are
   the more astonished at his praying because he was so evidently
   perturbed in mind, for, according to the second verse, he was very
   afraid. When you are fluttered and put out, you may forget to pray. Do
   you not, some of you, account it a valid excuse for omitting your
   ordinary devotion? At least, if anyone had said to you, "You did not
   pray when you were about that business," you would have replied, "How
   could I? There was a question that I was obliged to answer. I dared not
   hesitate. It was a king that asked it. I was in a state of confusion. I
   really was so distressed and terrified that I was not master of my own
   emotions. I hardly knew what I did. If I did not pray, surely the
   omission may be overlooked. I was in a state of wild alarm."

   Nehemiah, however, felt that if he was alarmed, it was a reason for
   praying, not for forgetting to pray! So habitually was he in communion
   with God, that as soon as he found himself in a dilemma, he flew away
   to God, just as the dove would fly to hide herself in the clefts of the
   rock. His prayer was the more remarkable on this occasion because he
   must have felt very eager about his objective. The king asks him what
   it is he needs and his whole heart is set upon building up Jerusalem.
   Are you not surprised that he did not at once say, "O king, live
   forever! I long to build up Jerusalem's walls. Give me all the help you
   can"? But no, eager as he was to pounce upon the desired objective, he
   withdraws his hand until it is said, "So I prayed to the God of
   Heaven."

   I confess I admire him! I desire, also, to imitate him. I would that
   every Christian's heart might have just that holy caution that did not
   permit him to make such haste as to find ill-speed. "Prayer and
   provender hinder no man's journey." Certainly, when the desire of our
   heart is close before us, we are anxious to seize it. But we shall be
   all the surer of getting the bird we spy in the bush to be a bird we
   grasp in the hand if we quietly pause, lift up our heart and pray the
   God of Heaven! It is all the more surprising that he should have
   deliberately prayed just then because he had been already praying for
   the past three or four months concerning the same matter. Some of us
   would have said, "That is the thing I have been praying for--now all I
   have to do is to take it and use it! Why pray any more? After all, my
   midnight tears and daily cries, and setting myself apart by fasting to
   cry unto the God of Heaven--after such an anxious conference, surely,
   at last, the answer has come! What is to be done but to take the good
   that God provides me and rejoice in it?"

   But no, you will always find that the man who has prayed much is the
   man who prays more. "For unto everyone that has, shall be given, and he
   shall have abundance." If you do but know the sweet art of prayer, you
   are the man that will be often engaged in it. If you are familiar with
   the Mercy Seat, you will constantly visit it--

   "For who that knows the power of prayer But wishes to be often there?"

   Although Nehemiah had been praying all this while, he nevertheless must
   offer another petition. "So I prayed to the God of Heaven." One thing
   more is worth remembering, namely that he was in a king's palace and in
   the palace of a heathen king, too--and he was in the very act of
   handing up to the king a goblet of wine. He was fulfilling his part in
   the state festival, I doubt not, among the glare of lamps and the
   glitter of gold and silver. He was in the midst of princes and peers of
   the realm. Or even if it were a private festival with the king and
   queen only, yet still men generally feel so impressed on such occasions
   with the responsibility of their high position that they are apt to
   forget prayer.

   But this devout Israelite, at such a time and in such a place, when he
   stands at the king's foot to hold up to him the golden goblet, refrains
   from answering the king's question until first he has prayed to the God
   of Heaven! There are the facts and I think that seems to prompt further
   inquiry. So we pass on to observe the manner of this prayer. Well, very
   briefly, it was what we call a brief prayer--prayer which, as it were,
   hurls a dart and then it is done. It was not the prayer which stands
   knocking at Mercy's door--knock, knock, knock--but it was the
   concentration of many knocks into one. It was begun and completed, as
   it were, with one stroke! This brief prayer I desire to commend to you
   as among the very best forms of prayer.

   Notice how very short it must have been. It was introduced--slipped
   in--sandwiched in between the king's question and Nehemiah's answer.
   And, as I have already said, I do not suppose it took up any time at
   all that was appreciable-- scarcely a second. Most likely the king
   never observed any kind of pause or hesitation, for Nehemiah was in
   such a state of alarm at the question that I am persuaded he did not
   allow any demur or vacillation to appear. The prayer must have been
   offered like an electric flash, very rapidly, indeed! In certain states
   of strong excitement it is wonderful how much the mind gets through in
   a short time. You may, perhaps, have dreamed and your dream occupied,
   to your idea, an hour or two at the very least. Yet it is probably--no,
   I think certain--that all dreaming is done at the moment you awake. You
   never dreamed at all when you were asleep--it was just in that instant
   when you awoke that the whole of it went through your mind.

   As drowning men, when rescued and recovered, have been heard to say
   that while they were sinking they say the whole panorama of their lives
   pass before them in a few seconds, so the mind must be capable of
   accomplishing much in a brief space of time. Thus the prayer was
   presented like the blinking of an eye--it was done intuitively, yet it
   was done-- and it proved to be a prayer that prevailed with God. We
   know, also, that it must have been a silent prayer and not merely
   silent as to sounds but silent as to any outward signs--perfectly
   secret. Artaxerxes never knew that Nehemiah prayed, though he stood,
   probably, within a yard of him. He did not even move his lips as Hannah
   did, nor did he deem it right, even, to close his eyes. The prayer was
   strictly within himself offered to God.

   As in the innermost shrine of the Temple--in the Holy of Holies of his
   own secret soul--there did he pray. Short and silent was the prayer. It
   was a prayer on the spot. He did not go to his chamber, as Daniel did,
   and open the window. Daniel was right, but this was a different
   occasion. Nehemiah could not have been permitted to retire from the
   palace just then. He did not even turn his face to the wall or seek a
   corner of the apartment. No, but then and there, with the cup in his
   hand, he prayed unto the God of Heaven--and then answered the question
   of the king. I have no doubt from the very wording of the text that it
   was a very intense and direct prayer. He says, "So I prayed to the God
   of Heaven." That was Nehemiah's favorite name of God--the God of
   Heaven.

   He knew to whom he was praying. He did not draw a bow at a venture and
   shoot his prayers anyway, but he prayed to the God of Heaven--a right
   straight prayer to God for the thing he needed--and his prayer sped,
   though it occupied less, perhaps, than a second of time. It was a
   prayer of a remarkable kind. I know it was so, because Nehemiah never
   forgot that he prayed it. I have prayed hundreds of times--thousands of
   times--and not remembered any particulars, afterwards, either as to the
   occasion that prompted or the emotions that excited me. But there are
   one or two prayers in my life that I can never forget. I have not
   jotted them down in a diary, but I remember when I prayed, because the
   time was so special and the prayer was so intense--and the answer to it
   was so remarkable!

   Now, Nehemiah's prayer was never, never erased from his memory. And
   when these words of history were written down he wrote that down. "So I
   prayed to the God of Heaven"--a little bit of a prayer pushed in
   edgeways between a question and an answer--a mere fragment of devotion,
   as it seemed, and yet so important that it is put down in a historical
   document as a part of the history of the restitution and rebuilding of
   the city of Jerusalem! And it was a link in the circumstances which led
   up to that event of the most important character. Nehemiah felt it to
   be so and, therefore, he notes the record--"So I prayed to the God of
   Heaven."

   Now, Beloved Friends, I come, in the third place, to recommend to you
   this excellent style of praying. I shall speak mainly to the children
   of God--to you that have faith in God. I beg you often, no, I would ask
   you always to use this method of brief, silent prayer. And I would to
   God, also, that some here who have never prayed before would offer a
   brief, silent prayer to the God of Heaven before they leave this
   house--that a short but fervent petition, something like that of the
   publican in the temple, might go up from you--"God be merciful to me, a
   sinner."

   To deal with this matter practically, then, it is the duty and
   privilege of every Christian to have set times of prayer. I cannot
   understand a man's keeping up the vitality of godliness unless he
   regularly retires for prayer, morning and evening at the very least.
   Daniel prayed three times a day and David says, "Seven times a day will
   I praise You." It is good for your hearts, good for your memory, good
   for your moral consistency that you should hedge about certain portions
   of time and say, "These belong to God. I shall do business with God at
   such-and-such a time and try to be as punctual to my hours with Him as
   I should be if I made an engagement to meet a friend."

   When Sir Thomas Abney was Lord Mayor of London, the banquet somewhat
   troubled him, for Sir Thomas always had prayer with his family at a
   certain time. The difficulty was how to leave the banquet to keep up
   family devotion. But so important did he consider it that he vacated
   his chair, saying to a person near that he had a special engagement
   with a dear Friend which he must keep. And he did keep it and returned,
   again, to his place, none of the company being the wiser, but he
   himself being all the better for observing his habit of worship!

   But now, having urged the importance of such habitual piety, I want to
   impress on you the value of another sort of prayer--namely, the short,
   brief, quick, frequent prayers of which Nehemiah gives us a specimen.
   And I recommend this because it hinders no engagement and occupies no
   time. You may be measuring off your calicoes, or weighing your
   groceries, or you may be casting up an account and between the items
   you may say, "Lord, help me." You may breathe a prayer to Heaven and
   say, "Lord, keep me." It will take no time. It is one great advantage
   to persons who are hard pressed in business that such prayers as these
   will not, in the slightest degree, incapacitate them from attending to
   the business they may have in hand!

   It requires you to go to no particular place. You can stand where you
   are, ride in a cab, walk along the streets, be the bottom sawyer in a
   saw pit, or the top one and yet pray just as well such prayers as
   these. No altar, no Church, no so-called sacred place is needed!
   Wherever you are, just a little prayer as that will reach the ear of
   God and win a blessing. Such a prayer as that can be offered anywhere,
   under any circumstances. I do not know in what condition a man could be
   in which he might not offer some such prayer as that. On the land, or
   on the sea, in sickness or in health, amidst losses or gains, great
   reverses or good returns, still might he breathe his soul in short,
   quick sentences to God! The advantage of such a way of praying is that
   you can pray often and pray always. If you must prolong your prayer for
   a quarter of an hour you might possibly be unable to spare the time,
   but if it only needs a quarter of a minute, why, then, it may come
   again and again and again and again--a hundred times a day!

   The habit of prayer is blessed, but the spirit of prayer is better. And
   the spirit of prayer it is which is the mother of these brief, silent
   prayers and, therefore, do I like them because she is a plentiful
   mother. Many times in a day may we speak with the Lord our God. Such
   prayer may be suggested by all sorts of surroundings. I remember a poor
   man once paying me a compliment which I highly valued at the time. He
   was lying in a hospital and when I called to see him he said, "I heard
   you for some years, and now whatever I look at seems to remind me of
   something or other that you said, and it comes back to me as fresh as
   when I first heard it." Well, now, he that knows how to pray brief
   prayers will find everything about him helping him to the sacred habit!
   Is it a beautiful landscape? Say, "Blessed be God who has strewn these
   treasures of form and color through the world, to cheer the sight and
   gladden the heart."

   Are you in doleful darkness and is it a foggy day? Say, "Lighten my
   darkness, O Lord." Are you in the midst of company? You will be
   reminded to pray, "Lord, keep the door of my lips." Are you quite
   alone? Then you can say, "Let me not be alone, but be You with me,
   Father." The putting on of your clothes, the sitting at the breakfast
   table, the getting into the conveyance, the walking the streets, the
   opening of your ledger, the putting up of your shutters-- everything
   may suggest such prayer as that which I am trying to describe if you
   are but in the right frame of mind for offering it.

   These prayers are commendable because they are truly spiritual. Wordy
   prayers may, also, be windy prayers! There is much of praying by book
   that has nothing whatever to recommend it. Pray with your heart, not
   with your hands. Or, if you would lift hands in prayer, let them be
   your own hands, not another man's. The prayers that come leaping out of
   the soul--the gust of strong emotion, fervent desire, lively
   faith--these are the truly spiritual prayers and no prayers but
   spiritual prayers will God accept. This kind of prayer is free from any
   suspicion that it is prompted by the corrupt motive of being offered to
   please men. They cannot say that the secret prayers of our soul are
   presented with any view to our own

   praise, for no man knows that we are praying at all! Therefore do I
   commend such prayers to you and hope that you may abound in them.

   There have been hypocrites that have prayed by the hour. I doubt not
   there are hypocrites as regular at their devotions as the angels are
   before the Throne of God--and yet there is no life, no spirit, no
   acceptance in their pretentious homage! But he that prays brief
   prayers--whose heart talks with God--he is no hypocrite! There is a
   reality, force and life about his prayers. Brief, silent prayers are of
   great use to us. Oftentimes they check us. Bad-tempered people, if you
   were always to pray just a little before you let angry expressions fly
   from your lips, why many times you would not say those naughty words at
   all! They advised a good woman to take a glass of water and hold some
   of it in her mouth five minutes before she scolded her husband. I dare
   say it was not a bad recipe, but if, instead of practicing that little
   eccentricity, she would just breathe a short prayer to God it would
   certainly be more effectual and far more Scriptural.

   I can recommend it as a valuable prescription for the hasty and the
   peevish--for all who are quick to take offense and slow to forgive
   insult or injury. When in business you are about to close in with an
   offer about the propriety of which you have a little doubt, or a
   positive scruple, such a prayer as, "Guide me, good Lord" would often
   keep you back from doing what you will afterwards regret. The habit of
   offering these brief prayers would, also, check your confidence in
   yourself. It would show your dependence upon God. It would keep you
   from getting worldly. It would be like sweet perfume burnt in the
   chamber of your soul to keep away the fever of the world from your
   heart.

   Besides, this type of prayers actually bring us blessings from Heaven.
   Brief prayers, as in the case of Eliezer, the servant of Abraham. As in
   the case of Jacob when he said, even in dying, "I have waited for Your
   salvation, O God"-- prayers such as Moses offered when we do not read
   that he prayed at all and yet God said to him, "Why cry you unto Me?"
   And brief prayers such as David frequently presented--these were all
   successful with the Most High. Therefore abound in them, for God loves
   to encourage and to answer them! I might thus keep on recommending
   brief prayer, but I will say only one more thing in its favor.

   I believe it is very suitable to some persons of a peculiar temperament
   who could not pray for a long time to save their lives. Their minds are
   rapid and quick. Well, time is not an element in the business--God does
   not hear us because of the length of our prayer--but because of the
   sincerity of it. Prayer is not to be measured by the yard, nor weighed
   by the pound. It is the might and force of it--the truth and reality of
   it--the energy and the intensity of it. You that are either of so
   little a mind or of so quick a mind that you cannot use many words or
   continue long to think of one thing, it should be to your comfort that
   brief prayers are acceptable.

   And it may be, dear Friend, that you are in a condition of body in
   which you cannot pray any other way. A headache such as some people are
   frequently affected with the major part of their lives--a state of body
   which only the physician can explain to you--might prevent the mind
   from concentrating itself long upon one subject. Then it is refreshing
   to be able again and again and again--50 or a hundred times a day--to
   address one's self to God in short, quick sentences, the soul being all
   on fire. This is a blessed style of praying!

   Now, I conclude by mentioning a few of the times when I think we ought
   to resort to this practice of brief prayer. Mr. Rowland Hill was a
   remarkable man for the depth of his piety, but when I asked at
   Wotton-under-Edge for his study, though I rather pressed the question,
   I did not obtain a satisfactory reply. At length the good minister
   said, "The fact is, we never found any. Mr. Hill used to study in the
   garden, in the parlor, in the bedroom, in the streets, in the woods,
   anywhere." "But where did he retire for prayer?" They said they
   supposed it was in his chamber, but that he was always praying--that it
   did not matter where he was, the good old man was always praying! It
   seemed as if his whole life, though he spent it in the midst of his
   fellow men doing good, was passed in perpetual prayer!

   You know the story of his being in Walworth, at Mr. George Clayton's
   chapel, and of his being seen in the aisles after everybody was gone,
   while he was waiting for his coachman. There was the old man toddling
   up and down the aisles, and as someone listened, he heard him singing
   to himself--

   "And when I shall die, receive me I'll cry, For Jesus has loved me, I
   cannot tell why. But this thing I find, we two are so joined, He won't
   be in Hea ven and lea ve me behind."

   And with such rhymes and ditties, and choice words, he would occupy
   every moment of his life! He has been known to stand in the
   Blackfriars' road with his hands under his coat tails, looking in a
   shop window, and if you listened you might soon perceive that he was
   breathing out his soul before God! He had got into a constant state of
   prayer! I believe it is the best condition in which a man can
   be--praying always, praying without ceasing, always drawing near to God
   with these brief prayers.

   But if I must give you a selection of suitable times I should mention
   such as these. Whenever you have a great joy, cry, "Lord, make this a
   real blessing to me." Do not exclaim with others, "Am I not a lucky
   fellow?" but say, "Lord, give me more Grace and more gratitude, now
   that You do multiply Your favors." When you have got any arduous
   undertaking on hand or a heavy piece of business, do not touch it till
   you have breathed your soul out in a short prayer. When you have a
   difficulty before you and you are seriously perplexed. When business
   has got into a tangle or a confession which you cannot unravel or
   arrange, breathe a prayer! It need not occupy a minute, but it is
   wonderful how many snarls come loose after just a word of prayer.

   Are the children particularly troublesome to you, good woman? Do you
   seem as if your patience was almost worn out with the worry and
   harassment? Now for a brief prayer! You will manage them all the better
   and you will bear with their naughty tempers all the more quietly. At
   any rate your own mind will be the less ruffled. Do you think that
   there is a temptation before you? Do you begin to suspect that somebody
   is plotting against you? Now for a prayer. "Lead me in a plain path
   because of my enemies." Are you at work at the bench, or in a shop, or
   a warehouse where lewd conversation and shameful blasphemies assail
   your ears? Now for a short prayer! Have you noticed some sin that
   grieves you? Let it move you to prayer! These things ought to remind
   you to pray.

   I believe the devil would not let people swear so much if Christian
   people always prayed every time they heard an oath. He would then see
   it did not pay. Their blasphemies might somewhat be hushed if they
   provoked us to supplication! Do you feel your own heart going off the
   lines? Does sin begin to fascinate you? Now for a prayer--a warm,
   earnest, passionate cry, "Lord, hold me up!" Did you see something with
   your eyes and did that infect your heart? Do you feel as if "your feet
   were almost gone and your steps had well near slipped?" Now for a
   prayer--"Hold me, Lord, by my right hand." Has something quite
   unlooked-for happened? Has a friend treated you badly? Then, like
   David, say, "Lord, put to nothing the counsel of Ahithophel."

   Breathe a prayer now! Are you anxious to do some good? Be sure to have
   prayer over it. Do you mean to speak to that young man about his soul?
   Pray first, Brothers and Sisters. Do you mean to address yourself to
   the members of your class and write them a letter this week about their
   spiritual welfare? Pray over every line, Brothers and Sisters. It is
   always good to have praying going on while you are talking about
   Christ! I always find I can preach better if I can pray while I am
   preaching. And the mind is very remarkable in its activities. It can be
   praying while it is studying--it can be looking up to God while it is
   talking to man! And there can be one hand held up to receive supplies
   from God while the other hand is dealing out the same supplies which He
   is pleased to give!

   Pray as long as you live! Pray when you are in great pain--the sharper
   the pang--the more urgent and importunate should your cry to God be.
   And when the shadow of death gathers round you and strange feelings
   flush or chill you, and plainly tell that you near the journey's end,
   then pray! Oh that is a time for brief prayer! Short and pithy prayers
   like this--"Hide not Your face from me, O Lord." Or this, "Be not far
   from me, O God" will doubtless suit you. "Lord Jesus, receive my
   spirit," were the thrilling words of Stephen in his extremity! And
   "Father, into Your hands I commend My spirit," were the words that your
   Master, Himself, uttered just before He bowed His head and gave up the
   ghost. You may well take up the same strain and imitate Him.

   These thoughts and counsels are so exclusively addressed to the saints
   and faithful Brothers and Sisters in Christ that you will be prone to
   ask. "Is not there anything to be said to the unconverted?" Well,
   whatever has been spoken in their hearing may be used by them for their
   own benefit. Now let me address myself to you as pointedly as I can.
   Though you are not saved, yet you must not say, "I cannot pray." Why,
   if prayer is so simple, what excuse can you have for neglecting it? It
   needs no measurable space of time. Such prayers as these, God will
   hear, and you have, all of you, the ability and opportunity to think
   and to express them if you have only that elementary faith in God which
   believes "that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently
   seek Him."

   Cornelius had, I suppose, got about as far as this when he was
   admonished by the angel to send for Peter, who preached to him peace by
   Jesus Christ to the conversion of his soul! Is there such a strange
   being in the Tabernacle as a man or woman that never prays? How shall I
   expostulate with you? May I steal a passage from a living poet who,
   though he has contributed nothing to our hymn books, hums a note so
   suited to my purpose and so pleasant to my ear that I like to quote
   it--

   "More things are worked by prayer

   Than this world dreams of.

   Therefore let your voice

   Rise like a fountain, flowing night and day!

   For what are men better than sheep or goats,

   That nourish a blind life within the brain,

   If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer,

   Both for themselves and those who call them friend?

   For so the whole round world is every way

   Bound by gold chains about the feet of God." I do not suspect there is
   a creature here who never prays because people generally pray to
   somebody or other. The man that never prays to God such prayers as he
   ought, prays to God such prayers as he ought not! It is an awful thing
   when a man asks God to damn him--and yet there are persons that do
   that! Suppose He were to hear you? He is a prayer-hearing God!

   If I address one profane swearer here I would like to put this matter
   clearly to him. Were the Almighty to hear you-- if your eyes were
   blinded and your tongue were struck dumb while you were uttering a wild
   imprecation--how would you bear the sudden judgment on your impious
   speech? If some of those prayers of yours were answered for yourself--
   and if some that you have offered in your passion for your wife and for
   your child were fulfilled to their hurt and your distraction--what an
   awful thing it would be!

   Well, God does answer prayer, and one of these days He may answer your
   prayers to your shame and everlasting confusion. Would not it be well
   now, before you leave your seat, to pray, "Lord, have mercy upon me.
   Lord, save me. Lord, change my heart. Lord, give me to believe in
   Christ. Lord, give me now an interest in the precious blood of Jesus.
   Lord, save me now"? Will not each one of you breathe such a prayer as
   that? May the Holy Spirit lead you to do so! And if you once begin to
   pray aright I am not afraid that you will never leave off, for there is
   a something that holds the soul fast in real prayer.
