PREFACE

      Das deutsche Lied ist einzig,
   Ein Schatz für Geist und Herz,
   Gehoben aus den Tiefen,
   Wo Freude wohnt und Schmerz.
   Kein andres Volk auf Erden
   Genosz des Schicksals Gunst,
   Solch einen Schatz zu sammeln,
   Reich an Natur und Kunst. [1]

   So far as is known to the writer of this thesis there has appeared
   hitherto no attempt to treat comprehensively and in detail the subject
   of the direct and indirect influence of Paul Gerhardt's hymns upon
   English and American sacred song. That there exists a very real
   influence is universally known, but how widely it has made itself felt
   is apparently a matter of little concern on the part of many, because
   we often find hymnals accrediting a hymn to the English translator with
   no mention of its original author. The present dissertation has been
   prompted by a desire to make some contribution to the subject of the
   relation of English and German hymnody in general, and in particular to
   show the great debt which the hymnody of England and America owes to
   the poetry of Paul Gerhardt. It was presented to the Faculty of the
   Graduate School of Yale University in candidacy for the degree of
   Doctor of Philosophy in June, 1917.

   For great assistance rendered to me by way of suggestion of sources I
   am under obligation to Dr. Bernard C. Steiner of the Enoch Pratt Free
   Library of Baltimore, Professor Gustav Gruener of Yale University,
   Professor Waldo S. Pratt of the Hartford Theological Seminary,
   Professor H. C. G. von Jagemann of Harvard University and to Professor
   John G. Robertson of the University of London; for help not only in
   this phase of the work but also in the general treatment of the subject
   I am deeply indebted to the counsel of my father, Professor Emeritus
   John H. Hewitt of Williams College and to Professor Arthur H. Palmer of
   Yale University.

PART ONE

  CHAPTER I.
  GERHARDT'S LIFE AND TIMES.

   Although Paul Gerhardt's poems have been so great a power in the world,
   nevertheless facts concerning his own life are few. A fire set by the
   Swedish soldiers in 1637 [4] destroyed all records which might
   enlighten us, yet from indirect sources and from his poems, we are
   certain of some facts of his biography.
     __________________________________________________________________

Early Life

   He was born in Gräfenhainichen a few miles southwest of Wittenberg in
   the direction of Halle on March 12th in the year 1607 probably. In this
   small town, of the electorate of Saxony, which was surrounded by a high
   mediaeval wall, Paul Gerhardt spent the first fifteen years of his
   life. His father, Christian Gerhardt, was burgomaster of
   Gräfenhainichen where the citizens earned their living by
   cattle-raising, agriculture and hopgrowing. His mother was Dorothea
   Starke, granddaughter of Gallas Döbler, a Lutheran pastor. Both of his
   parents died probably when he was very young; and of his many brothers
   and sisters little is known.

   At the age of fifteen having passed the examinations and being
   especially well prepared in Latin Gerhardt entered the Fürstenschule at
   Grimma. The school was noted for its pious atmosphere and stern
   discipline: its chief aim was to inculcate in the pupils "Gottesfurcht
   und gute Sitte."
     __________________________________________________________________

University Years

   It is natural that Gerhardt on completing his course at Grimma in 1627
   should choose Wittenberg as his university, for it was situated almost
   at the gates of his native town. Furthermore since this was the place
   where [8]Luther and Melanchthon had worked, the Protestant world looked
   toward Wittenberg with great hopes. He entered the university in 1628.
   Two of the teachers in particular had great influence on him, Paul
   Röber and Jacob Martini. These men were guardians of Lutheranism, and
   Röber besides composing hymns wrote many Latin disputations and
   polemics against Rome and Calvinism; in his sermons he often took his
   text, not from the Bible but from some religious poem, preaching for
   example on "Was mein Gott will, das gescheh allzeit." In this way
   Gerhardt was taught the full use and purpose of hymn writing. Beside
   Röber and Martini another Wittenberg professor was of influence on
   Gerhardt, the philologist August Buchner, one of the most esteemed
   members of the faculty. He had intimate friendship with [9]Opitz and
   had warmly advocated the latter's Von der Deutschen Poeterei and had
   himself written Anleitung zur deutschen Poeterey. As this book was
   easily copied [5] by many of the students, it is reasonable to assume
   that this effort toward spreading Opitz' rules for rhythmic measure had
   its due influence on Gerhardt.

   More is not known concerning his university career. A Latin epigram of
   the year 1642 points to the probability of his being still at
   Wittenberg, vhile the certainty of his being in Berlin the next year
   1643 is proved by a Hochzeitsode. [6] Gerhardt was undoubtedly tutor in
   the house of Andreas Barthold then "Kammergerichtsadvokat," whose
   daughter wedded Joachim Fromme, the archdeacon of the Nicolaikirche in
   Berlin; this wedding was the occasion of the congratulatory
   Hochzeitsode. During this period in Berlin from his thirty-seventh to
   his forty-sixth year he wrote a number of "Gelegenheitsgedichte" which
   show us Gerhardt as quite at home moving in a circle of educators and
   clergymen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5] In 1665 there was published an authentic edition.

   [6] Cf. Goed. 10: "Der aller Herz und Willen lenkt."
     __________________________________________________________________

Johann Crüger

   Among his friends was the well known choirmaster of the Nicolaikirche,
   Johann Crüger, who first introduced Gerhardt's hymns into common
   worship by publishing eighteen [7] of them with other poems in his
   Praxis pietatis melica.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [7] Among these 18 were: "Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld" Goed.
   68. "O du allersüszte Freude" Goed. 76. "O Welt sieh hier dein Leben"
   Goed. 71. "Wach auf, mein Herz, und singe" Goed. 59.
     __________________________________________________________________

Personal Loss

   In these early poems Gerhardt's depth of feeling and natural warmth of
   character are present. Since his twelfth year the Thirty Years' War, a
   period of destruction unparalleled in Germany history, had been going
   on. The horrors of the epoch made deep impression upon his imaginative
   mind, and the strife, the struggle for freedom of the conscience
   enlisted his sympathy and strengthened his determined resistance to all
   religious compulsion. The hope and joy in this life were taken away and
   confidence in another world was needed. Gerhardt even in these early
   hymns gave fully that deep assurance in the guidance of God.

   He himself had suffered individual loss. The Swedes in 1637 determined
   to punish Johann Georg, the Elector of Saxony, because he, in spite of
   a signed contract with them, had deserted the Protestant cause, and in
   their ravages they appeared before Gräfenhainichen and demanded a war
   tax of 3000 Gulden. It was paid, but notwithstanding the payment the
   Swedish soldiers set fire to the town. The Gerhardt house and the
   church with its many records were among the four hundred buildings
   destroyed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Work at Mittenwalde

   Whether Gerhardt felt the pinch of distress of the war, or hesitated to
   enter a field already crowded with a superabundance of young clergymen,
   or for what reason he stayed so long in Berlin as tutor is not known,
   but he was already forty-five years old when he began his first church
   work. In a letter of the clerical cabinet ("Geistliches Ministerium")
   of Berlin to the magistrate of Mittenwalde (Sept. 1651) Gerhardt was
   proposed as minister and he is characterized as being of "well known
   diligence and scholarship, of peace loving disposition and blameless
   life, besides being loved and esteemed by both high and low in Berlin."
   Upon the successful outcome of this recommendation Gerhardt was
   ordained "Propst" [8] of Mittenwalde on the 18th of November, 1651,
   entering his new office in December of that year. At his ordination he
   pledged his support especially of the Lutheran Book of Concord
   (Concordienformel).

   The community of Mittenwalde had suffered severely in 1637 as had
   Gräfenhainichen from the Swedish marauders and attacks of pestilence,
   and Paul Gerhardt undertook his duties here with full understanding of
   this universal suffering, and fulfilled them with all his strength. The
   poems which he wrote at this time give evidence of a tender, yet strong
   pastoral care. He was a spiritual guide and comforter, yet in spite of
   his ardent work in Mittenwalde he apparently yearned for Berlin, and
   often returned thither to visit. On February 11th, 1655, at the age of
   forty-eight he married Anna Maria Barthold, daughter of Andreas
   Barthold and sister of Frau Fromme. [9] Their first child, born to them
   in 1656, died in infancy and a memorial tablet in the church in
   Mittenwalde shows their grief.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] In Mittenwalde, 9 English miles south of Berlin, there were in the
   church two clerical positions, the first of which was known as the
   "Propstei," since its occupant was entrusted with the supervision of
   the clergy of the vicinity. Propst (or Probst) is from the Latin
   propositus.

   [9] Cf. p. 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

Work at Berlin

   That same year Gerhardt accepted the deaconry at the Nicolaikirche in
   Berlin, and began his work in the summer of 1657. He seems to have had
   some hesitation about leaving Mittenwalde, because it was only "after
   fervent prayer and mature deliberation," that he accepted the call to
   Berlin. However, without doubt he and Frau Gerhardt were glad to be
   again among such friends as Georg Lilius and Michael Schirmer whose
   tastes were so similar to their own.

   When Gerhardt came to Berlin he entered a city full of sharp strife
   between the Lutheran and the Reformed clergy; the Great Elector was by
   inheritance and by education in the Netherlands where he spent four
   years strongly in favor of the Reformed Church. Gerhardt on the other
   hand held the security of the Lutheran faith very dear. When
   hostilities between the clergy began to disturb the peace, the Elector
   issued on the 2d of June, 1662, an edict [10] the purpose of which was
   to maintain harmony between Reformed and Lutheran clergymen. Its only
   effect was, however, to fan the flames of the very conflagration he
   sought so hard to quench. The unconciliatory spirit was encouraged from
   Wittenberg, too, where Theology of Controversy had reached its highest
   pitch through Calovius, whose advice and judgment Gerhardt prized. His
   inclination toward Wittenberg is seen also in various Latin poems for
   special occasions.

   Gerhardt did not seek the quarrel, but was drawn forcibly into it; he
   was concerned throughout the controversy in keeping a clear conscience
   and preserving the confession of the Lutheran Church. In all the
   documents that were issued in this period between the Magistrate, the
   "Stünde" and the Elector it is said of him that he was always pacific
   and conciliatory. Being a strong adherent of all the symbolic books,
   including the Book of Concord, he could not conscientiously sign the
   edict. He was accordingly dismissed. The citizens of Berlin espoused
   his cause and appealed to the Magistrate who testified that Gerhardt
   had never "scorned nor rebuked the faith of the Elector." Also his
   influential patron, Mayor Zarlang, tried to reinstate him, but Gerhardt
   could not renounce his adherence to the Concordienformel, so in 1666
   his position was filled by another. Nor on the other hand can the
   Elector be blamed for his stand; he wished only to have peace between
   the adherents of the two beliefs, and was sincere in the thought that

   on Feb. 24, 1614, demanding "moderation and modesty in the pulpit."

Death and Memorials

   For some years Gerhardt lived in Berlin without any position, supported
   by his friends in his congregation. He was, however, the victim of
   inevitable circumstances, for although within a few months of his
   resignation the edict was withdrawn, his patroness, Electress Luise
   Henriette, had died. All of his children had died in infancy except
   Paul Friedrich who survived him, and in March, 1668, his wife died who
   had been as strong a follower of the Lutheran Faith as he, and had
   encouraged him in his stand of not signing the edict. [11] Her death
   was the fulfillment of a wish that "the dear Lord might soon come and
   release her."

   Gerhardt took into his home as housekeeper the widow of his
   brother-in-law Fromme. [12] His household was reasonably large for one
   in his condition, a preacher without office; he speaks of three, or
   even of four servants, and mentions at times some business matters in
   Berlin that seem to be of moment. Although he must also have had pupils
   whom he tutored during these years, he evidently wished for some
   definite occupation, and it came. On the 14th of October, 1668, Paul
   Gerhardt preached a trial sermon ("Gastpredigt") in Lübben. The city
   council the following day with the unanimous consent of the citizens
   offered him the vacant charge and Gerhardt accepted it as a divine
   gift. The formal call under date of October 29th was sent to him at
   Berlin. Owing to various circumstances, such as the delay incident to
   necessary repairs on the parsonage, and also the serious illness of his
   son, Paul Friedrich, he did not enter his duties till Trinity Sunday,
   1669. He was at this time sixty-three years old, and for seven years he
   worked faithfully in this new field.

   Gerhardt died the 27th of May, 1676, with the prayer on his lips:

   Kann uns doch kein Tod nicht tödten,
   Sondern reiszt unsern Geist
   Aus viel tausend Nöten;
   Schleuszt das Thor der bittern Leiden
   Und macht Balm, Da man kann
   Gehn zur Himmelsfreuden. [13]

   He was buried in the vault of the Lübben church.

   Shortly before his death, in his seventieth year, he composed a sort of
   testament or will of a moral nature for his own Paul in which he hoped
   to leave little of this world's goods, but an honorable name of which
   his son might not be ashamed. He commends to the boy the study of
   theology at reputable universities and also the avoidance of the
   Syncretists, [14] on the ground that they aimed at temporal things and
   were loyal to neither God nor man.

   In a memorial service to Gerhardt in 1876, a tablet was put up on the
   north wall of the chancel of the church at Lübben; and his portrait
   hung there bears this inscription:

   Theologus in cribro Satanae versatus. [15]

   The Nicolaikirche in Berlin and the other churches where he held charge
   have portraits of Gerhardt on their walls. Also among the many
   memorials to him are charitable foundations in Mittenwalde, Wittenberg
   and Berlin bearing his name. To these tributes the present generation,
   now, three centuries later, adds its praise and gratitude.

  CHAPTER II.
  GERHARDT'S RELATION TO EARLIER HYMNODY OF GERMANY.
     __________________________________________________________________

The Mediaeval Period

    THE MEDIAEVAL PERIOD.

   The history of hymnody in Germany up to the time of Gerhardt falls
   naturally into two periods which might be called the Mediaeval Period,
   extending from the beginning of the eighth century to the end of the
   fifteenth century, and the Reformation Period covering the sixteenth
   and the first half of the seventeenth centuries.

   The Hymns used in the services of the early church in Germany were, for
   obvious reasons, Latin hymns, for St. Boniface, the Apostle of Germany,
   though of English birth, entered Germany by the way of Rome. It was a
   Latin Christianity which he preached and the church services were, of
   course, those of the Mother Church. While the general use of the Latin
   language was favorable to preserving the unity of the Church and
   facilitated literary intercourse among scholars, this circumstance
   prevented for a long time the free and full development of a hymnody in
   the vernacular. The innate love of poetry, however, produced many
   sacred lyrics for private devotion and caused to be made metrical
   translations of Latin hymns and portions of the Psalter. In the
   consideration of the earlier period of hymnody reference will be made
   to a few Latin hymns, which though not of German authorship were yet
   used in the religious services of the Germans and had some influence in
   the development of the German vernacular hymnody. And in this
   consideration of hymns and hymn writers it will be convenient in the
   main to follow the chronological order.

   Probably it cannot be known what and when Latin hymns were first
   translated into modern languages. If the statement made by Dean Milman
   in a footnote of his Latin Christianity, that the hymns of Ambrose were
   translated into German in the ninth century, is well founded, then
   probably the "Deus Creator omnium" and "Aeterne rerum Conditor," which
   are undoubtedly by Ambrose, were among the earliest of Latin poems to
   be so translated.

   The oldest German poet is the Benedictine monk, Otfrid of Weissenburg,
   who was born about the beginning of the ninth century, according to
   some authorities in Franconia, according to others near the Lake of
   Constance. He settled as a monk and priest at Weissenburg, where he
   wrote and completed (about 865) his Evangelienbuch, a versified gospel
   history, and a most interesting work from a philological as well as a
   hymnological point of view. This is the earliest example of a long
   German poem in rhyme. Of the rhymed prayers which some on doubtful
   authority have ascribed to him two have been translated by [10]Miss
   Winkworth, "Du himlisco trohtin" ("[11]Thou Heavenly Lord of Light")
   and "Got thir eigenhaf ist" ("[12]God, it is thy property"). [16]

   A celebrated Latin hymn of early date, which is known to have been used
   as early as 898, is the "Veni Creator Spiritus"; it has been constantly
   sung throughout Christendom at the consecration of kings and at great
   ecclesiastical solemnities. It has been ascribed to Charlemagne,
   Charles the Bald, Gregory the Great and various others. [17]

   To this early period belongs Notker of St. Gall, called Balbulus, the
   "Stammerer," who was born in Switzerland about 840 and died in 912. He
   wrote in Latin and was the originator of a form of Latin hymnody called
   "sequentia" or "prosa," which, when translated into German, gave rise
   to the earliest German hymns with which we are acquainted. Whenever in
   the eucharistic service a "Hallelujah" was introduced it had been
   customary to prolong the last syllable and to sing on the vowel "ah" a
   series of elaborate passages to represent an outburst of jubilant
   feeling. These were termed "sequences" because they followed the
   "Hallelujah" and repeated its notes. They were of course without words
   and what Notker did was to write words for them. Notker was
   characterized as a man of gentle, contemplative nature and "accustomed
   to find spiritual and poetical suggestions in common sights and
   sounds." One of the most remarkable of his sequences, "Media vita in
   morte sumus," is said to have been suggested to him while observing
   some workmen constructing a bridge in a precipitous and most dangerous
   place. This sequence was long used as a battle-song; one of Luther's
   funeral hymns, "Mitten wir im Leben sind," is a translation of it and
   portions of the Burial Service of the Church of England are taken from
   it. St. Gall, which was for a long time the especial seat of German
   religious literature, produced besides Notker several distinguished
   sequence-writers, presumably his pupils, Hartmann, Hermann, and
   Gottschalk. To Gottschalk has been ascribed the "Alleluiatic Sequence
   ("Cantemus cuncti") well known in England by the translation, "The
   strain upraise of joy and praise."

   An early example of the change of sequences from a rhythmical to a
   metrical form is seen in the so-called "Golden Sequence," "[13]Veni
   Sancte Spiritus," called by Archbishop Trench "the loveliest of all the
   hymns in the whole circle of Latin sacred poetry." Tradition assigns
   its authorship to Robert II, King of France (997-1031). Its merit is
   attested by the many translations made of it into German, English and
   other Ianguages.

   Gregory the Great.

     __________________________________________________________________

   By the beginning of the tenth century the impulse given to the arts by
   Charlemagne had gradually died out and the state of society had become
   so disorganized that for two centuries after the time of Notker the
   field of literature was comparatively barren. The twelfth and
   thirteenth centuries, however, mark a great change and form an era of
   rapid growth. Germany was now ruled by the Hohenstauffens, whose dream
   it was to prove themselves true heirs of Charlemagne by re-establishing
   the Empire of the West. As a result of their participation in the
   common life of Christendom, very largely through the influence of the
   crusades, came the development of chivalry and a national literature,
   the first great outburst of German poetry and song. A large class (more
   than two hundred) of minnesingers sprang up who glorified earthly and
   heavenly love and the Virgin Mary as the type of pure womanhood. In the
   church too the voice of native song now made itself heard. The "Kyrie
   eleison" and "Christe eleison" which passed from the Greek church into
   the Latin, as a response of the people, to be repeated over and over
   again, especially on the high festivals, were popularly enlarged, and
   these brief poems were called from the refrain "Kirleison" or "Leisen,"
   also "Leichen." [18] These sequences, for such they were, were the
   first specimens of German hymns which were sung by the people. The
   oldest dates from the end of the ninth century and is called the
   "[14]Leich vom heiligen Petrus." It has three stanzas, of which the
   first reads:

   Unser trohtin hat farsalt
   sancte Petre giwalt
   Daz er mag ginerjan
   zeimo dingenten man.
   Kyrie eleyson! Christe eleison. [19]

   The twelfth century produced the "Salve Caput cruentatum" of Bernard of
   Clairvaux,--a hymn which has come to us by Paul Gerhardt, [20] whose
   own hymn writing is wonderfully affected by Bernard.

   In the following century appeared two widely celebrated compositions,
   the "Dies irae" and the "Stabat Mater dolorosa." These, as well as many
   others of the best Latin hymns, such as the "Te Deum" and the "Gloria
   in excelsis," were repeatedly translated. Occasionally words of the
   original Latin were introduced into the vernacular as in the Christmas
   hymn:

   In dulci jubilo
   Nu singet und seyt fro!
   Unsres Herzens Wonne
   Leyt in presipio
   Und leuchtet in gremio.
   Alpha es et O.

   The mystic school of [15]Tauler, in the fourteenth century produced a
   number of hymns full of glowing love to God. Tauler is the author of
   the Christmas poem, "[16]Uns kommt ein Schiff geladen" and the hymn of
   Self Renunciation, "[17]Ich musz die Creaturen fliehen," both of which
   have passed into English, the best versions being those of [18]Miss
   Winkworth. [21]

   Of unusual sweetness and abiding worth are the hymns of [19]Heinrich
   von Laufenburg, the most important and prolific hymn writer of the
   fifteenth century. Many are in intricate metres, while others are
   transformations of secular songs into religious songs. His cradle hymn,
   "Ach lieber Herre Jesu Christ," is a beautiful prayer of a mother for
   her infant child, and has become well known in England through [20]Miss
   Winkworth's translation.

   German hymnody of the Middle Ages is, like the Latin, overflowing with
   the worship of the saints and the Virgin who is even clothed with
   divine attributes and is virtually accorded the place of Christ as the
   fountain of grace. In characterizing the period Wackernagel says [22]

   "Through all the centuries from Otfrid to Luther we meet with the
   idolatrous worship of the Virgin Mary. There are hymns which teach that
   she pre-existed with God at the creation, that all things are created
   in her and for her and that God rested in her on the seventh day."

   One of the favorite hymns to the Virgin, "Dich Frau von Himmel, ruf ich
   an," [21]Hans Sachs subsequently changed into "Christum vom Himmel ruf
   ich an," a change strikingly characteristic of the effect which the
   Reformation exerted upon the worship of the Virgin Mary. It substituted
   for it the worship of Christ as the sole Mediator through whom men
   attain eternal life.

    THE REFORMATION PERIOD, 1500-1648.
     __________________________________________________________________

Martin Luther

   Guizot in his History of European Civilization calls the Reformation an
   insurrection of the human mind against the absolute power of spiritual
   order. In the changes that then occurred few things are more noteworthy
   than the new privileges granted to the individual worshipper. There was
   revived the primitive idea of the priesthood of all believers. Instead
   of the Latin Mass, the Reformation introduced a sermon in the
   vernacular, and for the chanting of priests and choirs it substituted
   congregational singing. Among the means which contributed to the large
   benefits which then came to the church the writing of hymns was not the
   least important. It is interesting to note that the leader of the
   Reformation was also the first evangelical hymnist. [23] To [23]Luther
   belongs the extraordinary merit of having given to his people in their
   own language not only the Bible and the Catechism, but also the hymn
   book, so that they might directly answer the word of God in their
   songs. No sooner had there been felt the want of German psalms and
   hymns to take the place of the Latin hymns and sequences than Luther
   set about to supply the want. He was intensely fond of poetry and song
   and was himself a poet by nature. His estimate of the value of music is
   revealed in his words: "He who despises music, as all fanatics do, will
   never be my friend." He wished that all children might be taught to
   sing; "for," he says, "I would fain see all arts, especially music, in
   the service of Him who has bestowed and created them." [24]

   He began to write hymns soon after he had completed his New Testament
   translation and from this time on he was an active reformer of church
   music and hymns, enlisting in the same work the large circle of friends
   whom he gathered about him. Luther had recourse to the Latin hymns,
   adapting and translating many of those which would lend themselves best
   to his purposes. Altogether he wrote thirty-seven hymns, most of them
   dating from the year 1524; more are frequently ascribed to him though
   on doubtful authority. Luther's hymns which are characterized by
   simplicity and strength, had a popular churchly tone; his style is
   plain and often rugged and quaint but he throws into his poems all his
   own fervent faith and deep devotion. His most famous hymn "[24]Ein'
   feste Burg ist unser Gott," written in 1529 when the German princes
   made their formal Protest against the revocation of their liberties,
   thus gaining the name of Protestants, has passed into English hymnody
   in no less than sixty-three versions. [25]

Early Lutheran and Moravian Hymnists

   Of the many hymnists inspired by Luther's example the more eminent were
   [25]Justus Jonas, Luther's friend and colleague in the preparation of
   metrical German versions of the Psalms, [26]Paul Eber, the faithful
   assistant of Melanchthon, [27]Markgraf Albrecht of Brandenburg,
   [28]Hans Sachs, the shoemaker, and later Gerhardt.

   The German hymnody of the Reformation period was enriched by the hymns
   of the [29]Bohemian and Moravian Brethren, who as followers of John
   Huss, had in 1467 formed themselves into a separate and organized
   church; their archbishop Lucas in 1501 collected hymns and published
   the first hymn book in the vernacular to be found in Bohemia or
   Germany. The adherents of this cult are commonly called Moravians,
   because the first founders of the settlement in Saxony immigrated from
   Moravia. They assumed this name in England and America and it is very
   largely through their hymn book [26] that German hymns have found their
   way into English hymnody.

   The Lutheran hymnody which followed closely upon the Moravian
   contributions concluded its productive period with the Formula of
   Concord [27] in 1577 which gave final shape to the Lutheran creed. In
   this period there were over a hundred poets whose verses have expressed
   the highest Christian praises. It is an era which, for its
   productiveness, may be compared with the time of [30]Watts and
   Doddridge and their immediate successors in England.

Hymnists of the Thirty Years' War

   The hymns from this time to the close of the Thirty Years' War are of a
   more subjective [28] experimental type of sacred poetry, that is,
   writers made their songs more and more expressive of personal feelings.
   In point of refinement and grace of style the hymn writers of the
   period of the Thirty Years' War, whose taste was chiefly formed by the
   influence of [31]Martin Opitz [29] the founder of the First Silesian
   School of German poetry, excelled their predecessors. His finest hymn,
   "O Licht, geboren aus dem Lichte" is a special favorite in Silesia
   where he was born, and has passed into English in several translations,
   notably that of [32]Miss Winkworth, "O Light, who out of Light wast
   born." [30]

   Near the close of the war, when the hope of peace had begun to dawn,
   [33]Martin Rinckart (1586-1649) composed that noble expression of trust
   and praise, "[34]Nun danket alle Gott." It has been translated many
   times and is included in nearly all American and English hymnals. The
   hymn of trust in Providence by Neumarck (1621-1681), "[35]Wer nur den
   lieben Gott läszt walten," is hardly inferior to that of Gerhardt on
   the same theme. [31]

   The two most famous and most copious hymn writers of this time were
   however [36]Rist and [37]Heermann; the former wrote between 600 and 700
   hymns, such as were intended to supply every possible requirement of
   public worship or private experience. In so great a mass of writings it
   is inevitable that there should be much that is poor, but over 200 may
   be said to be in common use in Germany and at least fifteen have
   appeared in the hymn books of English-speaking countries. Not so
   prolific as Heermann and Rist but superior to them in poetical genius
   was [38]Simon Dach (1605-1659), who was Professor of Poetry at
   Königsberg and the most important poet of the Königsberg School. [32]

   While the Lutheran churches were superior to the Reformed churches of
   Germany and Switzerland in original hymnody, they were inferior to them
   in the matter of psalmody. Zwingli and Calvin held firmly to the
   principle that in public worship the word God should have supreme
   dominion, a principle which raised the Psalter to new dignity and
   power. Versified versions of the Psalms became the first hymn books of
   the Reformed Churches. [34] The first German Reformed hymn book
   appeared at Zürich, 1540. It contained not only versified psalms but
   also hymns, with a preface in defense of congregational singing. The
   most popular collection however was the versified Psalter of
   [39]Lobwasser of Königsberg. While its poetry is but a poor translation
   of the French Psalter of Marot and Beza, [35] its pious contents made
   it a rich source of devotion for a hundred years. It is a parallel to
   the Scottish Psalter of 1641 by Francis Rous. [36]

   [40]Simon Dach was the last poet of any note to write in the
   Reformation period of German hymnody. After him a new era of poetry,
   the Confessional (1648-1680), opens and it is at this time that Paul
   Gerhardt appears. He, however, although living in the midst of this
   churchly atmosphere, profound in Lutheran orthodoxy, feels the
   tendencies of a still later period, that of the Devotional era. Like
   many other great men he saw beyond his time. He combined in his poems
   all the strong qualities of the century in which he lived, and of the
   later epoch, the period of the Pietists.

  CHAPTER III.
  CHARACTERISTICS OF GERHARDT AS A HYMN WRITER.

   From the close of the Thirty Years' War until 1680 there occurred in
   German hymnody a transition from the churchly and confessional to the
   pietistic and devotional hymns. [37] It is during this transitional
   period that the religious song of Germany finds its purest and sweetest
   expression in the hymns of Paul Gerhardt, who is as much the typical
   poet of the Lutheran, as [41]Herbert is of the English church. In
   Gerhardt more than in any other author all the requisites for the
   religious poem are united. He possessed a firm conviction of the
   objective truth of the Christian doctrine of salvation and also a
   genuine sentiment for all that is purely human. His deep Christian
   feeling together with sterling good sense, and a fresh and healthy
   appreciation of life in the realm of nature and in the intellectual
   world are the sources for his splendid work. His hymns are among the
   noblest contributions to sacred poetry, giving him a place second only
   to [42]Luther and even surpassing Luther's work in poetic fertility.
   Gervinus says of him: [38]

   "He went back to Luther's most genuine type of hymn in such a manner as
   no one else had done, only so far modified as the requirements of his
   time demanded. In Luther's time the belief in Free Grace and the work
   of the Atonement in Redemption and the bursting of the gates of Hell
   was the inspiration of his joyful confidence; with Gerhardt it is the
   belief in the Love of God. With Luther the old wrathful God of the
   Romanists assumed the heavenly aspect of grace and mercy; with Gerhardt
   the merciful Righteous One is a gentle loving man. Like the old poets
   of the people he is sincerely and unconstrainedly pious, naive and
   hearty; the blissfulness of his faith makes him benign and amiable; in
   his way of writing he is as attractive, simple and pleasing as in his
   way of thinking."

   Scherer [40] gives an even clearer characterization of the two hymn
   writers:

   "Geistlicher Ernst des Vortrags schlieszt Heiterkeit des Gemütes nicht
   aus, und diese bildet in der That den sittlichen Grundcharakter von
   Gethardts Poesie. Wenn bei Luther die Welt voll Sturm und Gewitter ist,
   so liegt sie bei Gerhardt in beständigem Sonnenglanz; die Wohltaten des
   Schöpfers erfreuen das Herz; alles ist so schön zum Besten der Menschen
   eingerichtet; Tod und Hölle haben längst ihre Macht verloren; die Seele
   frohlockt in der Gewiszheit der Erlösung; Gnade geht vor Recht, Zorn
   musz der Liebe weichen. Luther steht wie ein Mann dem Bösen, Gerhardt
   sieht wie ein Jüngling darüber hinweg; und schlieszlich weisz er zu
   trösten und Zufriedenheit, Geduld zu predigen, das rechte Mittelmasz zu
   preisen und auch dem Uebel gute Seiten abzugewinnen; selbst die Sünde
   dient zum Heil. Bei Luther ruft die Gemeinde zu Gott, bei Gerhardt
   redet der Einzelne. Seine Lyrik ist nicht mehr Chorpoesie; sie
   beschränkt sich nicht auf das, worin alle betenden Christen einig sind;
   sie holt aus der Tiefe des individuellen Seelenlebens ihre Schätze; sie
   macht (um die Schulausdrücke zu gebrauchen) den Uebergang vom
   objektiven Bekenntnisliede zum subjektiven Erbauungslied."

   Gerhardt sings his hymns with conviction, embodying in them such phases
   of feeling as might be experienced by any large body of sincere
   Christians. In all the religious lyrics even in the congregational
   hymns from the middle of the seventeenth century on we note a more
   personal and individual tone and with it a tendency to reproduce
   special forms of Christian experience often of a mystical character.
   Gerhardt's whole tone and style of thought belong to the confessional
   school, but the distinct individuality and expression of personal
   sentiment which are impressed on his poems already point to the
   devotional school.

   Many of our poet's hymns show the influence of [43]Opitz' Trostgedichte
   in Widerwärtigkeit des Krieges. Critics [41] have gone so far as to say
   that "without Opitz there would be no Gerhardt." There can be no doubt
   but that the smoothness and elegance of form, the complete mastery of
   technique and the purity of language are a distinct heritage from him.
   But without consciously differing from Opitz and his school, Gerhardt
   has brought into prominence the popular expression of feeling, using
   the popular form of verse in which there prevails the natural flow of
   rhythm, so that no striving after correctness of form is evident.
     __________________________________________________________________

Musical Settings

   Compared with most authors of his time Gerhardt wrote but little. His
   contemporary, [44]Rist (1607-1667), and his successor, [45]Schmolk
   (1672-1737), composed respectively 659 and 1188 hymns, while Gerhardt
   has the modest number of 132 poems in all. [42] Yet a complete hymnal
   might be compiled from them, so thoroughly do they embrace all
   religious and domestic experiences. They appeared at intervals from the
   year 1649 on, many of them for the first time in the Praxis pietatis
   melica, a collection of hymns and tunes by Johann Crüger, the famous
   organist and composer of chorals. Crüger died in the year 1662 and
   Cristoph Runge took over further editions of the book. Gerhardt made no
   further contributions to these publications because henceforth he
   became more intimately associated with Johann Georg Ebeling, Crüger's
   successor in his church and organ work. Ebeling was so much pleased
   with Gerhardt's hymns, that he at once began to set them to music and
   eventually he published them dividing them by "dozens" [43] into
   separate books. Gerhardt put at Ebeling's disposal the first copy of
   his hymns hitherto published and also thirty-one separate strophes
   which had for various reasons been omitted in previous editions.
   Finally he turned over to him twenty-six more poems which the Praxis
   pietatis melica had not published up to this time. Among them are a
   number which in all probability belong to his early period of poetic
   activity, such as: "O Tod, O Tod, du greulichs Bild," a paraphrase of
   one of Röber's [44] hymns. Also among them are several which from
   content and form must be regarded as products of his mature years, and
   from which the poet himself derived much comfort and strength. [45] The
   most important fact about the Ebeling edition is this, that the
   personality of Gerhardt, the poet, was for the first time presented to
   the German people's heart and mind. Hitherto his poems had been grouped
   together in collections of hymns with those of other and perhaps better
   known authors. Ebeling's publication placed Gerhardt's works on their
   own merit. The texts of the hymns in the editions of Crüger and Ebeling
   and later of Feustking [46] in 1707 have often different readings so
   that it is difficult to determine which the authentic version may be.
   It is quite within the limits of possibility that Gerhardt himself
   undertook revisions, as Feustking's title indicates.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] Among them are 18 poems for occasions, 27 founded on Psalms and 24
   founded on other parts of Holy Scripture.

   [43] The tenth and last "dozen" of Gerhardt's hymns which Ebeling had
   set to music for four voices and with an accompaniment of two violins
   and a bass, appeared in 1667. The full title, characteristic of
   Ebeling, reads: Paul Gerhardt's spiritual devotions, consisting of one
   hundred and twenty hymns, collected into one volume, at the request of
   a number of eminent and distinguished gentlemen; first to the honor of
   the Divine Majesty and then, also for the consolation of esteemed and
   distressed Christendom, and for the increase of the Christianity of all
   believing souls--in sets by dozens, embellished with melodies for six
   parts." With such eagerness were these hymns sought after that Ebeling
   had to publish a new edition two years later. The melodies which proved
   most popular were those set to "Voller Wunder, voller Kunst," "Schwing
   dich auf zu deinem Gott" and "Warum sollt' ich mich denn grämen." Each
   single dozen was again dedicated to a particular class of men with a
   characteristic preface. The first dozen he dedicated "to the prelates,
   counts, lords, knights, and estates of the Electorate of Brandenburg,
   this side the Oder and beyond the Elbe"; the second dozen, "To the
   high, noble-born, honored, and virtuous women of Berlin" and so on.

Acceptance in German Worship

   Of these 132 poems a large proportion have become embodied in church
   music of Germany and many of them may be counted among the most
   beautiful in German hymnody. How widely they have been adopted into
   general use is shown by the fact that in modern hymnals in Germany
   there appear either in expanded or cento form, [47] altogether 78 of
   his hymns, while in the Schaff-Gilman "Library of Religious Poetry,"
   which may be regarded as a representative collection of universal
   hymnody, the proportion among German hymn writers is as
   follows:--[56]Luther 10, Goethe 8, Gerhardt 7, [48] [57]Spitta 6,
   [58]Scheffler 4, [59]Schmolk 4, etc. Pietism and rationalism
   transferred the centre of gravity in hymnody to a different point; that
   is, it changed the type of hymn or required of it other features, and
   thus it is that during the XVIIIth century, while Gerhardt's hymns
   lived on with others they are rarely accorded a leading place. It was
   only the reawakening of a life of faith that needed worship and strong
   evidence of reverence such as followed the wars of liberation that
   brought his hymns into the forefront once more and prompted further
   publications of them.

   Rarely has there been, taking all in all, a time when there existed a
   greater gulf between poets and their effusions than in the XVIIth
   century. Most poets of that time gave forth what they had learned and
   what they knew,--not what they really were. Theirs was a play of the
   intellect and imagination on objects outside them. Hence their works
   displayed a universal lack of inner truth. In the biographical sketch
   of Gerhardt we have given a broken account of his life. Different from
   this is the story of the individual in his poems which are his very
   personality. His work is not what he learned from others. Instead, he
   gives us his own life unadorned and true, and for the very reason that
   he leads a rich inner life is he able to give it. He wrote preeminently
   as a living member of Christ's church. The same quiet sincerity, depth
   of feeling and warmth that are seen in his face, stand out in his
   poetry.

   Luther sang: "Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott," but Gerhardt has: "Ist
   Gott für mich, so trete," [49] and "Ich singe dir mit Herz und Mund."
   [50] Thus, as has been said in the early part of this chapter, [51] the
   hymns no longer acknowledge the truths of the Gospel as in the days of
   the Reformation, but the poet lives them. Approximately one-eighth [52]
   of Gerhardt's hymns begin with "Ich," while not one of Luther's begins
   this way. Gerhardt's hymns, then, proclaim his own personal
   experiences, many of them having their inspiration in the intimate
   circle of his own family and friends. Yet observe that in none of them
   is there any personal experience that is not enlightened by its
   relation to the external truths of Christian Belief so that it has a
   universal significance. Assuming that one takes for granted the
   incontestable truth of evangelistic Philosophy of Life as does
   Gerhardt, one may find one's own thoughts and feelings expressed in
   these poems. Every pious worshipper can follow Gerhardt, every one may
   find in him peace for the soul, the consecration of happiness and
   comfort in dark hours. Universal life and not merely the life of one
   reared in the church is unfolded in his hymns.

   Mention has several times been made of Luther [53] in connection with
   Gerhardt. Every Protestant hymn writer must undergo comparison with the
   great father of German hymnody and none can stand the test better than
   Gerhardt. Let us take the hymns cited above: "Ein' feste Burg," and
   "Ist Gott für mich." In the very choice of material the likeness is
   striking. In Luther's song of defiance the XLVIth Psalm is born anew.
   In Gerhardt it is the triumphant song of Paul that they who are in
   Christ are free from condemnation. We see, then, that while the one is
   concerned with the congregation of God's church, the other treats of
   life's experiences. In the form of the verse Luther displays the
   greater strength and Gerhardt the greater art.

Language

   Although Gerhardt's hymns are written in the vernacular of the XVIIth
   century, at a time when many of the forms characteristic of the writers
   of the two preceding centuries still survived, nevertheless his hymns
   are remarkably free from the tendency of this period to use words
   coined from foreign tongues. He belongs to no poetic school or literary
   circle of the XVIIth century. He never sought any laurels. He goes on
   his way writing because his heart is so full, and not from any desire
   or intention to devote himself to poetry. A fine feeling for rhythm
   schooled under the principles of [60]Opitz, language taken from the
   best sacred literature including Luther's Bible and almost entirely
   free from foreign words, [54] avoidance of bombast and coarseness [55]
   of which so many contemporary writers were guilty, richness in figures
   and analogies, tenderness which on occasion yields to sternness, are
   all attributes of his writing. The mother of Hippel [56] says of him:

   "Er war ein Gast auf Erden [57] und überall in seinen 120 Liedern ist
   Sonnenwende gesäet. Diese Blume dreht sich beständig nach der Sonne
   [58] und Gerhardt nach der seligen Ewigkeit."

   Gerhardt's poems are all permeated with this hope for future happiness
   in Heaven and with a childlike joy in this hope. He may sing of the
   beauties of summer, yet with that his thoughts go further and he soon
   begins to reflect upon the greater beauties of Heaven. In his
   "Reiselied" (Goed. 248) he begins by urging on his horse; suddenly he
   changes from the beauties of the hill and vale to the joy of eternity.
   Even in an uncouth poem about health (Goed. 244) appear the lines:

   "Gib mir meine Lebenszeit
   Ohne sonderm Leide,
   Und dort in der Ewigkeit
   Die vollkommene Freude!"

   We have said that biblical phraseology plays a large part in Gerhardt's
   hymns. In fact many lines are a direct translation of passages in
   scripture. In two or three of them a single dogma appears very plainly,
   but elsewhere pure doctrine is the basis of each poem. God is a
   friendly and gracious God, not a "bear or lion," [59] but a Father
   reconciled by Christ's death, entirely a New Testament conception. He
   even addresses the Almighty as a good companion:

   "Sollt aber dein und unser Feind
   An dem, was dein Herz gut gemeint,
   Beginnen sich zu rächen:
   Ist das mein Trost, dasz seinen Zorn
   Du leichtlich könnest brechen." [60]

   The Redeemer is mentioned in barely half of Gerhardt's poems. It has
   therefore been often said that the poet esteemed the graces of
   Redemption less than those of Creation. He is fully conscious of the
   former, hence he can resign himself to the latter and dwell upon them
   in all their phases. On the basis of the Atonement there springs up in
   his mind the whole Christian life with all its experiences of
   salvation, consolation, patience, mastery of sin and suffering. Since
   he does not sing solely for church worship, but for family devotion and
   for personal edification, he necessarily must observe and discourse
   upon the various vicissitudes of life in sickness and health, in strife
   and peace.

Poetic Technique

   Inasmuch as Gerhardt is a poet of unusually fine feeling for the
   rhythmical and melodious peculiarities of the German tongue, he
   appreciates the interdependence of verse rhythm and thought showing
   always a nicety in choosing the right word to suit the measure. The
   lines:

   "Nun ruhen aller Wälder,
   Vieh, Menschen, Stadt, und Felder . . ." [61]

   are at once suggestive of Nature in repose. The harmonious connection
   of words of kindred meaning, "Ruh und Rast," "Gnad und Gunst," [62] and
   frequent use of assonance, "Not und Tod," "Füll und Hüll," etc. are
   introduced not merely to catch the ear, but to accentuate the artistic
   effect, which shows us that Gerhardt is more than a master of the
   language, that he writes with an inexhaustible naturalness. He intended
   his style to be popular in the sense of appealing to the people, and it
   is here that he manifests the intimate relation of his poetry to the
   Volkslied without forsaking the proper limits of artistic poetry.

   In observing certain defects such as the awkwardness and imperfect
   rhyme in the couplet:

   "Aber nun steh ich
   Bin munter und frölich." [63]

   even Gerhardt's most devoted admirers must regret that he did not feel
   the necessity of giving to his verses the final rounding-off, or did
   not possess the ability to do so. Yet what many critics have regarded
   as faults, must, when fairly analyzed, be recognized as contributing
   much to the effect and as being in accord with the Sprachpoesie of the
   people. For example, the richness in alliteration, "Ich mein Heil und
   Hülfe hab," [64] "Ich lechze wie ein Land," [65] the juxtaposition of
   words of the same root, "Erbarm dich, o barmherzigs Herz," [66] "Ich
   lieb ihr liebes Angesicht," [67] as well as the frequent repetition of
   words or use of refrains [68] show the power of his language and offer
   a striking method of expressing inmost sympathy. What real fervor is
   indicated in the lines:

   "Dasz ich dich möge Eir und für
   In, bei und an mir tragen." [69]

   Just as Gerhardt was a loyal devotee to his mother-tongue, so also he
   stood aloof from the tendency of his time to adopt foreign
   characteristics in verse. Only twice [70] has he employed the
   Alexandrine so fashionable in the period, and other foreign verse-forms
   he avoids entirely. On the other hand in so comparatively small a
   number of poems the variety of his verse structure is unusual. Gerhardt
   knew Buchner [71] in his Wittenberg student days and owes to him his
   technical training in versification which his strophes show. He uses in
   them iambic, trochaic and especially dactyllic-anapaestic metres which
   Buchner had declared permissible. Hahne [72] enumerates in Gerhardt's
   poems fifty-one kinds of strophe among which six are quite complicated.
   Three of these, as appear in the poems, "Frölich soll mein Herze
   springen," Goed. [61]155; "Gib dich zufrieden," [62]274; and "Die
   güldne Sonne," [63]293, must be regarded as original with Gerhardt.
   While these three are not artistic and harmonious, they are,
   nevertheless, in exact accord with the type of melody prevalent in the
   XVIIth century.

Poetic Meters

   Our poet has shown preference for the older German strophes which
   belong to popular poetry and had most firmly held their own in the
   spiritual song because of its relation to the Volkslied and also for
   the Nibelungen strophe of eight lines. Eighteen [73] times he uses the
   well known seven-line ballad strophe and twice [74] the six-lined
   strophe of the Wanderlied "Innsbruck, ich musz dich lassen," [75] which
   even as early as the Reformation had come into wide use in hymnody. He
   has also frequently employed the rhymed couplet in the four-lined
   stanza. The verse-structure in the remainder of his poems may generally
   be traced back to lays long-since native to the church, though one
   strophe "Sollt ich meinem Gott nicht singen" [76] appears for the first
   time, as far as we know, in Johann Rist's [77] hymns. Realizing,
   furthermore, that a composition becomes truly a poem only through its
   harmony Gerhardt clung to the well known melodies, adapting his new
   text to them that through the music his hymns might the more easily
   become familiar. Thus he composed "Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die
   Schuld" to the melody "[64]An Wasserflüssen Babylon," and "O Welt, sieh
   hier dein Leben" and "[65]Nun ruhen alle Wälder" to "[66]Innsbruck, ich
   musz dich lassen," [78] and in fact his hymns were known at first only
   through their musical setting. Like Luther, he wished to teach the
   people song [79] and it is evident that in composing he usually had
   some definite melody in mind, and what Johann Walther had been to
   Luther, Crüger [80] was to Gerhardt. To this choir master we owe the
   first significant publication of our poet's hymns. Many musicians have
   adapted his hymns to music; Bach made use of them in a number of his
   cantatas and his Passion Music; [81] and five [82] times in his
   rapturous Weihnachtsoratorium do we find Gerhardt's words. Of recent
   musicians who have been interested in his poetry as a basis for their
   compositions mention must be made of Albert Becher (d. 1899), H. von
   Herzogenberg (d. 1900) and especially the Bavarian clergyman, Friedrich
   Mergner [83] (1818-1891), who has so thoroughly caught the spirit of
   Gerhardt. As early as 1732-1800 six Catholic hymn books in quite
   general use throughout Germany had included in all, thirteen of
   Gerhardt's hymns, and "[67]O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" can be heard
   in many Catholic churches to-day, even in the Cologne Cathedral. [84]

Occasional Poetry

   Gerhardt was essentially a "Gelegenheitsdichter," a poet of occasions,
   choosing for his themes the various vicissitudes of life and such
   events as would present themselves to an earnest pastor devoted to the
   flock under his care. We may define him more precisely as a poet of
   consolation, for at least seventeen of his hymns are to be classed as
   "Songs of the Cross and Consolation," [85] and fully half his work
   contains much that is intended as a source of comfort in the many
   afflictions of the troublous times in which he lived. An enumeration of
   "Trost" words shows the use of "Trost" 51 times, "getrost" 11,
   "trösten" 10, "trostlos," "tröstlich" 2, besides numerous phrases such
   as "Erschrecke nicht," [86] "Sei unverzagt," [87] "Sei ohne Furcht,"
   [88] "Gott hat mich nicht verlassen." [89] In this connection we should
   consider Gerhardt's use of the word "Trost." With him it seems often to
   have a wider meaning than merely solace, or comfort. At times it
   approaches even its English cognate trust, or at least that comfort or
   assurance which is born of trust. [90] In the poem beginning "Schwing
   dich auf zu deinem Gott" the word seems clearly to be used in this
   sense in line 7:

   Merkst du nicht des Satans List?
   Er will durch sein Kämpfen
   Deinen Trost, [91] den Jesus Christ
   Dir erworben, dämpfen.

   At other times the meaning is apparently the ground of confidence or
   reliance, as in the line: "Dein Arm ist mein Trost gewesen." [92] Since
   joy is to Gerhardt innately associated with the theme of comfort, we
   find in his verses a host of phrases embodying cheer and joy:

   Lasz deine Frömmigkeit
   Sein meinen Trost und Freud. [93]

   By enumeration we find the use of "Freude" 161 times; of "Freudenlicht"
   (-quell, -schein, etc.) 33 times; of "freuen" and "erfreuen" 22 times;
   of "froh," "frö(h)lich," "freudig," "freudenvoll," "selig," etc. 50
   times; of other kindred expressions, such as "Lust," "Wonne,"
   "Seligkeit," "Freudigkeit," etc. 8 times. Stanza VI of the
   "Adventgesang" ([68]Goed. 108) is a fair example of Gerhardt's fondness
   for singing of joys both temporal and spiritual:

   Aller Trost und aller Freude
   Ruht in dir, Herr Jesu Christ;
   Dein Erfreuen ist die Weide,
   Da man sich recht frölich iszt.
   Leuchte mir, o Freudenlicht,
   Ehe mir mein Herze bricht;
   Lasz mich, Herr, an dir erquicken!
   Jesu, komm, lasz dich erblicken!

   Compare with this the lines from the hymn based on Johann Arndt's
   "Gebet um Geduld in groszem Creutz" ([69]Goed. 209):

   St. XIV. "O heilger Geist, du Freudenöl,
            Das Gott vom Himmel schicket,
            Erfreue mich, gib meiner Seel
            Was Mark und Bein erquicket!
            Du bist der Geist der Herrlichkeit,
            Weiszt, was für Freud und Seligkeit
            Mein in dem Himmel warte."

   A pastor and poet whose spirit amidst the hardships of the war can not
   only remain undaunted but bring so large a measure of cheer to his
   flock is indeed destined to have an immortal name. It was the
   everpresent hardships of war, however, that made him long not merely
   for an earthly peace but also for spiritual rest. As an advocate of
   peace and contentment he has among his contemporaries no equal. Having
   hoped and prayed during the war for a cessation of hostilities and
   horrors he could at last burst forth at the conclusion of the Peace of
   Westphalia in his magnificent

   Gott Lob! nun ist erschollen
   Das edle Fried- und Freudenswort." [94]

   Furthermore he preaches patience and contentment with life's
   experiences. Notably does this appear in the poem "Gib dich zufrieden"
   ([70]Goed. 274) where each stanza has these words as the refrain.
   Taking as his theme "Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him" (Ps.
   XXXVII, 7) he reveals to his fellow-men the joys and comforts that
   await the true believers even though they must pass through pain,
   anxiety, and even death. As their tears are counted and their sighs are
   heard, so a day of rest is at hand when God shall receive the meek in
   the abundance of peace, and 'they shall then be exalted to inherit the
   land.' [95] But how very deeply Gerhardt felt this yearning for
   spiritual as well as material peace is best seen from the constant
   recurrence of the root "Friede." Of this word and its compounds we note
   33 examples, and of "Ruhe," "Stille," Rast" and similar words, 16.

Poetry and Nature

   Aside from the hymns of Cross and Consolation discussed above, [96]
   which among Gerhardt's poems are by far the most numerous, and which
   gave him the widest opportunity to grasp the inner life of the
   Christian believer in its different tendencies and phases, the
   subjective development of his spiritual songs is shown in two
   directions--in the poetic glorification of nature and of family life.
   Gerhardt's knowledge of nature is limited to the ideas set forth in
   Johann Arndt's [97] Viertes Buch vom wahren Christentum. Following
   Arndt, Gerhardt believes the material as well as the spiritual
   phenomena on earth are influenced in a mysterious way by the heavens
   and their constellations; hence the prophetic significance of comets
   which he mentions in two poems. [98] In the year 1615 just such a
   threatening "torch" had appeared to announce the frightful war.
   Fourteen years later another comet was regarded as prophecy of the
   death of the Swedish King. Naturally, then, in 1652 Gerhardt is
   terrified with all others at the appearance in the sky of the third
   "Flammenrute" (Goed. 104).

   However, within this limited knowledge nature appears to him as of
   independent grandeur, wholly subservient to God and freely enjoyed by
   all Christians. In his life, too, as well as in his songs, Gerhardt is
   open to all the world and is at all times sensible to the appreciation
   of nature. It is a noteworthy characteristic of him that in one glance
   he includes with sense of fitness and artistic certainty both large and
   small, the most sublime and the most commonplace. In this wise he
   sings:

   Die Erd ist fruchtbar, bringt herfür
   Korn, Oel, Most, Brot, Wein und Bier,
   Was Gott gefällt.
   (Goed. [71]139, 49 ff.)

   To Gerhardt the world lies in continual sunshine. [99] He scorns
   trouble, distress seems merely to accentuate happiness; from the
   horrors of the Thirty Years' War he turns to thank God for the return
   of peace, [100] and to inspire his people with gratitude for the
   infinite mercy of the Most High. He celebrates evening and morning and
   takes us in summer through the flowering gardens of God, portrays rain
   and sunshine, earth's sorrows and joys.

Family Life

   The other direction of the subjectivity of Gerhardt's writing is that
   of the family life. In a time so bereft of virtues as the XVIIth
   century the firmly grounded idea of the home must be given first place.
   His own family life, cheered by domestic felicity, and the many
   contributions he made to occasional poetry bear testimony to this. For
   married life he sings the praise of quiet domesticity, [101] picturing
   the Christian housewife in the midst of her surroundings, bringing joy
   and cheer to her husband, faithful in her tasks, ministering to the
   poor and teaching her children the Word of God. He closes the poem with
   the eulogy:

   Die Werke, die sie hie verrichtt,
   Sind wie ein schönes helles Licht;
   Sie dringen bis zu Himmelspfort
   Und werden leuchten hier und dort.

   Before Gerhardt, Mathesius [102] had sung the praises of domestic
   happiness in "Wem Gott ein ehrlich Weib beschert," but the sincere note
   of Gerhardt's "Wie schön ist's doch, Herr Jesu Christ" ([72]Goed. 302)
   placed German home-life in a poetic light it had not known before.

Theology

   For the dying he allays the fear of death; man is but a stranger on
   earth, [103] and has spent many a day in distress and care; his home is
   yonder where hosts of angels praise the Mighty Ruler. The sympathetic
   pastor takes his place with the parents beside the bier of their
   deceased child. [104] He speaks as a father who has lost his son, and
   he imagines the child in heaven joining the chorus of the angels. But
   Gerhardt has written very few hymns of death or of penitence. When he
   does speak of sin and its curse of death with its terrors, he still
   contrives at once to take from them the sting. The poem beginning "O
   Tod, O Tod, du greulichs Bild," [105] bears the title "Freudige
   Empfahung des Todes," and concludes with the lines:

   Was solls denn nun, O Jesu, sein,
   Dasz mich der Tod so schrecket?
   Hat doch Elisa Todtenbein,
   Was todt war, auferwecket:
   Viel mehr wirst du, den Trost hab ich,
   Zum Leben kräftig rüsten mich;
   Drum schlaf ich ein mit Freuden.

   In hymnody both before and since Gerhardt there has often been a vivid
   portrayal of the tortures of hell to terrify the soul. Gerhardt
   scrupulously avoids this and is therefore able to reduce everything to
   the simplicity of beauty. Every pain and every punishment in which his
   poems abound at once lose their bitterness because on them is reflected
   the sunlight of God's love. Gerhardt towers above his time in that amid
   all his despondent fellow-men he is always fearless and shows a
   cheerful heart reliant on God; just because the severe afflictions of
   his own life cannot break his spirit, he has in his power the cure for
   others.

   The candid reader must admit that there is evident in some passages of
   Gerhardt's poetry a certain dogmatic constraint, ("Gebundenheit"). The
   devil [107] is to him a terrible reality, the Christchild in the manger
   is the creator [108] of the world, and the problem of the Trinity is
   dismissed without consideration. The Atonement, too, of the Savior is
   easily understood on the theory of punishment, while the resurrection
   [109] of the flesh is an undeniable truth. But in other respects
   Gerhardt is far less dogmatic than Luther.

Poetic Development and Recognition

   Critics have sought in vain for traces of poetic development in
   Gerhardt's work. Such findings as have been claimed can be regarded
   only as more or less probable conjecture, a fact which shows that his
   personality was immediately poetically endowed, giving itself out
   whenever it composed poetry. If his individuality shows no development
   as such, his poetry can bear no marks of development.

   It has often been said that "Gerhardt had and sought no laurels"; nor
   was he ever "hailed as the Homer or Vergil of his time." As he knew
   neither himself nor the greatness of his gift, so his contemporaries
   failed to appreciate him. He never regarded himself as a poet by
   calling as did [73]Opitz, [74]Johann Franck and [75]Rist, but only a
   poet by avocation. To quote Goethe, he sang "as the bird sings that
   lives in the branches." In the same proportion that Gerhardt's poetry
   brought strength and comfort in the grievous period of the Thirty
   Years' War and later eras of confusion, it is destined through the
   present world disaster to bring its message of hope.

PART TWO.

  CHAPTER I.

    HISTORY OF ENGLISH HYMNODY AND THE GERMAN INFLUENCE UPON ENGLISH HYMN
    WRITING FROM THE EARLY XVITH THROUGH THE XIXTH CENTURY. [110]

   Any direct traces of literary intercourse between Germany and England
   before the XVIth century are hard to find; however, with the invention
   of printing, the establishment of the universities, the Renaissance and
   the Reformation the literary relations were increased and became
   important.

   In the wide region of satire which was at that time serious and often
   steeped in theological ideas Germany's works left enduring traces.
   Brant's "Narrenschiff" translated in the first years of the century
   helped essentially in accelerating the development of this type of
   literature in England: reprinted there after an interval of sixty years
   it was still an inexhaustible model of satire. Another source of
   dramatic effect destined to have great success on the English stage was
   found in some hero endowed with supernatural powers, such as Faustus.
   Thus by introducing a new class of situations into English drama the
   unusually gifted Germany of the sixteenth century was of great moment
   for its neighbor, England. Not a little of the quality of the
   Minnelied, too, reappears in much of the verse of the English lyric
   writers of this century, when the rose, the nightingale and daisy serve
   as interpretations of the play of love. In the Mystery Plays there
   existed doubtless germs of the Meistersänger school: the occasional
   strophic passages in the Towneley plays resembled to a great extent the
   normal Meistergesang. This germ, however, did not develop markedly
   because in England the cultivation of poetry never became a serious
   occupation. These literary influences from Germany in satire, in
   Minnelied and in Meistergesang had direct effect upon English
   intellectual life, and continued uninterrupted through the centuries.
   The record, on the other hand, of German influence in History, Lyrics
   and Hymns was more broken and disconnected.

   In order to get the story of the development of the hymn we must go
   back a little. Church music in the mediaeval times belonged to the
   choir, not to the congregation. The choral hymns in England, as in
   Germany, were in Latin and many of them were exceedingly beautiful.
   Although the early English Church received from the continent the most
   of the Latin hymns used in its service, nevertheless there were a few
   English authors of Latin hymns. Among this number were Bede, commonly
   called Venerable Bede (673-735?) who wrote "Adeste, Christi, vocibus,"
   and Anselm of Canterbury, a great architect and theologian, and Thomas
   à Becket. While psalms and hymns have been used by the Christian Church
   since its beginning, the particular form of psalms and hymns now in use
   originated with the Reformation. A wonderful development of this
   religious lyric poetry sprang up in England and Germany at the
   beginning of the XVIth century. The reformers in both countries were
   chiefly concerned in simplifying religious worship, and in giving to
   the laity a more active participation in it; the choir and anthem, the
   old liturgic hymn and antiphonal chant gave way to a great extent to
   hymns in the vernacular, set to the simplest music and sung by the
   whole congregation. This change was first made by Luther and eagerly
   copied in England.

   When Miles Coverdale in his ungifted way translated Luther's hymns into
   English his unpoetical and lumbering versions were ill received and
   were soon proscribed by the Crown. Sternhold and Hopkins who were
   translators of the psalms became more noticed, but their versions too
   seem to have been deficient in taste and feeling of lyric poetry. The
   criticism of the poet Campbell seems to be justified when he says of
   the authors that "with the best intentions and the worst taste they
   degraded the spirit of Hebrew Psalmody by flat and homely phraseology;
   and mistaking vulgarity for simplicity turned into bathos what they
   found sublime." Although these bleak translations were read in England
   for a time, they soon disappeared leaving only small traces which were
   picked up by [76]Wesley more than two centuries later.

   So with the royal proscription of Coverdale's work [111] , the dying
   out of Sternhold and Hopkins' and other similar attempts at
   translation, the imaginative poetry of German Protestantism which had
   been caught up in England with such momentary enthusiasm was as rapidly
   forgotten. Church music was again sung by the choir. The first effort,
   therefore, in the early XVth century to introduce Lutheran hymnody into
   the English world contributed little.
     __________________________________________________________________

Domination of the Psalter in English Hymnody

   This disappearance in England of the work of the Reformers in church
   music was due not only to the lack of great translators but also to
   many other causes. Early in the Renaissance England came to think of
   the Reformation as her own movement, and therefore casting aside all
   suggestions from other countries wished to study history and hymns of
   English sources only. The few men at this time who recognized Germany
   as the mother country of the Reformation and a seat of literary
   accomplishments had no wide influence in England. All German residents
   in England belonged exclusively to the commercial class and brought no
   literary influence with them; also a reason for the literary alienation
   at this time was the fact that Germany did not enter the religious wars
   in which Englishmen were so deeply interested. To men like Jonson and
   Fletcher Germany was famous only as a land of magicians and conjurers
   such as Paracelsus and Dr. Faustus. In short, for nearly two centuries
   England knew little of Germany except what booksellers found it to
   their profit to advertise on their sign directories as the "wonderful
   strange Newes from Germany," and the satires of Brant, Dedekind, and
   Fischart. [112]

   Another most vital cause of the retardation of the development of
   hymnody in Great Britain so soon after the Reformation was the example
   and influence of Geneva. Calvin was organizing his ecclesiastical
   system at Geneva, and introduced into it Marot's Psalter [113] which
   was then very fashionable. This example produced in England the
   translation commonly known as the Old Version of the Psalms begun in
   the reign of Henry VIII (1509-1547). In this collection are eleven
   metrical versions of the "Te Deum" and "Da pacem, Domine," two original
   hymns of praise, two penitential and a hymn of faith. The tunes which
   accompanied the words were German. [114] Therefore, although the
   religious influence of the Reformation was always strong in England
   from the beginning of the movement, the influence of Luther from a
   literary standpoint early in the Renaissance ceased to exist in England
   and was replaced by Calvin's stern rule. These narrower canons
   admitting nothing but paraphrases of scripture and even of scripture
   little outside the Psalms became the firm fashion of English hymnody
   for the next century and a half.

The Eighteenth Century

   In spite of the fact that Luther had little influence on English
   literature in the early Reformation his hymns came to their own in
   England in the middle of the XVIIIth century. In the meantime, although
   the English people used the stern canons of Calvin, they began to feel
   the want of a more lyric hymn. While German Protestantism had developed
   at once a rich hymnody there was actually no English hymnody until the
   XVIIIth century. [77]Isaac Watts, a representative of the English
   Independents, may be justly considered the real founder of modern
   English hymnody. He was the first to understand the nature of the want,
   and by the publication of his [78]Hymns in 1707-1709 and [79]Psalms
   (hymns founded on psalms) he led the way in providing for this want.
   His immediate followers were Simon Browne and Doddridge; and later in
   the century Grigg, Miss Steele, [80]Beddome and Swain succeeded them.
   Of these writers Watts and Doddridge are certainly preeminent, the
   hymns of the former are of unusual fervor and strong simplicity, and
   those of Doddridge while perhaps more artificial in general than those
   of his predecessor Watts are nevertheless distinguished by their
   graceful style.

   About 1738 came the "Methodist" movement which afterward became divided
   into three sects, the Arminian under [81]John Wesley, those who adhered
   to the Moravians, [115] and the Calvinists of whom Whitfield was the
   leader. Each of these factions had its own hymn writers, some of whom
   did, and others did not, secede from the Church of England. These are
   the years when a renewed strong current of influence from Germany is
   felt. The translation movement first sprang up in the middle of this
   century when Count Zinzendorf and A. G. Spangenberg came to England
   [116] and established a branch of the Moravian Church there. The
   Gesangbuch, the first of the hymn books for the congregation at
   Herrnhut, had been published in 1735 by Count Zinzendorf. The Moravians
   in England began to translate many of the hymns contained in the German
   Moravian Hymn Book. [117] These translations, however, were for the
   most part poor, mere doggerel, but in later editions they were somewhat
   improved, especially in the one revised in the XlXth century by
   [82]James Montgomery, the well known hymn writer, who was for a long
   time a member of the English Moravian Church. Among these many English
   hymn writers at this time whether writing entirely from English
   sources, or influenced by German ideas and philosophily or merely
   translators of the German hymn, the Wesley brothers are deserving of
   the first place.

   After determining upon missionary lives [83]John and [84]Charles Wesley
   embarked on October 14, 1735, for the new colony of Georgia. Among
   their fellow passengers were twenty-six Moravian colonists, who in all
   the changes of weather, especially during storms, made a great deal of
   hymn singing. John Wesley was much impressed with the fervor and piety
   of these hymns and with their spiritual possibilities. One of the
   German sources which had great influence upon Wesleyan hymnody was
   Freylinghausen's Geist-reiches Gesang-Buch (Halle 1704 and 1714). John
   Wesley introduced hymn singing into the "companies" formed in Georgia
   and his first hymn book appeared as a Collection of Psalms and Hymns.
   Charles-Town 1737, without his name. Of the seventy lyrics in the book,
   one half are from Watts, fifteen of the remainder are hymns of the
   Wesleys, five of which were translated from the German by John Wesley.
   In his third collection printed in England in 1750 the immediate
   impression the hymns produce is that of foreignness because of the many
   lengthy stanzas and the unusual metres. The reason for this is the fact
   that the authorities insisted that the melodies sung at Herrnhut be
   kept, irrespective of the language in which they might be sung.
   Although Charles Wesley knew no German, and therefore derived his
   impressions of the Moravian hymnody indirectly, nevertheless he caught
   much of its tone and manner and its atmosphere of confiding love. In
   all he wrote about 6500 hymns, through a large portion of which may be
   traced this Moravian influence.

   Of great value to English hymnody are the contributions of the
   Calvinistic Methodists, and few writers of hymns have had higher gifts
   than A. M. Toplady, the author of "Rock of Ages." His hymns have the
   same warmth, richness and spirituality as German hymns, and are
   meditations after the German manner, owing direct obligation to German
   originals. During the first quarter of the nineteenth century came the
   practice of hymnodists of altering without scruple the compositions of
   other men, notably Latin and German hymn writers, to suit their own
   doctrines and tastes, with the result all too often of spoiling the
   originals thus altered, though English hymnody was undoubtedly enriched
   by this process of adaptation.

     __________________________________________________________________

The Nineteenth Century

   Two publications in 1827, Bishop Heber's Hymns and Keble's
   [85]Christian Year introduced a new epoch into English hymnody,
   destroying the barrier which had previously existed between the
   different theological schools of the Church of England. This movement
   received a great additional impulse from the publication in 1833 of
   Bunsen's Gesangbuch. From this time hymns and hymn writers multiplied
   not only in the Church of England, but in Scotland and America also.
   With such influences as we have mentioned the more recent collections
   have evidenced an improved standard of taste, and there has been a
   larger and more liberal admission of good hymns from the German. In
   this XIXth century when the study of the German language and literature
   became so much more common than before it is natural that an impulse be
   given also to translation of German hymns.

   Beside the improvement in the standard of taste, additional interest in
   hymnody had been aroused by the prominence given to congregational
   singing in English churches. "To love hymns in eighteenth century
   Scotland was to be accused of heresy: in England, it was to be
   convicted of that worse thing, 'enthusiasm.'" Since the days of Luther
   Germany had given her hymns general esteem, but in England it was the
   middle of the nineteenth century before hymns won anything like popular
   favor. The congregational hymn in England is the direct although
   exceedingly slow outgrowth of the German Reformation but it must be
   borne in mind that the foundations of congregational singing were laid
   even before Luther. When the Hussites in Bohemia created this hymnody
   in the vernacular their hymns were designed for worshippers rather than
   for the choir. [118] While German Protestantism developed at once a
   rich hymnody there was actually no English hymnody until the XVIIIth
   century.

   German hymns and chorals had a place in the Church Psalter and Hymn
   Book of William Mercer of Sheffield (1854). One who took much interest
   in its preparation was [86]James Montgomery of whom mention has already
   been made. [119] This was the most successful of all the books of the
   decade for the reason that it aided in placing the hymnody back in the
   people's hands and making it congregational. Thus we see that the
   success of congregational singing of the better type required a return
   to the Reformation practice of including the tunes, as well as words,
   in the people's hymn books.

   If general congregational singing after the manner that prevailed in
   Germany for so long has been an incentive to the development of English
   hymnody, the interest in German hymnody has at the same time been
   quickened by the good work done in [87]Frances E. Cox's Sacred Hymns
   from the German (1841) and [88]Henry J. Buckoll's Hymns translated from
   the German (1842). This also found expression in the Psalms and Hymns,
   partly original, partly selected (Cambridge 1851) of [89]Arthur T.
   Russell, in which the German hymns played a very large part, the Latin
   a very small one; even the arrangement of the hymns is based on an old
   Lutheran hymn book. In 1854 appeared [90]Richard Massie's Martin
   Luther's Spiritual Songs, and the first of four parts (1854-1862) of
   Hymns from the Land of Luther by [91]Jane Borthwick and her sister
   [92]Mrs. Findlater. In 1855 and 1858 [93]Catherine Winkworth published
   the [94]first and [95]second series of her Lyra Germanica, following
   them in 1863 with the [96]Chorale Book for England, and [97]Christian
   Singers of Germany (1869). The work of this group of translators which
   has secured so firm a place in English hymnody for a number of German
   hymns and more particularly those of Paul Gerhardt will be discussed in
   the following chapter.

   [110] Inasmuch as Gerhardt's influence was not fully felt in England
   till the middle of the XIXth Century, this chapter deals with the
   development of the English hymn up to that period.

   [111] It must be remembered, however, that although Coverdale's
   writings had little influence upon the people of his own time, they
   have been appreciated by later generations and are among the most
   sincere monuments to Luther in the English language. Cf. A. Mitchell:
   The Wedderburns, Edinb., 1868. An example will show the nature and
   degree of Coverdale's imitation. Here is the first stanza of his
   version of "Ein' feste Burg": "Oure God is a defence and towre A good
   armour and good weapen, He hath ben ever oure helpe and sucoure In all
   the troubles that we have ben in. Therefore wyl we never drede For any

  CHAPTER II.

    ENGLISH VERSIONS OF GERHARDT'S HYMNS.

   While the first influence of Gerhardt on English hymnody dates from the
   earlier part of the XVIIIth century it was not until the middle of the
   following century [120] that his influence was most fully felt. For it
   was then that the whole subject of church music and congregational
   singing in England received renewed and special attention. The English
   hymn writers and compilers of hymn books naturally appropriated all
   embodiment of Christian experience and devotion that Germany, a country
   so nearly akin to their own, could offer. The translators of all German
   hymns were subjected to certain limitations the observance of which
   affected the character of the rendering. The accompanying versions of
   Gerhardt's poems are illustrations of this statement.

   A parallel arrangement of these various versions reveals the following
   interesting facts. First, that literalness has been rarely attained for
   the reason that a certain measure of freedom has to be used in any
   metrical rendering. Some, as for example, [107]Dr. J. Kelly, have
   striven to maintain fidelity to the sense of the original and thereby
   have often sacrificed euphony to fidelity. Secondly, there has been
   made necessary the frequent use of the double rhymes which are as
   common in the German language, on account of its peculiar structure, as
   monosyllabic rhymes are in English. The limited number of double rhymes
   in English has presented a serious obstacle in the way of rendering
   German hymns with their native force and simplicity without which
   qualities the hymns cannot become truly naturalized. In so many cases
   have the German hymns and tunes been considered as one and inseparable,
   that the translators have sought to preserve the original metres for
   the sake of the tunes which would not of course admit of any deviation
   without harm to their characteristic beauty.

   In the following pages we shall discuss those of Gerhardt's hymns (84
   in number) which have been translated into English, and cite in most
   cases the hymn books which have been among the first to recognize the
   excellence of the English versions. [121]

    Du liebe Unschuld du, wie schlecht wirst du geachtt!--(Goed. 3.)

   Appeared in the Crü. Praxis, 1656, p. 650.

      English Version:

   1. By [108]J. Kelly, under the heading, "Under the vexations of the
   wicked prosperous world," the first stanza as follows:

   Ah! lovely innocence, how evil art thou deemed,
   How lightly oft thy work by all the world's esteem'd!
   Thou servest God, thy Lord, and to His word thou cleavest.
   For this, from men thou nought but scorn and hate receivest.

   This translation is somewhat labored as is especially evident in line 4
   above for the German:

   "Darüber höhnt man dich und drückt dich aller Orten."

   Goedeke in his note to this hymn points out that from the use of the
   Alexandrine verse, the freedom from biblical phraseology and from the
   generality of the expressions it is probable that this is one of
   Gerhardt's earliest poems composed at a time when he patterned his
   writings after the model of Opitz. [122]

   influence of Opitz cf. p. 18.

    Wie ist so grosz und schwer die Last.--(Goed. 7.)

   Appeared in Crü.--Runge, 1653, no. 299.

   This fervent appeal for protection during the Thirty Years' War has
   been translated into English only by [109]J. Kelly 1867, p. 246. In
   line 36 he renders (from the Wackernagel text which he used):

   "Behold! my heart, on every hand."

   As mein Herr is very evidently the proper reading from the sense of the
   context and the character of the other stanzas, it is unfortunate that
   his otherwise excellent rendering should be made to suffer by this one
   weak stanza.

   "Protection of God in hitherto dangerous times of war."

   Stanza 1. How heavy is the burden made
             That Thou upon our backs hast laid,
             O God! the Lord of Hosts,
             O God, whose anger rises high
             'Gainst workers of iniquity.
     __________________________________________________________________

    O Herrscher in dem Himmelszelt.--(Goed. 15.)

   Appeared in Crü.--Runge, 1653, no. 315.

   This poem and "Nun ist der Regen hin" (cf. Goed. [110]17, below) were
   both written during the Thirty Years' War and inspired by the same
   occasion. Gerhardt in two instances uses the same set of rhymes:

      Goed. 15      Goed. 17
   l. 1  zelt    l. 31 feld
      2  feld       32 zelt

      51 bekehrt    5  gekehrt
      52 erhört     6  erhöret

   The long metre lends itself well to English translation, and [111]Kelly
   in his English version has observed with precision the pleading and
   melancholy tone of the original.

   Stanza 1. O God! who dost Heav'n's sceptre wield,
             What is it that now makes our field,
             And everything that it doth bear,
             Such sad and ruined aspect wear? [123]
             [112]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 294.

   His last stanza forms by its fervor an even stronger conclusion than
   Gerhardt's. The alteration from "bis in unsern Tod" to "as long as we
   may live" is a decided improvement, and more consistent with the
   thought of the context:

   Verleih uns bis in unsern Tod
   Alltäglich unser liebes Brot
   Und dermaleins nach diser Zeit
   Das süsze Brot der Ewigkeit!      And, Lord, as long as we may live
                                     Our daily bread in bounty give
                                     And when the end of time we see
                                     The bread give of eternity.

    Nun ist der Regen hin.--(Goed. 17.)

   First published in Crü.--Runge, 1653, no. 315.

   This simple nature poem expressing to the Almighty thanks for gracious
   sunshine after a storm has appeared but once in English verse, the
   version of [113]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 298. The many poetic allusions and
   references to nature he has imitated very acceptably, at times even
   surpassing the thought of the original. In the first stanza the rhymes
   "gekehret" and "erhöret" have been especially aptly rendered by the
   accented ed in "turnéd" and spurnéd."

   Stanza 1. Now gone is all the rain,
             Rejoice my heart again,
             Sing after times of sadness
             To God thy Lord with gladness!
             Our God His heart hath turned
             Our pray'r He hath not spurned

   How successfully [114]Kelly has caught the spirit of Gerhardt's nature
   description is evident in stanza 9:

   Die Bäume werden schön
   In ihrer Fülle stehen,
   Die Berge werden flieszen,
   Und Wein und Oele gieszen,
   Das Bienlein wird wol tragen
   Bei guten warmen Tagen.         The trees so very fair
                                   Fruit-laden will stand there;
                                   From hill-sides like a river
                                   Will wine and oil flow ever
                                   In warm and quiet weather
                                   Will bees their honey gather.

    Noch dennoch must du drum nicht ganz.--(Goed. 23.)

   Appeared in the Crü. Praxis, 1656, no. 814.

   This hymn of consolation seems to refer to some particular disaster
   that had befallen the community during the Thirty Years' War. The
   "drum" in line 1 may possibly refer to some address or announcement
   made to the congregation.

   The poem has been well translated in full by [118]J. Kelly, 1867, p.
   230. He makes no attempt to render the doubtful meaning above referred
   to in the word "drum." On the other hand his interpretations of several
   rather obscure lines (cf. lines 29 and 43 below) are undoubtedly
   correct.

   Stanza 1. Thou must not altogether be
             O'ercome by sad vexation,
             God soon will cause to shine on thee
             The light of consolation.
             In patience wait, and be thou still
             And let the Lord do what He will,
             He never can do evil.

   Lines 29, 30 [125] are rendered:

   God therefore all our joys doth blight.
   Lets trials overtake us,

   and lines 43, 44: [126]

   Afflicted band! oh, fall ye now
   With contrite hearts before Him,

   In this last citation [119]Kelly is right in assuming it is not
   literally the "army" but rather the congregation or community that
   Gerhardt is here addressing.

    Wie soll ich dich empfangen.--(Goed. 25.)

   [120](Cf. p. 82.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [125] Gerhardt, lines 29, 30: Drum fährt uns Gott durch unsern Sinn Und
   läszt uns Weh geschehen;

   nieder;
     __________________________________________________________________

    Nun du lebest, unsre Krone.--(Goed. 28.)

   This poem was appended to an address delivered in Berlin on the 23d of
   March, 1648, at the funeral of Peter Fritzen, the President of the
   Consistory.

      English Version:

   1. On thy bier how calm thou'rt sleeping
      Yet thou livest, oh our crown!
      Watch eternal art thou keeping,
      Standing near thy Savior's throne.
      Endless joy thy portion now!
      Why should tears so freely flow?
      What should thus in sorrow sink us?
      Up! aright let us bethink us!

   A complete translation by [121]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 338.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Sei mir tausendmal gegrüszet.--(Goed. 40.)

   Taken from the "Salve mundi salutare," ascribed to St. Bernard of
   Clairvaux. [127] The text of this beautiful poem is in St. Bernard's
   Opera Omnia, Paris, 1609, cols. 1655-56. Here it is entitled "A
   rhythmical prayer to anyone of the members of Christ suffering and
   hanging on the Cross," and is divided into 7 parts viz:

          I. Salve mundi salutare (to the Feet).
          II. Salve Jesu, Rex sanctorum (to the Knees).
          III. Salve Jesu, pastor bone (to the Hands).
          IV. Salve Jesu, summe bonus (to the Side).
          V. Salve salus mea, Deus (to the Breast).
          VI. Summi Regis cor aveto (to the Heart).
          VII. Salve caput cruentatum (to the Face).

   The whole poem has been frequently translated into German. The best
   known translations are those by Paul Gerhardt, which are free versions
   of all the seven parts from the Latin text of 1609. Of Gerhardt's
   versions, nos. I, V, VI, and VII have passed into English, as follows:
     __________________________________________________________________

   [127] Bernard of Clairvaux, saint, abbot, and doctor, was born in
   Burgundy in 1091, entered the monastery of Citeaux in 1113. In 1146 he
   spent much time in traversing France and Germany to rouse the people to
   participate in the ill-fated second crusade. He died in 1153. The hymns
   by which he is best known are (1) "Jesu dulcis memoria," a long poem on
   the "Name of Jesus," and (2) "Salve mundi salutare," an address to the
   various members of Christ on the cross. Hymns, translated from, or
   founded on, St. Bernard's will be found in almost every modern hymnal.

   His rendering of the similes and metaphors of this hymn is especially
   good. Cf. stanza VI:

   Betrachte, wer ich bin,
   Im Hui fahr ich dahin,
   Zerbrechlich wie ein Glas,
   Vergänglich wie ein Gras
   Ein Wind kann mich fällen.   Consider what we be--

                                As brittle as frail glass
                                As fading as the grass,
                                By a breath we're swept off.

      Thy Savior yields his breath.
   2. Behold his Body swims in blood;
      Out of his tender Heart,
      Deep sighs and Groans he sends to God

   This is a fine hymn of supplication to the Holy Spirit for His gifts
   and graces. It is widely popular in Germany, and is included in the
   Berlin G. L. S.: 1863, no. 366. Through the version of [153]J. C.
   Jacobi it has also been very largely used in various forms, in Great
   Britain and America.

      English Versions:

        1. O Thou sweetest source of gladness.

   A full and good translation by [154]J. C. Jacobi, in his Psal. Ger.,
   1725, pt. II, p. 6. Jacobi's stanzas I-IV, IX, X, were considerably
   altered, as "[155]Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness," by A. M. Toplady, in
   the Gospel Magazine, June, 1776. In Sedgwick's ed. of Toplady's Hymns
   and Sacred Poems, 1860, p. 169, these stanzas appear:
    1. Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness;
    2. From that height which knows no measure.
    3. Come, Thou best of all donations.
    4. Known to Thee are all recesses.
    5. Manifest Thy love for ever.
    6. Be our Friend on each occasion.

   The alteration in Sedgwick is, therefore, as follows:

   Gerhardt: I II III IV V VI VII (VIII IX) X
   Toplady:  1 3  2   4    5                6

   The hymn appears in many centos, though it usually begins with the
   first stanza of the text above, "Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness." There
   are many centos in the original metre, but other metre has been
   employed also, as:

   (1) 8.7.8.7.4.7 metre. Cf. a greatly altered version of stanzas I, III,
   in Bickersteth's Christian Psalmody, 1883.

   (2) 8.7.8.7. metre. 10 centos. Cf. Cong. H. Book, 1836, 2 stanzas, and
   Pennsylvania Lutheran Ch. Book, 1868, in 3 stanzas of 8 lines.

   Other centos are:

   (1) Holy Spirit, Source of gladness, in the American Unitarian Bk. of
   Hymns 1848, and other collections.

   (2) Come, Thou Source of sweetest gladness, in Stopford Brooke's
   Christian Hymns, 1881. Both these centos are altered forms of the
   [156]Jacobi-Toplady text.

        2. Sweetest joy the soul can know.

   A good translation, omitting stanzas VIII and IX, by [157]Miss
   Winkworth, in her [158]Lyra Ger., 2d Series, 1858, p. 55, and again,
   altered in metre, as "Sweetest Fount of holy gladness," in her [159]C.
   B. for England, 1863, no. 73. In this, stanzas II and IV, as in Lyra
   Ger., are omitted. From this text is derived no. 408 of the American
   Hymns of the Spirit, 1864. Cf. also no. 105 in [160]Stryker's Christian
   Chorals, N. Y., 1885, which is taken from the Chorale Book text.

      Selected Stanzas:

   [161]J. C. Jacobi, 1722, altered by A. M. Toplady, 1776, in the
   Schaff-Gilman Library of Religious Poetry, 1881.

   1. Holy Ghost, dispel my sadness,
      Pierce the clouds of sinful night;
      Come, thou source of sweetest gladness,
      Breathe thy life and spread thy light!
      Loving Spirit, God of peace!
      Great distributer of grace!
      Rest upon this congregation,
      Hear, oh, hear our supplication!

   [162]Miss Winkworth, in her [163]Chorale Book for England, 1863.

   1. Sweetest Fount of holy gladness,
      Fairest light was ever shed
      Who alike in joy and sadness
      Leavest none unvisited;
      Spirit of the Highest God,
      Lord, from whom is life bestow'd,
      Who upholdest ev'rything,
      Hear me, hear me, while I sing.

    Nun danket all und bringet Ehr.--(Goed. 78.)

   Appeared in Ebeling, 1648, no. 181.

   It is based on the Apocryphal book Sirach I. 24, and inspired also of
   course by the famous hymn of [164]Martin Rinckart [130] "[165]Nun
   danket alle Gott," which may be called the German Te Deum. As a great
   part of Rinckart's life, was, like Gerhardt's, spent amid the horrors
   of the Thirty Years' War it is natural that Gerhardt should have been
   influenced by this voluminous writer. Rinckart's hymn was translated by
   [166]Miss Winkworth in her [167]Chorale Book, but for some reason she
   has passed over Gerhardt's verses. As Rinckart was a good musician and
   his melody [131] was well calculated to please the popular ear it is
   not strange that his hymn has maintained itself ahead of Gerhardt's.

   The only English version published is that of [168]J. Kelly, 1867, p.
   238. [132]

   Stanza 1. In grateful songs your voices raise,
             All people here below,
             To Him whom angels ever praise
             In heav'n His glory show.

   The translation has much more flowery language than the original and is
   far less direct, cf. "In grateful songs" as compared with "Nun danket
   all," and in the second stanza a virtual repetition of this "with
   gladsome songs now fill the air" for the very forceful reflexive
   construction "Ermuntert euch." Throughout the poem the English version
   brings out more emphatically than the German the idea of life in
   eternity. Cf. stanza 6:

   And may his blessing ever rest.

   and the last two lines of stanza 8:

   Our portion when from earth we part,
       To all eternity.

   In the closing stanza the translation by losing the fervor of
   Gerhardt's verses is almost anticlimactic. The German is a fervent
   prayer that God may close our eyes and appear to us in eternity, while
   the English, in too evident an effort to effect a rhyme with rest,
   would seem to assign to the Deity a place almost secondary in
   importance to "our eyes." Cf. stanza 9. [133]

   When sinks the heart, when strength decays,
   By Him our eyes be press'd
   Then may we see His open face,
       In everlasting rest.

   Rinckart.

   [169]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 107.

   The rhyme of the German has offered great difficulties in the last
   three lines of each stanza. The translator's success in meeting this
   obstacle has been indifferent. Cf.:

      My hope can never shaken be,
      Nor e'er be put to shame by Thee.

   A full translation by [182]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 88. This is one of the
   best pieces of interpretation as regards harmony and rhythm and the
   spirit of the original, that he has given us. Kelly is at his best in
   rendering the "long metre" hymns (cf. Goed. [183]260, [184]287, etc.).
   Stanza 9 is especially noteworthy:

  Nun, Herr, ich bin dir wolbekannt,
  Mein Geist, der schwebt in deiner Hand;
  Du siehst, wie meine Seele thränt
  Und sich nach deiner Hülfe selint.       Ah! Lord full well Thou knowest

   It would be inconceivable that Gerhardt should omit the first Psalm
   from his themes, and his hymn adapts so well the biblical text that we
   should expect more than the one English version of [224]J. Kelly, 1867,
   p. 130. [136] In his rendering the translator has done well to infuse
   much of the poetic language of the English Bible.

   Stanza 1.      Bless'd is he who never taketh
                  Counsel of ungodly men!
                  Bless'd, the right who ne'er forsaketh,
                  Nor in sinners' paths is seen,
                  Who the scorners' friendship spurns,
                  From their seats away who turns,
                  Who delight in God's word taketh,
                  This his meditation maketh.
   Stanza 2.
   (Lines 1 & 2.) Bless'd is he who pleasure taketh
                  In God's laws' most perfect way.
   Stanza 3.
   (Lines 1 & 2.) He will truly ever flourish
                  Who God's word delights to do.
   Stanza 4.
   (Lines 1 & 2)  But he who in sin's ways goeth
                  Is like chaff the wind before.

   Appeared in Crü.--Runge, 1653, no. 243.

   The CXIIth Psalm of David celebrating the prosperity of the godly is
   the basis for Gerhardt's beautiful hymn which has found great
   popularity in German hymn-books. The translation by [225]J. Kelly,
   1867, p. 132, is the only English version published. While Gerhardt
   follows quite closely the poetic language of the Bible, the translator
   departs often from what might be expected as the normal English
   equivalent of Gerhardt's diction. In the following stanzas the
   translation brings out excellently Gerhardt's simile and metaphor.

   Stanza 1. Bless'd is he the Lord who loveth,
             At His word doth tremble aye!
             Bless'd whose heart him freely moveth
             God's commandments to obey.
             Who the Highest loves and fears,
             Findeth increase with the years.
             Of all that to him is given
             By the bounteous band of Heaven.
   Stanza 5. When the black clouds o'er them lighten,
             And the pealing thunders shock
             They shall sit and nought shall frighten,
             Like the dove hid in the rock; [137]
             They'll remain eternally,
             And their memory shall be
             Upon every side extending,
             As their branches trees are sending. [138]

   Cf. also lines 1 and 2 of stanza 2:

   His dear children shall stand ever [139]
   Like to roses in their blow; . . .

    Schwing dich auf zu deinern Gott.--(Goed. 135.)

   Appeared in Crü.--Runge, 1653, no.*288, under the title "Trost in
   schwerer Anfechtung."

   The only English version of this fervent hymn of consolation in
   despondency and temptation is that of [226]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 195.
   Nearly every line has the force and directness of the original
   especially in the verses addressed to the Soul, charging it to defy the
   wiles of Satan and to seek strength and consolation in Nature's
   bounties. Gerhardt's poem is one of close introspection and self
   analysis, and the translator interprets with feeling its spirit of
   "Trost."

   IN DESPONDENCY AND TEMPTATION.
   Stanza 1. Look up to thy God again,
             Soul, sunk in affliction!
             Shall He be reproach'd by men
             Through thy sore dejection?
             Satan's wiles dost thou not see?
             By severe temptation,
             Gladly would he keep from thee
             Jesu's consolation.

   1. What pleases God, O pious soul,
   Accept with joy; though thunders roll
   And tempests lower on every side,
   Thou knowest nought can thee betide
       But pleases God.   1. What God decrees, child of his love,
   Take patiently, though it may prove
   The storm that wrecks thy treasure here;--
   Be comforted! thou needst not fear
       What pleases God.
   2. The best will is our Father's will,
   And we may rest there calm and still,
   Oh make it hour by hour thine own,
   And wish for nought but that alone,
       Which pleases God.   2. The wisest will is God's own will:
   Rest on this anchor, and be still;
   For peace around thy path shall flow,
   When only wishing here below
       What pleases God.
   3. His thought is aye the wisest thought;
   How oft man's wisdom comes to nought;
   Mistake or weakness in it lurks,
   It brings forth ill, and seldom works
       What pleases God.

    Frölich soll mein Herze springen.--(Goed. 155.)

   [Christmas.]

   (Cf. Koch IV, p. 130.)

   Appeared in Crü. Praxis, 1653 and 1656, no. 104, in 15 stanzas of 8
   lines; reprinted in Wackernagel: no. 5; and Bachmann: no. 44; Unv. L.
   S.: 1851, no. 35.

   Lauxmann, in Koch, VIII, 26, thus analyses it:

   "First a trumpet blast: Christ is born, God's Champion has appeared as
   a Bridegroom from his chamber (I, II). In the following 4 stanzas the
   poet seeks to set forth the mighty value of the Incarnation: is it not
   love when God gives us the Son of His Love (III), the Kingdom of Joy
   (IV) and His Fellowship (V)? Yes, it is indeed the Lamb of God who
   bears the sin of the world (VI). Now he places himself as herald by the
   cradle of the Divine Child (VII). He bids, as in Matt. XI, 28, all men
   (VIII), all they that labor (IX), all the heavy laden (X), and all the
   poor (XI), to draw near. Then in conclusion he approaches in
   supplication like the shepherds and the Wise Men (XII-XV). He adores
   the child as the source of life (XII), his Lamb of God (XIII), his
   Glory (XIV), and promises to be ever true to Him (XV). It is a glorious
   series of Christmas thoughts, laid as a garland on the manger at
   Bethlehem."

   Crüger gave the hymn an original melody in 1656 (as in L. Erk's
   Choralbuch, 1863, no. 86), but the melody generally used (in Church
   Hymns called "[245]Bonn") is that by J. G. Ebeling in the Geistliche
   Andachten, 1666, to "Warum sollt ich mich derm grämen." [140] The hymn
   is very beautiful, but somewhat long, hence generally abridged.

      English Versions:

        1. Let the voice of glad thanksgiving.

   A good translation of stanzas I-III, VI-IX, by [246]A. T. Russell, as
   no. 15, in the Dalston Hospital Hymn Bk., 1848, and repeated, in part,
   as no. 56, in his own Psalms and Hymns, 1851.

   A beautiful, but rather free translation omitting stanzas III-V, XIII,
   XIV, by [247]Miss Winkworth in the 2d series of her [248]Lyra Ger.,
   1858, p. 13. In America it appeared in the Dutch Reformed Hymns of the
   Church, 1869, the Hymns and Songs of Praise, N. Y., 1874, etc. Parts
   have appeared also in the New Zealand Hymnal, 1872, the Evangelistic
   Hymnal, N. Y., 1890, and Laudes Domini, N. Y., 1884, etc. It is very
   generally included in cento form in nearly all current American
   hymnals.

        3. All my heart with joy is springing.

      Hither fly! hark! they cry,
      Christ to earth is given!

   [256]Miss Winkworth, 1858, in her [257]Lyra Germanica.

   1. All my heart this night rejoices,
      As I hear, far and near,
      Sweetest angel voices:

   This is a beautiful hymn in which the poet puts himself in the place of
   the shepherds and the wise men visiting Bethlehem; and in praise and
   adoration tenders his devotion, his love and his all to the Infant
   Savior in the manger.

      English Versions:

   1. Stanzas I, IV, VII, XV, have been translated by [258]Rev. A. T.
   Russell in his Ps. and Hys., 1851, no. 57. His translation of stanza I
   is as follows:

   My faith Thy lowly bed beholds,
   My Life and my Salvation;
   Thee in my heart my faith enfolds,
   And brings Thee her oblation.
   My heart and soul, will, spirit, mind,
   Oh, take them all, to Thee resign'd:
   Make all to Thee well-pleasing.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [141] This is Gerhardt's third Christmas hymn (cf. also Goed. 150, 153,
   155, 310, 312). It is very probable that in composing it the poet had
   in mind the words of St. Jerome of Strido, abbot of a monastic
   brotherhood in Bethlehem 386-420: "As often as I gaze on this place
   (the manger at Bethlehem), so often does my heart converse with the
   Infant Jesus which lay there in the manger . . . I say . . . "I must
   give Thee something, Dear Child! I will give Thee all my wealth," and
   the child answered--"Give it to the poor, I will accept it as if it
   were given me."--cf. Koch IV, p. 137.

      With griefs his heart had broken.

   This is stanza 1 of a complete translation of the seven stanzas of
   Gerhardt's Easter hymn, keeping well the spirit and fervor of the
   original, at the same time observing the literality in an unusually
   difficult metre. Cf. stanza 7:

   Nu Gott sei Dank, der uns den Sieg
   Durch Jesum hat gegeben
   Und uns den Frieden für den Krieg
   Und für den Tod das Leben
   Erworben, der die Sünd und Tod,
   Welt, Teufel, Höll und was in Not
   Uns stürzet, überwunden.            Now praised be God, who vict'ry hath
                                       To us through Jesus given,
                                       Who peace for war, and life for death,
                                       With entrance into Heaven,
                                       Hath purchas'd, who death, sin, and woe,

                                      Who while on earth permit this Guest
                                      To make in them His dwelling;
                                      Who now receive him joyfully,
                                      He'll take up to God's house on high,
                                      Their souls with rapture filling.

   On the other hand in stanza 5 the translator has coped very
   successfully with the many difficulties of rhyme and metre:

   Und das ist auch ein Gnadenwerk
   Und deines heilgen Geistes Stärk;
   In uns ist kein Vermögen.
   Wie bald würd unser Glaub und Treu,
   Herr, wo du uns nicht stündest bei
   Sich in die Aschen legen!             This is a work of grace indeed,
                                         The Holy Spirit's strength we need,
                                         Our pow'r is unavailing;
                                         Our faith and our sincerity
                                         Would soon, O Lord! in ashes lie
                                         Were not Thy help unfailing.

   Translated by [269]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 235, in seven stanzas of seven
   lines each. The rhyme and metre have been altered after the first four
   lines in each stanza, with the result that the version is one of this
   translator's least successful contributions.

   Stanza 1. How long, Lord, in forgetfullness
             And darkness wilt Thou leave me?
             How long will sorrow on me press
             And deep heart-anguish grieve me?

   1612. [143]

      English Versions:

   (A.) Wesley.

        1. Jesus, Thy boundless love to me.

   A full and very fine translation by [271]J. Wesley in Hymns and Sacred
   Poems, 1739 (P. Works, 1868-72, vol. I, p. 138). [144] In the Wesleyan
   Hymn Book, 1780, it was reduced to 9 stanzas.

   Centos of the Wesley version are:

   Bk. of Hymns, Boston, U. S. A., 1848.

   (2.) My Savior, Thou Thy love to me. (Stanza V.)

   Moravian H. Bk., 1789.

   Bk. of Hymns, Boston, U. S. A., 1848. Amer. Unitarian H. Bk., 1869.

   (6.) Still nigh me, O my Savior stand.

   This stanza is taken from a hymn "Peace, doubting heart, my God's I
   am," by [272]C. Wesley. To this is added in Snepp's Songs of G. and G.,
   stanzas XII, XIV, XVI, and in J. L. Porter's Collection, 1876, stanzas
   XII, XV, XVI, of this translation of [273]J. Wesley.

   (7.) Thou Friend of Sinners! Who hast bought.

   This is stanzas V, IV, XVI, rewritten by E. Osler and published in the
   Mitre H. Bk., 1836.

   (B.) Other English versions:

        1. O Christ, my sweetest Life and Light.

   In the Suppl. to German Psal., ed. 1765, p. 29, and the Moravian H.
   Bk., 1754 (and with slight change in the ed. of 1789, and 1849), viz:
   In the 1746 ed. in part II there appear as a separate hymn stanzas
   V-VII, beginning "Thou cam'st in love to my relief." In the 1789, and
   1849 ed., it begins "O Christ, my only Life and Light."

        2. O Jesus Christ! my fairest Light.

      Selected Stanzas:

   In the Moravian Hymn Book, 1754 (author's name not given).

   1. O Christ my sweetest Life and Light!
      Whose loving Condescension
      Embraces me by day and night
      Beyond my comprehension:
      Lord! grant me to return thy Love
      With due and true devotion,
          That my notion
      Of Mercy may improve
      With ev'ry thought and motion.

   [275]J. Wesley, 1739, in the 1754 ed., Part I, of the Moravian Hymn
   Book.

   1. Jesu, thy boundless Love to me
      No thought can reach, no tongue declare:
      O knit my thankful heart to Thee
      And reign without a rival there.
      Thine wholly, thine alone I am:
      Be thou alone my constant Flame.

   [276]J. Wesley, 1739, in Snepp's Songs of Grace and Glory, 1872. It is
   stanza 2 of a hymn beginning "Still nigh me, O my Savior stand" in
   Snepp, and Gerhardt's stanza XII: "Was ists, o Schönster, dasz ich
   nicht / In deiner Liebe habe?" etc.

   Stanza 1. What in Thy love possess I not?
             My star by night, my sun by day;
             My spring of life, when parched with drought,
             My wine to cheer, my bread to stay,
             My strength, my shield, my safe abode,
             My robe before the throne of God!

   [143] This hymn led Philipp Friedrich Hiller to think of turning all of
   these prayers in the Paradiszgärtlein into hymns. The result was his
   work entitled "Arndt's Paradiszgärtlein . . . in teutsche Lieder,"
   Nürnberg (no date given). The book is in four parts and contains 301
   hymns, 297 being founded on Arndt and 4 original.

   [279]Russell stanza 1          2  3                  4

    Ich weisz, mein Gott, dasz all mein Thun.--(Goed. 217.)

   [Supplication.]

   A prayer for success in all Christian works and purpose; founded on
   Jeremiah X, 23, and Acts V, 38, 39. Cf. Koch IV, 98. Included in Crü.
   Praxis, 1653, no. 321, 1656, no. 332, in 18 stanzas of 5 lines; thence
   in Wackernagel: no. 40; Bachmann: no. 71; Berlin, G. L. S.: 1863.

   In the Ebeling edition the hymn has the title: "Um Glück und Segen zu
   allem christlichen Thun und Vorhaben." It has on many occasions been
   given as a farewell injunction by parents to their children on leaving
   home.

      English Versions:

        1. I know, my God, and I rejoice.

   (Stanzas I-III, VIII, XI, IX) by [286]Miss Winkworth in her
   [287]Chorale Book, 1863, no. 121.

        2. My God! my works and all I do.

      Selected Stanzas:

   [289]Miss Winkworth in her [290]Chorale Book, 1863.

   1. I know, my God, and I rejoice
      That on Thy righteous will and choice
      All human works and schemes must rest:
      Success and blessing are of Thee,
      What Thou shalt send is surely best.
   2. It stands not in the power of man
      To bring to pass the wisest plan
      So surely that it cannot fail;
      Thy counsel, Highest, must ensure
      That our poor wisdom shall avail.

    Du bist ein Mensch, das weiszt du wol.--(Goed. 220.)

   Appeared in Crü. Praxis, 1656, no. 330.

   A hymn of self-abnegation, even self-denunciation, emphasizing the
   frailty and insignificance of mortals, and closing with an admonition
   of resignation to God's wise dispensations. Though Gerhardt frequently
   employs this form of rhyme [146] only rarely does he combine it with
   this metre. Both have been strictly observed by [291]J. Kelly, 1867, p.
   148:

   Stanza 1. Thou art but man, to thee 'tis known,
             Why dost thou then endeavor
             To do what God should do alone,
             Or can accomplish ever?
             A thousand griefs thou goest through,
             In spite of all thy wit can do;
             Upon thine end thou pond'rest
             What it will be thou wond'rest.

   Stanza 1. I have deserv'd it, cease t'oppose
             The Lord's will, shall I never?
             Thou bitter cup, thou heavy cross,
             Come hither to me ever!
             From pain all free
                 May never be
             He 'gainst the Lord who fighteth,
                 As I each day,

             Wherein the world delighteth. . . .
   [292]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 165.

   This is one of the least adaptable poems of Gerhardt and it is evident
   that the translator has struggled with the many difficulties of metre
   and frequent rhyme.

             Who laid himself betimes to rest?
   [293]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 143.

   A free, but very acceptable rendering in which the easy colloquial
   style of the original has been well retained. Cf. lines 7 and 8:

   "Denn, Lieber, denk und sage mir:
   Was für ein Stand ist wol allhier."   "Reflect, my friend, say, if you

      Selected Stanzas:

   [298]Miss Winkworth in her [299]Lyra Ger., 1855.

   1. Cometh sunshine after rain,
      After mourning joy again.
      After heavy bitter grief
      Dawneth surely sweet relief;
      And my soul, who from her height
      Sank to realms of woe and night,
      Wingeth now to heav'n her flight.
   2. He, whom this world dares not face,
      Hath refreshed me with his grace,
      And his mighty hand unbound
      Chains of hell, about me wound;
      Quicker, stronger, leaps my blood,
      Since his mercy, like a flood,
      Poured o'er all my heart for good.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Soll ich meinem Gott nicht singen.--(Goed. 235.)

   [Thanksgiving.] Cf. Koch, IV, 91 ff.

   One of Gerhardt's finest hymns, setting forth God's love in His
   creation, redemption and sanctification of the world, His care in
   trouble. It closes with a prayer which [300]R. Massie renders:

   Grant me grace, O God, I pray Thee,
   That I may with all my might
   Love and trust Thee and obey Thee,
   All the day and all the night;
   And when this brief life is o'er
   Love and praise Thee evermore.

   The hymn was included in the 5th ed., Berlin, 1653, and in the
   Frankfurt ed., 1656, of Crü. Praxis, no. 230; thence in Wackernagel:
   no. 81; Bachmann: no. 60; Unv. L. S.: 1851, no. 722.

      English Versions:

   [301]Dr. Mills in his Horae Germanicae, 1845, p. 141, and 1856, p. 195.

   This is a mediocre version, as it misses the characteristic points of
   the German. His stanzas II, IV-VII beginning "As the eagle fondly
   hovers," were included in the Amer. Luth. Gen. Synod's Collection,
   1850-52, no. 35.

        2. Shall I not sing praise to Thee.

   A full and good translation by [302]Miss Winkworth in her [303]Lyra

   her [304]C. B. for England, 1863, no. 10. Included in full in Cantate
   Domino, Boston, U. S. A., 1859.

        3. I will sing my Maker's praises.

   A good translation omitting stanzas VI, VIII, contributed by [305]R.
   Massie to the 1857 ed. of Mercer's C. P. & H. Bk., no. 185, reprinted
   in his own Lyra Domestica, 1864. [147]

      Selected Stanzas:

   [309]Dr. Mills in his Horae Germanicae, 1856.

   1. Shall I not His praise be singing
      Who in glory reigns above:--
      Him my thanks and honors bringing,
      For the blessings of his love?
      Those, who with sincere endeavor
      Keep the way that He has shown,
      He will as his children own,
      Yielding them a father's favor.
      All things else their time will last
      But His love, when Time is past.

   [310]Miss Winkworth, in her [311]Chorale Book for England, 1863.

   1. Shall I not sing praise to Thee,
      Shall I not give thanks, O Lord?
      Since for us in all I see
      How thou keepest watch and ward;
      How the truest tend'rest love
      Ever fills Thy heart, my God,
      Helping, cheering, on their road
      All who in Thy service move.

   [312]M. W. Stryker, 1882, in his Christian Chorals, 1885.

   1. Should I not, in meek adoring,
      Thank my gracious God above
      Whom I see on all things pouring
      Forth the sunshine of His love?
      For 'tis naught but Love's own loving

      English Version:

   O God! from Thee doth wisdom flow,
   All I can do Thou well dost know;
   If Thine own grace doth not sustain,
   Then all my labor is in vain. . . .

   A complete and very good translation by [315]J. Kelly. The long metre
   of 8 syllables seems to lend itself more readily to adaptation into
   English. In the fourth stanza, first line, Kelly has resorted to a
   device common to translators, that of making up the extra accent where
   the corresponding English cognate has lost the ending, by selecting
   instead of a monosyllabic adverb an adverb of two syllables. Here, of
   course, "very" for "sehr" makes literality and meter perfect.

   Mein Leben ist sehr kurz und schwach
   My life is very short and weak.

   As exact and appropriate translation as is possible word for word is
   found in stanza ???:

   Ich lieb ihr [148] liebes Angesicht,
   Sie ist meins Herzens Freud und Licht;
   Sie ist die schönste, die mich halt
   Und meinen Augen wolgefällt.            I love her lovely face so bright.
                                           She is my joy and heart's delight
                                           The fairest is that holdeth me
                                           Mine eyes she pleaseth wondrously.

    Jesu, allerliebster Bruder.--(Goed. 263.)

   Based on Johann Arndt's Paradiszgärtlein, 1, 33, 92. It appeared in
   Crü. Praxis, 1661, no. 374.

      English Version:

   1. Jesus! Thou, my dearest Brother,
      Who dost well to me intend,
      Thou mine Anchor, Mast, and Rudder
      And my truest Bosom-Friend.
      To Thee, ere was earth or heaven,
      Had the race of man been given;
      Thou, e'en me, poor guest of earth,
      Chosen hadst before my birth. . . .

   A complete translation by [316]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 112. The translator
   has well rendered a hymn of rather unusual difficulty of interpretation
   in a foreign tongue.

   An unavoidable weakening by translation appears in the last stanza:

   Nun, Herr lasz dirs wolgefallen,
   Bleib mein Freund bis in mein Grab!
   Bleib mein Freund und unter allen
   Mein getreuster stärkster Stab!      Gracious Savior! let it please Thee,
                                        Be my Friend in every hour
                                        Be my Friend, till death release me
                                        Be my faithful Staff of pow'r!

    Geduld ist euch vonnöten.--(Goed. 267.)

   Based on Hebrews X, 35-37. It appeared in Crü. Praxis, 1661, no. 375.

      English Version:

   1. 'Tis patience must support you
      When sorrow, grief, or smart,
      Or whate'er else may hurt you
      Doth rend your aching heart.
      Belov'd and chosen seed!
      If not a death will kill you,
      Yet once again I tell you
      'Tis patience that you need. . . .

   By [317]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 184. A complete translation of the 14
   stanzas, and in general very true to the original. It is noteworthy
   that the first line of each stanza contains the word "patience" as does
   the poem of Gerhardt the word "Geduld." Kelly's rendering of the last
   four lines illustrates as well as any the faithfulness of his version.

   Kommt dann der letzte Zug,
   So gib durch deine Hände
   Auch ein geduldigs Ende!
   So hab ich alles gnug.      And in my dying hour,
                               Thy mercy still extending,
                               Oh! grant a patient ending
                               Then need I nothing more.

    Nun sei getrost und unbetrübt.--(Goed. 271.)

   Subjoined to a funeral address by Johann Meiszner.

   This is one of Gerhardt's many "Trostgesänge," and though less well
   known than most of his hymns is deserving of wider recognition than it
   has hitherto received. As far as is at present known there has been
   published but one English version, that of [318]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 329,
   the first stanza of which is as follows:

   "JOYFUL RESIGNATION TO A HAPPY DEPARTURE FROM THIS WEARY WORLD."

   Stanza 1. Be glad, my heart! now fear no more,
             Let nothing ever grieve thee;
             Christ lives, who lov'd thee long before
             Thy being He did give thee,
             And ere He made thy wondrous frame;
             His love remaineth still the same,
             It ne'er can change to hatred.

   It is unfortunate that the translator has been satisfied with "glad"
   for the forceful "getrost" which connotes "confidence" and "trust" (to
   which it is indeed cognate) [149] and even "comfort in that confidence"
   to the point of being "courageous." More pardonable is his balking at
   the characteristic alliterative "Geist und Gemüte" which must mean not
   only the "feelings," but also "soul" and "intellect" as well. If
   "heart" be accepted in this broadest sense it is undoubtedly the best
   English equivalent. The psychology of language would presumably never
   allow in poetry a literal word-for-word rendering of "Geblüte, Fleisch,
   Haut," and the English reader is denied the poetic force of "ward"
   [150] also beautifully illustrated so frequently in the German Bible.
   Again it must be accounted a defect that the passive "ward zugericht"
   (1. 5) is changed to an active construction. The German passive is
   never used without sufficient reason, and Gerhardt chooses here to
   imply the divine mystery of birth. Here the English is too specific. On
   the other hand where the German is direct, "Dein Jesus" (1. 3),
   "Geblüte, Fleisch, Haut," (1. 4, 5), "Der" (1. 6), the English descends
   to the general.

   Stanza 7 preserves more of the "Stimmung" of the original:

   Thou Jesus! O thou sweetest Friend,
   My light and life art ever!
   Thou boldest me, dost me defend,
   The foe can move Thee never.
   In Thee I am, Thou art in me,
   As we are here, we'll ever be,
   Nought here or there can part us.

   It is difficult to see, however, why "allerliebster Freund" (line 43)
   could not have its logical equivalent "dearest Friend"; [151] and
   similarly in line 48, "Und wie wir stehen," might equally be "And as we
   are," instead of "As we are here," which seems rather forced.

   [334]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 138. &

   In his last stanza Kelly has nearly equalled the original in happily
   choosing for many of the words the exact English cognate:

   Und führe mich bald himmelan

    Was traurest du, mein Angesicht.--(Goed. 289.)

   Appeared in Ebeling, 1666, 2, 24.

   Of Gerhardt's hymns treating of Death, the Last Day, and Eternal Life,
   this is one of the least well known, and has not been retained in many
   German hymn books, mainly because of the mixed metaphor and the many
   unpoetic lines. It is translated in full by [335]J. Kelly, 1867, no.
   322, in stanzas of 7 lines, the long fifth line with the double rhyme
   being written as two short lines,

   Stanza 1. My face, why should'st thou troubled be
             When thou of death art hearing?
             Know it, it cannot injure thee,
             Contemplate it, ne'er fearing.
                   When thou dost know
                   Death, all its woe
             Will soon be disappearing.

   In stanza 19 Kelly has made the first personal pronoun predominant with
   the result that greater smoothness is obtained. He has, however, been
   obliged to omit what in the German are the best touches, namely the
   thoughts contained in "mein Hirt," "leiten" and "immergrün":

   O süsze Lust, o edle Ruh,
   O fromme Seelen Freude,
   Komm, schleusz mir meine Augen zu,
   Dasz ich mit Fried abscheide
   Hin, da mein Hirt mich leiten wird
   Zur immergrimen Weide.              O sweetest joy, O blessed rest!
                                       To all true-hearted given,
                                       Come, let mine eyes by Thee be pressed,
                                       In peace take me to heaven.
                                             May I roam there
                                             'Mong pastures fair
                                       Where day ne'er knoweth even.

      English Version:

   1. Lord God! Thou art forevermore

      And Thou existence hadst before
      Was laid the earth's foundation!

      Thou livedst in eternity,
      Of all things the beginning.

   Stanza 1 of a complete translation by [371]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 312.

   In this version the translator has lost much of the poetry and spirit
   not only of Gerhardt but of the ninetieth Psalm on which Gerhardt's
   poem is based. Witness the second and fourth lines above, where Kelly
   offers the feeble Latin derivatives for the virile "Die Zuflucht deiner
   Heerde" and "Grund."

      English Version:

   1. By John was seen a wondrous sight,
            A noble light,
      A picture very glorious:
      A multitude stood 'fore him there
      All bright and fair,
      On heav'nly plain victorious;
      Their heart and mood
      Were full of good,
      That mortal man
      With gold ne'er can
      Procure, so high 'tis o'er us. . . .

    Wie ist es müglich, höchstes Licht.--(Goed. 324.)

   Appeared in Ebeling, 8, 96.

   The English version by [373]J. Kelly, 1867, p. 259, is throughout more
   moderate in tone and does not reflect the utter self-abnegation of
   Gerhardt. [154]

   Stanza 1. How can it be, my highest Light!
             That as before Thy face so bright
             All things must pale and vanish,
             That my poor feeble flesh and blood
             Can summon a courageous mood
             To meet Thee, and fear banish?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [154] This is almost the only poem in which Gerhardt has not employed
   his characteristic alliteration or assonance, or introduced "Friede" or
   "Freude" words. On these characteristics cf. p. 2 ff.

   From the foregoing statements it is evident that even of Gerhardt's
   less well-known hymns there has been a comparatively large
   representation in English and American hymnals. The ten hymns which
   follow are so widely known through the excellent versions of [377]Miss
   Winkworth and others, that making the treatment more detailed, I shall
   discuss the individual merits of the different versions and compare
   their relative values as interpretations of the originals.

    Wie soll ich dich empfangen.--(Goed. 25.)

   [Advent.]

   First published in Crü.--Runge, 1653, no. 77, in 10 stanzas of 8 lines;
   thence in Wackernagel: no. 3; Bachmann: no. 22; Unv. L. S.: 1851, no.
   21. Cf. Koch IV, 119 ff.

   The hymn is founded on St. Matthew XXI, 1-9, the Gospel for the first
   Sunday in Advent. It is one of Gerhardt's finest productions, and is
   probably the best German Advent hymn. It is inferable from stanzas
   VI-IX that the poem was written during the Thirty Years' War. The
   entire first stanza has been set to music by Bach in the
   Weihnachtsoratorium, Part I.

      English Versions:

        1. How shall I meet my Savior.

   A translation in full, by [378]J. C. Jacobi, in his Psalmodia
   Germanica, 722, p. 3 (1732, slightly altered). Included in the Moravian
   Hymn Book, 1754, and also in later editions with alterations. Varying
   centos of this version are found in [379]Montgomery's Christian
   Psalmist, 1825; Dr. Pagenstecher's Collections, 1864; and Bishop Ryle's
   Collection, 1860. Other forms are:

     __________________________________________________________________

Commentary

   The first hymn in the Psalmodia Germanica [156] of [393]Jacobi (1722)
   is a translation of Luther's "Nun kommt der Heiden Heiland" ("Now the
   Savior comes indeed"). The second place in the book is given to
   Gerhardt's "Wie soll ich dich empfangen" which is translated as " How
   shall I meet my Savior." In a rather quaint preface [394]Jacobi writes:

   "The present Specimen hopes for a charitable Allowance from those, that
   may happen to use it. A Version of this Kind lies under various
   Disadvantages, known only to those, who in any degree are acquainted
   with any Poetical Translations of this Kind. A great Deal is lost of
   the Life and Spirit of an Hymn, when it appears in another Language."

   In this effort as well as in the case of "Befiehl du deine Wege"
   [395]Jacobi has left out so much, and incorporated so many ideas of his
   own which are at variance with Gerhardt's theme that it is difficult to
   recognize its kinship with the original. The effect Gerhardt produces
   in the first line by the use of the direct form of address is entirely
   lost by [396]Jacobi; also the translator creates an unpleasant
   impression by abruptly changing from the third person in the opening
   line to the second person in the next line.

   Bishop Ryle has altered the last quatrain to this form:

   I wait for Thy salvation;
   Grant me Thy Spirit's light,
   Thus will my preparation
   Be pleasing in Thy sight.

   Again, the diction of stanza two is particularly strange, at least to
   modern readers.

   I'll raise with all my Powers
   More Notes than Unison,

   would be quite bewildering if we did not have at hand the German which
   is so forceful in its very simplicity:

   Mein Herze soll dir grünen
   In stetem Lob und Preis.

   It is plain that [397]Jacobi had not much appreciation of the spirit of
   Gerhardt, for the distinctive touches of alliteration, repetition for
   emphasis, the prevailing note of joy and peace accompanying the
   Savior's advent are certainly not adequately reproduced. In fact the
   impression he leaves is almost one of gloom!

   Contrast with this the translation by [398]A. T. Russell, a cento of
   which (stanzas 1, 2, 7, 8, 10) is given in most American hymnals. Far
   more cheerful and more appropriate for the Advent season than anything
   in [399]Jacobi are such lines as:

   My heart to praise awaking,
   Her anthem shall prepare, (stanza 2)

   and

   That in the light eternal our
   Joyous home may be. (stanza 5)

   It is apt renderings like these that have won for Gerhardt a place in
   English hymnody.

   [400]Kelly's rendering (1867) is characteristically accurate, but,
   excepting such lines as:

   My heart shall blossom ever
   O'erflow with praises new (stanza 2)

   and

   O come Thou Sun and lead us
   To everlasting light, (stanza 10)

   it is uninspired and lacking in fervor.

   Of the 20 hymns of Gerhardt which [401]Miss Winkworth translated there
   are three for which she has made two renderings: "[402]O Haupt voll
   Blut und Wunden," "[403]Nun ruhen alle Wälder," and for this Advent
   hymn. The earlier version (1855) of the Advent hymn omits only the
   third stanza ("Was hast du unterlassen"). The later one (1863) is
   written in the original metre for church use to be sung to the
   traditional melody "Wie soll ich dich empfangen" by Johann Crüger [157]
   (1653) and contains but six stanzas. As [404]Miss Winkworth was so
   thoroughly at home in the German she was able to reproduce a surprising
   number of details. Even the alliteration and repetition for emphasis of
   which Gerhardt is so fond find in her poem at least a partially
   corresponding place:

   In heavy bonds I languished long (1855, stanza 3, 1)
   This weary world and all her woe (1855, stanza 4, 5)
   And labor longer thus (1855, stanza 6, 2)

   The original has been characterized as the best German Advent hymn and
   [405]Miss Winkworth has transfused it in her earlier version
   undiminished into her own language so that it reads like an original
   poem. Her final quatrain is worthy of Gerhardt:

   O Sun of Righteousness! arise,
   And guide us on our way
   To yon fair mansion in the skies
   Of joyous cloudless day.

    O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden.--(Goed. 49.)

   [Passiontide.]

   A beautiful but very free translation of the "Salve Caput Cruentatum,"
   which is part VII of the "Rhythmica Oratio," 1153, ascribed to St.
   Bernard of Clairvaux. [160] The Latin original follows:

   DE PASSIONE DOMINI: AD FACIEM.
   1. Salve, caput cruentatum,
      Totum spinis coronatum,
      Conquassatum, vulneratum,
      Arundine sic verberatum
      Facie sputis illita
      Salve, cuius dulcis vultus,
      Immutatus et incultus
      Immutavit suum florem
      Totus versus in pallorem
            Quem coeli tremit curia.
   2. Omnis vigor atque viror
      Hinc recessit, non admiror,
      Mors apparet in aspectu,
      Totus pendens in defectu,
      Attritus aegra macie.
      Sic affectus, sic despectus
      Propter me sic interfectus,
      Peccatori tam indigno
      Cum amoris intersigno
            Appare clara facie.
   3. In hac tua passione
      Me agnosce, pastor bone,
      Cuius sumpsi mel ex ore,
      Haustum lactis ex dulcore
      Prae omnibus deliciis,
      Non me reum asperneris,
      Nec indignum dedigneris
      Morte tibi iam vicina
      Tuum caput hic acclina,
            In meis pausa brachiis.
   4. Tuae sanctae passioni
      Me gauderem interponi,
      In hac cruce tecum mori
      Praesta crucis amatori,
            Sub cruce tua moriar.
      Morti tuae iam amarae
      Grates ago, Jesu care,
      Qui es clemens, pie Deus,
      Fac quod petit tuns reus,
      Ut absque te non finiar.
   5. Dum me mori est necesse,
      Noli mihi tune deesse;
      In tremenda mortis hora
      Veni, Jesu, absque mora,
            Tuere me et libera.
      Quum me jubes emigrare,
      Jesu care, tune appare;
      O amator amplectende,
      Temet ipsum tune ostende
      In cruce salutifera.

   Gerhardt's version appeared in the 1656 ed. of Crü. Praxis, no. 156, in
   10 stanzas of 8 lines; thence in Wackernagel: no. 22; Bachmann: no. 54;
   Unv. L. S.: 1851, no. 109. Cf. Koch, IV, 163; VIII, 47.

   In Koch VIII, 47, Lauxmann thus characterizes it:

   "Bernard's original is powerful and searching, but Gerhardt's hymn is
   still more powerful and profound, as redrawn from the deeper spring of
   evangelical Lutheran, Scriptural, knowledge, and fervency of faith."

   Stanza X Lauxmann traces not only to Bernard but to stanza II of "Valet
   Will ich dir geben" of Herberger, and to Luther's words on the death of
   his daughter Magdalen "Who thus dies, dies well."

   The melody to which the hymn is sung, usually called "[412]Passion
   Chorale," first appeared in Hans Leo Hassler's "Lustgarten," Nürnberg,
   1601, set to a love song, beginning "Mein G'müth ist mir verwirret."

   The hymn has often been signally blessed. The story is told that a
   Roman Catholic from Bohemia on hearing this hymn sung in a Protestant
   church was so overpowered that he shed tears of joy, for he saw clearer
   than ever his own sin and the Savior's grace; he understood better than
   ever the secret of justification by faith alone, and he became from
   that time a true evangelical Christian. Frederick William I., King of
   Prussia from 1713 to 1740, the father of Frederick the Great, ordered
   in his will that at his funeral this hymn should be played by the band.
   For other incidents connected with this hymn cf. Th. Kübler: Historical
   notes to the Lyra Germanica, London, 1865.

   The English versions are many, and of some of the versions there are
   several centos:

        1. O Head so full of bruises.

   In full, by [413]J. Gambold, in Some other Hymns and Poems, London,
   1752, p. 12. Repeated in the Moravian H. Book, 1754, pt. 1, no. 222
   (1789 greatly altered). In the 1789 ed. a new translation of stanza IX
   was substituted for [414]Gambold's version, his translation of stanza
   IX "When I shall gain permission" being given as a separate hymn.

   Centos of the above version are:

   a. "O Head, so pierced and wounded" in Dr. Pagenstecher's Collection,
   1864.

   b. "O Christ! what consolation" in the Amer. Bapt. H. Bk., 1871.

   c. "I yield Thee thanks unfeigned" (based on [415]Gambold's version of
   stanza IX) in E. Bickersteth's Christian Psalmody, 1833.

   d. "I give Thee thanks unfeigned" in Bishop Ryle's Collection, 1860.

        2. O Sacred Head! now wounded.

   A very beautiful translation by [416]Dr. J. W. Alexander. His
   translations of stanzas I, II, IV, VII-X, were first published in the
   Christian Lyre, N. Y., 1830, no. 136. These stanzas were revised, and
   translations of stanzas III, VI, were added by Dr. Alexander for
   Schaff's Deutscher Kirchenfreund, 1849, p. 91. The full text is in Dr.
   Alexander's Breaking Crucible, N. Y., 1861, p. 7; in Schaff's Christ in
   Song, 1869; and the Cantate Domino, Boston, U. S. A., 1850. [161] In
   his note Dr. Schaff says:

   "This classical hymn has shown an imperishable vitality in passing from
   the Latin into the German, and from the German into the English, and
   proclaiming in three tongues, and in the name of three Confessions--the
   Catholic, the Lutheran, and the Reformed--with equal effect, the dying
   love of our Savior and our boundless indebtedness to Him."

   Dr. Alexander's version has passed into very many English and American
   hymnals, and in very varying centos, some of which follow:

   a. "O sacred Head, now wounded," People's H., 1867; Hymnary, 1872;
   Hatfield's Church H. Bk., 1872; Hymns and Songs of Praise, N. Y., 1874,
   etc.

   b. "O Sacred Head! once wounded" (stanza I altered), Bapt. Ps. and
   Hys., 1858, etc.

   c. "O Sacred Head, sore wounded" (stanza I altered), in the Stoke Hymn
   Book, 1878.

   d. "O Sacred Head, so wounded" (stanza I altered), in J. L. Porter's
   Collection, 1876.

   e. "O blessed Christ, once wounded" (stanza I altered), in Dr. Thomas's
   Augustine H. Book, 1866.

   f. "O Lamb of God, once wounded" (stanza I altered), in Scottish Presb.
   Hyl., 1876.

   g. "O Lamb of God, sore wounded" (stanza I altered), in the Ibrox
   Hymnal, 1871.

        3. Ah! Head, so pierced and wounded.

Commentary

   The earliest known English translation of Gerhardt's Passiontide hymn
   is that of [426]J. Gambold, published in 1752. [162] It is written in
   his characteristic vein. Gambold has made no effort to do more than
   reproduce in doggerel the main ideas of the original without even
   attempting to gloss over the indelicate expressions which Gerhardt
   introduced from the Latin of Bernard. The "facie sputis illita" which
   in Gerhardt is modified to "Wie bist du so bespeit" (line 12) is given
   by Gambold with extreme literalness. His style becomes often ridiculous
   if indeed not wholly flippant when he attempts to imitate Gerhardt's
   familiarity [163] in addressing the Savior.

   Witness the first quatrain of stanza 7:

   It gives me solid pleasure
   My heart does not recoil
   When I dive in some measure
   Into thy Pangs and Toil. [164]

   It is easy to understand why this hymn should be printed in full in the
   crude Morazian Hymn Book of 1754 and even in later editions, but it is
   also obvious that more recent hymnals should have made drastic
   alterations and judicious omissions. Of the centos adapted from
   [427]Gambold's unpolished verses, that in Reid's Praise Book (1872)
   will show how changes were made to suit the more refined taste of the
   century following the early Moravian period. The quatrain cited above
   appears in Reid as follows:

   And oh! what consolation
   Doth in our hearts take place,
   When we Thy toil and passion
   Can joyfully retrace.

   An English writer who faithfully transplanted Germany's best hymns and
   made them bloom with fresh beauty in their new gardens was
   [428]Catherine Winkworth. Her two renderings of this hymn are well
   adapted to awaken responsive feelings in Christian readers. It would be
   difficult to judge between the two versions as to which the more
   successfully retains the force of the German. In both versions she has
   omitted stanza VI beginning "Ich will hie bei dir stehen." The
   [429]earlier one (1855) does not preserve the metre of the original,
   while the [430]later one (1863) was written for her Chorale Book with
   the accompanying melody. In general it may be said that the earlier
   version with the expanded third and seventh lines follows more closely
   the fervent thought of Gerhardt, an effect made possible in the longer
   stanza, as the English can rarely be expressed as concisely as the
   German. A comparison of the first quatrains of the two versions of the
   final stanza illustrates this:

   [431]1855.                      [432]1863.
                                   (Version for church singing.)
   Come to me ere I die,
   My comfort and my shield;
   Then gazing on Thy cross can I
   Calmly my spirit yield.         Appear then, my Defender,
                                   My Comfort, ere I die
                                   This life I can surrender
                                   If I but see Thee nigh.

   Of the twenty or more forms in which this hymn is familiar to English
   and American readers that of [433]Dr. Alexander has found most general
   acceptance for church use. The reason is not far to seek. The music to
   which the hymn is usually sung is the original melody for the hymn
   "Herzlich tut mich verlangen" [165] and was, as has been stated,
   written for a secular song, though thoroughly suitable for the
   expression of the awfulness of Christ's passion. Alexander's version is
   without question the one which best suits the cadence of this melody.
   In the version, for example, of [434]Jackson, the stress would fall
   upon "tortured" [166] in line 2 and, as the music repeats for the third
   and fourth lines, also on "a" in line 4. This, then, would not be
   selected as a satisfactory version for church singing. Aside from this
   feature, however, the flow of Gerhardt's language is more successfully
   imitated and the deep fervor of the German more effectively brought
   forth in Alexander's hymn than in any of the other translations unless
   we except the earlier one of [435]Miss Winkworth.

   While Gerhardt's hymn is more searching and profound than its Latin
   prototype, and an English translator would not ordinarily refer to the
   original of Bernard, still there seem to be in the phraseology of the
   [436]Jackson and [437]Winkworth translations evidences that these
   authors were at least familiar with it. Such lines as "Death triumphs
   in his pallour" [167] and "The pallor of the dead" [168] are quite
   suggestive of the Latin: "Totus versus in pallorem"; [169] and
   "Redeemer spurn me not" [170] of the Latin "Non me reum asperneris."
   [171]

   A short paraphrase by Sir H. W. Baker contains several ideas taken from
   the Latin which Gerhardt has omitted. Stanza 1 lines 7, 8:

   Yet angel hosts adore thee
   And tremble as they gaze

   are evidently suggested by:

   Totus versus in pallorem
   Quem coeli tremit curia. (lines 9, 10)

   and

   O Love to sinners free!
   Jesu all grace supplying,
   Oh turn thy face to me. (stanza 2)

   follows the idea in

   Peccatori tam indigno
   Cum amoris intersigno
   Appare clara facie. (lines 18-20)

   The same is true in the first quatrain of Baker's stanza 3, with the
   idea of the word "indigno" above brought into these later lines:

   In this thy bitter passion,
   Good Shepherd, think of me,
   With thy most sweet compassion,
   Unworthy though I be. [172]

   In 1860 Bishop Ryle selected and arranged Three hundred and sixty-six
   Hymns and Spiritual Songs--a song for every day in the year. His 166th
   poem is a cento of this Passiontide hymn and is assuredly deserving of
   mention, although he omits the first four stanzas entirely, and for no
   apparent reason changes the order of the others, arranging them as
   follows:

   Ryle:     1    2  3   4 5  6
   Gerhardt: VIII VI VII V IX X.

   His first quatrain of Gerhardt's stanza VII is almost identical with
   that given in Reid's Praise Book as an alteration of the old
   [438]Gambold version.

   What heavenly consolation
   Doth in my heart take place,
   When I Thy toil and passion
   Can in some measure trace.

   1.            O Sacred Head, now wounded,
                 With grief and shame bow'd down,
                 Now scornfully surrounded,
                 With thorns, Thy only crown.
                 O Sacred Head, what glory
                 What bliss till now was Thine
                 Yet, though despised and gory,

                 Mine, mine was the transgression
                 But Thine the deadly pain.
                 Lo, here I fall, my Savior:

   3.
   (Gerh. VII.)  The joy can ne'er be spoken,

                 When in Thy body broken
                 I thus with safety hide.
                 Lord of my life desiring
                 Thy glory now to see,
                 Beside Thy cross expiring

   1. Ah wounded Head that bearest
      Such bitter shame and scorn,
      That now so meekly wearest
      The mocking crown of thorn!
      Erst reigning in the highest
      In light and majesty,

                 When Thou for me didst bleed.
                 Grant to lean unshaken
                 Upon Thy faithfulness,
                 Until I hence am taken
                 To see Thee face to face.

   Cento from [445]J. Gambold's version, in Reid's Praise Book, 1866.

      With brightest majesty,
      In death once bow'd and wounded,
      Accursed on a tree!
   2. Thou countenance transcendent,
      Thou life-creating Sun
      To worlds on Thee dependent,
      Yet bruised and spit upon! . . . etc.

   1. Oh! bleeding head and wounded,
      And full of pain and scorn,
      In mockery surrounded
      With cruel crown of thorn!
      O Head! before adornèd
      With grace and majesty,
      Insulted now and scornèd,
      All hail I bid to Thee!

   Poetry.

   1. O Head, blood stained and wounded,
      Tortured by pain and scorn!
      O Head in jest surrounded
      By a rude crown of thorn!
      O Head, once rich adorned
      With highest laud and lays,
      But now so deeply scorned,
      To thee I lift my praise!

   Sir H. W. Baker in Schaff-Gilman Lib. of Religious Poetry.

   1. O Sacred Head, surrounded
      By crown of piercing thorn!
      O bleeding Head so wounded,
      Reviled and put to scorn!
      Death's pallid hue comes o'er Thee,
      The glow of life decays,
      Yet angel-hosts adore thee
      And tremble as they gaze.

   Miss Margarete Münsterberg, in her Harvest of German Verse, 1916.

   1. Oh, wounded head and bleeding,
      By pain and scorn bowed down!
      Oh head, the gibes unheeding,
      Bound with a thorny crown!
      Oh head, once decorated
      With honors gloriously,
      Now tortured so and hated,
      I greet and worship Thee!

Commentary

   The third [174] hymn of Gerhardt which [454]Jacobi included in his
   Psalmodia Germanica [175] is "Wach auf, mein Herz, und singe." As this
   song of trust is one of Gerhardt's oldest pieces and may be said to set
   the key for all the later hymns, it is appropriate that [455]Jacobi
   should find for it a place in his very limited selection.

   The eighteenth century English versions of German hymns invariably
   abound in extravagant figures. just why in this instance the translator
   has chosen to add to the text, where no mention is made of a "lion,"
   the idea of such an animal in the verse:

   Nay, when that Lyon's Fury,

   is difficult to explain. Possibly to his own mind that creature was
   more terrifying than Satan himself. Still less pardonable is the
   distortion in stanza IV:

   Du sprachst: Mein Kind, nun liege
   Trotz dem, der dich betriege!
   Schlaf wol, lasz dir nicht grauen,
   Du sollt die Sonne schauen.         Thou saidst: my Child, be easy,
                                       My presence shall release Thee
                                       From frightful Pain and Evil,
                                       In spite of Hell and Devil.

   Such alterations of the original, always with the idea of bringing a
   more terrible picture to the mind of the reader, can be justified on no
   ground whatever, and accounted for only by saying that the translator
   probably regarded this as one of the methods of

   "resolving all the jarring Discords of Self-love into the heavenly
   Concords of Mutual Love and Affection. If this be not effected here
   below, we shall never be worthy to hear the glorious Anthems of the
   Seraphic Quire above." [176]

   The singularly inapt paraphrase of the couplet in stanza 3

   Thy gracious Condescension,
   Has crossed his sore Intention

   appears to slightly better advantage in stanza 7:

   In gracious Condescension
   Despise not my Intention;
   Nor Body, Soul, nor Spirit
   Can boast of any Merit.

   Another characteristic of the English versions of this period is the
   emphasizing of the tortures of Hell and the Devil. just as in stanza 4
   above, we are not surprised to read in stanza 8:

   From Satan's woeful doings,

   although there is in the German no suggestion whatever of Satan or his
   deeds. Similarly, the concluding stanza, after the pleasing opening
   lines, causes something of a shock by its abrupt descent to the
   grotesque:

   Thy Bliss be my Salvation,
   My Heart thy Habitation;
   Thy Word my Food and Relish,
   Till thou destroy'st what's Hellish.

   Except for the imperfect rhymes in most of his stanzas [456]Kelly's
   version is unusually good both as a scrupulously faithful rendering and
   a successful attempt to keep the simple language and reproduce the
   characteristic touches of Gerhardt. The line:

   The sunlight shall delight thee,

   takes on a new significance when compared with

   Du sollt die Sonne schauen,

   and strophe 8 is particularly well done in that it has so large a
   predominance of Anglo-Saxon words:

   So wollst du nun vollenden
   Dein Werk an mir und senden
   Der mich an diesern Tage
   Auf seinen Händen trage.     Thou wilt, O Lord! be ending
                                Thy work in me and sending
                                Who in his hands will take me,
                                Today his care will make me.

    Nun ruhen alle Wälder.--(Goed. 60.)

   [Evening.]

   First published in Crü. Praxis, 1648, no. 15, in 9 stanzas of 6 lines;
   thence in Wackernagel: no. 102; Bachmann: no. 2; Unv. L. S.: 1851, no.
   529. Cf. Koch, IV, 607; VIII, 194.

   This is one of the finest and one of the earliest of Gerhardt's hymns.
   In the time of Flat Rationalism in Germany the first stanza became the
   object of much derision. [177] But the shallow wit showed how little
   poetry was then understood, for Gerhardt followed in thus beginning his
   hymn a much admired passage of Virgil, Aeneid IV, 522-528:

   Nox erat, et placidum carpebant fessa soporem
   Corpora per terras, silvaeque et saeva quierant
   Aequora, cum medio volvuntur sidera lapsu,
   Cum tacet omnis ager, pecudes pictaeque volucres,
   Quaeque lacus late liquidos, quaeque aspera dumis
   Rura tenent, somno positae sub nocte silenti
   (Lenibant curas, et corda oblita laborum).

   Among the common people the hymn became an exceeding favorite and was
   generally used as an evening prayer. Its childlike simplicity combined
   with its deep poetical charm has won the hearts of old and young to the
   present day. Frequently it has been sung on starry nights by men,
   women, or children in the fields on their homeward way, and many have
   laid themselves down for the long sleep of death with this hymn on
   their lips.

   A troop of French soldiers entered Lisberg, a small town of Hesse, on
   the 14th of September, 1796, plundered and killed the inhabitants, and
   burned the whole town. A little way distant, at the foot of a mountain,
   was a small cottage in which a mother sat by the bedside of her sick
   child. Hearing the noise in the town and seeing the burning houses she
   locked the door and knelt by the bedside and prayed. As the door burst
   open and a furious soldier rushed in, she spread her hands over the
   child and cried:

   Breit aus die Flügel beide,
   O Jesu, meine Freude, . . . (stanza VIII),

   and lo! the wild soldier suddenly dropped his arm, stepped to the bed,
   and laid his rough hand gently on the child's head. Then going outside
   he stood guard that none of his troop might harm the cottage.

   Although in limited use in the English hymn books, the translations are
   numerous, as follows:

Commentary

   Quaint and homely as it is, this hymn has done much to enkindle
   devotion and strengthen grace among Christian readers in Germany, and
   is now familiar to English-speaking peoples through the beautiful
   translations of [472]Miss Winkworth and [473]Mrs. Findlater. Both they
   and [474]Dr. Guthrie have successfully imitated the sweetly domestic
   tone in poems that have soothed many a careworn spirit at the close of
   day.

   In the [475]version which appeared in her Lyra Germanica [476]Miss
   Winkworth evidently overlooked the fact that line 3 of her first stanza
   had an extra foot:

   O'er field and city, man, and beast.

   In the [477]version for church singing printed in her Chorale Book the
   line is changed to the normal six-syllable iambic measure to admit of
   its being set to the old German melody, [178] "O Welt, ich musz dich
   laszen."

   Gerhardt's stanza VIII, "Breit aus die Flügel beide," [179] has been a
   special favorite in Germany, and Lauxmann in Koch VIII, 194, says of
   it:

   "How many a Christian soul, children mostly, but also God's children in
   general, does this verse serve as their last evening prayer. It has
   often been the last prayer uttered on earth, and in many districts of
   Germany is used at the close of the baptismal service to commend the
   dear little ones to the protection of their Lord Jesus."

   [478]Miss Winkworth has successfully caught the truly childlike popular
   spirit of the stanza in the lines:

   My Jesus, stay Thou by me,
   And let no foe come nigh me,
   Safe shelter'd by Thy wing;
   But would the foe alarm me,
   O let him never harm me,
   But still Thine angels round me sing.

   Interesting and amusing by its grotesqueness is the Moravian version of
   this stanza, [180] printed as a separate hymn in the edition of 1754:

   Matt. XXIII, 37.
   Breit aus die flugel [(sic)] beide.
   Display thy both Wings over
   Thy Chickens and them cover,
        O Jesu, Savior mild!
   If devils would disturb 'em,
   Let holy angels curb 'em
   And bid them never touch thy Child.

   In the rich language in which such hymns were conceived and expressed
   they possess a force that is not easily retained in a translation
   especially where as in the present instance there is such an abundance
   of double rhymes. [479]Dr. J. Guthrie's version has in England gained
   some popularity through the melodious rhythm he has given his lines by
   not restricting himself to Gerhardt's metre, [181] and certainly the
   iambic line is more suited to an English treatment of the theme of rest
   and repose. Note this effect in [480]Guthrie's lines:

   The woods are hushed o'er town and plain (1).
   Now hastes the body to repose (19).
   My laden eyes to slumber yield [182] (31).

   The sound sequence in stanza VIII to which the lines owe some of their
   popularity [481]Dr. Guthrie has obviously endeavored to imitate by the
   alliterative,

   My Savior, Shield and Sun!
   When Satan on my soul would spring,

   which would indeed do justice to Gerhardt. However a less unpleasant
   sound than the repeated sibilant which he has used, would suit the
   English ear better.

   As an attempt to translate with scrupulous faithfulness [482]Kelly's
   version is of some interest. The difficulties in the double rhymes he
   overcomes by the device of inflectional endings and repetition of
   pronouns which although at first moderately satisfactory must
   eventually become monotonous:

   declining hasteth     tirèd
   shining   divesteth   expirèd [183]
   sing ye   make me     send you
   bring ye  o'ertake me defend you.

   [483]Mrs. Findlater has in her version changed the metre of the
   original for all lines except the third and sixth; in the closing
   couplet or even the concluding line of each stanza she has more than
   any other translator reproduced the idea of peaceful repose which was
   so evidently Gerhardt's intention.

   Stanza 3, lines 5 and 6.   When I hear my Lord's command
                              To leave this earth and upward fly.
   Stanza 8, lines 5 and 6.   Give to my beloved sleep,
                              And angels send to guard their home.

   The omission of stanza VIII containing the figure of the hen gathering
   in her chicks is partially justifiable on the ground that the poem is
   complete without it, and that such similes while appropriately
   introduced into hymns of the seventeenth century are out of place in
   nineteenth century hymnody. On the other hand by this ruthless pruning
   the distinctive touch that Gerhardt gave the hymn is lost. It is
   interesting to note in the examination of the various English versions
   of Gerhardt's poetry the treatment which the "homely element" receives
   from the translator. The poem under consideration will form a good
   basis for discussion. Almost invariably the translator offers a
   paraphrase departing more or less widely from the original and
   effecting a colorless result: Gerhardt writes in stanza IV:

   Der Leib eilt nun zur Ruhe,
   Legt ab das Kleid und Schuhe.

   [484]Miss Winkworth renders:

   The body hastes to slumber
   These garments now but cumber.

   [485]Mrs. Findlater:

   Now the body seeks for rest
   From its vestments all undrest.

   [486]Kelly:

   To rest the body hasteth
   Itself of clothes divesteth.

   [487]Guthrie, however, whose version as a whole would doubtless be
   considered the best literary production, is not content with what is in
   the German but takes the opportunity offered by the extra syllables in
   his longer line to describe the vestment more explicitly:

   Now hastes the body to repose
   Throws off its garments, shoes and hose.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] In Mittenwalde, where Gerhardt had a pastoral charge from
   1651-1657 (cf. p. 3 ff.), there prevailed the custom of playing an
   evening hymn from the tower. The one used up to that time was the old
   and then well-known lay, "Innsbruck, ich musz dich laszen." Gerhardt
   liked the air, but longed to see it associated with a better and more
   really evening hymn. For this end he composed "Nun ruhen alle Wälder."
   The melody was originally composed in 1488(?) by Heinrich Isaac,
   conductor of the choir of Maximilian I. The great masters Bach and
   Mozart are reported to have said that they would gladly give their best
   works for this single tune. In our hymnals it is usually called
   "Innsbruck," but in German hymn books it is given as "O Welt, ich musz
   dich laszen," from the first line of the hymn of Johann Hesse, 1855,
   which was set to it.

   [179] Breit aus die Flügel beide O Jesu, meine Freude, Und nimm dein
   Küchlein ein! Will Satan mich verschlingen, So lasz die Englein singen:
   Dies Kind soll unverletzet sein.

   [180] Founded on St. Matthew XXIII, 37. "O Jerusalem . . . how often
   would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth
   her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"

   [181] Line 3 in his stanza is the same length as Gerhardt's.

   [182] Cf. the same effect in Adelaide Procter's hymn: The shadows of
   the evening hours Fall from the dark'ning sky Upon the fragrance of the
   flowers The dews of evening lie; etc.

   [183] This rhyme occurs in two successive stanzas.

   Stanza 1. Quietly rest the woods and dales,
             Silence round the hearth prevails,
             The world is all asleep;
             Thou, my soul, in thought arise,
             Seek thy Father in the skies,
             And holy vigils with Him keep.

   [489]Miss Winkworth, 1863, in her [490]Chorale Book.

   Stanza 1. Now all the woods are sleeping,
             And night and stillness creeping
             O'er (field and) city, man and beast;
             But thou, my heart, awake thee,
             To prayer awhile betake thee,
             And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.

   [491]J. Kelly, 1863, in his Paul Gerhardt's Spiritual Songs.

   Stanza 1. Now spread are evening's shadows,
             O'er forests, towns, and meadows,
             And sleepeth every eye;
             Awake my powers and sing ye,

             That your Creator please on high!

   [492]J. Guthrie, 1869, in his Sacred Lyrics.

   Stanza 1. The woods are hushed; o'er town and plain,
             O'er man and beast, soft slumbers reign:
             The world has gone to rest.
             But thou, my soul, my every sense,
             Wake up, thy Maker's praise commence,
             And be that praise thy best.

   In the Hymnal of Praise, 1913 (translator's name not given).

   Stanza 1. The duteous day now closeth,
             Each flow'r and tree reposeth,
             Shade creeps o'er wild and wood.
             Let us, as night is falling,
             On God, our Maker calling,
             Give thanks to Him, the Giver good.
   Stanza 2. Now all the heavenly splendor
             Breaks forth in starlight tender
             From myriad worlds unknown;
             And man, Thy marvel seeing,
             Forgets his selfish being
             For joy of beauty not his own.

Commentary

   The unusual figures in this Passion Hymn have prevented its receiving
   in English-speaking countries the wide popularity attained by "O Haupt
   voll Blut und Wunden." [184] Yet because of its dealing with a theme
   that appealed so strongly to Gerhardt and its being so characteristic
   of his piety and simplicity, a glimpse into the treatment accorded it
   by English translators should not be without interest. With hardly less
   depth of feeling than in "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" but with
   stranger imagery Gerhardt portrays the passion of Christ and reflects
   upon its significance, and the comfort the Christian derives from it.

   The Moravian Hymn Book contains [501]Gambold's translation in
   Gerhardt's metre of nine of the ten stanzas; the seventh, which abounds
   in metaphors, he has omitted. Mention has elsewhere [185] been made of
   Gerhardt's familiarity of tone in addressing the Savior. Gambold equals
   his master in this respect; witness stanza 5:

   Whilst I live here, I never shall
   Forget thy Grace amazing;
   Our love shall be reciprocal,
   I also Thee embracing.
   My heart's Light thou shalt be always,
   And when it breaks once (as one says)
   Thou'lt be my Heart thenceforward . . .

   The figure in the concluding stanza of the bride clothed in purple is
   rather spoiled by Gambold by the baldness of the couplet:

   Thy Blood shall of my Wedding-dress
   Be then the only splendor.

   Nor have we in the German anything to suggest the final lines:

   Then will the Mother, who bore me,
   And nursed me up, my Lamb, for thee,
   Present me as thy Purchase.

   [502]Russell's short version of two stanzas presents an effective
   paraphrase of the last three lines of Gerhardt's stanza IV:

   O süszes Lamm, was soll ich dir
   Erweisen dafür, dasz du mir
   Erweisest so viel Gutes?          O Lamb beloved! How shall I Thee
                                     Requite for all, thus unto me
                                     Such wondrous goodness showing?

   Under the title "The sin-bearing Lamb" [503]Dr. Guthrie gives in his
   Sacred Lyrics perhaps the most readable English translation, as it
   combines Gerhardt's beautiful piety and spiritual simplicity; it is
   also unique among translations from the German, in that it introduces
   more of the direct address than is usual, translators preferring as a
   rule to render quotations in the indirect form:

   "Give me," he says, "the wreath of thorn," etc.

   Stanza 7, which [504]Gambold omitted entirely, is the beginning of a
   hymn in Reid's Praise Book. It is a cento taken from [505]Mrs. Charles'
   very free translation (1858) and is cited here to illustrate the
   liberties often taken by translators. Here, of course, the free
   paraphrase is reasonably justifiable:

   STANZA 7.
   Gerhardt. [506]Mrs. Charles.
   Erweitre dich, mein Herzensschrein,
   Du sollt ein Schatzhaus werden
   Der Schätze, die viel gröszer sein
   Als Himmel, Meer und Erden.
   Weg mit dem Gold Arabia!
   Weg Calmus, Myrrhen, Casia!
   Ich hab ein Bessers funden.
   Mein groszer Schatz, Herr Jesu Christ
   Ist dieses, was geflossen ist
   Aus deines Leibes Wunden.     Gate of my heart, fly open wide--
   Shrine of my heart, spread forth;
   The treasure will in thee abide
   Greater than heaven and earth:
   Away with all this poor world's treasures,
   And all this vain world's tasteless pleasures,
   My treasure is in heaven;
   For I have found true riches now,
   My treasure, Christ, my Lord, art Thou,
   Thy blood so freely given!

      Selected Stanzas:

   In the Moravian Hymn Book, 1754 ed., part II (author's name not given).

   Stanza 1. A Lamb goes forth and on him bears
             The Guilt and misdemeanour
             Of all the World, and patient wears
             The Likeness of a Sinner.
   Stanza 2. Great King! in ev'ry age confest,
             Yet never more or greater,
             Than when thou with thy Wounds wast drest,
             Could I but praise thee better!

   [507]J. Gambold, in the 1754 edition of the Moravian Hymn Book.

   Stanza 1. A Lamb goes forth, and bears the guilt
             Of all the world together,
             Most patiently by his Blood spilt
             To pay for ev'ry Debtor;
             Sickness and toil he on him took,
             Went freely to the Slaughter-block
             All comfort he refused;
             He underwent reproach and blame,
             Death on the Cross, and Stripes and shame,
             And said, I gladly chuse it.

   [508]A. T. Russell, in his Psalms and Hymns, 1851.

   Stanza 1. A Lamb goes forth: the sins He bears
                   Of every generation:
             Himself with patience He prepares
             To die for every nation.
             All faint and weak, behold! He goes,
             His life resigning to His foes:
             No thought His grief can measure.
             He yields to scorn, reproach, disdain,
             Wounds, anguish, cross, and dying pain,
             And saith, "It is my pleasure."

   [509]Guthrie, 1869, in his Sacred Lyrics.

   Stanza 1. Forth goes a dear devoted Lamb
             And dies an expiation
             For sinners all, of every name,
             Of every age and nation.
             Forlorn and faint, behold He gains
             The scene of more than deadly pains,
             No earthly good possessing:
             "Give me," he says, "The wreath of thorn,
             The stripes, the curse, the Cross of scorn,
             That men may have the blessing."

    Warum sollt ich mich denn [186] grämen?--(Goed. 122.)

   [Cross and Consolation.]

   Founded on Psalm LXXIII, 23. Appeared in Crü.--Runge, 1653, no. 240, in
   12 stanzas of 8 lines; thence in Wackernagel: no. 64; Bachmann: no. 29;

   This is a very beautiful hymn but difficult of translation. It was a
   source of comfort to the Salzburg emigrants on their way through Swabia
   in 1732 (cf. Goethe's Hermann und Dorothea), and to Frederick William
   I. of Prussia on his deathbed, May 31, 1740. The eighth stanza was the
   last utterance of Gerhardt on the day of his death, May 27, 1676. It
   has since cheered and comforted many Christians, both in the season of
   trial and in the hour of death. It was joyfully sung by the pious
   pastor Hosch of Gächingen in Württemberg, when on the 2d of July, 1800,
   French soldiers had plundered his house, leaving him almost nothing but
   his harp, with which he accompanied the cheering strains of this hymn.
   The words of the seventh stanza:

   Unverzagt und ohne Grauen
   Solt ein Christ, Wo er ist,
   Stets sich laszen schauen. . . .

   were spoken by the pious lawyer in Stuttgart, John Jacob Moser, when,
   in consequence of his fearless remonstrances against injustice, he was
   called before his sovereign, the Duke of Württemberg, to be sentenced
   to imprisonment. The Queen of Poland and Electress of Saxony,
   Christiana Eberhardina, who died on the 5th of September, 1726, derived
   great consolation in her dying moments from the eighth stanza which was
   repeated to her by her chaplain.

Commentary

   This "Christliches Freudenlied" has an especial interest, for it seems
   to have been the hymn that was most comforting to Gerhardt. We know
   that in his last moments [189] he repeated stanza VIII:

   Kann uns doch kein Tod nicht tödten,
   Sondern reiszt Unsern Geist
   Aus viel tausend Nöten;
   Schleuszt das Thor der bittern Leiden
   Und macht Bahn, Da man kann
   Gehn zur Himmelsfreuden.

   It was fitting that one whose hymns are so replete with expressions of
   earthly and the far greater heavenly joys should go to his final rest
   comforted by the full realization of their meaning.

   The translator in the 1754 edition of the Moravian Hymn Book has with a
   few characteristic exceptions treated the peculiar rhythm and metre
   skillfully. Although the line

   Han't I still Christ my Hill,

   (line 2) would not be acceptable to-day, still our attention is
   forcibly drawn to the rhythm and note of genuine fervor in the
   reproduction of our poet's last words:

   Conquered Death cannot destroy us,
   But cuts short grief and Smart
   That doth here annoy us;
   Shuts the door on sin and sadness
   And makes way for the Day
   Of eternal gladness.

   [514]John Kelly in his Paul Gerhardt's Spiritual Songs although he does
   not retain much of the lyric grace of the original translates the poem
   with scrupulous faithfulness. His stanza 8 suffers greatly by
   comparison with that of the Moravian version-given above.

   Death can never kill us even,
           But relief
           From all grief
       To us then is given.
   It does close life's mournful story
           Make a way
           That we may
       Pass to heavenly glory.

Commentary

   Few of the English versions of German hymns which appear in the old
   Moravian hymn books rise above a mediocre grade; many on account of
   their crudity deserve only passing mention, others are interesting
   merely by way of comparison with later renderings. The editions up to
   that of 1886 published no authors' names and it is now largely a matter
   of conjecture as to who may have written these earlier versions. Rarely
   did the translators succeed in giving even a fair impression of the
   original, and we suspect that irnperfect knowledge of the exact meaning
   of the German or even indifference to the effect their versions
   produced may too often have been the cause of the crude and even
   grotesque language.

   The translator of this Christmas hymn has, however, been a notable
   exception; choosing from Gerhardt's discursive strophes the most
   significant ideas, he has developed a poem of seven stanzas superior to
   most contemporary hymns from the German. The correspondence of strophes
   is as follows:

   Gerhardt:     I II VII VI VII VIII VI IX XI XX
   Mor. Hy. Bk.: 1 2  3      4        5     6  7

   Especially happy are the epithets in lines 3 and 4:

   Du Himmelsblum und Morgenstern,
   Du Jungfrausohn Herr aller Herrn.     Thou Morning-star, thou Eden's
                                         Flow'r
                                         The Lord of Lords, whom Mary bore!

   The modern reader will enjoy the orthography in the lines:

           Dost thou a stranger chuse to be (stanza 3),
   and     Thou cloathest all (stanza 3).

   though he will recoil at the pronunciation of the first two lines of
   stanza 5:

   Thou in a manger ly'st with beasts,
   There thou a little Infant rest'st.

   Stanza 6, a free paraphrase of stanza XI in the original, reproduces
   admirably the childlike confidence with which Gerhardt writes. The
   translator appreciates keenly the personal tone which pervades the poem
   when he sings:

   I thank thee, loving Lamb! that thou
   On my account didst stoop so low;
   And as thy Spirit gives me grace,
   I'll be thy Servant, if thou please.

   In her [526]Chorale Book and set to the old tune "[527]Erschienen ist
   der herrlich Tag," [190] [528]Miss Winkworth gives the following
   arrangement of her ten-stanza version:

   Gerhardt:  I II III V VI IX VII XVIII XIX XX
   Winkworth: 1 2  3   4 5  6  7   8     9   10

   Stanza 9 shows how successfully she can imitate Gerhardt's simplicity
   and fervor; even the alliteration finds a partial correspondence in her
   third line:

   Gerhardt (stanza XIX). Winkworth (stanza 9).
   Du bist mein Haupt; hinwiederum
   Bin ich dein Glied und Eigentum
   Und will, so viel dein Geist mir gibt,
   Stets dienen dir, wie dirs geliebt.     Thou art my Head, my Lord
   Divine,
   I am Thy member, wholly Thine,
   And in Thy Spirit's strength would still
   Serve Thee according to Thy will.

   So also in stanza 10 (Gerhardt XX) for Gerhardt's favorite expression
   "für und für" we find a very happy equivalent, and also an exact rhyme
   which the German lacks:

  Gerhardt (stanza XX).                  Winkworth (stanza 10).
  Ich will dein Alleluja hier
  Mit Freuden singen für und für,
  Und dort in deinem Ehrensaal
  Solls schallen ohne Zeit und Zahl.     Thus will I sing Thy praises
                                         here
                                         With joyful spirit year by year;
                                         And they shall sound before thy throne,
                                         Where time nor number more are known.

   [529]Miss Cox, whose translation of Gellert's Easter hymn

   Jesus lives, thy terror now
   Can no longer, Death, appal us,

   is so well known, has given us one of the best modern versions of this
   Christmas hymn of Gerhardt's. Her stanzas correspond as follows:

   Gerhardt: I II III V VI VII XVIII XIX XX
   [530]Cox: 1 2  3   4 5  6   7     8   9

   [531]Miss Cox makes a less personal appeal to the worshipper and
   thereby loses much that is so excellent and characteristic of Gerhardt;
   instead of keeping the pronoun in the singular, "So fasz ich" (stanza
   XVIII) "Du bist mein Haupt" (stanza XIX) and "Ich will dein Alleluja"
   (stanza XX), she has respectively "Our love grows bold," "Thou art our
   Head," and "Our hallelujahs." If her poem is rather more polished,
   Gerhardt's is certainly the more direct, as witness these stanzas:

   Gerhardt (stanza VII). [532]Cox (stanza 6).
   Du kehrst in fremder Hausung ein,
   Und sind doch alle Himmel dein;
   Trinkst Milch aus deiner Mutter Brust
   Und bist doch selbst der Engel Lust.     Thou who both heaven and earth
   dost sway,
   In strangers' inn are fain to stay;
   And though thy power makes angels blest,
   Dost seek thy food from human breast.

   The concluding stanza is inferior to the others and suffers by
   comparison with the excellent lines of [533]Miss Winkworth cited above:
   it is a very free paraphrase and leaves the impression of having been
   hastily constructed:

   As each short year goes quickly round,
   Our hallelujahs shall resound;
   And when we reckon years no more,
   May we in heaven thy name adore!

    Befiehl du deine Wege.--(Goed. 185.)

   [Trust in God.]

   Appeared in Crü. Praxis, 1656, no. 333; Wackernagel: no. 66; Bachmann:
   no. 72 in 12 stanzas of 8 lines; Unv. L. S.: 1851, no. 620.

   Lauxmann, in Koch VIII, 392, calls this hymn "the most comforting of
   all the hymns that have resounded on Paulus Gerhardt's golden lyre,
   sweeter to many souls than honey and the honey-comb." It is an acrostic
   on Luther's version of Psalm XXXVII, 5, "Befiehl dem Herren deine Wege
   und hoffe auf ihn, er wirds wohl machen," formed by the initial words
   of the stanzas, those of the Wackernagel edition being printed in
   blacker type. This acrostic form has been preserved by [537]Jacobi and
   [538]Stallybrass.

   According to tradition Gerhardt wrote the hymn in a Saxon village to
   console his wife after they had been compelled to leave Berlin. But the
   hymn was printed as early as 1653, and although Gerhardt had to give up
   his position in 1666, [191] he did not leave Berlin until his
   appointment to Lübben in 1669, while his wife died in Berlin in 1668.
   Hence there appear to be two good reasons for discrediting this story.
   We must assume, therefore, that the hymn was written during the
   Mittenwalde period when as yet he could have had no thought of a
   position in Berlin. The perfection of the hymn is strikingly evinced by
   the fact that it soon spread through Germany, finding its way into all
   hymn books and ranking as one of the finest hymns of its class.
   Lauxmann relates that it was sung when the foundation stone of the
   first Lutheran church at Philadelphia was laid, May 2, 1743, and again
   on October 20, when Muhlenberg, the father of the American Lutheran
   Church, held the opening service.

      English Versions:

        1. Commit thou all thy griefs.

   A very free but spirited rendering omitting stanzas V, IX-XI, by
   [539]J. Wesley in his [540]Hymns and Sacred Poems, 1739 (P. Works,
   1869-72, Vol. I, p. 125), in 8 stanzas of 8 lines. Wesley has here
   caught, far more successfully than any other, the real ring and spirit
   of Gerhardt. His translation has been included in many hymn books and
   collections, and has come into very extended use, but generally
   abridged. In the United Presb. H. Bk., 1852, it began "To God commit
   thy griefs." It is also found under these headings:

          (a) Thou on the Lord rely (stanza III).
          (b) Thy everlasting truth (stanza V).
          (c) Give to the winds thy fears (stanza IX). (This is the
          heading under which it appears in most American hymnals. Cf. p.
          202.)
          (d) O cast away thy fears (stanza IX altered).
          (e) Through waves and clouds and storms (stanza X).
          (f) Leave to his sovereign sway (stanza XIII).
          (g) Thou seest our weakness, Lord (stanza XV).
          (h) Put thou thy trust in God.

   This last is a greatly altered cento with the stanza arrangement as
   follows:

   [541]Wesley: III I III V
   Cento:       1   2 3   4

   In this form also it has appered in many hymnals.

        2. Commit thy way, confiding.

   A complete translation by [542]Dr. H. Mills in the Evang. Review,
   Gettysburg, July, 1849, and his Horae Ger., 1856, p. 172. His stanzas
   I, II, VI, XII, were included in the Lutheran General Synod's Hymns,
   1852, and I, II, V, VI, XI, XII, in the Ohio Luth. Hymnal, 1880.

        3. Thy way and all thy sorrows,
              Give thou into His hand.

   A complete translation by [543]Rev. A. T. Russell as no. 233 in his
   Psalms and Hymns, 1851, in 3 parts. Part II begins "In vain the powers
   of darkness / Thy will, O God, oppose": (Gerhardt's stanza V). Part III
   (Gerhardt's stanza IX) begins "Awhile his consolation / He will to thee
   deny."

        4. Commit thy way to God.

   A translation omitting stanzas IX, X, XII, by [544]Mrs. Charles in her
   Voice of Christian Life in Song, 1858, p. 239. A cento of her version
   (Gerhardt's stanzas I, II, VI, VIII, XI) appears as no. 138 in
   Jellicoe's Collection, 1867, and another cento (Gerhardt's I, VI-VIII,
   XI) appears as no. 283 in Bishop Ryle's Collection, 1860.

        5. Commit thy way, O weeper.

   A free paraphrase in 6 stanzas of 4 lines by [545]J. S. Stallybrass for
   the Tonic-Solfa Reporter, July, 1857, repeated in Curwen's Child's Own
   H. Bk., 1862 and 1874.

        6. Commit thou every sorrow, And care.

   A translation of stanzas I-III, XII, by [546]Miss Borthwick in Dr.
   Pagenstecher's Collection, 1864, no. 240.

Commentary

   In the interesting and now very rare old Psalmodia Germanica [193]
   compiled and edited by [554]J. C. Jacobi there are three of Gerhardt's
   hymns--"Wie soll ich dich empfangen," "Wach auf, mein Herz, und singe,"
   and "Befiehl du deine Wege." The book is dedicated to

   "Their Royal Highnesses,
   Princess ANNE
   Pincess AMALIA,
   (sic!)
   AND
   Princess CAROLINA,"

   and in one paragraph of this dedication we read:

   "As a sincere Desire to promote Divine Psalmody has prompted me to this
   Translation; so I presume to address the same, such as it is to YOUR
   ROYAL HIGHNESSES, for no other End than to promote thereby the Singing
   the Praises of our blessed Redeemer"; etc.

   In most cases facing the beginning page of the hymns is an inserted
   leaf (not numbered) containing the traditional melody unharmonized. It
   is a reasonably safe conjecture that these books of [555]Jacobi were
   among the very first printed copies of anglicized German hymns, and the
   historical value and interest of the books themselves as well as the
   versions they contain cannot be overestimated.

   The version of "Befiehl du deine Wege" is so free a paraphrase,
   combining, as it does, in the five stanzas ideas from the twelve of the
   original, and introducing new elements altogether, that except for the
   first and fifth strophes it is difficult to connect the themes
   definitely with any particular lines in Gerhardt's poem. The
   correspondence seems, however, to be approximately as follows:

   [556]Jacobi: I     II      III     IV             V
   Gerhardt:    1     2 5     7       7 3 4 8 10     12

   Which line of Gerhardt suggests the injunction "Shake off that yoke of
   Hell" (2, 6) is not clear: possibly here [557]Jacobi had in mind the
   scriptural passage (Psalm XXXVII, 5, ff.) where in verse 8 we read
   "Cease from anger, and forsake wrath." Stanza 4:

   And he shall clear the Dullness
   That sits upon thy Mind

   perhaps finds its basis in stanza VII:

   . . . was das Herze
   Betrübt und traurig macht!

   or in stanza VIII:

   Wann Er . . .
   Das Werk hinausgeführet,
   Das dich bekümmert hat.

   To conclude his hymn, [558]Jacobi again, as in strophe 2, dwells upon
   the punishment for sin, entirely an interpolation of his own, with no
   bearing on the original whatever:

   Redeem us all together
   From Sin, World, Death, and Hell.

   Finally it must be said that for the modern reader this version must
   seem little more than a distorted paraphrase, made still further
   difficult of interpretation and appreciation through the use of words
   far more remote from our modern English than is the German vernacular
   of the seventeenth century from the modern German. Phrases such as:

   His Fatherly Dilection
   is never at a stand (3, lines 7 and 8)

   and

   Our Life and Conversation
   Lead by Thy Holy Hand (5, lines 5 and 6)

   seem not well calculated to carry out the hope that the translator
   utters on the last page of his "dedication":

   "If the Lover of Psalmody, can find in these Hymns an edifying Sunday's
   Entertainment, which, it seems, has hitherto been too much wanting in
   Abundance of Families, the Translator will think his Time well
   bestow'd,

   In another chapter [194] mention has been made of the relation of
   [559]John and [560]Charles Wesley to the Moravians. It is altogether
   probable that it was the singing of this hymn with its reference to
   winds and seas that first appealed to these Englishmen when on their
   voyage to America on the same vessel with a company of Moravians.
   [561]John Wesley's version (1739) is the second of the three earliest
   translations of this hymn which has come into such extensive use both
   in Germany and English-speaking lands. A number of changes have been
   made by the translator, but in general the main features are quite
   faithfully reflected. Firstly he has divided the 8-line strophes into
   quatrains, has disregarded the feminine rhymes of lines 1 and 3 and
   changed to iambic tetrameter the original iambic trimeter ending in a
   feminine rhyme. These variations enable him often to introduce an
   additional thought, e. g. in line 3 "To his sure truth and tender
   care," where in Gerhardt there is only the idea of "faithful care."
   Again he profits by being able better to express in English the more
   pithy German; for example, in stanza 14: "When fully he the work hath
   wrought" reproduces very acceptably the idea contained in the compound
   "hinausgeführt."

   Omitting stanza V Wesley gives a free but spirited version of the
   stanza beginning

   Hoff, O du arme Seele
   Hoff und sei unverzagt . . .

   as

   Give to the winds thy fears
   Hope and be undismayed
   God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears
   God shall lift up thy head. [195]

   Omitting also stanzas IX-XI inclusive, in which the original emphasizes
   or repeats in sameness of strain the thoughts of the earlier part of
   the poem, Wesley offers in his final strophe a strong conclusion,
   though he departs from the idea of Gerhardt's theme of distress for
   which termination is besought, and dwells upon the weakness to which
   man is prone. While Gerhardt asks to be guided to Heaven, to be
   entrusted ("empfohlen") to God's care, which one would expect for the
   appropriate conclusion of a poem beginning "Befiehl du deine Wege,"
   Wesley prays only that God's children may remember His care:

   Let us, in life, in death,
   Thy steadfast truth declare
   And publish, with our latest breath,
   Thy love and guardian care!

   The nearest date that can be set for the other early English
   translation of this most famous of Gerhardt's hymns is 1754 in the
   Moravian Hymn Book of that year where it appeared without the name of
   the author. It is very likely the work of the editor himself, [562]Dr.
   J. Gambold; for it has many of the characteristics of other hastily
   made translations in his collection of "German Hymns in the Seventeenth
   Century." Many of the hymns of the early and exuberant development of
   Moravian hymnody seem at first sight like a highly-colored and almost
   morbid growth that had been grafted from without upon the stem of
   English church song. If the immediate impression this version makes is
   that of foreignness owing to its phraseology, [196] it must be
   remembered that in reality these efforts are part of a new development
   of a real spiritual life, at first perverted into fantastic forms, but
   certainly capable of culture and ultimately becoming a characteristic
   and permanent type of English hymn. An unbiassed critic must concede
   that the whole atmosphere of this hymn in spite of its crudity is still
   that of childlike simplicity and tender devotion to Christ.

   The author has rendered all stanzas but the fifth ("Und ob gleich alle
   Teufel," etc.), omitting this possibly because Wesley before him (1739)
   had omitted it. The stanza is not far inferior to its prototype, stanza
   III [197] of Luther's "Ein' feste Burg," and would seem worthy of being
   included. The diction of the concluding lines shows evidently the
   influence of [563]Wesley, who, as has been seen, departs here widely
   from the idea of Gerhardt. Wesley has:

   Let us, in life, in death,
   Thy steadfast truth declare,
   And publish, with our latest breath,
   Thy love and guardian care!

   The Moravian version reads:

   Till, and beyond death's valley
   Let us thy Truth declare
   Yea then emphatically
   Boast of thy Guardian care.

   [564]Miss Cox preserves the eight-line form and the original metre in
   her complete translation of the twelve stanzas. Taken as a whole her
   appeal is far less direct than [565]Wesley's, her sentences and the
   ideas contained in them being much more involved. On the other hand, in
   the very first quatrain her word "Trust" gives the keynote of the whole
   poem at once, a touch that the original certainly contains and which no
   other translator has successfully reproduced in the first stanza.
   Strophe IX which is among those passed over by Wesley finds here a good
   English parallel in what appears to be a well-studied rendering:

   Gerhardt:       Er wird zwar eine Weile
                   Mit seinem Trost verziehen . . .
   [566]Cox:       Awhile, perchance to try thee,
                   He seems to hear thee not,
                   All comfort to deny thee,
                   As if thou wert forgot; . . .

   But undeniably the closest parallel, showing too that she was at home
   in both languages, is the concluding stanza. Where others fail her
   translation here excels in that it follows the idea which Gerhardt
   emphasizes throughout the poem, that of the heart trusting [198] in
   God:

   End if thou wilt our sorrow,
   And our probation close;
   Till then we fain would borrow
   Strength to support life's woes:
   To thee our way commending,
   Whose wisdom orders best,
   We tread the pathway tending
   To heaven's eternal rest.

   Much of the native beauty and lyric grace of this charming hymn is to
   be found in one of the less well known translations--that of [567]Dr.
   John Guthrie (1869). He very appropriately designates the hymn "The
   Triumph of Trust," and seems to have divined Gerhardt's meaning and use
   of "Trost" [199] as being that comfort which has its source in Trust
   and Faith. Note Guthrie's treatment of this theme in stanza 2:

   Trust him and soon with wonder
   His goodness shalt thou see
   . . . Tis faith and prayer and waiting
   That draw the blessing down.

   or again in stanza 8 where the true "Stimmung" is present:

   Trust Him to guard and guide thee,
   And bid thy troubles flee
   Trust Him, whate'er betide thee . . .

   Not as successful in the concluding quatrain as [568]Miss Cox, but
   nevertheless sensible of what Gerhardt intended to be the closing
   theme, as has been noted already, [569]Dr. Guthrie gives us this
   couplet:

   That on thy care depending,
   We heavenward still may go. . . .

   [570]Dr. John Kelly's version adheres more closely than any other to
   the metre and language, but it would be impossible by this means to
   popularize for the English reader Gerhardt's poetry. The translator's
   effects are altogether too labored, as is apparent in stanza 2 where
   the only virtue is the very doubtful one of the retention of the
   feminine rhyme:

   The Lord thou must repose on
   If thou wouldst prosper sure,
   His work must ever gaze on
   If thine is to endure.

   Throughout the poem occurs the same defect, a forcing of the rhyme:

   evil
   cavil       graciously
               early see       misery
                               may we

   In the last quatrain [571]Kelly fails, as do the other translators, to
   bring out Gerhardt's strong repetition of the dominating theme, ending
   with the very inferior couplet

   So come we where prepar'd for
   Us is our bless'd abode.

   Another translation that, like Kelly's is somewhat ultra-faithful to
   the original metres is that of [572]Dr. A. T. Russell (1851). He has
   divided the hymn into three separate poems:

   Part I, stanzas I, II, III, IV.
   Part II, stanzas V, VI, VII, VIII.
   Part III, stanzas IX, X, XI, XII.

   In the very passage where others have made their poorest offering
   [573]Russell has been unusually successful, namely in the last quatrain
   of stanza II ("Mit Sorgen und mit Grämen," etc.):

   God yieldeth nought to sorrow
   And self-tormenting care:
   Nought, nought with Him availeth;--
   No power save that of prayer.

   He has obtained literality in a marked degree in the fourth stanza as a
   close examination will show:

   Weg hast du allerwegen,
   An Mitteln fehlt dirs nicht;
   Dein Thun ist lauter Segen,
   Dein Gang ist lauter Licht,
   Dein Werk kann niemand hindern,
   Dein Arbeit darf nicht ruhn,
   Wann du, was deinen Kindern
   Ersprieszlich ist, willst thun.     Thy way is ever open;
                                       Thou dost on nought depend;
                                       Thine act is only blessing;
                                       Thy path light without end,
                                       Thy work can no man hinder,
                                       Thy purpose none can stay,
                                       Since Thou to bless Thy children
                                       Through all dost make a way.

   The success is plainly due to the fortunate choice of Anglo-Saxon
   equivalents and the coincidence of verse accent and important words.
   Contrast with this in [574]Miss Cox's otherwise good translation her
   only poor stanza, all but unintelligible to modern readers through the
   use of the obsolete word "let" (line 6) for "hindrance."

   Stanza 4. Resources rich possessing,
             That love still finds a way,
             Thy every act a blessing,
             Thy pathway cloudless day;
             In one unbroken tissue,
             Which no let e'er withstood,
             It brings to happy issue
             Plans for thy children's good.

   It is unfortunate that a version so excellent in other respects should
   include this wide departure from the fervor and whole-heartedness of
   Gerhardt.

   One final observation is interesting that in his last strophe
   [575]Russell offers a compromise between [576]Wesley's interpretation
   and that of [577]Miss Cox:

   Thy truth and Thy protection
   Forevermore we pray:
   With these in heavenly glory
   Shall end our certain way.

   This prayer for protection is closer to Gerhardt's lines and therefore
   better than [578]Wesley's bold paraphrase, but it falls far short of
   the simple and forceful conclusion of [579]Miss Cox:

   To Thee our way commending,
   Whose wisdom orders best,
   We tread the pathway tending
   To heaven's eternal rest.

      Selected Stanzas:

   [580]J. C. Jacobi in Psalmodia Germanica, 1722.

   I.
   Commit thy Ways and Goings,
   And all that grieves thy Soul,
   To him, whose wisest Doings
   Rule all without Controul:
   He makes the Times and Seasons
   Revolve from Year to Year
   And knows Ways, Means, and Reasons
   When Help shall best appear.

   (Note: In the wording accompanying the musical score the second line
   reads "And all what grieves thy Soul.")

   [581]J. Wesley, 1739, in the Schaff-Gilman Library of Religious Poetry.

   I.
   Commit thou all thy griefs
   And ways into his hands,
   To his sure truth and tender care,
   Who earth and heaven commands.
   II.
   Who points the clouds their course,
   Whom winds and seas obey,
   He shall direct thy wandering feet,
   He shall prepare thy way.

   The cento given in most American hymnals:

   Stanza 1. Give to the winds thy fears;
             Hope, and be undismayed;
             God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears;
             God shall lift up thy Head.
   Stanza 2. Through waves and clouds and storms,
             He gently clears thy way;
             Wait thou His time, so shall this night
             Soon end in joyous day.
   Stanza 3. What though thou rulest not,
             Yet heaven and earth and hell
             Proclaim, God sitteth on the throne,
             And ruleth all things well.
   Stanza 4. Far, far above thy thought
             His counsel shall appear,
             When fully He the work hath wrought
             That caused thy needless fear.

   In the Moravian Hymn Book, 1754 (by [582]Gambold, himself?).

   Stanza 1. Commit thou thy each grievance
             And Case into his Hands,
             To his sure Care and guidance,
             Who heav'n and earth commands:
             He who's the Clouds Director,
             Whom Winds and seas obey,
             He'll be thy feet's Protector,
             He shall prepare thy Way.

   (Note: the orthography of the Moravian Hymn Book has been retained.)

   [583]A. T. Russell, in his Psalms and Hymns, 1851.

   Stanza 1. Thy way and all thy sorrows,
             Give thou into His hand,--
             His gracious care unfailing,
             Who doth the heavens command.
             Their course and path He giveth
             To clouds and air and wind:
             A way thy feet may follow,
             He too for Thee will find.

   [584]H. Mills, 1856, in his Horae Germanicae.

   Stanza 1. Commit Thy way, confiding,
             When trials here arise,
             To Him whose hand is guiding
             The tumults of the skies:
             There, clouds and tempests raging,
             Have each its path assign'd,--
             Will God for thee engaging,
             No way of safety find?

   [585]Frances Elizabeth Cox, 1864, in the Schaff-Gilman Library of
   Religious Poetry.

   I.
   To God Thy way commending
   Trust him whose arm of might,
   The heavenly circles bending,
   Guides every star aright:
   The winds and clouds and lightning
   By his sure hand are led;
   And he will, dark shades brightening,
   Show thee what path to tread.

   [586]J. Kelly, 1867, in his Paul Gerhardt's Spiritual Songs.

   Stanza 1. Commit whatever grieves thee
             At heart, and all thy ways,
             To Him who never leaves thee,
             On whom creation stays.
             Who freest courses maketh
             For clouds, and air, and wind,
             And care who ever taketh
             A path for thee to find.

   [587]J. Guthrie, 1869, in his Sacred Lyrics.

   Stanza 1. Commit thy way, O weeping
             And care-encumbered soul,
             To His all-trusty keeping,
             Who guides the glowing pole.
             No cloud or wind fleets o'er thee
             But God directs its flow;
             That God will cleave before thee
             A path wherein to go.

   [588]Mrs. Charles, 1858, in Bishop's Ryle's Collection of Hymns and
   Spiritual Songs, 1883.

   Stanza 1. Commit thy way to God;
             The weight which makes thee faint--
             Words are to Him no load!
             To Him breathe thy complaint.
             He who for winds and clouds
             Maketh a pathway free,
             Through wastes or hostile crowds
             Can make a way for thee.

    Ist Gott für mich, so trete.--(Goed. 229.)

   [Trust in God.]

   Based on Romans, VIII, 31-39. Cf. Kock, IV, 457. Included in Crü.
   Praxis, 1656, no. 330; thence in Wackernagel: no. 63; Unv. L. S.: no.
   418. Lauxmann, in Koch, VIII, 408, quotes Langbecker: "This heroic hymn
   of Gerhardt's is worthy to be placed side by side with Luther's 'Ein'
   feste Burg.'"

   The poem was written undoubtedly at the time when the Elector,
   Frederick William of Brandenburg, Gerhardt's sovereign, threatened with
   his severe displeasure those of the Lutheran clergy who would not sign
   a declaration [200] binding them not to say anything publicly against
   the Reformed party. To this, most probably, the words of the thirteenth
   stanza refer,

   Kein Zorn der groszen Fürsten
   Soll mir ein Hindrung sein.

   This hymn, springing from a heart full of faith and courage, has gone
   into the hearts of many, especially the tried and afflicted, cheering
   and encouraging them in the struggles of faith. The third stanza in
   particular has often been made a blessing:

   Der Grund, da ich mich gründe,
   Ist Christus und sein Blut; . . .

   A pious watchman in Berlin who, when calling the hours of the night,
   used to sing suitable verses, once sang these lines before the house of
   a shoemaker, who with some friends, just then assembled late at night,
   was in danger of leaving the Church and setting up a self-righteous
   sect. The well-known words, coming so unexpectedly, had the desired
   effect, the shoemaker declaring to his friends, "As for me, I will rest
   upon that ground of Jesus and his blood, and not seek any other
   master." The final stanza:

   Mein Herze geht in Springen
   Und kann nicht traurig sein. . . .

   has been the dying song of many a believing Christian.

      English Versions:

Commentary

   The earliest accessible English version is that of [598]Jacobi, 1725,
   printed in the 1754 Moravian Hymn Book. The translations by this author
   are usually very crude and painfully laborious, but in the present
   case, with a few notable exceptions, he has very well caught the ring
   and spirit of Gerhardt. Later compilers and publishers of hymns would
   of course omit the lines:

   "His Grace has cleansed and polished
   My humble Soul within." (stanza 5.)

   and

   "All this I have digested." (stanza 12.)

   Like many of the early translators of German hymns [599]Jacobi is
   guilty of frequent imperfect rhymes:

   Merit
   spirit stanza 4       spectre
                         conjecture stanza 14       alone
                                                    begun stanza 15

   If we overlook these defects the version is one of the best that has
   appeared so far in English or American hymnals and considerably above
   the standard [201] of the Moravian hymns of the early eighteenth
   century. The following lines offer a very true counterpart of the
   German:

   "All woes give way and flee," line 4.
   "And that in Change and Chances
   He stands at my right hand." lines 13, 14.
   "The ground of my possession
   Is Jesus and his Blood." lines 17, 18.
   "Should Earth lose its foundation
   Thou stand'st my lasting Rock." lines 97, 98.

   Bishop Ryle in taking over this version into his Hymns and Spiritual
   Songs has made a number of alterations, presenting a cento of four
   stanzas. His stanza 3, for example, is a combination of [600]Jacobi's
   last quatrain of stanza 9 and first quatrain of stanza 10:

   Ryle (stanza 3).                [601]Jacobi (stanza 9).
   For me there is provided
   A city fair and new;
   To it I shall be guided,--
   Jerusalem the true!             And how he hath provided
                                   A city new and fair
                                   Where things, our Faith did credit
                                   Shall to our eyes appear.
                                   (stanza 10.)
   My portion there is lying,
   A destined Canaan lot;
   Though I am daily dying,
   My Canaan withers not.          My portion there is lying
                                   A destin'd Canaan-lot
                                   Tho' I am daily dying,
                                   My Heaven withers not.

   American congregations are familiar with the hymn:

   Since
   (If) Jesus is
              (be) my friend
   And I to him belong . . .

   It is often called "The Rest of Faith," and is a cento of [602]Miss
   Winkworth's very excellent [603]version. Although she has not preserved
   the metre of the poem Miss Winkworth has thoroughly caught its spirit
   even imitating in the widely known last stanza [202] the sound sequence
   and alliteration:

   My heart for gladness springs,
   It cannot more be sad,
   For very joy it laughs and sings,
   Sees nought but sunshine glad.
   The sun that glads mine eyes
   Is Christ the Lord I love,
   I sing for joy of that which lies
   Stored up for us above.

      Selected Stanzas:

   [605]J. C. Jacobi (1725) in the Moravian Hymn Book (ed. 1754).

   Stanza 1. Is God for me, what is it
             That Men can do to me?
             Oft as my God I visit,
             All woes give way and flee.
             [203] If God my Head and Master
             Defend me from above,
             What pain or what disaster
             Can drive me from his Love?

   [606]B. Beddome, 1776, in Bishop Ryle's Hymns and Spiritual Songs.

   Stanza 1. If God is mine, then present things
             And things to come are mine;
             Yes Christ, His Word, and Spirit too,
             And glory all divine.
   3.        If He is mine, I need not fear
             The rage of earth and hell;
             He will support my feeble power
             And every foe repel.

   [607]Miss Winkworth in her [608]Lyra Germanica, 1855, p. 130.

   Stanza 1. If God be on my side,
             Then let who will oppose
             For oft ere now to Him I cried
             And He hath quelled my foes.
             If Jesus be my Friend,
             If God doth love me well,
             What matters all my foes intend,
             Though strong they be and fell?
             Here I can firmly rest,
             I dare to boast of this,
             That God the Highest and the Best,
             My Friend and Father is.
             From dangerous snares He saves,
             Where'er He bids me go
             He checks the storms and calms the waves,
             Nor lets aught work me woe.
             I rest upon the ground
             Of Jesus and His blood,
             For 'tis through Him that I have found
             The True Eternal God.
             Nought have I of mine own,
             Nought in the life I lead,
             What Christ hath given me, that alone
             Is worth all love indeed.
             His spirit in me dwells,
             O'er all my mind He reigns,
             All care and sadness He dispels,
             And soothes away all pains.
             He prospers day by day
             His work within my heart,
             Till I have strength and faith to say,
             Thou God my Father art!
             When weakness on me lies,
             And tempts me to despair,
             He speaketh words and utters sighs
             Of more than mortal prayer;
             But what no tongue can tell,
             Thou God canst hear and see,
             Who readest in the heart full well
             If aught there pleaseth Thee. etc.

   [609]Mrs. Bevan, 1858, in Snepp's Songs of Grace and Glory, 1872
   (abridged version).

   Stanza 11. Is God for me? I fear not, though all against me rise;
              When I call on Christ my Savior, the host of evil flies;
              My Friend--the Lord Almighty, and He who loves me--God,
              What enemy shall harm me, though coming as a flood?
              I know it, I believe it, I say it fearlessly,
              That God, the Highest, Mightiest, forever loveth me!
              At all times, in all places, He standeth by my side;
              He rules the battle fury, the tempest and the tide.

   [610]J. Kelly, 1867, in his Paul Gerhardt's Spiritual Songs.

   A SONG OF CHRISTIAN CONSOLATION AND JOY.
   Stanza 1. Is God for me? t'oppose me
             A thousand may uprise;
             When I to pray'r arouse me,
             He'll chase mine enemies.
             And doth the Head befriend me,
             Am I belov'd by God?
             Let foes then rise to rend me,
             The wild opposing brood!

    Geh aus, mein Herz, und suche Freud--(Goed. 239.) [204]

   This beautiful poem of thanksgiving for the divine goodness in the gift
   of the delights of summer and of anticipation of the joys of Paradise
   appeared in the 1656 ed. of Crü. Praxis, no. 412, in 15 stanzas of 6
   lines. It was also printed in H. Müller's Geistliche Seelenmusik, 1659,
   and included in Wackernagel: no. 103; Bachmann: no. 85; Unv. L. S.:
   1851, no. 732. Cf. Koch, IV, 591; VIII, 141. Like Luther, who fondly
   loved nature and admired its beauties, Gerhardt showed himself in this
   inspiring poem a real lover of God's creation.

      English Versions:

        1. Go forth, my heart, and seek delight.

   A good translation omitting stanza XIV, by [611]Miss Winkworth, in the
   First Series of her [612]Lyra Ger., 1855, p. 136. Her translation of
   stanzas VIII-XI, beginning "Thy mighty working, mighty God," was
   included in the American Sabbath Hymn Book, 1858, and repeated in
   Boardman's Collection, Philadelphia, 1861.

        2. The golden corn now waxes strong.

   A good translation beginning with stanza VII, contributed by [613]R.
   Massie to the 1857 ed. of Mercer's C. P. and H. Bk., no. 463 (1864, no.
   500). In the Appendix to the Second Series of Lyra Domestica Mr. Massie
   reprinted his translation at page 102, and prefixed a version of
   stanzas I-VI, beginning "Go forth, my heart, nor linger here." In this
   form it appeared in full in Reid's Praise Book, 1872.

Commentary

   None of Gerhardt's poetry has so well lent itself to English words as
   this hymn of praise for God's goodness and of contemplation of the joys
   in the next world, and the translators have without exception
   reproduced most successfully the exquisite feeling for nature which
   Gerhardt manifests, whether he be singing of forest and brook, or of
   flowers and fields. Only [619]Miss Winkworth and [620]Dr. Alexander of
   the four or five prominent translators omit stanza XIV, and they do so
   apparently on the ground that it contains a complexity of figures.
   [621]Dr. Massie whose version except for the last stanza has more truly
   poetic lines than any other offers this paraphrase:

   Make for thy spirit ample room,
   That thus I may forever bloom.
   Like plants which root have taken:
   Oh let me in thy garden be
   A flourishing and righteous tree,
   Which never shall be shaken.

   So well have all the translators succeeded that it would be perhaps
   merely a matter of individual taste as to which of the many excellent
   lines are deserving of highest praise. Of stanza III [622]Dr. Massie's
   verses are both more literal and harmonious than the others. Gerhardt
   sings:

   Die Lerche schwingt sich in die Luft,
   Das Täublein fleugt aus seiner Kluft
   Und macht sich in die Wälder.

   [623]Dr. Massie interprets:

   The lark mounts singing to the skies:
   The dove forsakes her clefts, and flies
   To shady groves and alleys.

   [624]Miss Winkworth:

   The lark soars singing into space,
   The dove forsakes her hiding-place,
   And coos the woods among.

   [625]Dr. Kelly:

   The lark aspiring soars on high,
   Flies from her cleft the dove so shy,
   And seeks the woodland shadow.

   [626]Dr. Alexander:

   The lark floats high before the breeze,
   The dove toward the forest-trees
   From covert speeds along.

   This last version is marred by the accent's falling on the unstressed
   syllable of "toward" in line 2. Several of our American hymnals contain
   the cento of four stanzas from [627]Miss Winkworth's [628]version
   (Gerhardt stanzas VIII-XI incl.) whose ring gives the freshness
   appropriate in an outdoor hymn of Spring and Summer.

Selected Stanzas

   [629]C. Winkworth, 1855, in her [630]Lyra Germanica.

   Stanza 1. Go forth my heart and seek delight
             In all the gifts of God's great might,
             These pleasant summer hours:
             Look how the plains for thee and me
             Have deck'd themselves most fair to see
             All bright and sweet with flowers.
   8.        Thy mighty working, mighty God,
             Wakes all my pow'rs; I look abroad,
             And can no longer rest;
             I, too, must sing when all things sing,
             And from my heart the praises ring,
             The Highest loveth best.
   9.        If Thou in Thy great love to us,
             Wilt scatter joy and beauty thus
                   O'er this poor earth of ours;
             What nobler glories shall be given
             Hereafter in Thy shining heaven
             Set round with golden towers!
   10.       What thrilling joy, when on our sight
             Christ's garden beams in cloudless light
             And rings with God's high praise;
             Where all the thousand seraphim
             In one accordant voice and hymn
                   Their Alleluia raise!
   11.       O, were I there! oh, that I now
             Before Thy throne, my God, could bow,
             And bear my heavenly palm!
             Then, like the angels would I raise
             My voice, and sing thine endless praise
             In many a sweet-toned psalm.

   [631]J. W. Alexander, 1849, in the Schaff-Gilman Library of Religious
   Poetry.

   Stanza 1. Go forth, my heart, and seek for praise,
             On these delightsome summer days,
                   In what thy God bestows!
             How rich the garden's beauties be,
             How lavishly for me and thee
             It doth its charms disclose!

   [632]R. Massie, 1863, in the Schaff-Gilman Library of Religious Poetry.

   Stanza 1. Go forth, my heart, nor linger here
             In this sweet season of the year,
             When God his gifts dispenses;
             See how the gardens in their best
             For you and me are gayly drest,
             And ravish all the senses!

   [633]J. Kelly, 1867, in his Paul Gerhardt's Spiritual Songs.

   Stanza 1. Go forth, my heart, and seek delight
             In this summer time so bright,
             The bounties God displayeth,
             The garden's splendour go and see
             Behold how God for me and thee
             Them gorgeously arrayeth.

   Miss Margarete Münsterberg, in her Harvest of German Verse, 1916.

   Stanza 1. Go out, my heart, and seek delight,
             In this dear summer time so bright,
             In God's abundance daily;
             The beauty of these gardens see,
             And look, how they for me and thee
             Have decked themselves so gaily.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Many hymn writers since Gerhardt have drawn from the same scriptural
   sources as he, and it would be presumption to attempt to prove that all
   these had received any direct impulse from his verses; yet it must be
   realized that it is to a certain extent impossible that the conceptions
   of the hymn writers of one age should remain inseparable from the ideas
   of later poets. Bayard Taylor, in speaking about what he calls
   "intellectual genealogies in literature," says: "Most authors may be
   shown to be not imitators, but the spiritual descendants of others,
   inheriting more or less of their natures."Studies in German Literature,
   1879. In the pages which follow are cited some hymns containing phrases
   thoroughly suggestive of Gerhardt's lines which will contribute
   evidence in addition to that already adduced to show the prominent
   place his works hold as influencing English hymn writing.

A. T. Russell

   In his Psalms and Hymns, 1851, [652]Rev. A. T. Russell includes a group
   of hymns entitled "The Sufferings of Our Lord." One of them, no. 94, of
   three stanzas, bears such a striking resemblance to Gerhardt's "[653]O
   Welt, sich hier dein Leben" [209] that we should be inclined to trace
   its source to this hymn, though it is signed merely with the author's
   initials A. T. R. and is offered as original:

   [654]Russell (stanza 1).              Gerhardt (stanza 1).
     O World, behold Him dying           O Welt, sich hier dein Leben
     Who is thy life supplying;          Am Stamm des Kreuzes schweben!
     Behold! He dies for Thee:           Dein Heil sinkt in den Tod!
     He who in glory reigneth,           Der grosze Fürst der Ehren
     No scorn, no shame disdaineth,      Läszt willig sich beschweren
     From endless death my soul to free. Mit Schlägen, Hohn und groszen
                                         Spott.
   Stanza 2.
     Now from my Savior floweth          Tritt her und schau mit Fleisze:
     The blood His love bestoweth        Sein Leib ist ganz mit Schweisze
     On us that we may live!             Des Blutes überfüllt;
     What grief His spirit rendeth!      Aus seinem edlen Herzen
     Whilst thus He condescendeth        Vor unerschöpften Schmerzen
     His life for us His foes to give.   Ein Seufzer nach dem andern quillt.

   Although its second and third lines are taken directly from the Bible,
   yet stanza 3 as a whole appears to be influenced by the thoughts in
   Gerhardt's stanzas VIII and III. Line 5 might well be regarded as a
   condensation of the repeated ideas of confession and repentance in
   Gerhardt's strophes. (Cf. line 19 "ich und meine Sünden"; line 25 "ich
   sollte büszen").

   [655]Russell (stanza 3).            Gerhardt.
                                       (Lines 43-45.)
   Of His own will He dieth,           Du springst ins Todes Rachen,
   Who to His Father crieth,           Mich frei und los zu machen
   "O Father! mercy show:"             Von solchem Ungeheur
                                       (Lines 16 and 17.)
   Come, children of transgression     Du bist ja nicht ein Sünder
   To Jesus make confession;           Wie wir und unsre Kinder
                                       (Line 48.)
   Your all to His great love you owe. O unerhörtes Liebesfeur!

Maltbie D. Babcock

   A hymn by Dr. Maltbie D. Babcock which has been included in several
   American hymnals would indicate that while the author may have had
   before him only the scriptural passage from the Psalms [210] as he
   composed his verses, yet because of the marked similarity of
   phraseology Gerhardt's hymn "[656]Befiehl du deine Wege" must have been
   more or less familiar to him through the version of [657]Wesley or
   another translator.

   Rest in the Lord, my soul                       Befiehl du deine Wege
   Commit to him thy way                           Und was dein Herze kränkt
   What to thy sight seems dark as night
   To him is bright as day.
                                                   (Lines 9-12.)
   Rest in the Lord, my soul                       Dem Herren muszt du trauen,
   He planned for thee thy life                    Wenn dirs soll wolergehen;
   Brings fruit from rain brings good from pain    Auf sein Werk muszt du
                                                   schauen,
   And peace and joy from strife.                  Wenn dein Werk soll bestehn.
                                                   (Lines 41-48.)
   Rest in the Lord, my soul:                      Hoff, o du arme Seele,
   This fretting weakens Thee;                     Hoff und sei unverzagt
                                                   Gott wird dich aus der Höle,
   Why not be still? accept his will               Da dich der Kummer plagt,
                                                   Mit groszen Gnaden rücken:
                                                   Erwarte nur die Zeit,
   Thou shalt his glory see.                       So wirst du schon erblicken
                                                   Die Sonn der schönsten Freud.

James Montgomery

   [658]Wesley's adaptation [211] of the thought in "[659]Ist Gott für
   mich, so trete" is but one of many sacred poems that treat this theme
   of the Christian's Hope. A hymn [212] now familiar to many
   congregations written by [660]James Montgomery [213] in 1872 and
   avowedly based on Psalm XXVII [214] bears so strong a resemblance to
   this poem of Gerhardt's that two stanzas are here cited to show first
   the similarity of treatment of the general subject of Faith in the
   Power of God, and particularly the marked traces of Gerhardt's
   influence upon the English verses.

   Gerhardt ([661]Goed. 229). [215]
   1. God is my strong salvation: Ist Gott für mich, so trete 1
   What foe have I to fear? Gleich alles wider mich; 2
   In darkness and temptation Was kann mir tun der Feinde 7
   Und Widersacher Rott? 8
   My light, my help, is near. Mein Glanz und schönes Licht 26
   Though hosts encamp around me Ist Gott für mich, so trete 1
   Firm to the fight I stand, Gleich alles wider mich 2
   What terror can confound me
   With God at my right hand? Und bin geliebt bei Gott 6

   2. Place on the Lord reliance Nun weisz und gläub ich feste, 9
   My soul with courage wait . . . dasz ich finde 19
   His truth be thine affiance, Das ewge wahre Gut 20
   When faint and desolate. Wenn ich gleich fall und sterbe 75
   His might thine heart shall strengthen Sein Geist spricht meinem Geiste
   His love thy joy increase Manch süszes Trostwort zu:
   Mercy thy days shall lengthen
   The Lord will give thee peace.
   [662]James Montgomery, in his Songs of Zion, 1822.

Sarah Flower Adams

   With less direct influence than appears in the hymns hitherto
   mentioned, yet showing much of the spirit of "[663]Auf den Nebel folgt
   die Sonne" [216] is Sarah Flower Adams' hymn, "He sendeth sun, he
   sendeth shower." The final line of each stanza introducing the theme of
   Resignation to God's Will may well have been suggested by the refrain
   "Was Gott gefällt." [217]

   He sendeth sun, he sendeth shower, Auf den Nebel folgt die Sonne 1
   Alike they're needful for the flower; Auf das Trauren Freud und Wonne 2
   And joys and tears alike are sent Trost und Labsal, . . Meine Seele . .
   . steigt 4, 5
   To give the soul fit nourishment: Hat mir meinen Geist erquickt, 9
   As comes to me or cloud or sun,
   Father, thy will, not mine, be done!

   Can loving children e'er reprove Gott Läszt keinen traurig stehn 50
   With murmurs whom they trust and love? Der sich Ihm zu eigen schenkt 52
   Creator, I would ever be Und Ihn in sein Herze senkt; 53
   A trusting, loving child to thee: Wer auf Gott seine Hoffnung setzt 54
   As comes to me or cloud or sun,
   Father, thy will, not mine, be done!

   Oh, ne'er will I at life repine; Nu, so lang ich in der Welt 85
   Enough that thou hast made it mine; Haben werde Haus und Zelt 86
   . . . Ich will all mein Leben lang 89
   When falls the shadow cold of death, . . . Hiefür bringen Lob und Dank.
   91
   I yet will sing with parting breath Ich will gehn in Angst und Not 99
   Ich will gehn bis in den Tod 100
   As comes to me or shade or sun, Ich will gehn ins Grab hinein 101
   Father, thy will, not mine, be done. Und doch alIzeit frölich sein 102
   Sarah Flower Adams, 1841, in the Schaff-Gilman Lib. of Rel. Poetry.

Various authors and 'Ich bin ein Gast auf Erden'

   A very familiar hymn in English-speaking countries is Thomas Rawson
   Taylor's "I'm but a stranger here" written in 1834. It was published in
   1836 in his Memoirs and Select Remains, and headed "Heaven is my home.
   Air--'Robin Adair.'" In America it is usually sung to Arthur S.
   Sullivan's "Saint's Rest." The hymn so closely resembles Gerhardt's
   lines in "[664]Ich bin ein Gast auf Erden" [218] that the parallels are
   given below:

   1. I'm but a stranger here;         Ich bin ein Gast auf Erden     1
      Earth is a desert drear,
        Heaven is my home.             Was ist mein ganzes Wesen      9
      Danger and sorrow stand          Als Müh und Not gewesen        11
      Round me on every hand,
      Heaven is my fatherland,         Da ist mein Vaterland          4
        Heaven is my home.

   2. What though the tempests rage,   Mich hat auf meinen Wegen      17
      Short is my pilgrimage,          Manch harter Sturm erschreckt; 18
        Heaven is my home.             Blitz, Donner, Wind und Regen  19
      And time's wild wintry blast     Hat mir manch Angst erweckt;   20
      Soon will be overpast,           So will ich swar nun treiben   57
      I shall reach home at last       Mein Leben durch die Welt      58
                                       Doch denk ich nicht zu bleiben 59
        Heaven is my home.             In diesem fremden Zelt.        60

   3. There at my Savior's side,       Mein Heimat ist dort droben,   65
      I shall be glorified,            Da aller Engel Schaar          66
                                       Den groszen Herrscher loben    67
        Heaven is my home,             Die frommen heilgen Seelen     41
                                       Die giengen fort und fort      42
      There with the good and blest    Da will ich immer wohnen,      105
      Those I loved most and best,     Bei denen, die mit Kronen      107
      I shall forever rest;            Du ausgeschmücket hast         108
                                       Da will ich . . .              109
        Heaven is my home.             In meinern Erbteil ruhn.       112

   4. Therefore I'll murmur not,       Hab ich doch müszen leiden     23
                                       Und tragen mit Geduld,         24
      Whate'er my earthly lot,         Es musz ja durchgedrungen      53
                                       Es musz gelitten sein;         54
        Heaven is my home.             So will ich zwar nun treiben   57
                                       Mein Leben durch die Welt.     58
      For I shall surely stand
      There at my Lord's right hand;-- Cf. lines 105-112, above, quoted opp.
                                       stanza 3.
      Heaven is my fatherland,
        Heaven is my home.

   Other similarities to "Ich bin ein Gast auf Erden" are:

   (a) "The Pilgrim," by Sarah H. Palfrey, in the Schaff-Gilman Lib. Rel.
   Poetry.

   A Pilgrim am I on my way
   To seek and find the Holy Land . . .

   This poem would perhaps bear but slight resemblance to Gerhardt's were
   it not for the final stanza where the element of joy is introduced:

   While Joy shall spring
   With me through heaven's straight door.

   These lines are certainly suggestive of Gerhardt's words in his stanza
   XIII:

   Du aber, meine Freude . . . du zeuchst mich . . .
   Ins Haus der ewgen Wonne.

   (b) "The Pilgrim's song," by H. F. Lyte, in his Poems chiefly
   Religious, 1833 and 1845,

   Stanza 1. My rest is in heaven; my rest is not here;
             Then why should I murmur when trials are near?
             Be hushed, my dark spirit! the worst that can come
             But shortens thy journey, and hastens thee home.
   2.        It is not for me to be seeking my bliss
             And building my hopes in a region like this:
             I look for a city which hands have not piled;
             I pant for a country by sin undefiled. . . .
   4.        Afflictions may damp me, they cannot destroy;
             One glimpse of thy love turns them all into joy: . . .
   5.        Let doubt then, and danger, my progress oppose;
             They only make heaven more sweet at the close. . . .
   6.        A scrip on my back, and a staff in my hand,
             I march on in haste through an enemy's land:
             The road may be rough, but it cannot be long;
             And I'll smooth it with hope and I'll cheer it with song.

   Although Lyte based his hymn on Hebrews IV, 9, "There remaineth
   therefore a rest to the people of God," he treats in his concluding
   stanza the additional theme of hope and cheer which, as has been seen,
   [219] was a constant and favorite topic with Gerhardt. Since this
   chapter of Hebrews has no direct reference to this theme we have good
   reason to assume that from the striking similarity of language of the
   two hymns Lyte was influenced by Gerhardt's "Ich bin ein Gast auf
   Erden." Especially in stanza VII is the likeness most noticeable:

   So will ich zwar nun treiben
   Mein Leben durch die Welt,
   Doch denk ich nicht zu bleiben
   In diesem fremden Zelt. (Cf. Lyte stanza 6.)
   Ich wandre meine Straszen,
   Die zu der Heimat führt, (Cf. Lyte stanza 1.)
   Da mich ohn alle Maszen
   Mein Vater trösten wird. (Cf. Lyte stanza 5.)

   (c) "In exile here we wander," by W. Cooke. [Septuagesima.] This hymn
   appeared in the Hymnary, 1872, under the signature "A. C. C." (i. e.,
   "A Canon of Chester"), and is definitely known to have been suggested
   to Canon Cooke by Gerhardt's hymn. In [665]Thring's Collection, 1882,
   stanza III, lines 4-8 is altered to:

   And we shall rise in that great day
   In bodies like to Thine
   And with Thy saints in bright array, (Cf. lines 65, 66.)
   Shall in Thy glory shine. (Cf. line 104.)

Summary

   There are of course numerous adaptations of Gerhardt's work which have
   less merit than those which have been mentioned, but it would be beyond
   the scope of this thesis to discuss them. From our consideration up to
   this point we may draw the following conclusions: many translators have
   taken the liberty of altering the original versions thereby injuring
   perhaps just those hymns possessed of the greatest warmth and vigor and
   have in this way prevented our poet from being more fully acknowledged;
   at the same time the best of his hymns as devotional lyrics with a
   pathos and sympathy which are exceptionally beautiful and powerful have
   become naturalized in English-speaking countries by the really good
   translations and will always serve to enkindle devotion and strengthen
   grace in the true Christian worshipper.

Beddome, Benjamin

   Beddome, Benjamin, M.A. This prolific hymn writer was born at
   Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, January 23, 1717, where his father was
   at that time Baptist minister. He was apprenticed to a surgeon in
   Bristol, but removing to London, he joined in 1739 the Baptist Church,
   and became one of the most respected Baptist ministers in England. In
   1770 he received the degree of M.A. from Rhode Island College, [221]
   Providence. He died September 3, 1795. It was his practice to prepare a
   hymn every week to be sung after his Sunday morning sermon. Many of
   these found their way into the General Baptist Hymn Book of 1793, and
   other collections. His popularity is now mainly in America. He has
   translated no. [700]229.

   Susanna Wesley and was born at Epworth Rectory December 18, 1707,
   receiving his education at Westminster School and Christ Church,
   Oxford. He became one of the first band of Oxford Methodists, and went
   in 1735 with his brother John to Georgia as Secretary to Gen.
   Oglethorpe. His stay there was very short; he returned to England 1736
   and shortly afterward came under the influence of Count Zinzendorf and
   the Moravians. His headquarters were at Bristol till 1771 when he moved
   to London devoting there much time to the spiritual care of the
   prisoners in Newgate. He died in 1788. Cf. [885]p. 31.

Wesley, John

   Wesley, John, born at Epworth Rectory in 1703. He was educated at
   Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1729 became director of the little band
   of "Oxford Methodists." In 1735 he went as a missionary of the Society
   for the Propagation of the Gospel to Georgia where a new colony had
   been founded under the governorship of Gen. Oglethorpe. On his voyage
   he was deeply impressed with the piety and Christian courage of some
   German fellow travellers, Moravians. During his short ministry in
   Georgia he met with many discouragements and returned home much
   dissatisfied. In London he again fell in with the Moravians and from
   now on he labored to spread what he believed to be the everlasting
   gospel, travelling, preaching and making converts. He died at the age
   of 88 in the year 1791. The part which he actually took in writing the
   many hymns ascribed to the two brothers John and Charles is difficult
   to ascertain, but it is reasonably certain that more than thirty
   translations from the German, French, and Spanish, chiefly from the
   German, were exclusively his and although somewhat free they embody the
   fire and energy of the originals and have had a wide circulation. He
   has translated nos. [886]71, [887]185, [888]200.

Winkworth, Catherine

   Winkworth, Catherine, born in London in 1829. She took always a deep

   England (containing translations from the German, together with music),
   1863; and (4) [892]Christian Singers of Germany, 1869. Although not the
   earliest of modern translators from the German into English, Miss
   Winkworth is surely the foremost in rank and popularity. Her
   translations are the most widely used of any from the German and have
   had more to do with the modern revival of the English use of German
   hymns than have the versions of any other writer. She has translated

  ALLITERATION (cf. [920]p. 19)

   Gerhardt clings to the traditional fondness of the German poet for
   alliterative phrases. If there be any virtue in the saw regarding "Apt
   alliteration's artful aid" our poet has found that virtue. The
   predominating sounds are the consonants; rarely is there alliteration
   of vowels. An enumeration shows the following results: [224]

   Sequences of F, 12; of G, 36; of H, 20; of L, 27; of S, 30; of W, 20;
   of Z, 6. Of the other consonants there is an average of only two or
   three each.

   [225] The complete tabulation of words and phrases used in repetition
   is too bulky for printing. These few selections will serve to
   illustrate this characteristic of Gerhardt's poetry. Cf. p. 19.

   Hymnal and Order of Service, #400


   Shun, my heart, the thought forever

   That thou hast been cast away,

   Rest upon God's Word and favor,

   Never cease to watch and pray.

   E'en though thou unrighteous art,

   True and faithful is God's heart;

   Hast thou death deserved forever?

   God's appeased, despond thou never!


   Thou art, as is ev'ry other,

   Tainted with the bane of sin

   That the serpent through our father

   Adam, by the fall, brought in.

   But if thou God's voice dost hear,

   With a contrite heart draw near

   Unto God, he will receive thee,

   All thy sins He will forgive thee.


   Thou wilt find in Him a Father

   Who is patient, kind, and true,

   He doth love thee as no brother

   And no other friend can do.

   E'en our smallest cares He knows,

   He is touched by all our woes;

   Our most secret prayers He heareth,

   And our saddened hearts He cheereth.


   Hear His word, "As I am living,

   I the death of none would see,

   But that every sinner, giving

   Up his heart, would turn to Me.

   How my heart with rapture burns

   When a prodigal returns!

   My own child I love to call him,

   And no evil shall befall him."


   Never shepherd's heart so yearneth

   For the sheep that go astray

   As God's loving bosom burneth

   For His erring child alway.

   How He thirsts, and longs, and yearns

   For the soul that from Him turns!

   Couldst thou know His love so tender,

   Thou wouldst praise unto Him render.


   Of such wondrous love and favor

   Open wide the door to me,

   And Thy goodness, precious Saviour,

   Let me ever taste and see.

   Love me, Lord, and let me be

   Ever nearer drawn to Thee;

   Let Thy Spirit lead and guide me,

   In Thy loving bosom hide me.

   Ich singe dir mit Herz und Mund, 1653

   (1-5) 1765. J Haberkorn; (6, 7) 1746-54. M.

   Moravian Hymn Book, #23


   I'll praise thee with my heart and tongue,

   O Lord, my soul's delight,

   Declaring to the world in song

   Thy glory, praise and might.


   Thou art th'eternal source of grace,

   The fount of lasting bliss;

   From thee unto the human race

   Flows all true happiness.


   On thee, almighty Lord of hosts,

   Depend our life and all;

   Thou keepest watch around our coasts,

   Protecting great and small.


   Thy chastisements are nought but love;

   When we our sins confess,

   We thy forgiveness richly prove;

   'Tis thy delight to bless.


   Hast thou not tended us and fed,

   E'en from our earliest days;

   Our souls with loving-kindness led

   Through many dangerous ways?


   God never yet mistake hath made

   In his vast government;

   And all he doth permit or aid

   Is blest in the event.


   Then murmur not, but be resigned

   To his most holy will;

   Peace, rest and comfort thou wilt find,

   My soul, in being still.

   Salve mundi Salutare. 12th Cent. Bernard of Clairvaux.

   Sei mir tausendmal gegrüsset. 1653.

   1754. J. Gambold, a.

   Moravian Hymn Book, #97


   Thousand times by me be greeted,

   Jesus, who has lovèd me,

   And thyself to death submitted

   For my treason against thee:

   Ah, how happy do I feel,

   When 'fore thee I humbly kneel,

   See thee on the cross expiring,

   And true life for me acquiring.


   Jesus, thee I view in spirit,

   Covered o'er with blood and wounds:

   Now salvation through thy merit

   For my sin-sick soul abounds:

   O who can, thou Prince of Peace,

   Who didst thirst for our release,

   Fully fathom all that's treasured

   In thy love's design unmeasured?


   Heal me, O my soul's Physician,

   Wheresoe'er I'm sick or sad;

   All the woes of my condition

   By thy balm be now allayed:

   Heal the hurts which Adam wrought,

   Or which on myself I've brought;

   If thy blood me only cover,

   My distress will soon be over.


   With the deepest adoration

   Humbly at thy feet I lie,

   And with fervent supplication

   Unto thee for succour cry:

   My petition kindly hear;

   Say in answer to my prayer,

   'I will change thy grief and sadness

   Into comfort, joy, and gladness.'

   Ist Gott füf mich, so trete.

   1656. P. Gerhardt

   1725. J. C. Jacobi, a.

   Moravian Hymn Book, #376


   Is God my strong salvation,

   No enemy I fear,

   He hears my supplication,

   Dispelling all my care:

   If he, my Head and Master,

   Defend me from above,

   What pain, or what disaster,

   Can part me from his love?


   I fully am persuaded

   And joyfully declare,

   I'm never left unaided,

   My Father hears my prayer;

   His comforts never fail me,

   He stands at my right hand;

   When tempests fierce assail me,

   They're calm at his command.


   The ground of my profession

   Is Jesus and his blood;

   He giveth me possession

   Of everlasting good.

   To me his Spirit speaketh

   Full many a precious word--

   Of rest to him who seeketh

   A refuge in the Lord.


   Should earth lose its foundation,

   He stands my lasting rock;

   No temporal desolation

   Shall give my love a shock;

   I'll cleave to Christ my Saviour,

   No object, small or great,

   Nor height, no depth, shall ever

   Me from him separate.


   My merry heart is springing,

   It can no more be sad;

   With laughter and with singing,

   In God's own sunshine glad;

   For Christ is now preparing

   His city new and bright,

   Where saints his throne are sharing

   And faith is turned to sight.

   Wach auf mein Herz! und singe.

   1648. P. Gerhardt.

   1722. J. C. Jacobi, a.

   Moravian Hymn Book, #727


   My soul, awake and render

   To God, thy great defender,

   The God of all the living,

   Thy prayer and thy thanksgiving.


   When night had closed around me,

   The darkness helpless found me;

   But happy was my sleeping

   In his most gracious keeping.


   With joy I still discover

   Thy light, O Lord, my Lover;

   My thanks shall be the spices

   Of morning sacrifices.


   Be thou my only treasure,

   Fulfil in me thy pleasure,

   Thy word my spirit feeding,

   Thy light still onward leading.


   Thy love, which once did find me,

   To thee shall ever bind me;

   My life to thee be tending

   Beginning, middle, ending.

   Lutheran Hymnary, #301


   A Lamb goes uncomplaining forth,

   The guilt of all men bearing;

   Laden with all the sins of earth,

   None else the burden sharing!

   Goes patient on, grows weak and faint,

   To slaughter led without complaint,

   That spotless life to offer;

   Bears shame, and stripes, and wounds and death,

   Anguish and mockery, and saith,

   "Willing all this I suffer."


   That Lamb is Lord of death and life,

   God over all forever;

   The Father's Son, whom to that strife

   Love doth for us deliver!

   O mighty Love! what hast Thou done!

   The Father offers up His Son--

   The Son content descendeth!

   O Love, O Love! how strong art Thou!

   In shroud and grave Thou lay'st Him low

   Whose word the mountains rendeth!


   Him on the cross, O Love, Thou lay'st,

   Fast to that torture nailing,

   Him as a spotless Lamb Thou slay'st;

   His heart and flesh are failing--

   The body with that crimson flood,

   That precious tide of noble blood,

   The heart with anguish breaking!

   O Lamb! what shall I render Thee

   For all Thy tender love to me,

   Or what return be making?


   My lifelong days would I still Thee

   Be steadfastly beholding;

   Thee ever, as Thou ever me,

   With loving arms enfolding,

   And when my heart grows faint and chill,

   My heart's undying light, O still

   Abide unchanged before me!

   Myself Thy heritage I sign,

   Ransomed to be forever Thine,

   My only hope and glory.


   I of Thy majesty and grace

   Would night and day be singing;

   A sacrifice of joy and praise

   Myself to Thee still bringing.

   My stream of life shall flow to Thee

   Its steadfast current ceaselessly

   In praise to Thee outpouring;

   And all the good Thou dost to me

   I'll treasure in my memory,

   Deep in my heart's depths storing!


   Shrine of my heart, give larger space

   For wealth that passeth measure!

   Thou must become a royal place

   For all-excelling treasure.

   Away, world, with thy golden hoard,

   And all the glories in thee stored,

   My treasure is in heaven;

   For I have found true riches now;

   My treasure, Christ, my Lord art Thou

   Thy blood so freely given!


   This treasure ever I employ,

   This ever aid shall yield me;

   In sorrow it shall be my joy,

   In conflict it shall shield me.

   In joy, the music of my feast;

   And when all else has lost its zest,

   This manna still shall feed me;

   In thirst my drink, in want my food,

   My company in solitude,

   To comfort and to lead me!


   And when I enter on Thy joys,

   With Thee Thy kingdom sharing,

   Thyself my robe of triumph, Lord,

   Thy blood my right declaring,

   Shall place upon my head the crown,

   Shall lead me to the Father's throne,

   And raiment fit provide me;

   Till I, by Him to Thee betrothed,

   By Thee in bridal constume clothed,

   Stand as a bride beside Thee!

   Lutheran Hymnary, #157


   O how shall I receive Thee,

   How meet Thee on Thy way;

   Blest hope of every nation,

   My soul's delight and stay?

   O Jesus, Jesus, give me,

   By Thine illuming light,

   To know whate'er is pleasing

   And welcome in Thy sight.


   Thy Zion psalms is strewing

   With branches fresh and fair;

   And every soul awaking,

   Her anthem shall prepare;

   Perpetual thanks and praises

   Forth from our hearts shall spring;

   And to Thy name the service

   Of all our powers we bring.


   O ye who sorrow, sinking

   Beneath your grief and pain,

   Rejoice in His appearing,

   Who shall your souls sustain;

   He comes, He comes with gladness!

   How great is His good-will!

   He comes, all grief and anguish

   Shall at His word be still.


   Ye who with guilty terror

   Are trembling, fear no more;

   With love and grace the Savior

   Shall you to hope restore;

   He comes, who contrite sinners

   Will with the children place,

   The children of His Father,

   The heirs of life and grace.


   He comes, the Lord, to judgment;

   Woe, woe to them who hate!

   To those who love and seek Him

   He opes the heavenly gate.

   Come quickly, gracious Savior,

   And gather us to Thee,

   That in the light eternal

   Our joyous home may be.

   Lutheran Hymnary, #332


   I know that my Redeemer lives,

   In this my faith is fast;

   And whatsoe'er against Him strives

   Will surely fall at last.

   He lives, the mighty One, I know,

   Whose arm overcomes the strongest foe,

   Who death and hell hath vanquished.


   He lives, He lives; though dust shall lie

   Upon my mouldering head,

   Yet He will call me, by and by,

   To quit an earthly bed;

   And I shall waken at His voice,

   Rise re-embodied, and rejoice

   To look on my Redeemer.


   His promise, who hath ne'er deceived,

   In life and death I trust;

   The Lord in whom I have believed

   Will raise my sleeping dust:

   In this my very flesh that dies

   I shall revive, and with these eyes

   Shall see the God who made me.


   Myself shall see Him in my flesh,

   With all His glory bright;

   His presence shall my heart refresh,

   And fill my soul with light.

   Myself shall ever on Him gaze,

   Myself shall ever sound His praise,

   Myself, and not another.


   Rise, then, my soul, e'en now, and life

   In hope's divine abode!

   Let earth and Satan vainly strive

   To tear thee from thy God.

   The bier, the coffin, let them show

   The grave, the gloom, the worm--"I know

   That my Redeemer liveth."

   Lutheran Hymnary, #383


   I sing to Thee with voice and heart,

   Of all my joys the well;

   I sing, that, that I know Thou art

   My lips to all may tell;

   That Thou a fountain art of grace,

   With blessings richly stored

   For all, in every time and place,

   This well I know, O Lord.


   Cheer up, faint heart, rejoice and sing,

   All anxious fear resign;

   For God, the sovereign Lord and King,

   Is thy God, even thine:

   He is thy portion, He thy joy,

   Thy life, and light, and Lord;

   Thy counsellor when doubts annoy,

   Thy shield and great reward.


   In restless thoughts or dark despair

   Why spend the day and night?

   On Him who loves thee cast thy care;

   He makes our burdens light:

   Did not His love, and truth, and power

   Watch o'er thy childhood's day?

   Hath He not oft, in threatening hour,

   Turned dreaded ills away!


   His wisdom never plans in vain,

   Ne'er falters, or mistakes;

   All that His counsels wise ordain

   A happy ending makes:

   Upon thy mouth, then, lay thy hand,

   And trust His guiding eye;

   Thus, firm as rock, thy feet shall stand,

   Now and eternally.

   Lutheran Hymnary, #455


   Blessed is the man that never

   Doth in godless counsel meet;

   Nor in sinners' way stands ever,

   Nor sits in the scorner's seat,

   But on God's all-perfect law

   Meditates with holy awe;

   Day and night he delves for treasure

   In the word--'tis all his pleasure.


   As a tree that has been planted

   By the flowing waters fair,

   In its season e'er is granted

   Fruits and foliage to bear,

   So is he, the righteous, seen

   Ever fruitful, ever green,

   And his leaf shall wither never,

   All he does shall prosper ever.


   To the wicked 'tis not given

   Such a happy lot to share;

   As the chaff by wind is driven

   So shall the ungodly fare;

   They in judgment shall not stand,

   Nor be in the righteous band:

   These the Lord forsaketh never,

   Those thall be cast off forever.


   For the Lord His people knoweth,

   His pure eyes behold their way,

   And the blessing He bestoweth

   Is their heritage for aye:

   But the wicked ever tend

   To their doom and to their end:

   God will all the righteous cherish,

   But the wicked ones shall perish.

   Holy Ghost, dispel our sadness,

   Pierce the clouds of sinful night;

   Come, thou source of sweetest gladness,

   Breathe thy life, and spread thy light.


   From that height which knows no measure

   As a gracious shower descend,

   Bringing down the richest treasure

   Man can wish, or God can send!


   [Come, Thou best of all donations...]


   [Known to Thee are all recesses...]


   Manifest thy love for ever;

   Fence us in on every side;

   In distress be our Reliever,

   Guard and teach, support and guide.


   [Be our Friend on each occasion...]


   When we die, be our Salvation,

   Raise us glorious from the grave;

   Perfect thus thy new creation,

   God! omnipotent to save.

   P Gerhardt. 1653.

   Lutheran Hymnary, #436


   I will sing my Maker's praises,

   And in Him most joyful be,

   For in all things I see traces

   Of the good He meaneth me:

   Nothing else but love could move Him

   With such sweet and tender care

   All who try to serve and love Him

   Evermore to raise and bear.


   Yea, so dear doth he esteem me,

   That the Son He loves so well

   He hath given to redeem me

   From the quenchless flames of Hell;

   Well of life that springeth ever!

   Sea of love that hath no ground!

   Fruitless were my best endeavor

   Depth of love like Thine to sound.


   All which for my soul is needful

   He will carefully provide

   Nor of that is he unheedful

   Which my body needs beside:

   When my strength cannot avail me--

   At the best a broken reed--

   God appears; He will not fail me

   In the time of utmost need.


   As a father ne'er removeth

   All his love for some lost child,

   But the prodigal still loveth,

   Yearning to be reconciled;

   So my sins and many errors

   Find a tender pardoning God,

   Who doth not with penal terrors

   Chasten them, but with the rod.


   All His blows and scourges truly

   For the moment grievous prove,

   And yet, when I weigh them duly,

   Are but tokens of His love;

   Proofs that He is watching o'er me,

   And would, by the cross and rod,

   From this wicked world restore me

   To my Father and my God.


   Since then neither change nor coldness

   In His precious love can be,

   Lo! I lift my hands with boldness,

   As a child I come to Thee.

   Grant me grace, O God, I pray Thee,

   That I may with all my might

   Love, and trust Thee, and obey Thee,

   Till I reach the realms of light.

   Lutheran Hymnary, #342


   Why, my soul, thus trembling ever?

   Have no fear;

   Christ is near;

   Naught from thee can sever,

   Heaven is thine, and Christ shall own thee;

   Faithful be

   Until He

   Shall with triumph crown thee.


   Painful cross if He should send me,

   Shall I faint

   With complaint,

   Lest the grief should end me?

   He hath borne the cross before me;

   Soon no pain

   Shall remain,

   Only peace be o'er me.


   Hopeful, cheerful, and undaunted,

   Everywhere

   They appear

   Who in Christ are planted;

   Death itself cannot appall them;

   They rejoice

   When the voice

   Of their Lord doth call them.


   Death cannot destroy forever;

   From our fears,

   Cares and tears,

   Soon shall it deliver,

   Doors of grief and gloom it closes,

   While the soul,

   Free and whole,

   With the saints reposes.


   Lord, my Shepherd, take me to Thee!

   I am Thine,

   Thou art mine,

   Even ere I knew Thee.

   I am Thine, for Thou hast bought me:

   Lost I stood,

   But Thy blood

   Free salvation brought me.


   Thou art mine, and, for my guiding,

   Be my bright

   Shining light

   In my heart abiding!

   Savior dear! let me, attaining

   To Thy side,

   There abide,

   With Thee ever reigning!
