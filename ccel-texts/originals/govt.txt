I. A Fifth Century Tract for the Times

   "Be ashamed, ye Roman people everywhere, be ashamed of the lives you
   lead! . . . It is neither the strength of their bodies that makes the
   barbarians conquer, nor the weakness of our nature that makes us
   subject to defeat. Let no one think or persuade himself otherwise--it
   is our vicious lives alone that have conquered us." [1]

   These are the words which Salvian would have made echo throughout the
   Roman world, had his human frailty permitted, the words which have
   earned him the title of the "Jeremiah of his times." The problem of the
   decline of the Roman power was not relegated to the historians at that
   time, but was the chief concern of all thinking men, and many solutions
   were proposed. Successive invasions and settlements of barbarian tribes
   had ended Rome's claim to rule the world, while at the same time the
   fiscal difficulties of the central administration had increased
   taxation beyond endurance. The world seemed to be dying of old age, and
   the Empire with it. The natural tendency to glorify the past was
   intensified by the poignant wretchedness of the present, and grave
   doubts arose in the minds even of faithful Christians. "The very people
   who, as pagans, conquered and ruled the world, are being conquered and
   enslaved now that they have become Christians. Is not this clear
   evidence of God's neglect of human affairs?" [2] The question did not
   of itself imply disbelief in God, but its implicit doubt of God's
   constant government and judgment of mankind endangered the foundations
   of the Christian faith. Salvian's answer was clear and uncompromising.
   "These words are harsh and austere," he wrote elsewhere, "but what are
   we to do? We may not change the nature of things, and the truth cannot
   be pronounced otherwise than as the very essence of truth demands. Men
   think my words harsh. I know that well enough. But what are we to do?
   Except by hardship we do not make our way into the Kingdom." [3]

   The treatise On the Government of God, which is Salvian's best known
   work, is essentially an exposition of this thesis: that the decline of
   the Roman power actually demonstrated God's government and judgment of
   human actions, since the sins of the Romans were such as had always,
   since the fall of Adam, been visited with instant punishment.
   Consequently the first two books of Salvian's discussion are chiefly
   devoted to demonstrations of God's judgment by examples drawn from the
   authority of the Old Testament. The third book builds on this
   foundation a clear exposition of the Christian obligation of an upright
   life in God's service. On this basis Salvian then proceeded to contrast
   the disgraceful actions of the Christian Romans of his time with their
   duty toward God, and with the virtues of the victorious barbarians. Yet
   the latter, being either heretics or pagans, were under less obligation
   to a godly life than the orthodox Romans. To the author himself, and to
   his fellow clergy, the first three books may well have seemed the
   essential portion of the argument: to us the great interest of the work
   lies in the picture of the times given in the last five. For here we
   have detailed accounts of the effects of the burden of taxation on the
   poor, whom it ruined; on the rich, who managed to shift their burden to
   weaker shoulders; and on the curials, who were forced into tyranny by
   their responsibility to the agents of the central government for the
   sums due. In this case as in others, reference to the imperial decrees
   collected in the Codices proves the essential truth of Salvian's
   account. Sidonius Apollinaris has given us in his letters charming
   descriptions of the life of the wealthy nobles of southern Gaul:
   Salvian showed the other side of the picture when he described the
   means by which some of these same nobles had acquired their neighbors'
   land, and when he inveighed against the corruption of domestic life in
   their villas. He has shown clearly the development of serfdom under
   pressure of taxation and patronage, and the other alternatives from
   which the poor might choose--flight to barbarian territory, or armed
   revolt against the Roman system. And he has described in graphic terms,
   in part as an eyewitness, the horrors that attended the capture and
   sack of wealthy Roman cities, even at the hands of barbarians whom he
   believed to be far less brutal and depraved than many Romans. He has
   pictured the triumphant progress of the Vandals, reckoned as the
   weakest of Rome's enemies, through the richest provinces of the West.

   He showed, to be sure, only one side of life. The miseries of the time
   prompted the doubts that he undertook to resolve; with these alone he
   was directly concerned. He rarely admitted that there were exceptions
   to the prevailing corruption of his fellow Romans. It was hardly
   consistent with his thesis that he should do so, for his book was
   essentially a polemic. It is important, however, to note in this
   connection that his statements are very rarely in conflict with other
   contemporary evidence. Passages in the letters of Sidonius, in the
   sermons and letters of his friends at Lérins, and of other leaders of
   the church, as well as in the writings of pagans and in the laws of the
   empire, regularly corroborate his account of the times. And he, in
   turn, occasionally confirms their accounts of the beauty that still
   remained in life, by his glimpses of Provence, with its pleasant
   country life and rich harvests--"the one corner where the Roman power
   still lives."

II. The Life of Salvian

   As we have seen, Salvian wrote "as one having authority." That he had
   earned the right to speak is fully proved by the chief contemporary
   reference to his life and work. Gennadius wrote of him, in his
   biographical dictionary of illustrious men:

   Salvian, presbyter of Marseilles, learned in human and divine letters,
   and, if I may apply the title to him, master of bishops, wrote many
   books in a clear and scholarly style. Of these I have read the
   following: four books addressed to Marcellus the presbyter, On the
   Value of Virginity, and four Against Avarice; five books On the Present
   Judgment, and one book For the Satisfaction of These [Sins], addressed
   to Salonius the bishop; one book in exposition of the last part of
   Ecclesiastes, addressed to Claudius, bishop of Vienne; one book of
   letters; one book composed in verse as a Hexameron after the Greek
   fashion, from the beginning of Genesis to the creation of man; many
   homilies written for bishops; and on the sacraments, books whose number
   I do not recall. He still lives today in a goodly old age. [4]

   Salvian's other names we do not know, due chiefly to the fact that
   fifth century etiquette forbade the use of more than one name in
   friendly correspondence, [5] but the title "master of bishops" which
   Gennadius bestowed on him has more than atoned for the loss. The modest
   office of presbyter at Marseilles would seem sufficient to refute the
   early editors' claim of a bishop's mitre for him, even, without the
   negative evidence of the omission of his name from the episcopal lists.
   [6] But the title "master of bishops," magister episcoporum, is his by
   manifold right, and is inseparably connected with his personality in
   the minds of all who have studied his work. He lived and worked for
   some time at the very nursery of bishops, Lérins, where he was chosen
   to teach the two sons of Eucherius, both of whom were to become bishops
   later. At Marseilles he continued his teaching, composing many homilies
   for bishops, as Gennadius said. Although in his books To the Church
   against Avarice he spoke of himself as "least of the servants of God,"
   he spoke with the voice of authority, and his words were chiefly
   addressed to the great lords of the church.

   Many have called him by another title, which in its present meaning we
   cannot claim for him, but which he rightfully enjoyed in its fifth
   century use. Sanctus to him, as to all other Christians, before it
   seemed necessary to determine fixed categories for the communion of
   saints, meant a devout Christian. The word was applied to him by
   contemporaries, and recurs so often in his books that it is small
   wonder that many of his editors have informally canonized him, others
   have become involved in learned arguments to deprive him of sainthood,
   [7] and one university, at least, continues the good tradition in his
   honor. [8] Without doubt, as Baluze concludes, after disproving his
   claims to canonization, "there are many saints in heaven who are not so
   held by us in our catalogues."

   Of his personal life we know little, though he contributes so much to
   our knowledge of the general circumstances of his time. Gennadius
   described him in the last decade of the fifth century as still living
   bona senectute. It is not possible for us to fix the exact date of his
   birth, but the wide experience and ripe wisdom shown in his treatise On
   the Government of God indicate at least that he had reached maturity
   some time before it was written. As this book was evidently composed
   between A.D. 439 and 450, it is natural to assume that he was born late
   in the fourth century or early in the fifth. [9] What we know of the
   events of his life belongs entirely to the period before the
   publication of his chief work. The forty years or more that followed
   must be filled in by the writing of some of those lost works of which
   Gennadius spoke, and the many activities of a priest and "master of
   bishops" in one of the chief centers of the Gallic church. Several
   years before Salvian settled in Marseilles, a poet beggared by the
   Gothic raids sought refuge there, and found "many saints my dear
   friends." [10] Such a haven from the storms that beset the rest of Gaul
   was sure to provide ample activity for its priests.

   The place of Salvian's birth has been much disputed. Some early editors
   assumed that he was born in Africa--an assumption not unnatural in view
   of his graphic description of the sins and the ruin of that province.
   [11] The account of the capture of Trèves in his sixth book, however,
   makes it clear that his native district was near the Rhine frontier.
   The claims of both Trèves and Cologne have been supported by various
   authorities. Whether he lived in one of these cities, or on an estate
   in the countryside near by, his familiarity with the whole district is
   unmistakable.

   Trèves was the place of all others in the western world where he could
   best have studied the fatal magnificence of the higher Roman officials
   in the face of the barbarian attacks. The praetorian prefect of the
   Gallic and Spanish provinces kept his official residence there in such
   state as Constantius the emperor had scarcely equalled when he fixed
   his capital in that city a century earlier. There Salvian must have
   watched with growing anxiety the increasing power of the Franks. The
   author of the twelfth century Gesta Treverorum tells us that they had
   conceived a special hostility for this most splendid of Gallic cities
   from the time of their first contact with it. This district also
   afforded excellent opportunities to observe the increasing ravages of
   Goths, Vandals and Burgundians. The great amphitheater of Trèves was
   the scene of many of those public spectacles against which Salvian
   inveighed so bitterly, and when the Vandal Crocus captured the city in
   A.D. 406, the people were saved only by taking refuge within its strong
   walls. [12] Years later, Salvian wrote from Marseilles to the monks at
   Lérins, commending to their kindly offices a young kinsman, a refugee
   from the captured city of Cologne. He wrote to the brothers that the
   boy was "of a family not obscure, of which I might say something more,
   were he not related to me." [13] These words confirm the conclusions as
   to Salvian's family and position that we should naturally draw from his
   writings. His parents were clearly of the Gallo-Roman aristocracy:
   Salvian knew intimately the way of life of a man of position and
   substance, however much he disapproved of it. His examples indicate a
   considerable knowledge of life on the great estates, the masters'
   problems with slaves and tenants, the results of patronage, the various
   forms of cultivation employed, and at the same time a very real
   appreciation of the natural beauties of the country. For slaves and
   poor men, and all who suffered oppression, he had great sympathy. This,
   however, did not blind him to the probability that they would be as bad
   as their oppressors if the tables were turned. We do not need
   Gennadius' statement to prove that he had the full rhetorical education
   of his time. Despite the arguments of some scholars to the contrary,
   his works seem to indicate that he had continued to read widely in
   "human and divine letters." Greek he apparently did not read, and the
   works of philosophers he quoted only at second hand. He was fond of
   examples drawn from medical practice, but these are all of a sort with
   which any intelligent man would be familiar.

   His knowledge of law was far more detailed, and his writings furnish a
   valuable commentary on the Roman Codices, which in their turn serve as
   a check on his statements. Rittershausen concluded that he had had
   regular legal training; certainly he had a legal mind, and legal
   phraseology recurs constantly in his discussions. But it seems equally
   probable, especially if his father held an imperial position, that his
   juristic knowledge merely represents the attainment of a Roman citizen
   concerned both in the complex management of a considerable estate and
   in affairs of government administration. That he belonged to an
   imperial official family is suggested by his attitude toward lesser
   officials. For the downtrodden poor his sympathy is great, but for
   clerks, soldiers and tax collectors, and for the curials who formed the
   miserable remnant of the local aristocracies, he seems to have felt
   only scorn and distaste. His aristocratic prejudices were tempered by
   Christian charity in other cases, but not in his attitude toward these
   men [14] .

   It seems probable that he himself was brought up in the orthodox faith;
   at least he shows little of that bitterness toward pagans and heretics
   that recent converts are wont to feel. For those who called themselves
   Christians but continued heathen practices, however, his antipathy was
   very strong. His wife, Palladia, had been brought up in paganism, but
   her parents, Hypatius and Quieta, seem to have made no objection to the
   marriage. Later, however, they were alienated by the decision of
   Salvian and Palladia to follow a course which was being adopted by many
   other Christian couples. Unable either to endure Roman society as they
   found it, or to reform it from within, they determined to give their
   property to the church, and live no longer as man and wife, but as
   brother and sister in Christian fellowship. Paulinus of Nola, the one
   contemporary to whose example Salvian clearly alludes, [15] is the best
   known of those who sought that peace in Christian poverty which Roman
   wealth had failed to give. The anger of Ausonius at his friend's course
   reflects a situation that must have been many times repeated. In this
   case, however, it culminated in one of the most poignant expressions of
   friendship that man has ever written. [16]

   After an estrangement from their parents that lasted nearly seven
   years, Salvian, Palladia and the little daughter Auspiciola tried once
   more to effect a reconciliation. Their letter, [17] which has
   fortunately been preserved, seems far too mannered and artificial to be
   convincing, but this formality was a set convention in the
   letter-writing of the time. Their pleas are sincere and loving, though
   yielding not one jot as to the essential rightness of their course. The
   immediate occasion of the letter seems to have been the news of the
   parents' conversion to Christianity, which would seem indeed to work in
   favor of their case. Palladia followed her husband's arguments by
   memories of the days when they had called her "little starling, little
   mistress, little mother, birdling:" she pleaded tenderly, too, for
   little Auspiciola, who deserved her grandparents' love.

   Of the issue of their suit we know nothing. They had withdrawn from the
   vicinity of Trèves, probably shortly after that destruction of the city
   which Salvian saw with his own eyes, and so graphically described. [18]
   About A.D. 418 the praetorian prefect of Gaul seems to have changed his
   seat from Trèves to Aries; perhaps Salvian's was one of the Roman
   families that withdrew soon after, either for official or private
   reasons. [19] We do not know whether it was before or after this move
   that their ascetic resolution was taken; in any case, they went soon to
   the islands of the Lérins, which offered monasteries, separate but not
   remote from each other, for families in such case as theirs. Nothing is
   known thereafter of Palladia and Auspiciola; Salvian's life apparently
   lay apart from theirs.

   Lérins was that "earthly paradise" [20] which furnished a haven for
   many religious of the day, and was so powerful a stimulant to their
   faith that from it went forth a seemingly endless stream of saintly
   men. Honoratus and Hilary, Caesarius and Virgilius went from Lérins to
   the archbishopric of Aries; Maximus and Faustus to the see of Riez;
   Lupus to Troyes. Eucherius came to Lérins with his wife Galla and his
   two sons. He himself left to become bishop of Lyons; his sons, Salonius
   and Veranus, were put under the successive tutelage of Honoratus,
   Hilary, Salvian. and Vincent, [21] and became bishops of Geneva and
   Vence. Three bishops went from Lérins to Avignon, and many others might
   be named. [22]

   Honoratus was abbot at Lérins in Salvian's time and was called by
   Eucherius "master of bishops, doctor of the churches," being thus the
   prototype of Salvian. Shortly after A.D. 429, Hilarius of Aries
   preached at Marseilles a sermon on the life of Honoratus, in which he
   quoted from the writings of "a man of not unmerited distinction, and
   most blessed in Christ, Salvian the presbyter, one of Honoratus' dear
   associates." [23] Thus he gives us not only a glimpse of the esteem in
   which Salvian was already held, but a terminus ante quem for his
   ordination. Just when Salvian moved to Marseilles we do not know, nor
   why. Certainly it was through no antagonism at Lérins, for his first
   letter, already mentioned, expresses the utmost affection for the
   brothers there. The initial paragraph, on the bitter-sweetness of love,
   which at times compels one to ask of beloved friends a favor that
   without love would be irksome, bears witness to the depth of his
   feeling for the monks. Its concluding words testify to his; high esteem
   for them: "Surely, if there is any good character in this young man,
   his hope and salvation will not prove to be of great difficulty to you;
   even if he receives no actual teaching, it is enough for him to be with
   you."

   The years at Lérins must have exerted great influence on the
   development of Salvian's thought and style. The close fellowship
   between the monks of the island is constantly demonstrated by
   likenesses of ideas and phrasing in the writings of the many great men
   who there received their early training. Parts of the homilies of
   Caesarius of Aries, of Valerius and Hilarius bear striking resemblances
   to passages in Salvian's work. Vincent's Commonitorium has been
   appropriately included in many editions of Salvian, thus continuing
   their ancient fellowship. The book On the Government of God, as well as
   a lost work, was dedicated to Salonius, whom Salvian addressed in his
   ninth letter as "master and most blessed pupil, father, and son, pupil
   by instruction, son by affection, and father by rank and honor."

   The life of Caesarius of Aries throws some light on the statement that
   Salvian composed many homilies for bishops. We read of Caesarius that:

   He composed also appropriate sermons for feast days and other
   occasions, and sermons against the evils of drunkenness and lust,
   against discord and hatred, against anger and pride, against
   sacrilegious men and soothsayers, against pagan rites, against augurs,
   the worshippers of woods and of springs, and against the vices of
   divers men. He so prepared these homilies that if any visitors asked,
   far from refusing to loan them, he offered them for copying at the
   slightest suggestion of a request, and himself corrected them. He sent
   copies by priests to men far distant in the Frankish land, in Gaul,
   Italy and Spain and divers provinces, to be preached in their churches,
   that, casting aside frivolous and transitory interests, they might, as
   the apostle preached, become followers of good works. [24]

   Gennadius' emphasis on the homilies of Salvian suggests that their
   composition may have been one of the major preoccupations of his life
   in Marseilles, and a chief ground for his title of "master of bishops."
   That many of his sermons took the form of invectives against the vices
   of his day may be assumed from the extant books Against Avarice and On
   the Government of God. Both of these, indeed, have the air of having
   been compiled from actual sermons. The congregation is clearly
   visualized, which may account for the frequent use of the second
   person, and of a vivid colloquial tone.

   That his attacks on the weaknesses of his contemporaries caused him
   serious difficulties is indicated by his constant reiteration that his
   words are sure to give offence to many, but even so they must be said.
   Larinus Amatius said in his eulogy of Salvian: "For if wrath engenders
   hatred among all men, and begets it especially among the wicked, who
   was ever more hated for the truth than Salvian, since no one ever set
   forth more truths than he?" [25]

   From the time of his removal to Marseilles, all that we know of
   Salvian's life is summed up in Gennadius' account. The few extant
   letters are chiefly of value for the glimpses they afford of his regard
   for the deference due to those of higher rank in the church, and their
   evidence of his continuing association with his former friends and
   pupils at Lérins. An example is his letter to Eucherius, thanking him
   for a copy of his Instructions on the More Difficult Questions of the
   Old and New Testament, [26] which the bishop had written for his sons,
   now themselves "masters of churches." Lacking any further evidence for
   the closing years of Salvian's life than the goodly old age with which
   Gennadius credited him, we can only hope that he gained fulfilment of
   the wish with which his letter to Eucherius ended: "May God in his
   mercy grant me throughout the days of my life, or at least when they
   are ended, that those who have been my pupils may daily pray for me."

III. Salvian's Literary Work

   Gennadius' list shows that, while much of Salvian's work has been lost,
   the books that remain are probably the most individual and the most
   interesting to us. The writings of several other early Christians
   present such titles as On the Value of Virginity, A Book in Exposition
   of the Last Part of Ecclesiastes, and books On the Sacraments. One
   title is obscure, the book to Salonius Pro eorum merito satisfactionis,
   or Pro eorum praemio satisfaciendo. The variants in the text of
   Gennadius indicate that the obscurity is of long standing in the
   manuscript tradition. In my translation I have followed Ebert's
   conjecture of peccatorum for eorum, which at least makes possible a
   conjectural translation of the title--For the Satisfaction of These
   Sins, [27] a book that might conceivably have been a companion volume
   to that On the Government of God.

   Of the homilies written for bishops, and the influence of sermon
   writing on Salvian's general style, I have already spoken. It is
   possible, as Peter Allix suggested, that the anonymous poem on Genesis
   formerly ascribed to Tertullian may be part of the lost Hexameron of
   Salvian; the poem is, however, of slight importance, and its
   identification as the work of our author would be chiefly valuable as
   an indication of his wisdom in not publishing other verses. [28] Only
   nine of the letters are preserved; of these I have already spoken. The
   ninth, addressed to Salonius, is of special interest, since it explains
   both Salvian's purpose in writing his four books Against Avarice, and
   his reasons for publishing them anonymously. Salonius feared that since
   the work was issued as the Address of Timotheus to the Church against
   Avarice, it might be mistaken for an apocryphal work of the "Apostle"
   Timothy.

   Like the Government of God, the invective Against Avarice was written
   because of Salvian's deep conviction of the dangers inherent in the
   persistent vices of men who called themselves Christians. Avarice was a
   besetting sin of many Romans, and had infected not only members of the
   church, but its clergy, even to the bishops themselves. The resultant
   neglect of the true service of God, and of the spiritual and material
   welfare of the church, led Salvian to "burst forth into words of
   lamentation" addressed to the church to which the offenders belonged.
   His failure to attach his own name to the book he explained not only by
   his desire to avoid vain glory in a service to God, but also by his
   conviction that the obscurity of his name might detract from the
   influence of his words. The pseudonym Timotheus ("Honoring God") was
   chosen to indicate the motive of the work: "Indeed, the writer thought
   it fitting that, writing his books for the honor of God, he should
   consecrate the title to his divine honor." [29]

   In spite of this letter, and of Gennadius' ascription of the work to
   Salvian, its anonymity was preserved in modern times, for it was
   published by Sichardus at Fol near Basel in 1528 as. the work of Bishop
   Timotheus, in a collection entitled An Antidote against the Heresies of
   All Ages.

   While no one who reads the treatise Against Avarice can doubt the
   sincerity and depth of feeling with which it was written, the work is a
   curious document of the times. Avarice was considered one of the deadly
   sins. But it is hard now to avoid seeing some self-interest on the part
   of the church in the constant exhortations to the rich to give all
   their goods to the church in order to win remission of their sins. In
   its simplest form, this is the admonition of Christ to the rich young
   man: as it is elaborated to produce a surer conviction in the minds of
   fifth century Midases it is perilously close to the purchase of
   absolution. Some modern writers have thought the book more likely to
   encourage the avarice of the church than to discourage that of
   churchmen; others have seen in it an anticipation of the later satires
   against the greed of the clergy. [30] The irony that is never far from
   Salvian's writing is even more marked than usual in this indictment,
   but the unprejudiced reader is not likely to see in it an intention of
   actual satire. Nor is it sufficient to dismiss it, as Teuffel does,
   simply as a ballon d'essai. [31] It was clearly written in all
   seriousness, albeit in bitterness of heart, with the earnest hope of
   exerting a salutary influence against a chief evil of the times. The
   author employed the arguments that experience had taught him were most
   likely to be effective.

   That this work was written before the completion of the treatise On the
   Government of God is shown by the quotation from it in the latter; it
   may with some probability be assigned to the years 435-439. [32] The
   words of Timothy to the church must have aroused much anger among
   ecclesiastical leaders, and apparently this antagonism made Salvian
   rather sensitive to criticism, though none the less determined to
   attack the vices of his day. That his later books would not be less
   fearless because of any hostility thus aroused, he showed in his
   concluding paragraphs, in which there is not a little of his own
   spiritual biography:

   All human work is unworthy in comparison with the future glory. So
   nothing ought to seem hard and austere to Christians, because whatever
   they offer to Christ is in return for eternal blessings; what is given
   is vile when that which is received is so great. Nothing great is paid
   to God by men on earth, in comparison with the supreme gift of heaven.
   It is hard for misers to lavish their wealth. What is strange in this?
   Everything is hard that is demanded of the unwilling. Almost every
   divine word arouses animosity--there are as many hostile schools as
   there are teachers.

   If the Lord orders men to be generous, the miser is angry; if he exacts
   parsimony, the prodigal curses. The wicked consider the sacred speeches
   their enemies; robbers shudder at what is written about justice, the
   proud at precepts of humility; the drunken oppose the request for
   sobriety and the shameless the command of chastity. So we must either
   say nothing, or expect that whatever is said will displease one man or
   another. Any wicked man would rather execrate the law than amend his
   character; he would rather hate precepts than vices.

   Meanwhile, what do those men do who have been given by Christ the duty
   of speaking? They displease God if they are silent, men if they speak.
   But, as the apostles said to the Jews, it is better to obey God than
   man. This is the advice I offer to all to whom the law of God seems
   heavy and onerous, even if they do not entirely refuse to receive it,
   in order that those things may please them, which God ordains. All who
   hate the sacred commandments have the cause of their hatred within
   themselves. Every man's dislike of the law is due not to its precepts,
   but to his own life; the law indeed is good, but his habits are bad. So
   men should change their attitude and their point of view. If they make
   their habits worthy of approbation, nothing that the good law enjoins
   will displease them. For when a man has begun to be good, he cannot
   fail to love the law of God, which has within it that which holy men
   have in their lives. [33]

   [27] Brakman suggests reading Pro reorum merito satisfactionis librum
   unum, which seems textually reasonable. He interprets this title as
   meaning a "book teaching how praiseworthy are sinners who atone for
   their sins to the satisfaction of God." Gennadius' account of Cassian's
   works contains one De satisfactione paenitentiae, which is a simpler
   statement of the same subject. Mnemosyne, LII (1924), p. 181.

IV. On The Government of God

   The work on which for us the real interest of Salvian's life and
   thought depends, is that which Gennadius cited as five books On the
   Present Judgment, but which the manuscripts offer us as eight books On
   the Government of God. In this treatise Salvian discusses the defeat of
   Litorius in A.D. 439, but fails to mention the Vandal sack of Rome in
   455, which must have profoundly impressed him. In view of the
   description he gives of the Vandal capture of Carthage, he would
   scarcely have omitted their raid on Rome. So we may reasonably suppose
   that the book was published between A.D. 439 and 455. We may probably
   limit the period somewhat more by the assumption that the great battle
   between the Romans and the Huns would have been mentioned if the
   treatise had been finished after 451. The argument from silence is less
   dangerous in this instance, because of the general inclusiveness of
   Salvian's allusions to contemporary matters germane to his purpose, as
   these great events certainly would have been. Whatever the date of
   publication, the book is the mature product of some years of preaching.

   It is evident that only the third and fifth books mark distinct
   developments in the argument. Some claim that elsewhere the division
   into books is purely arbitrary and does not betray any set intention on
   the part of the author. Since Gennadius speaks of five, and not eight
   books it has been assumed that a new division was made, perhaps as a
   matter of scribal convenience, after Gennadius wrote. Brakman, however,
   suggested with some plausibility that Gennadius may actually have
   written VIII, and a scribe mis-copied the letters as IIIII, which would
   be a natural error, if the V were imperfect. And the length of the
   individual books varies too much for a purely arbitrary division,
   whereas some case can be made out for the logic of the present
   arrangement. [34]

   For the modern reader the chief interest of Salvian's work lies in the
   description of the life of the times in his later books. The careful
   building up of the evidence of the sacred authorities for God's
   judgment of the world seems tedious and repetitious. We are inclined to
   rebel at the constant reference to authority in the first three books.
   It is not unnatural to prefer the Old Testament itself to Salvian's
   reworking of the same themes with abundance of quotation. The cento is
   no longer a favored literary form, and overabundant quotation, at least
   when openly acknowledged, is out of favor. Few of us are likely to be
   in the position of the men of the fifth century who found it difficult
   to choose among various poor renderings of the Old Testament, since
   Jerome's version was just beginning to make its way into Gaul, or to
   procure a complete copy even if the initial obstacle of choice were
   overcome. The reader who wishes his interest readily aroused, who would
   read the past in the light of his own experience, had best begin with
   the fourth book. A generation ago it would have been natural to remark
   that in Salvian's tract for his own times in these later books there is
   much that might be applied with little change to our own day. Such a
   statement would be no less true now, were it the present custom of
   historians to study past records as a source of moral examples for the
   current age.

   But to avoid the risk of tedium by omitting the first three books is to
   lose much of the essence of the work, and of the fifth-century manner
   of thought. Salvian wrote not for us, but for his contemporaries.
   Historically, therefore, it is of value to note how he built up his
   demonstration of a fundamental principle--God's constant government and
   immediate judgment of his people. Not only pagans, but men who called
   themselves Christians, were led by a faulty reading of their times to
   question this tenet of the Christian faith. The Christians must be made
   to realize that such doubts were directly contradictory to the
   testimony of the Bible on which their faith rested. Hence the full
   evidence of the Scriptures was brought into court before the witness of
   contemporary life was summoned. It is futile to say that Salvian was
   merely attempting to prove God's judgment by reiterating his statement
   that God constantly sees and judges his people, or, as some put it,
   that he cites the authority of the Scriptures in support of that
   authority. There is no indication that his opponents had questioned the
   authority of the Biblical narrative. They had, indeed, questioned a
   fundamental doctrine of Christianity, having what would appear to be
   good reason for such doubts in the distress into which they, though a
   Christian people, had fallen. The validity of their estimate of God's
   injustice to themselves was a secondary matter to Salvian. The first
   necessity was to remind them that their doubts as to God's complete and
   immediate justice in the governance of the world were constantly
   disproved by the scriptural authority. Since they had shown themselves
   either ignorant or forgetful of the evidence of the Bible on this
   subject, it must be recapitulated for them. The foundation thus laid,
   they would be in a fit frame of mind to consider how the apparent
   injustice of their present misfortunes might be squared with the
   unvarying justice of the God they worshipped. We are too apt to forget
   that his words were addressed not to pagans or heretics but to orthodox
   Christians, For these the first essential was fulness of understanding
   of their own faith: its application to their transitory circumstances
   was secondary. To many of its first readers the latter part of the work
   may have seemed an irrelevant anticlimax to the real argument, since it
   depended less closely on scriptural authority for its substance and
   Lactantius for its structure, and dealt with matters of ephemeral
   interest.

   Like Augustine, Salvian was distressed by the "false opinion held by
   many" in his time, that the contrast between the poverty and captivity
   of the Christian Roman Empire and the prosperous domination of pagan
   Rome proved that God neither cared for the world he had created nor
   governed and judged it, except by a judgment too far in the future to
   afford any present satisfaction to the just or fear to the wicked. Such
   attacks on Christianity Augustine had answered by his contrast, a
   generation earlier, between the ephemeral city of this world and the
   eternal City of God. Another portion of his answer had been assigned to
   Orosius, who undertook in his History against the Pagans to prove that
   the evils into which the Christian Roman Empire had fallen were less
   than those of past and pagan generations. He even dared to remind his
   readers that the most glorious conquests of Rome had afforded far
   greater misery, disgrace and suffering to her defeated enemies than the
   Romans themselves now suffered, and to prophesy that those who now
   seemed barbarous destroyers of a mighty empire would some day be
   honored as heroes of the nations they were founding. Orosius'
   minimizing of Rome's dangers was possible, though somewhat fantastic,
   even after the Gothic sack of the city in A.D. 410. When Salvian wrote
   such an attitude was no longer reasonable. Orosius had prophesied that
   new nations would take the place of Rome; Salvian, while he conceived
   the Empire as still the great cohesive force in the western world, saw
   the Teutonic nations settled within its former borders. Goths, Vandals,
   Burgundians and Franks had established their own kingdoms, and if any
   of them lost ground, it was not because of the superiority of the
   Romans, but of the other barbarians. Rome had long tried to suppress
   the peasants' revolt of the Bagaudae, but without lasting success, and
   this situation was rendered the more serious by the fact that the cause
   of the rebellion was oppressive taxation for which no workable remedy
   was found. Britain was cut off from Rome by Saxon raids and by her own
   dissensions. The Vandals were in possession of the former province of
   Africa, the granary of Rome and the great center of Christian teaching.
   Salvian's debt to Tertullian, Cyprian, Lactantius and Augustine was so
   great that he recalled with difficulty that many of his readers thought
   the home of these Fathers remote from them, and were little concerned
   in its ruin. [35]

   Salvian's own home in the Rhineland had been several times ravaged by
   the Franks. The success of Aetius in checking disintegration during the
   years of his leadership seemed due in no small part to his shrewdness
   in alliances and his discretion in granting favorable terms to the
   Goths and Vandals for security against an aggression with which he
   might not be able to cope directly. His success was more than once
   endangered by the lack of prudence and coöperation among his
   subordinates. [36]

   Rome herself opened her gates to fur-clad satellites,
   And was captive ere her capture. [37]

   Everywhere the growing disproportion between the expenses and the
   income of the Empire led to taxation that would have been heavy under
   the most favorable circumstances. With the opportunities for privilege
   and graft that the nobles in the imperial hierarchy could always find,
   against which the more lowly could only struggle impotently, this
   became unendurable. Salvian's picture of the times does not stand alone
   : it is gloomy in comparison with that of Sidonius Apollinaris in his
   letters, and yet Sidonius gives ample evidence to confirm much of
   Salvian's detail. It is more gloomy than that of Ausonius in his
   verses, but a man who had resigned all that he had to seek God's peace,
   could hardly be expected to find the continuance of the elegant
   pleasures of society in southern Gaul a cause for light-heartedness. It
   must be remembered also that matters had improved somewhat, though
   temporarily, in the generation between Salvian's book and the letters
   of Sidonius. [38]

   Salvian's sympathies for the poor and oppressed were very great, the
   greater because he had himself become poor, though oppression could not
   touch him personally in any respect for which he now cared. From his
   new point of view, the good men in the upper orders at Rome were too
   few to count. The best of those who still lived in the world were very
   far from following the teachings of Christ. That poor men and slaves
   might be quite as wicked as the rich, if a sudden access of fortune
   made it possible, did not alter the reality of the oppression they
   suffered. That lack of a sturdy middle class, the importance of which
   during the period of decline of the Roman power Rostovtzeff has so
   vividly emphasized, is abundantly illustrated in Salvian's curious
   picture of the society of his time.

   He undertook, at a time when the task was as difficult as at any period
   of the world's history, to justify the ways of God to man, to prove his
   constant government of the world and his immediate judgment. This
   involved the proof not only that the orthodox Romans deserved their
   misfortunes, but that the pagan and heretic barbarians merited their
   successes. It required also a satisfactory answer to the question why
   God had treated the Romans better when they were pagans than he did now
   that they were Christians. The latter question is never actually taken
   up, though Salvian promised at the beginning of the seventh book to
   answer it at the end of his work, if God should permit. But the end is
   missing.

   It is inappropriate to judge the proofs that Salvian gives of the just
   judgment of God in the light of rational argument or historical
   criticism. He himself carefully denned his audience; his words were
   addressed to Christian Romans, not to pagans, heretics or barbarians.
   "For if I am addressing Christians, I do not doubt that I shall prove
   my case. But if I speak to pagans, I should scorn the attempt, not for
   any shortage of proofs, but because I despair of any profit in my
   discourse. Surely it is fruitless and lost labor, when a perverted
   listener is not open to conviction." [40]

   Christianity and rationalism were to him inconsistent and mutually
   exclusive terms: "I am a man, I do not understand the secrets of God."
   [41] If his arguments seem at times to form a vicious circle, it is
   because he inevitably assumed as his basis the very points he was
   attempting to demonstrate. The great fact of the world, recognized by
   pagan philosophers and Christian theologians alike, was that God
   constantly governed and judged it; Lactantius had worked out
   philosophical and theological proofs of this in his Divine
   Institutions. Salvian deliberately adopted the groundwork furnished by
   his predecessor and made his indebtedness evident after the classical
   manner by direct though unacknowledged quotations. He was undertaking
   to reassure the Christian, not to instruct and convert the heathen or
   heretic; to enable the Christian to adjust his views of himself and of
   God to the dispensation under which he lived, and to effect such
   personal reformation as would take away the necessity of future
   punishment. [42]

   The first two books formed the foundation for the whole, following
   Lactantius closely in form and drawing most of their non-Biblical
   citations from him. This preliminary portion of the work is largely
   homiletic in character, demonstrating the government and judgment of
   God by examples drawn from the earlier books of the Old Testament, and
   by "testimonies" from the Bible as a whole. In the third book Salvian
   definitely undertook to answer the question "why we Christians, who
   believe in God, are more wretched than all other men." The answer in
   various forms occupied the rest of his work, which became more and more
   a study of contemporary society and events as he proceeded. For he saw
   the calamities and disasters of the world as God's judgments on the
   gross immorality of the Roman people. Not only were the triumphant
   barbarians less wicked than the Romans, but, being either pagans or
   heretics, they deserved indulgence for sins committed in ignorance, not
   in full knowledge of the Christian law. As Matter ably pointed out,
   Salvian's indictment of the Christians furnished plentiful material to
   the pagans for attacks on Christianity, [43] but Salvian might have
   countered that it was not the accusation but the crime that made such
   attacks possible. His ideal was that of ascetic Christianity, of
   poverty in this life for the sake of eternal salvation, but he was not
   one of those who looked for a speedy ending of the world, and the
   coming of the last judgment. He saw a continuing world, which God's
   immediate and constant judgment no longer suffered to continue as it
   had when the Empire was intact, in which a new and potentially better
   regime was gradually being formed. Among the ancient Romans to whom
   "everything unknown seemed glorious" it was an old tradition that
   barbarians were freer of vice than civilized men. If Salvian at times
   seems to exaggerate this view, he had some support not only in the
   readiness with which men in conquered territory adapted themselves to a
   regime less oppressive than the old, but also in the actual flight of
   many Romans to barbarian protection from the demands of Roman fiscal
   agents. He was not alone in feeling that there were compensations in
   the partial breakdown of the old system. Paulinus of Pella had been one
   of the luxurious, self-centered Aquitanians of the type that Salvian
   accused; his lapses from virtue were considerable, though not such as
   to occasion censure among his peers. When his great estates were lost
   and he was living in comparative poverty and full repentance, he wrote
   his autobiography in verse as a thanksgiving for God's mercies to him.
   [44] A like attitude is found in the poem of a husband to his wife, and
   also in a song on the divine providence, both formerly attributed to
   Prosper of Aquitaine. [45] Salvian was trying to bring others to a
   similar frame of mind.

   Augustine had employed the same argument in his Sermo de tempore
   barbarico, a brief homily very closely akin to Salvian's book, and with
   the same conclusion: the calamities of the world were due to the wrath
   of God, warning us that we should not neglect atonement for our sins.
   The theme is not infrequent elsewhere.

   In his books Against Avarice Salvian dwelt constantly on the need of
   repentance and charity because of the imminent danger of death: in his
   treatise On the Government of God he was concerned instead with the
   amendment and reformation necessary for continued life. Of one thing he
   is sure, that the true Christian cannot be wretched, and therefore a
   fuller Christianity is the only real solution of the problem. His
   arguments are by no means free from inconsistencies of detail. On one
   occasion, for example, slaves are described as generally better than
   their masters, while on another we learn that the best masters usually
   have bad slaves. But there is no inconsistency in the fundamental
   thesis.

   The violence of his feeling made him no respecter of persons; in spite
   of his avowed desire to consider the priests of God as above reproach,
   he is so bitter in his denunciations of wickedness within the church
   that Bellarmine said of him: "His exaggeration of the vices of
   Christians and especially of the clergy of his time would seem
   excessive, did his words not proceed from true zeal for the glory of
   God and the salvation of souls." [46] And Guillon found the indictment
   of the church in the ninth chapter of the third book so violent that he
   could scarcely bring himself to transcribe it, and finally effected a
   compromise between loyalty to his church and his scholarly conscience
   by copying the translation of Père Bonnet, and so gaining his pious
   sanction for the overbold words. [47]

   Salvian's irony is very marked, especially in the treatise Against
   Avarice. The abbé de la Rue, in one of his Lenten sermons, followed a
   quotation from Saivian by the words: "Voilà l'ironie de Salvien, mais
   discrète et charitable." [48] Salvian's friends, however, probably
   feared that it lacked discretion, and those against whom it was turned
   very likely felt it weak in charity; but it was seldom bitter. It is
   not inappropriate that the last sentence of the treatise On the
   Government of God that has come down to us displays an irony so
   pronounced that recent editors have destroyed it by inserting a
   negative. [49]

   [42] Bury, in his appendix to Gibbon (The Decline and Fall of the Roman

   are concerned, there is nothing to add to Gibbon's criticism (ch. xxxv,
   note 12) that Salvian has attempted to explain the moral government of
   the Deity; a task which may be readily performed by supposing that the
   calamities of the wicked are judgments, and those of the righteous
   trials.' "I cannot feel that this is a true summary of the case.
   Granted that Salvian wrote in complete acceptance of the Christian
   faith and of scriptural authority, he has accomplished his purpose very
   definitely; that we may not be convinced by the same means may be our
   loss or our gain, according to the point of view, but can hardly affect
   his success; it would seem likely that his discussion had a favorable
   effect in encouraging those for whom it was written. A full discussion
   of Salvian's theology will be found in G. Bruni, Un apologista della
   Provvidenza (Rome, 1925).

V. Style and Latinity

   Salvian's style justifies the praise of Gennadius. While it is not
   altogether free from the faults of the rhetorical taste of his time, it
   is never obscure and rarely overburdened. In his preface he stressed
   the importance of subject matter as compared with style, and declared
   that his work was meant to be salutary rather than eloquent. This
   emphasis on content rather than form did not produce crudeness but
   served in general as a controlling element against the excesses of the
   rhetorician. He is fond of antithesis, of figures of speech and series
   of balanced phrases; he has a marked predilection for alliteration,
   assonance and rhyme, fostered by his love of plays on words. [50] His
   great fault is a wearisome repetition, a failing, however, that arises
   not so much from carelessness in style as from anxiety to hammer a
   point home. He runs out of words for his reiteration of a theme, and
   uses the same one till they are worn threadbare, yet this is a relief
   from the artificially varied phrases which the letter writers of his
   time would substitute. Indeed, his own letters are far more artificial
   than his other works. He was conscious of his wordiness, which may have
   been partly due to his preaching, and he speaks more than once of his
   fear that the prolixity of his style may arouse distaste in his
   readers. [51] It is at least, as Gregoire remarked, sufficient to
   terrify the most intrepid of translators, yet Joseph Scaliger could
   rightly exclaim of Salvian's work: "Le beau livre que c'est, et une
   belle simplicity!" [52]

   Salvian's vocabulary was the source of much discussion among the
   earlier editors. Having in their introduction lauded him as a second
   Demosthenes or Cicero, and explored the history of rhetoric for phrases
   in his honor, they found themselves compelled, when they turned from
   the general to the particular, to account for his use of words which
   Cicero had never employed. Eventually they explained the considerable
   number of late Latin words by the influence of his subject and of his
   many Biblical quotations. Most of the late Latin and ecclesiastical
   words in his vocabulary are found also in Tertullian, Lactantius,
   Hilarius, Cyprian and Sidonius Apollinaris; others reflect the language
   of the jurists. In common with the other writers of his day, he shows a
   noticeable but not excessive fluidity of word formation, a fondness for
   negative adjectives and for diminutives, the latter usually to give a
   sense of humility or of sympathy and pity. A few of them are rather
   sesquipedalian formations, as the excusatiuncula and deprecatiuncula of
   the second chapter of the third book Against Avarice.

   A recent thorough study of his use of moods and tenses resulted in the
   conclusion that, in spite of frequent departures from the pure
   classical norm, Salvian cannot be accused of negligence or lack of
   skill; that he followed fixed rules, though not always those of the
   best classical Latinity. [53]

   A very large proportion of his material is drawn from the Bible or from
   his own and contemporary experience. Aside from his direct and purposed
   use of Lactantius in the first two books [54] and from natural
   reminiscences of both Lactantius and Tertullian when writing of a
   subject which they had considered from the same point of view as his
   (e.g., on the games), he seems deliberately to avoid obvious citations
   and quotations other than those from the Bible. Yet there is ample
   evidence that his memory was well stocked with pagan and earlier
   patristic literature. His reticence in quotation from secular authors
   is distinctly at variance with the habit of his times, and corresponds
   to his general strictures on the rhetorical ideal of literary
   composition. He cites Vergil and Cicero as the authors of quotations
   only when the latter are drawn from Lactantius, although elsewhere
   there are clear reminiscences of both. His acquaintance with the works
   of Seneca is indicated by several passages in which the resemblance
   between the thought and ideas of the two authors is unusually striking.
   Rittershausen cites parallels from Minucius Felix almost as often as
   from Seneca, but for most of these equally close parallels may be found
   in Lactantius, so that no other source need be considered. The obvious
   extent of Salvian's education makes it an unnecessary strain on one's
   credulity to believe with some commentators that all the similarities
   to known passages in the works of pagan authors are due to chance, and
   none to his personal knowledge of the books concerned.

   The result of his method of allusion is very satisfactory; classical
   reminiscences are readily apparent to the reader with a well stocked
   mind, but do not intrude themselves on the less informed, to distract
   his attention from the argument. Nor was there any risk of seeming to
   set pagan writers on a level with biblical authority. The frequent
   biblical quotations are drawn most commonly from the old Itala
   versions, but Salvian also used the translation of Jerome occasionally;
   indeed, with his friend Eucherius he was among the first of the
   Christian writers in Gaul to employ the new text. [55] His citations
   are rather loose, and where the same passage is quoted more than once,
   there are sometimes variations in the wording. The translation of his
   numerous biblical quotations presents some difficulty. It is, of
   course, natural and almost inevitable to use the familiar and beautiful
   text of the King James Version, and in general I have done this, even
   in some cases where Salvian's wording might suggest a slightly
   different rendering. In several passages, however, either marked
   differences between Salvian's text of the Bible and that on which the
   King James Version is based, or his rather free adaptations of the text
   to its setting in his argument, have required corresponding changes in
   the English rendering.

VI. The Editions of Salvian's Works

   Schoenemann distinguished three ages in the editions of Salvian; [56]
   the first, from 1528 to 1580, is that in which the two major works were
   published. The treatise Against Avarice was issued by Sichardus at Fol
   near Basle in 1528: two years later Brassicanus published in the same
   city his editio princeps of the books On the Government of God, based
   apparently on the extant Vienna manuscript of the fifteenth century (MS
   Vindobonensis 826). The next period, from 1580 to 1663, was dominated
   by the editions of Pierre Pithou, the first of which, published at
   Paris in 1580, was so much in demand that it soon came, as Baluze said,
   to have almost the rarity of a manuscript. This was the more
   unfortunate, as the several reprints were inferior. [57] In 1611 Conrad
   Rittershausen published an edition at Altdorf, with far more copious
   notes than those of previous editors. He seems to have been the first
   to find much space for commentary on other points than the
   establishment of the text, and included literary and juristic
   references of considerable interest and value. His edition, however,
   was little used outside of Germany.

   In the third period, as Schoenemann says, solus regnat Baluzius.
   Stephen Baluze published his first edition of Salvian's works together
   with the Commonitorium of Vincent of Lérins in 1663, and this rapidly
   superseded the earlier editions. Using the tenth century manuscript of
   Corbie (Paris, Bibl. Nat. MS Lat. 13385), by far the best of existing
   manuscripts, he was able to construct a text superior to any previously
   published. The commentary of Baluze has formed the basis, often
   unacknowledged, of many notes on Salvian since, a source of information
   which one could not afford to overlook. His work is chiefly cited now
   in the fourth edition, published in 1742 at Stadtamhof.

   Here end Schoenemann's three ages; but as far as the text is concerned,
   Baluze has been dethroned in our present age, first by Halm in 1877 and
   then by Pauly in 1883. [58] Since notes in these modern editions are
   limited to the apparatus criticus, Baluze still reigns in the field of
   commentary. Meanwhile, from the sixteenth century to the early
   nineteenth, there have been numerous lesser editions, frequently
   pirated from those more famous. [59]

   [57] Yet such is the infrequency of the present demand for editions of
   Salvian, that Pithou's original edition could be had recently at a
   lower price than obscure editions with better bindings.

   I have used Pauly's text throughout, except for occasional emendations
   proposed by H. K. Messenger, De temporum et modorum apud Salvianum usu.

   [59] For additions to the editions cited above, see G. Bruni, Un
   apologista della Provvidenza (Rome, 1925), 68-79, or Schoenemann, op.
   cit., pp. 825-833, reprinted in Migne, PL, LIII, cols. 13-24. For
   translations see also Ceillier, Histoire générale des auteurs sacrés,
   XV (Paris, 1748), p. 81, and Gregoire et Collombet, Introd. pp.
   lxiii-lxvii. The most useful of the translations are: S. Carlo
   Borromeo, Libro di Salviano Vescovo di Marsiglia contra gli Spettacoli
   ed altre Vanità del Mondo, Milan, 1579; Père Bonnet, Nouvelle
   Traduction des Oeuvres de Salvien, et du Traité de Vincent de Lérins
   contre les Hérésies, Paris, 1700; P. P. Grégoire et F. Z. Collombet,
   Oeuvres de Salvien, Paris, 1833; A. Helf, Des Salvianus acht Bücher
   über die göttliche Regierung, Kempten, 1877. In English, a part of the
   sixth book appeared in 1580 as "a second blast of retrait from places
   and theaters"; a translation of the whole work which I have been unable
   to consult, was published at London in 1700.

VII. Estimates of Salvian's Work

   When Brassicanus published his first edition of Salvian's treatise On
   the Government of God, he found ready applause for his achievement in
   rescuing so great a work from the dust and spider webs of a thousand
   years; the occasion was a fitting one for those odes which his
   contemporaries so loved to write. Perhaps his romantic tale of the
   manuscripts he had found at Buda in the library of his friend Matthew
   Corvinus, king of Bohemia, just before its destruction by the Turks,
   absorbed his friends' interest so far that they forgot the scribes who
   had made this edition possible by their earlier copies of the book.
   While we have no other evidence for the reading of Salvian's books
   between the date of Gennadius' account, which seems to be the source of
   the scanty later mentions, and Sichardus' publication of Against
   Avarice in 1528, the manuscripts lend their testimony that copies were
   made, corrected, and presumably read, in the tenth century, and in the
   twelfth, thirteenth and fifteenth as well. The scholars of the
   sixteenth century were not unlike some of our own days in considering
   those ages dark of which they knew little.

   Once printed, however, Salvian's works enjoyed great popularity.
   Jurists, including Sirmond, Cujas, Godefroi and Rittershausen, whose
   notes on Salvian are packed with legal references, consulted his books
   and cited them extensively in their studies of the Roman codes. The
   French clergy during four centuries found that he furnished material so
   appropriate to the personal vices and social disorders of their own
   times that they emulated the earlier bishops of Gaul in preaching
   Salvian's sermons instead of writing their own. [60] When Bossuet
   called him "le saint et éloquent prêtre de Marseille" his clerical
   readers must have assented with due gratitude. A German translator also
   praises his usefulness for the clergy in furnishing them so rich a
   source of Schönheiten and practical suggestions, that they should never
   let his works leave their hands. [61] Historians found his work of
   great value, especially when the current interpretation of history was
   most sympathetic to his constant reiteration: "It is only our vicious
   lives that have conquered us." So Johannes Jovianus Pontanus pointed
   out Salvian's special distinction in that, while writing of Christ and
   Christian topics, he had yet joined with these "very many histories and
   events of his own age, and commented sagely on them in the course of
   his account." [62] Zschimmer cites a long list of historians who have
   made extensive use of him; of these Guizot and Gibbon are the best
   known to us now, but many not named by Zschimmer would need to be added
   to bring the list up-to-date. [63] Indeed of late years Salvian seems
   to have been cited more than read. It is difficult to find a history of
   the period that does not refer to him, or a source book of ancient or
   medieval history that does not quote at least one of half-a-dozen
   famous passages, but the text itself is little read.

   That this neglect has been a distinct loss to students of the later
   days of the Roman power in the west, will, I trust, be apparent even to
   those who make their acquaintance with Salvian through the medium of a
   translation. Since, however, a study of his works inevitably engenders
   the habit of reference to "authority," I shall not leave our author
   without this support. Know, then, that Pierre Pithou called Salvian "a
   most excellent author," Joseph Scaliger named him "the most Christian
   writer." Rittershausen, one of the most enthusiastic of editors,
   considered his opinions not only wholesome and holy, [64] but fully
   apostolic, and judged, therefore, that Salvian should be deemed master
   not only of bishops, but of the whole Christian world as well.

   Saurin, Cheminais, de la Rue and others as having made extensive use of
   Salvian. Grégoire and Collombet in their notes cite long passages from
   the sermons of de la Rue which are taken bodily from Salvian's works.
   Indeed, Guillon says he "has transported them almost entire into his
   sermons" (p. 143).

PREFACE

  To the holy bishop Salonius, Salvian sends greeting
  in the Lord

   Practically all men who have chosen some form of literary composition
   as a fitting expression of their native genius have taken especial
   pains, whether they were writing of useful and worthy matters, or of
   useless and unworthy, to lighten the order of their discourse by the
   brilliance of their language and to illumine by their style the
   questions under discussion. It is to style therefore that the majority
   of writers on secular topics, whether in prose or verse, have paid most
   attention, not considering sufficiently the necessity of choosing
   subjects worthy of approbation, provided that whatever they said was
   either chanted in smooth and elegant verse, or narrated in
   distinguished prose. [65]

   These authors have sought their own ends, and looking toward their
   individual praise rather than the benefit of others have not tried to
   be considered salutary and helpful, but rhetorical and eloquent.
   Therefore their writings are swollen with vanity, infamous for their
   falsehood, smeared with filth, or vicious because of their obscene
   subjects. Trafficking in such unworthy fashion to purchase praise for
   ingenuity seems to me less a glorification than a condemnation of one's
   genius. Since we, on the other hand, are lovers of deeds rather than
   words, [66] we seek utility rather than applause.

   It is not, then, for vain and worldly adornments that we solicit
   praise, but for salutary prescriptions. Our writings, trifling though
   they are, shall present no vain lures but actual remedies, calculated
   not to please idle ears but to benefit the minds of the sick. So do we
   hope to gain our full reward from heaven.

   Now if this healing grace of ours cures the unfavorable opinion of our
   God held by certain men, it will be no small reward that I have thus
   aided many. But if no such benefit accrues, the very fact that I have
   tried to be of service may not be unfruitful. For a mind devoted to a
   good work and a charitable aim, though it has not achieved full success
   in its undertaking, is still rewarded for its good intent. At this
   point then I shall begin.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] As is usually the case with writers trained in the later Roman
   rhetorical schools, Salvian's disclaimer of any interest in rhetorical
   style leads him to use an elaborate phraseology in his preface,
   somewhat at variance with his usual simpler and more colloquial style.

   [66] See Seneca De tranquillitate vitae I. 1, and IV. 1, infra. In
   these notes, references without title are to Salvian, De gubernatione
   Dei (On the Government of God): Ad ecclesiamrefers to the treatise To
   the Church against Avarice; Ep. to the Letters.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE FIRST BOOK

   1. By certain men God is said to be careless and neglectful of human
   actions, on the ground that he neither protects good men nor restrains
   the wicked; and they claim that this is why at the present time the
   good are generally wretched and the wicked happy. Since we are dealing
   with Christians the Holy Scriptures alone should be sufficient to
   refute this charge. The many who are still somewhat infected by pagan
   unbelief may perhaps be convinced by the testimony of the greatest
   pagan philosophers. Let us, then, prove that not even these men had any
   conception of a God careless and neglectful of the world, though they
   had no means of really knowing God, since they were outside the true
   faith and were ignorant of the law through which he is apprehended.

   Pythagoras the philosopher, whom Philosophy herself regarded as her
   master, said in his discourse on the nature and beneficent works of
   God: "The Soul moves to and fro and is diffused through all parts of
   the world, and from it all living creatures receive their life. . . ."
   [67]

   How then can God be said to neglect the world for which he so far shows
   his love that he extends his own being through its whole mass? Plato
   and all the Platonic school confess that God is the controller of all
   things. The Stoics testify that he remains always as steersman within
   that which he guides. What truer or more religious conception could
   they have had of the loving care of God than this comparison with a
   helmsman? For they clearly understood that as the helmsman never takes
   his hand from the tiller, so God never in the slightest degree
   withdraws his care from the world; and as the pilot catching the
   breezes, avoiding rocks, watching the stars, is completely absorbed,
   body and soul, in his task, so our God never turns his most gracious
   eyes from the whole extent of the world, nor takes away the guiding
   power of his providence, nor removes the indulgence of his most kindly
   love. Whence comes also that ancient mystic saying by which Maro wished
   to prove himself no less philosopher than poet: "For God makes his way
   through all lands and the paths of the sea and the high heavens." [68]
   Tully also says: "Nor indeed can God himself, who is known by us, be
   known in any other way than as a mind loosed and free and separated
   from all mortal matter, understanding all things and moving them." [69]
   Elsewhere he states that nothing is more immediately present than God;
   [70] by him the world is necessarily ruled. God, therefore, is neither
   subject nor obedient to any natural force; he himself rules all nature.
   Unless forsooth we are led by our great wisdom to believe that he, by
   whom we say all things are ruled, at the same time both rules and
   neglects them! Since even men outside our faith have been compelled by
   sheer necessity to say that all things are known by God and are moved
   and ruled by him, how is it that some now think him careless and
   neglectful of the world? Is it not he who comprehends all creation by
   the fineness of his perception, moves it by his strength, rules it by
   his power, and protects it by his kindness?

   I have told you what men preeminent alike in philosophy and eloquence
   have thought of the majesty and government of the most high God.
   Moreover, I have cited the noblest masters of both these supreme arts
   expressly to facilitate my proof that all others have either agreed,
   or, if they have disagreed, have done so without any authority. And, in
   fact, I can find none who have differed from this judgment, except for
   the delirious ravings of the Epicureans and certain of their imitators.
   [71] These last have associated God with carelessness and sloth, just
   as they have linked pleasure with virtue--so it appears that those who
   entertain this idea are likely to follow the vices of the Epicureans
   along with their opinion and doctrine.

   2. I do not think that we need also use the divine word to prove so
   obvious a case, especially since the sacred writings furnish such
   abundant and open refutation of all the claims of ungodly men that, in
   meeting those of their vile charges which follow, we shall be able to
   refute more fully those already mentioned. They say that God neglects
   us entirely, since he neither restrains the wicked nor protects the
   good, and therefore in this world the condition of the better men is
   substantially the worse. They contrast the poverty of good men with the
   wealth of the wicked, their weakness with the strength of the wicked,
   their constant grief with the others' perpetual joy, their misery and
   mean estate with the honors and prosperity of sinners.

   I wish at the outset to ask those who mourn this state of affairs, or
   base their accusations on it, this one question: is their grief for the
   saints, that is, the true and faithful Christians, or for the false
   impostors? If for the false, it is a needless grief that mourns for the
   unhappiness of the wicked, since, to be sure, all evil men are made
   worse by success in their undertakings, and rejoice at the lucky turn
   of their folly. Yet they ought to be most wretched in order that they
   may cease to be wicked, that they may cease to apply the name of
   religion to their most evil gains and to bestow the title of sanctity
   on their sordid traffickings; in such a case, indeed, a comparison of
   the misfortunes of sinners with their misdeeds shows that they are less
   unfortunate than they deserve, for the utmost misfortunes they can
   suffer leave them still less wretched than they are wicked. It is
   foolish to grieve for their lack of wealth and happiness. Far less
   should we lament in the case of the saints, for however unhappy they
   may seem to men who do not understand their condition, it is impossible
   for them to be otherwise than happy. Moreover, it is superfluous to
   think them wretched because of sickness or poverty or any like
   misfortune, in the midst of which they count themselves happy; for no
   man is wretched because of other men's judgment, but only in his own.
   [72]

   So those who are truly happy in their own estimation cannot be unhappy
   through the false conception of any man; for none, I think, are more
   fortunate than those who live and act according to their own
   determination and vows. Religious men are lowly--they wish to be so;
   poor--they delight in poverty; without ambition--they spurn it;
   unesteemed--they flee from honors; they mourn--but they seek out
   occasion for mourning; they are weak--nay, they rejoice in weakness.
   For the apostle said, "When I am weak, then am I strong." [73] Nor was
   this opinion held undeservedly by the man to whom God himself spoke
   thus: "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect
   in weakness." [74]

   It is useless for us to bemoan this affliction of bodily illness, which
   we know is the mother of strength. Therefore, whatever their sorrows
   may have been, any who are truly religious should be called happy,
   since amid any hardships or difficulties whatsoever none are happier
   than those who are what they wish to be. Although we all know
   individuals whose aims are vile and shameful, who think themselves
   happy in gaining their desires, yet in actual fact such men are not
   happy, because they ought not to desire what they do. Moreover, the
   religious are happier than all others in this, that they have what they
   wish and at the same time cannot possibly wish for anything better than
   they have. [75] So toil, fasting, poverty, humility and weakness are
   not burdensome to all who suffer them but only to those who are
   unwilling to bear them. For the mind of the sufferer determines whether
   his troubles are heavy or light to endure. Just as no task is so light
   that it is not heavy to the man who performs it unwillingly, none is so
   heavy that it does not seem light to him who performs it gladly. [76]

   Or are we perhaps to think that it was a burden to those ancient
   patterns of virtue, the Fabii, Fabricii and Cincinnati, that they, who
   did not wish riches, were poor? [77] Remember that they directed all
   their efforts, all their labor, to the common good, and by their
   individual poverty contributed to the growing wealth of the state.
   Surely you do not think that it was with groans and sadness that they
   endured their famous life of rustic economy, when they ate their cheap
   country fare before the very fire over which they had cooked it, and
   delayed even this poor meal until evening? Did they take it ill that
   they were not piling up talents of gold in the pursuit of miserly
   wealth, when they were passing laws to restrict the circulation even of
   silver? Could men who judged a patrician unworthy of the senate because
   he had wished to increase his wealth to the sum of ten pounds of silver
   possibly think it a penalty for their illicit greed that they had not
   their purses stuffed with gold? [78]

   In those days, I think, men did not despise humble ways of life, when
   they wore only one short and shaggy garment, when they were summoned
   from the plow to the dictator's fasces, and, on the point of winning
   fame in the consular robes, very likely wiped off their dusty sweat on
   those same imperial togas that they were about to don. In their time
   the magistrates were poor, but the state wealthy, whereas now the
   wealth of officials makes the state poor. What madness, I ask you, or
   what blindness, leads men to think that private fortunes can survive in
   the midst of the need and beggary of the state? Such were the ancient
   Romans; so they in their day scorned riches, though they knew not God,
   just as in ours men who follow the Lord still scorn them.

   But why do I speak of those men who in their desire to extend the Roman
   power turned their scorn of private means to the public enrichment, and
   while individually poor still had abundance in the common wealth of the
   state? Even Greek philosophers without any interest in public gain,
   through sheer greed of glory have been known to strip themselves of
   almost all articles of common use, and, not content with this, have
   exalted their creed to the lofty pinnacle of contempt of suffering and
   death, saying that even in chains and punishment a wise man still is
   happy. [79] They would have it that the power of virtue is so great
   that a good man can never fail to be content. If, then, certain wise
   men now think that those men were not unhappy, though they received no
   reward for their efforts but transient praise, how much more must
   religious and saintly men cease to be thought wretched, who both enjoy
   at this present time the delights of their faith, and are to attain as
   well the reward of eternal blessedness?

   3. One of those of whom we complain said to a certain holy man who
   followed the true doctrine, that is, that God rules all things and
   tempers his governance and guidance according to his knowledge of human
   necessities: "Why then, I ask, are you yourself infirm?" His line of
   reasoning, I suppose, was as follows: "if God, as you think, rules
   everything in this present life, if he dispenses all fortunes, then how
   is it that a man whom I know to be a sinner is strong and healthy,
   whereas you, whose sanctity I do not question, are infirm?"

   Who does not marvel at the depth of feeling of one who considers the
   merits and virtues of a godly man worthy of such great recompense that
   he thinks they should be rewarded in this present life by the fleshly
   strength of the body? I answer, therefore, not in the name of any one
   saint but of them all: "Do you ask, then, whoever you are, how it is
   that holy men come to be weak? My answer is brief: they make themselves
   infirm for the express reason that if they are strong, they can hardly
   be holy." [80] I think that men gain strength entirely through their
   food and drink, and are weak through abstinence, thirst and fasting.
   Therefore it is not strange that those are weak who scorn the use of
   the means by which others are made strong. And there is good reason for
   such scorn, according to the words of the apostle Paul, when he said:
   "I keep under my body and bring it into subjection; lest that by any
   means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
   [81] If the apostle himself considered the weakness of the body an end
   to be sought, who acts wisely in avoiding it? If the apostle feared the
   strength of the flesh, who rightly presumes to be strong? This, then,
   is the reason why men who have given themselves over to Christ both are
   and wish to be weak. Far be it from us to think that holy men are
   neglected by God for the very reason for which, we trust, they are the
   more loved by him. We read that the apostle Timothy was most weak in
   the flesh. [82] Was this a sign of God's neglect, or did Timothy
   through his weakness fail to please Christ, willing as he was to be
   weak in order to please him? Even so the apostle Paul, though Timothy
   was suffering from serious infirmities, yet permitted him to take and
   sip only a very little wine; that is, he wished him to have regard for
   his weakness but not so far as to attain full vigor. [83] And why was
   this? What other reason could there be but that which he himself has
   given? "For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit
   against the flesh; and these are contrary," he says, "the one to the
   other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would." [84]

   It was not without insight that a certain author [85] said in this
   connection that if the strength of the body prevents us from doing what
   we wish, the flesh must be weakened in order that we may achieve our
   desires. For he says: "The weakness of our flesh sharpens the vigor of
   the mind, and when our limbs are weakened bodily strength is
   transformed into spiritual virtue. Then our inmost parts no longer
   seethe with disgraceful passions, and secret desires no longer kindle a
   diseased mind; our senses do not roam wantonly over various
   enticements, but the soul alone exults, rejoicing in the weakness of
   the body as over a defeated adversary."

   This, as I said, is the cause to which religious men ascribe their
   infirmities, and you, I think, can no longer deny its validity.

   4. But perhaps they have, you say, other and greater sufferings, that
   is, they endure many hard and bitter trials in this life; they arc
   captured, tortured and butchered. That is true, but what are we to make
   of the fact that the prophets were led away into captivity and that the
   apostles also suffered torments? Surely we cannot doubt that God had
   the greatest concern for them, since it was for God that they bore
   these afflictions. But perhaps you claim this as an additional proof
   that God neglects everything that happens in this life and reserves his
   whole care for the judgment to come, since the good have always
   suffered, as the wicked have performed, all things evil. This idea does
   not seem to be that of an unbeliever, especially as it admits the
   future judgment of God. But we say that the human race is to be judged
   by Christ, while yet maintaining that now also God rules and ordains
   all things in accordance with his reason. While we declare that he will
   judge in the future, we also teach that he always has judged us in this
   life. As God always governs, so too he always judges, for his
   government is itself judgment.

   In how many ways do you wish this proved, by reason, or by examples, or
   by authorities? If you wish it proved by reason, who is so lacking in
   ordinary human intelligence and so utterly averse to the truth of which
   we speak, that he does not recognize and see that the surpassing beauty
   of the created world, the inestimable grandeur of the heavens above and
   of the regions below are ruled by the same power that created them? He
   who devised their elements will himself be their governor. He will
   guide all things by a providence and reason consistent with the
   majestic power by which he founded them. And certainly, since even in
   those matters that are conducted by human activity, absolutely nothing
   exists without reason, and all things derive their security from
   providence, even as the body derives its life from the soul; so in this
   world not only empires and provinces, civil and military affairs, but
   also the lesser offices and private homes, the very sheep and the
   smaller sorts of domestic animals are controlled by no other means than
   human ordinance and wisdom, as by a guiding hand on the tiller. All
   this beyond a doubt is in accordance with the will and judgment of the
   most high God, that the whole human race should govern the lesser
   parts, or limbs of the world, following the example of God's government
   of the whole body of the universe.

   But, you suggest, in the beginning the governance of his creatures was
   so determined and arranged by God; yet after he had formed and
   perfected the whole scheme of things, he abdicated, and renounced the
   administration of earthly matters. I suppose you mean to imply that he
   fled from the idea of toil and repudiated it, that he sought to avoid
   the annoyance of constant effort. Or was it that, occupied with other
   business, he abandoned a part of his affairs, since he could not attend
   to the whole?

   5. God then puts far from himself, you say, all thought of mortal men.
   In that case what rational ground is there for our belief in his
   divinity? What reason is there for worshipping Christ, or what hope of
   winning his favor? For if God in this life neglects the human race, why
   do we daily stretch out our hands toward heaven? Why do we pray so
   often for the mercy of God? Why do we hasten to the churches? Why kneel
   in prayer before the altars? There is no reason for praying if the hope
   of an answer to prayer is taken from us. You see what vain folly lies
   in the urging of this idea; truly, if it is accepted, nothing at all
   remains of our religion. But perhaps you take refuge in the argument
   that we honor God in the fear of a future judgment, and perform all the
   ritual of our daily worship to gain absolution on the judgment day
   hereafter. In that case, what was the meaning of the daily preaching of
   Paul the apostle in the church, and his command that we offer
   constantly to God our prayers, our entreaties, our requests and our
   thanksgivings?

   What is the purpose of all this? What else than, as he himself says,
   "that we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all chastity?" [86] For
   our present needs, as we see, he orders us to pray and beseech the
   Lord. Surely he would not command this if he were not sure that God
   hearkens to prayer. How can any one suppose that the ears of God are
   open for the granting of boons at some future time, but deaf and
   blocked against immediate petitions? Or what leads us when praying in
   the church to ask God for present safety, if we think that he does not
   listen at all to our prayers? In that case we should make no vows for
   our safety and prosperity.

   Perhaps, to the end that the modesty of the request may win favor for
   the voice of the petitioner, we should rather pray thus: "Lord, we do
   not seek prosperity in this life, nor beseech you for immediate favors,
   for we know that your ears are closed to such petitions and that you do
   not listen to such prayers, but we ask only for those favors that shall
   be granted us after our death."

   Granted that such a petition is not without value, on what rational
   basis does it rest? For if God is without interest in this life, and
   closes his ears to the prayers of his suppliants, then doubtless he who
   does not hear our present pleas is deaf also to our prayers for the
   future. Are we to believe that Christ listens or denies his attention
   according to the diverse nature of our prayers, that lie closes his
   ears when we ask for present boons, and opens them when we ask for
   blessings to come? But enough of this. The arguments are so stupid and
   frivolous that one needs to beware lest what is said for the honor of
   God seem injurious to him. For so great and terrible is the reverence
   due to his sacred majesty that we should not only shudder at the
   arguments of our opponents, but should also make our defence of
   religion with due fear and circumspection.

   If, therefore, it is stupid and impious to believe that the divine love
   despises the care of human affairs, then God does not despise it;
   moreover, if he does not scorn it, he governs; if he governs, he judges
   by the very exercise of his government, since there can be no rule
   without the constant exercise of judgment on the part of the ruler.

   6. Perhaps some one may think a proof too insecure that rests on reason
   alone without the support of authority. Let us see how God has ruled
   the world from the beginning; for by demonstrating that he has always
   ruled the universe, we shall prove that he has at the same time
   exercised judgment.

   What is the testimony of the Scriptures? "Therefore God formed man of
   clay and breathed into him the breath of life." And what followed? "He
   placed him in a paradise of pleasure." [87] What next? What else than
   that he gave him law, filled him with his commands, formed him by his
   instruction? But what happened then? Man transgressed the sacred
   ordinance, underwent judgment, lost paradise and suffered the penalty
   of damnation. Who can fail to see God as both governor and judge in
   this whole account? For he placed Adam in paradise in innocence; he
   expelled him in guilt. In Adam's establishment we see the divine
   ordinance; in his expulsion, the divine judgment. For when God set man
   in a place of delight, he ordained his way of life; but when he
   expelled him in guilt from that realm, he exercised judgment. This then
   is the story of the first man, that is, of the father.

   What of the second, the son? "In process of time it came to pass," say
   the Holy Scriptures, "that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an
   offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of
   his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel
   and to his offering: but unto Cain and his offering he had not
   respect." [88]

   Before I speak of the more obvious judgment of God, I think that even
   in the account just given there is a certain indication of judgment;
   for in the act of receiving one brother's sacrifice and rejecting the
   other God gave a most open verdict as to the justice of the one and the
   injustice of the other. But this was not enough. Thereafter Cain paved
   the way for his later crimes by leading his brother into the
   wilderness; in the friendly protection of the desert he committed his
   murder. He proved himself at once the most wicked and most stupid of
   men, since he thought he had sufficient secrecy for the most evil and
   abhorrent act if he avoided the sight of men when about to commit
   fratricide with God as his witness.

   Whence I think he had this same idea that is now so prevalent, that God
   does not behold things done on earth and does not see any of the acts
   of wicked men. Nor is there any doubt of this, since, when he was
   admitted to speech with God after the commission of his crime, he
   answered that he knew nothing of his brother's death. He was so sure of
   God's ignorance of his deed, that he thought the most deadly wrong
   could be hidden by a mere lie.

   But the event proved other than he anticipated. For though he thought
   his fratricide unseen by God, his condemnation taught him that God had
   seen. I now have one question to ask of those who deny that human
   affairs are regarded by God or ruled or judged by him: are all the
   circumstances different in these accounts that we have given? For I
   think that he is present who is concerned in the sacrifice; he rules
   who rebukes Cain after his sacrifice; he is anxious who requires the
   victim of the murderer; he judges who condemns the wicked slayer by a
   just verdict.

   In this incident, indeed, there is yet another point convenient to our
   argument. Surely we are not to wonder that holy men are now suffering
   certain hardships, since we see that God even at that time permitted
   the first of his saints to be most wickedly slain. As to the reason why
   he permits such actions, it is not within the power of human weakness
   to discover fully, nor is this a fit occasion for such discussion. For
   the present it is enough to prove that deeds of this sort do not occur
   because of the negligence or inattention of God, but are permitted by
   the dispensation of his wisdom. Moreover, we can by no means call him
   unjust, for the will of God is the highest justice; nor does a divine
   action cease to be righteous because man is incapable of grasping the
   workings of the divine justice. But let us return to the main argument.

   7. We have seen in the accounts already given that nothing is done
   without the care of God, but that some of these actions were so
   arranged by his divine wisdom, some endured by his forbearance, some
   punished by his sentence. Certain people, perhaps, think that these few
   cases do not sufficiently establish our contention; let us see if we
   can make it completely clear through the experience of all men.

   When, therefore, the human race had increased and multiplied alike in
   numbers and in wickedness, as the Holy Scripture says: "God seeing that
   the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every
   imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually,
   repented that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his
   heart, and he said: I will destroy man whom. I have created, from the
   face of the earth.'" [89]

   Let us consider how both the care of God and his severity are equally
   shown in the whole account. For first we read, "moreover God seeing";
   secondly, "it grieved him at his heart"; and thirdly, "he said, I will
   destroy man whom I have created.'" In the first statement, that God
   sees all things, his care is shown; in the statement that he grieves is
   shown the terror of his wrath; that he punishes, his severity as a
   judge. "God therefore repented," says the Holy Scripture, "that he had
   made man on the earth"; this does not indicate that God is subject to
   repentance or any other emotion, but rather that the divine word, to
   further our understanding of the true meaning of the Scriptures, speaks
   to us in terms of human feeling and shows the force of God's anger
   under the name of repentance; moreover, the divine wrath is the
   punishment of the sinner.

   What followed then? When God saw that the earth was corrupt he said to
   Noah: "The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled
   with violence through them: and behold, I will destroy them with the
   earth." [90] What happened next? "All the fountains of the great deep
   were broken up, and the flood-gates of heaven were opened and the rain
   was upon the earth forty days and forty nights." [91] And a little
   later: "All flesh died that moved upon the earth." And again: "And Noah
   only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark." [92]

   Now I wish to ask those who say that God neglects human fortunes
   whether they believe that at this time he cared for earthly matters and
   judged them? I think he not merely judged but gave a twofold judgment;
   for in preserving the good he proved himself a generous giver of
   rewards, and in destroying the wicked, a severe judge.

   Perhaps these instances may seem to stupid wits to lack authority,
   since they happened before the Flood--in another age, as it were. As if
   we could assume that God was different at that time, and afterwards
   ceased to desire to exercise the same care for the world! Indeed, by
   the divine grace I could prove my statements by examples from all
   generations since the Flood, but their great number forbids. However,
   certain of the more important instances will suffice, for since God is
   undoubtedly the same in the greater and the lesser cases, the lesser
   may be inferred from the greater.

   8. After the Flood God blessed the generation of men, and when this
   blessing had brought forth an immeasurable host of men, God spoke to
   Abraham from heaven, ordering him to leave his own land and go to a
   strange country. He was called, he followed; he was guided and
   established; from a poor man he became rich; from an obscure man,
   powerful. Though reduced by his journeyings to the lowest estate, he
   came to be most high in honor. Yet in order that the previous gifts of
   God to him should not seem undeserved generosity, he who rejoiced in
   prosperity was tested in adversity. Then came toil, danger and fear; he
   was vexed by travelling, worn out by exile, visited with shame, and
   deprived of his wife. God ordered him to sacrifice his son; the father
   offered his child, and so far as the resolution of his heart was
   concerned, performed the sacrifice. Again came periods of exile, again
   fear, the hatred of the Philistines, the rapine of Abimelech--many
   evils, yet compensated by equal consolations, for though he was
   afflicted in many things, yet was he rewarded for them all.

   What conclusion are we to draw? In all the events which we have
   recounted, is not God seen examining Abraham, inviting and leading him,
   anxious for him, his sponsor, protector, benefactor, testing and
   exalting him, at once his avenger and his judge? Surely he examined
   him, for he chose him as the one best man of them all; he invited him,
   for he called him; he was his guide, leading him through in safety to
   unknown lands; anxious for him, for he visited him by the oak tree; his
   sponsor, in promises of things to come; his protector, guarding him
   among barbarous races; his benefactor, in that he enriched him; his
   examiner, in that he wished to test him by harsh trials; his exalter,
   for he made him powerful beyond all men; his avenger, for he avenged
   him on his adversaries; his judge, for in avenging him he exercised
   judgment.

   Moreover, God at once added another item to this history when he said:
   "The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is grown great, and their sin is
   increased overmuch." [93] The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, he said, is
   grown great. He said well that sins cry out, for without doubt the cry
   of sinners is great, as it ascends from earth to heaven. Why does he
   speak of men's sins as crying out? Certainly because he means that his
   ears are smitten by the cries of our sins, that the punishment of
   sinners may not be delayed. Truly, it is a cry, and a great cry, when
   the fatherly love of God is overcome by the cries of sin, so that he is
   compelled to punish the sinners. [94]

   God showed how unwillingly he punishes even the worst of sinners, when
   he said that the cry of Sodom ascended to him. That is to say: "My
   mercy indeed persuades me to spare them; nevertheless the cry of their
   sins compels me to punish." When he had said this, what resulted?
   Angels were sent to Sodom; they set out, and entered the city; they
   were treated hospitably by the good and injuriously by the wicked; the
   wicked were blinded and the good saved. Lot, with his dear ones who
   honored God, was led out of the city; Sodom itself was burned with its
   wicked inhabitants.

   I ask at this point whether it was in accordance with justice or
   contrary to it that God burned these wicked men? He who says that the
   Sodomites were unjustly punished by God accuses him of injustice; if,
   on the other hand, God justly destroyed those evil men, he judged them.

   Surely he judged them, and indeed his judgment clearly foreshadowed
   that which is to come. For it is well known that in time to come
   Gehenna will be in flames for the punishment of the wicked, just as
   flames from heaven then consumed the city of Sodom and its neighbors.
   Moreover, God wished his immediate action to prefigure that coming
   judgment, when he sent Gehenna down out of heaven upon an impious
   people. So the apostle also says that God condemned the cities of Sodom
   and Gomorrah by their overthrow, making them an example to those that
   hereafter should live ungodly lives, [95] although his action on that
   occasion had in it more of mercy than of severity. For that he so long
   delayed their punishment was due to his mercy; that he finally punished
   them, to his justice. So when God sent his angels to Sodom, he wished
   to prove to us that he is loath to punish even wicked men; to the end
   that when we should read what insults the angels endured from the
   people of Sodom, and see plainly the enormity of their crimes, the
   disgraceful character of their vices and the obscenity of their lusts,
   he might prove to us that he did not wish to destroy them, but they
   themselves forced their destruction on him.

   9. I might mention countless further examples, but I am afraid that in
   my effort to give adequate proof I may seem to have composed a whole
   history. Moses pasturing his sheep in the desert saw a bush burning,
   heard God from the midst of the bush and received his commands. He was
   exalted in power and was sent to Pharaoh; he spoke with him, was
   scorned, but conquered. The Egyptian was struck down, Pharaoh's
   disobedience was smitten, and not in one way alone, but many, to the
   end that he should be tortured by a diversity of punishments in
   consideration of the greatness of his sacrilege. What was the outcome?
   Ten times he rebelled; ten times he was smitten. What is our
   conclusion? I think you must recognize that in all these cases God
   shows equally his care for human affairs and his judgment of them.

   In Egypt, indeed, the judgment of God at that time was evidently not
   single but manifold. For as often as he smote the rebellious Egyptians,
   so often he judged them. But after the events already told, what
   happened? Israel was dismissed; after celebrating the Passover they
   despoiled the Egyptians and departed in wealth. Pharaoh repented,
   gathered his army, overtook the fugitives, encamped beside them, was
   separated from them by the darkness; the sea was dried up, Israel
   crossed over and by the friendly withdrawal of the waves was set free.
   Pharaoh followed, the sea rolled over him, and he was drowned by the
   engulfing waves.

   I think that the judgment of God has been made clear in these events,
   and indeed not merely his judgment but also his moderation and
   patience. For it was due to his patience that the Egyptians in their
   rebellion were often smitten, to his judgment that for their persistent
   stubbornness they were condemned to death. Therefore, after this series
   of adventures the race of the Hebrews, victorious without warfare,
   entered the desert. They followed an uncharted course, pathless
   wanderers, with God to lead the way, honored by his divine comradeship,
   powerful through their heavenly leader, following a moving column of
   cloud by day, of fire by night, which took on shifting changes of color
   to suit the changing skies, that its dull obscurity might stand out in
   contrast to the strong light of day and its flaming splendor illumine
   by its clear glow the mists of night.

   Add to this the springs that suddenly gushed forth, add the bitter
   waters given and changed, keeping their old appearance but changing
   their character. Add mountain peaks cleft open by streams gushing
   forth, dusty fields foaming with new torrents. Add flocks of birds sent
   into the camp of the wanderers, since God in his most indulgent love
   catered not only to the needs but also to the palates of his people;
   the food granted throughout forty years by the daily ministry of the
   stars, the dew of sweet morsels shed from the poles, offering abundance
   not merely for nourishment but for delight. Add that the men
   experienced in no part of their bodies the growth or losses natural to
   human beings, their nails did not grow, nor their teeth decay, their
   hair stayed always of one length, their feet were not worn by the
   march, their clothing was not tattered, their shoes not broken, and
   thus the honor granted to the men themselves was even sufficient to
   dignify their mean garments. [96] Add to all this God descending to
   earth to instruct his people, lending himself, God the Son, [97] to
   earthly sight, the countless throngs of people admitted to familiar
   intercourse with him, waxing strong in the power of his sacred
   intimacy.

   Add to this the thunders, the lightnings, the terrifying blasts of
   celestial trumpets, the fearful crashing over the whole sky, the poles
   rumbling with a holy sound, the fires, mists and clouds filled with the
   very presence of God, God speaking to man face to face, the law
   resounding from his holy lips, the letters inscribed in minutest
   accuracy on the stone page by the finger of God, the stone become a
   written scroll, the people learning and God teaching in a school of
   heaven and earth commingled, almost a union of men and angels.

   For it is written that when Moses had taken the words of the people to
   the Lord, the Lord said to him: "Lo, now I come to thee in a thick
   cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee." [98] And a
   little later: "Lo, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick
   cloud upon the mount." [99] Again: "And the Lord came down upon Mount
   Sinai, on the top of the mount." [100] Again: "And the Lord talked with
   Moses. And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
   door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent
   door. And the Lord spake unto Moses, face to face, as a man speaketh
   unto his friend." [101]

   In view of all this, does God seem to take any thought for men, giving
   them such great gifts, helping them so much, sharing his speech with a
   vile mortal, as if admitting him to converse in his sacred fellowship,
   opening before him his hands filled with immortal riches, nourishing
   him with a cup of nectar, feeding him with celestial food? What greater
   care, I ask, could his guidance afford, what greater love could he
   show, than possession in the course of this present life of such a
   mirror of future blessedness?

   10. Perhaps at this juncture you may answer that God did once exercise
   such care for men, but now does not at all. Why should we believe this?
   Because we do not now eat manna daily as the Israelites did? But we
   reap fields full of grain at the harvest. Because we do not catch
   quails that fly into our hands? But we devour all kinds of birds,
   cattle and beasts. Because we are not granted waters gushing from
   clefts opened in the rocks? But we pour the fruits of our vines into
   our wine cellars. I have more to add: we ourselves, who say that the
   children of Israel at that time were cared for by God but that we are
   neglected by him, would absolutely reject the choice of their condition
   if we could receive their past favors in exchange for our present
   benefits. For we should not be willing to lose what we now have in
   order to gain what they then enjoyed, not that we are better off than
   the Israelites were, but that they too, who were then daily fed by the
   ministry of the stars and of God, preferred the old accustomed fodder
   for their bellies to the favors they enjoyed. They were actually sad at
   their vile recollections of carnal foods, pining away with a vulgar
   yearning for onions and garlic, not because their former diet was more
   wholesome, but because they acted just as we do now. They loathed what
   they had and longed for what they lacked. We would rather praise bygone
   days than the present, not that we should prefer to revive the past if
   the choice were given us, but because it is a well-known failing of the
   human mind always to desire what it lacks, and, as the proverb says,
   "Another's goods please us, and ours please others more." [102]

   To this may be added a trait shared by almost all, of being forever
   ungrateful to God, and all in turn are bound by the deep-rooted and
   inborn vice of belittling the blessings God gives, in order that they
   may not feel obliged to look on themselves as his debtors.

   But enough of this: let us at last return to our original proposition.
   I think we have made no slight progress toward proving the point; still
   let me add one instance more, if you please, since it is better to
   prove a matter more fully than is necessary than to risk falling short
   of conviction. [103]

   11. Freed from Pharaoh's yoke the people of the Hebrews transgressed
   near Mount Sinai, and were at once smitten by the Lord for their
   transgression. For it is written: "And the Lord plagued the people for
   their delusion concerning the calf which Aaron made." [104] What
   greater and clearer judgment could God give concerning sinners than
   that punishment should overtake them forthwith in the midst of their
   sin? Yet since all the people were guilty, why was not destruction
   visited on all alike? Surely because the Lord, loving them, smote some
   with the sword of his sentence, in order to correct the others by their
   example, and to prove to all at one time his censure in chastising
   their sin and his affection in pardoning them. For his censure was
   shown in the punishment, his mercy in the pardon, though
   disproportionately, for on that occasion he yielded more to mercy than
   to severity.

   Surely then, since our most indulgent Lord shows himself always more
   prone to mercy than to punishment, even though in punishing a part of
   the Jewish host by his divine censure he gave some scope to judgment
   and severity, yet his love claimed the greater portion of the people--a
   special and peculiar act of mercy to countless men that the punishment
   might not destroy all who were implicated in the guilt. But toward
   certain individuals and families, as we read, the censure of God was
   inexorable. Such an instance is that of the man who, when the people
   rested on the Sabbath day, presumed to gather wood and was killed. For
   although his action seemed harmless in itself, yet the observance of
   the day made it sinful. Or the time when two men were contesting with
   each other, and one, since he had blasphemed, was punished by death.
   For it is written: "Lo the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father
   was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of
   an Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
   and the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and
   cursed. And they brought him to Moses." And a little later: "And they
   put him in ward, that the mind of the Lord might be showed them. And
   the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Bring forth him that hath cursed
   without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his
   head, and let all the congregation stone him.' " [105]

   Was not God's judgment immediate and manifest and his sentence
   pronounced as if the heavenly decision followed the forms of our legal
   procedure? First the man who had sinned was arrested, then he was led,
   so to speak, before the judge's seat, thirdly accused and then put into
   prison, lastly punished by the authority of the divine judgment;
   furthermore he was not only punished but punished in accordance with
   evidence given, so that God's justice and not merely his power was seen
   to condemn his guilt. This truly was meant as an example working toward
   the correction of all men, so that none should commit thereafter the
   deed which all the people had punished in one person. For this reason
   and by this judgment the Lord does all things now and has always done
   them, that whatever penalties individuals have to bear should work
   toward the correction of all.

   So it was also when Abihu and Nadab, men of priestly blood, were
   consumed by fire from heaven, in whose case, to be sure, the Lord
   wished to show not merely judgment but judgment immediately impending.
   For it is written that when the fire sent by the Lord had consumed the
   burnt offering: "Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of
   them his censer, and put fire therein and put incense thereon, and
   offered strange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not. And
   there went out fire from the Lord and devoured them and they died
   before the Lord." [106] What else did he wish than to show his right
   hand stretched over us, and his sword ever threatening? For he punished
   the errors of the aforesaid men at once, in their very act, and the
   crime of the sinners was scarcely committed before punishment was
   exacted for their misdeeds.

   Yet not only this was accomplished in their case, but much else
   besides, For, as in these men not a wicked intention but only a
   misguided impulse was punished, the Lord surely made clear what
   punishment any one would deserve who committed a sin through contempt
   of the divine power, since even those who had sinned only through
   thoughtlessness were struck down by God--or how guilty they would be
   who acted contrary to his command, when those who merely acted without
   his command were thus stricken. God also wished to further our
   correction by a salutary example, that all laymen should understand how
   much they ought to fear the wrath of God, since neither did the high
   priest's merits rescue his sons from instant punishment, nor did the
   privilege of the sacred ministry redeem them.

   But why do I speak of men whose ill-advised action really did in some
   measure affect God and work injury to his divinity? Mary spoke against
   Moses and was punished; she was not only punished, but punished in due
   course of trial. For first she was called to justice, then accused, and
   thirdly chastised. In the accusation she learned the full force of her
   sentence, and in her leprosy she paid full atonement for her crime--yet
   this punishment humbled not Mary alone, but Aaron as well. For, though
   it was unsuitable for the high priest to be deformed by leprosy, yet
   the correction of the Lord plagued him also. Nor was this all. In the
   punishment that Mary suffered, Aaron too was involved, as sharer in her
   guilt; Mary indeed was punished that Aaron might be put to confusion.

   Furthermore, that we might recognize in the individual cases that the
   form of the divine judgment is inexorable, God did not even yield to
   the intercession of the injured party. For we read that the Lord spoke
   thus to Aaron and Mary:

   "Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
   And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and he departed.
   And behold, Mary became leprous, and white as snow: and Moses cried
   unto the Lord, saying: "Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee." And the
   Lord said unto Moses: "If her father had but spit in her face, should
   she not be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut out from the camp seven
   days, and after that let her be received in again." [107]

   These things that we have told should be sufficient for this division
   of the argument and for this part of our work; for it is an endless
   task to discuss all the cases; indeed, it would be overlong merely to
   enumerate them without any discussion. But let me add one more
   instance.

   12. The people of the Hebrews repented having gone out of Egypt; they
   were struck down: then they grieved at the weariness and toil of the
   journey, and were afflicted: they desired flesh-meat, and were smitten.
   And because, eating manna daily, they desired to satiate the cravings
   of their bellies with illicit foods, they were sated indeed in their
   passionate greed, but tortured in that very satiety. "For while their
   food was still in their mouths," says the Scripture, "the wrath of God
   came upon them, and slew very many of them and smote down the chosen
   men of Israel." [108]

   Og rebelled against Moses: he was blotted out. Korah taunted him: he
   was overwhelmed. Dathan and Abiram murmured against him: they were
   swallowed up. "For the earth opened and swallowed Dathan, and covered
   the company of Abiram." [109] Two hundred and fifty leaders of the
   people also, as the sacred narrative testifies, who were called upon by
   name to speak at the time of the council, rose against Moses. "And they
   gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said
   to them: Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are
   holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them; wherefore then
   lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord?'" And what
   happened after this? "There came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed
   the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense." [110]

   When such deeds were committed, heavenly mercy was of no avail.
   Correction was administered again and again, yet improvement did not
   follow. For just as we are chastised again and again, and do not
   improve, so they too, though constantly struck down, did not mend their
   ways. For what is written? "But on the morrow all the congregation of
   the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, Ye
   have killed the people of the Lord.'" [111]

   What happened then? Fourteen thousand seven hundred men were struck
   down at once and consumed by divine fire. Since all the multitude of
   the people sinned, why did not the punishment fall on all alike?
   Especially since, as I said before, no one escaped from Koran's
   sedition. Why did God on the former occasion wish all the assemblage of
   sinners to be killed, but at this time a portion only? Surely because
   the Lord is full of justice and mercy and therefore his indulgence
   causes many concessions to his love, and his discipline to his
   severity. And so on the one occasion he gave first place to discipline
   that the punishment of all the guilty might redound to the general
   betterment; on the other he yielded precedence to mercy, that the whole
   people might not perish. Although he acted with such mercy, yet because
   the punishment so often repeated for a part of the people did not
   profit them, finally he condemned them all to death. This example
   should contribute to our fear and our correction alike, that we,
   failing to be improved by their example, may not come to be punished by
   a destruction like theirs.

   There is no doubt what their end was. Although the whole race of the
   Hebrews went out of Egypt to enter the promised land, yet not one of
   them entered it save two holy men alone. For it is written: "The Lord
   spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying: How long shall I bear with
   this evil congregation, which murmur against me? As truly as I live,
   saith the Lord, as ye have spoken in mine ears this day, so will I do
   to you: your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness!'" What followed?
   "Your little ones," he said, "which you said would be a prey, them will
   I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. But as
   for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness." And what
   then? "All died and were struck down in the sight of the Lord." [112]

   What detail is lacking in this whole account? Would you see a ruler?
   Behold him, correcting present sins and disposing the future. Would you
   see a severe judge? Behold, he punishes the guilty. Would you see a
   just and loving judge? Behold, he spares the innocent. Would you see
   the judge of the whole world? Behold, his judgment is in all places.
   For as judge he accuses and as judge he rules; as judge he pronounces
   sentence; as judge he destroys the guilty, and as judge he rewards the
   innocent.

THE SECOND BOOK

   1. The examples given above are sufficient proof, therefore, that our
   God acts constantly as a most anxious watcher, a most tender ruler, and
   a most just judge. But perhaps one of my less enlightened readers is
   thinking: "If all things are now conducted by God as they were in those
   days, why is it that the evil prevail while the good are afflicted; and
   whereas in the past the evil felt God's wrath, and the good his mercy,
   now by some strange reversal the good appear to experience his wrath
   and the evil his favor?" These questions I shall answer presently, but
   now since I have promised to prove three points, namely, God's
   presence, his government and his judgment, by three methods, that is,
   by reason, by examples and by authority and since I have already given
   sufficient proof of them by reason and examples, it remains for me to
   verify them by authority. Yet the examples I have given should rank as
   authority, since that term is rightly applied to the means by which the
   truth of matters under discussion is established.

   Which then of the above-mentioned points should first be proved by
   sacred authority--his presence, his government, or his judgment? His
   presence, I think, because he who is to rule or judge must surely be
   present, in order to be able to rule or judge anything whatever.

   Speaking through the Sacred Books, the Divine Word says.: "The eyes of
   the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good." [113]
   Here you find God present, looking upon us, his eyes watching us
   wherever we may be. If the Divine Word assures us that God observes the
   good and the wicked, it is expressly to prove that nothing escapes his
   watchful scrutiny. For your fuller comprehension, hear the testimony of
   the Holy Spirit in another part of the Scriptures, when it says:
   "Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, to deliver
   their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine." [114] This is
   why God is said to watch over the just, that he may preserve and
   protect them. For the propitious oversight of his divinity is the
   safeguard, of our mortal life. [115] Elsewhere the Holy Spirit speaks
   in the same fashion: "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and
   his ears, are open unto their cry." [116]

   See with what gentle kindness the Scripture says the Lord treats his
   people. For when it says the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, his
   watchful love is shown; when it says that his ears are always open to
   their prayers, his readiness to hear is indicated. That his ears are
   always open to the prayers of the righteous proves not merely God's
   attention, but one might almost say his obedience. For how are the ears
   of the Lord open to the prayers of the righteous? How, save that he
   always hears, always hears clearly, always grants readily the pleas he
   has heard, bestows on men at once what he has clearly heard them ask?
   So the ears of our Lord are always ready to listen to the prayers of
   his saints, always attentive. How happy should we all be if we
   ourselves were as ready to hearken to God as he is to hear us!

   But perhaps you say that the proof of God's guardianship of the just is
   useless to our argument, since this is not a general watchfulness of
   the divine power but merely a special favor granted to the righteous.
   Note, however, that the Sacred Word testified above that the eyes of
   the Lord watch over both good and evil. If you still wish to argue the
   point, consider this, for it follows in the text: "Moreover the face of
   the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of
   them from the earth." [117]

   You see that you have no ground for complaint that God does not look
   upon the unjust also, since you know that he watches all men, but with
   different effect because of the inequality of their merits. The good
   indeed are watched by him that they may be preserved, the evil that
   they may be destroyed. You yourself, who deny that God watches men,
   have your place with these last; know then that you are not only
   clearly seen by God, but are without doubt in imminent peril. For since
   the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil, to cut off remembrance
   of them from the earth, you, who wickedly say that the eyes of the Lord
   do not see you, must learn by your destruction the wrath of an
   all-seeing God. These arguments, then, are sufficient to prove the
   presence and watchfulness of God.

   2. Let us now see whether he who watches us also rules us, although,
   forsooth, his watchfulness in itself implies governance as its motive,
   unless he looks upon us in order to neglect us thereafter. Surely the
   fact that he deigns to look upon us is itself an indication of his care
   for us, especially since the Sacred Word has borne witness, as I have
   shown above, that the wicked are observed by God to their destruction,
   the good to their salvation. Certainly this very fact shows the divine
   guidance, for this is actually ruling by just government and dealing
   with men individually according to their several merits.

   Listen, however, to fuller testimony on this point. The Holy Spirit
   spoke thus to God the Father in a psalm: "Give ear, O Shepherd of
   Israel." [118] Israel means "Seeing God," since indeed Christians who
   believe faithfully see him with faith in their hearts:. Though God is
   the governor of all things, still his governance is spoken of as being
   chiefly assigned to those who especially deserve divine guidance.
   Therefore you also, whoever you are, if you are a Christian, must of
   necessity believe in God's government. If, however, you refuse utterly
   to believe that you, together with other Christians, are ruled by God,
   you must recognize that you belong outside the whole body of
   Christians.

   But if, as we suggested earlier, you are more interested in the case of
   men in general, than of Christians alone, see how clearly the Holy Book
   says that all things are daily ruled by the divine will and the whole
   world incessantly guided by God, for it says: "He himself loves counsel
   and discipline." [119] "For neither is there any other God beside thee
   that careth for all, bat being righteous thou rulest all things
   righteously and with great reverence dost dispose us." [120]

   Here you have God constantly arranging, constantly governing; yet in
   the passage cited not only his divine governance but also the high
   honor of man is declared. For the words, "thou dost dispose us," show
   the power of his divine government, but the words, "with great
   reverence," show the culmination of human honor. Elsewhere also we read
   in the words of the prophet: "Do I not fill heaven and earth!" [121]
   And he himself tells us why he fills all things: "Because I am with you
   to save you." [122] Obviously then God shows us not merely his rule and
   the fulness of his power but also the might and benefits that result
   from its plenitude. For the fulness of divinity bears within it this
   fruit, that it saves all things that it fills. Thus in the Acts of the
   Apostles the most blessed Paul said: "In him we live and move and have
   our being." [123] Doubtless he is more than the controller of our
   lives, in whom is the very source of life. For Paul did not say that we
   are moved by God but in him, teaching us, to be sure, that our real
   substance is rooted within his sacred attributes, since we truly live
   in him from whom we receive our being.

   The Savior himself said also in the Gospel: "Lo, I am with you alway,
   even unto the end of the world." [124] He not only said that he is with
   us, but that he is with us all our days. Do you then, most thankless of
   men, say that he who is constantly with us has no care or thought for
   us? What then does he do in our company? Can you possibly think that he
   is with us in order to neglect and overlook us? And how can he
   consistently grant his presence to our virtue and neglect our vice?
   "For lo," he says, "I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
   world." Truly we have a marvelous comprehension of God's love if we say
   falsely that he is constantly neglectful of us while he says that he is
   constantly with us. Through this he wishes to show that his love and
   protection are constantly with us, since his very presence does not
   leave us. But we turn the divine charity into contempt; we change the
   indications of his love into proofs of hatred. For we try to see
   evidence of hatred rather than of love in his saying that he is with
   us. If the Lord had said that he would remain apart from us, we might
   perhaps have less occasion to gossip about his lack of care, in his
   absence. Constant neglect is a proof of greater contempt and scorn from
   one who never leaves us. There is the more odium in staying with us
   always if, while never depriving us of his presence, he continually
   shuts us out from his loving care.

   But far be it from us to believe that our most loving and merciful God
   would have wished to be always near us for the sake of increasing by
   his presence the apparent contempt of his neglect: far be it from us
   even to say such a, wicked thing. For I think there is no one in the
   whole human race who is so evil that he wishes to be with any man on
   account of his dislike of him, or wishes to employ his presence solely
   to achieve greater satisfaction of his hatred by scorning him face to
   face. Let human nature itself teach and convince us that we wish to be
   with one man or another because we love the one whose company we
   desire. And just because we love a man, we wish our presence to be of
   benefit to him whom we love. So what we cannot deny even to a criminal,
   we deny to God, and make him seem worse than the worst of men, if we
   think that he promised to be with us in order to show greater contempt
   for us by his subsequent neglect. But enough of this.

   3. We have already proved by sacred testimony that all things are both
   watched and ruled by God; it remains now to show that the greater part
   are also judged by his divine power in this world.

   When the blessed David had suffered the insulting scorn of Nabal the
   Carmelite, since he himself postponed vengeance, he received his
   revenge at once at the hand of God. So when, shortly after, his enemy
   had been overwhelmed and killed by the hand of the Lord, he spoke thus:
   "Blessed be the Lord, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from
   the hand of Nabal." [125] Likewise when his rebellious son had driven
   him from his kingdom the Lord as his judge in a brief space requited
   him, and more abundantly than he himself desired.

   God wished to show that the affliction of those who suffered injustice
   was greater in his eyes than in their own. For when a man takes
   vengeance beyond the wish of the injured person, what else can he mean
   than that he is acting on his own behalf also? So when, for his
   attempted parricide, David's son was being hung on a cross not made
   with hands, the Divine Word tells us that the punishment divinely
   brought upon him was thus reported: "I bring thee good tidings, my lord
   king; for the Lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up
   against thee." [126]

   4. You see how the sacred books prove through divine witnesses that God
   judges not only by deeds, as we said above, and by examples, but by the
   very name and terms of judgment, even in our present age. Perhaps you
   think that it was as a special favor granted by God to a holy man, that
   he wrought judgment forthwith on David's enemies. The day will not
   suffice if I would tell of his immediate sentences and judgments in
   this world. Yet, that you may clearly understand that it is not so much
   in consideration of the persons concerned as of their actions that he
   exercises his sacred censure, hear how God our judge, who constantly
   gave his unmistakable verdict on behalf of his servant David, many
   times passed judgment on David himself. And indeed this occurred not in
   a matter affecting many men, nor--which would perhaps naturally have
   aroused God the more--affecting holy men, but in the case of a single
   individual, a barbarian, [127] a case in which it was not the person
   concerned that demanded vengeance, but the action. For when David had
   killed Uriah the Hittite, a man belonging to an impious people and a
   hostile nation, he was at once charged thus by the divine voice: "Thou
   hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to
   be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of
   Ammon. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house.
   Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against
   thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
   eyes and give them unto thy neighbor. For thou didst it secretly; but I
   will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.'" [128]

   What answer have you to this, you who believe that God not only fails
   to judge our every action but does not regard us at all? Do you see
   that the eyes of the Lord were in no wise withdrawn from the single
   secret sin which David once committed? Wherefore do you also, who--as a
   consolation I suppose for your sins--think that our acts are not
   observed by God, learn from this same instance that you are always seen
   by Christ, and know that you must receive punishment, perhaps very
   shortly. For you see that even the blessed David was unable to hide his
   own misdeed in the secret places of his innermost chambers, and to
   claim exemption from instant punishment by the undoubted merit of his
   great deeds. For what did the Lord say to him? "I will take thy wives
   before thine eyes, and the sword shall never depart from thine house."
   You see what immediate judgment so great a man suffered at once for one
   sin. Condemnation followed close on the heels of the fault, a
   condemnation punishing immediately without reservations and arresting
   the wrongdoer on the spot, not putting off the charge to a later time.

   Therefore he did not say: "Because you have done this, know that the
   judgment of the Lord shall come and you shall be tortured hereafter by
   the flames of Gehenna." No; he said: "You shall suffer torture at once,
   and shall feel the sword of divine justice already at your throat."

   And what followed? The guilty man acknowledged his fault, was humbled,
   stung by remorse, confessed and mourned his sin. He repented and
   implored pardon, gave up his royal jewels, laid aside his gold-wrought
   robes, put off the purple, resigned the glory of his crown, changed his
   whole bodily habit, cast off every aspect of kingship with its
   trappings, and put on the guise of a penitent fugitive, eagerly
   assuming a squalor that should plead in his defence; he was wasted by
   fasting, withered by thirst, exhausted by weeping, self-imprisoned in
   loneliness. And yet this king of so great repute, greater in holiness
   than in mere temporal power, surpassing all men in the favors earned by
   his former merits, although he sought pardon so earnestly, did not
   escape punishment. The fruit of such great penitence was indeed
   sufficient to win remission from eternal expiation, but not to earn
   pardon at the moment. Finally, what did the prophet say to the
   penitent? "Because thou hast made the enemies of the Lord blaspheme,
   the son that is born to thee shall die." [129] In addition to the
   bitter loss of his son, God wished the loving father to suffer also the
   knowledge of the full extent of his punishment, that he himself had
   caused the death of the clearly loved son for whom he mourned, when the
   boy born of his father's crime was slain for the very crime that had
   begotten him.

   5. This is the first instance of the divine punishment; the first, to
   be sure, but not the only one, for a long series of great griefs
   followed and an almost unending succession of misfortunes haunted his
   household. Thamar was seduced by the mad act of Amnon, and Amnon slain
   by Absalom. A great crime indeed was committed by the first brother,
   but its retribution by the other was worse. In these actions David the
   father was punished alike by both sons' crimes. Two children sinned,
   but three were ruined by the sin of two; for Thamar suffered the loss
   of her virginity, while in Amnon also the destruction of Absalom was
   mourned. And verily you cannot tell for which of the two sons so loving
   a father mourned the more grievously, the one slain in this world by
   his brother's hand, or the other who by his own hand was doomed
   forever. [130] From this time indeed ills were piled up beyond
   reckoning, according to the word of God. The father long endured the
   treachery of his son, was driven from his kingdom, and sought in exile
   an escape from murder. Which was worse, the vice or the
   bloodthirstiness of his son? By incest he disgraced his father when his
   attempted parricide failed, and by his diligent heaping up of crime
   achieved an incest passing the bounds of incest, committing in public,
   to his father's greater shame, a crime abominable even in secret. It
   was a mortal sin that he performed against his exiled father, but worse
   still was the injury wrought by his public incest before the eyes of
   the whole world.

   Must we add to this the spectacle of David's actual flight? Picture
   this mighty king, so greatly renowned, higher in honor than all others,
   greater than the world itself, fleeing his whole people with a tiny
   band of slaves. In comparison with his former state he was needy
   indeed; in comparison with his wonted train [131] he went alone. He
   fled in fear, disgrace and sorrow--"walking," the Scripture says, "with
   covered head, and barefoot." [132] He had outlived his former state,
   exiled from himself, almost, one might say, surviving his own death. He
   sank so low as to merit the scorn of his own servants, or--which is
   harder yet to bear--their pity. So Ziba was fain to feed him, and
   Shimei did not fear to curse him publicly. God's judgment so changed
   him from his former self that he endured the open insults of a single
   enemy--he who had made the world to tremble!

   6. Who now denies that God watches over human actions? Behold how often
   the Scriptures have shown in the case of one man that God not only
   observed, but also judged his acts! And why? Why indeed, except that we
   should understand that the Lord's verdict and coercion are always to be
   exercised in this world as they were then? So we read that even holy
   men were punished aforetime by God's judgment, to teach us that we too
   must always be judged in our present life by God. For as God always is,
   so is his justice eternal. As God's omnipotence is never-failing, so is
   his verdict unchangeable. As long as his law endures, so long also
   shall his justice remain. Therefore all his saints in their sacred
   books, amid the imminent fear of martyrdom and the swords of the
   persecutors, demand that the immediate judgment of God be established.
   For thus said the just man in a psalm: "Judge me, O God, and plead my
   cause against an ungodly nation." And that this might not be construed
   as a reference to some future judgment of God, he added at once:
   "Deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man." [133]

   Certainly it is the immediate judgment of God that he demands who begs
   to be freed from the hands of the persecutor. In his consciousness of a
   just cause the psalmist did well to pray for God's justice rather than
   for his favor, for the best verdict is always given to the righteous
   cause if the case is conducted with justice.

   Elsewhere also the psalmist spoke most clearly, saying: "Judge, O Lord,
   them that injure me; fight against them that fight against me; seize
   arms and shield and stand up for mine help." [134] You see in this case
   that he does not demand the severity of a future trial, but the verdict
   of immediate justice.

   For what are his words? "Take up the shield and seize the sword"--the
   shield, of course, for protection and the sword for vengeance--not that
   God's judgment needs such weapons, but because in this world the names
   of dreaded arms are the instruments of dread judgments. Speaking to
   human intelligence in figures drawn from human life, since he was
   praying for judgment and for vengeance on his adversaries, he expressed
   the power of God's punishment in terms of the instruments of earthly
   vengeance.

   Lastly, the same prophet showed elsewhere the great difference between
   the present and the future judgments of God. For what did he say to the
   Lord about his verdict in the present trial? "Thou sittest on the
   throne and judgest." And what about the future and everlasting judgment
   of God? "He shall judge the world in righteousness;" and again: "He
   shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness." [135] By these
   words surely he made a clear distinction in time between the present
   and the future judgments of God. For to indicate the present he wrote,
   "thou judgest," and to distinguish the future from the present he
   added, "he shall judge."

   Sufficient proof of God's care for us and of his government and
   judgment has now been given by reason, by examples and by authority,
   [136] especially since the books to follow are all to be concerned with
   the same proof. Now if we receive from God, whose work we are
   performing, strength to complete our task, we shall attempt to bring to
   light and to refute the customary arguments opposed by our adversaries
   to these essential doctrines.

THE THIRD BOOK

   1. It is well: the foundations have been laid [137] for a work
   undertaken from pious motives and from love of a sacred duty; they have
   not been laid in marshy ground or built of perishable stone, but are
   strengthened by the sacred treasures used in their building and by the
   skill of their divine architect. These foundations, as God himself says
   in his Gospel, cannot be shaken by raging winds, undermined by river
   floods, or washed away by the rains. [138] Since the divine writings in
   some fashion lent their aid to the erection of this structure, and the
   Holy Scriptures performed the joiner's task, the work itself must,
   through the help of the Lord Jesus Christ, be as strong as its makers.
   So this edifice receives its character from its parent stock and cannot
   be shaken while the builders remain sound.

   As no one can tear down the walls of earthly houses without tearing
   apart their stones and mortar, so none can destroy this structure of
   ours unless he first destroys the materials of which it is composed.
   Since these certainly can in no way be weakened, we may safely assume
   the permanence of a building whose strength is insured by immortal aid.

   The question is raised why, if everything in this world is controlled
   by the care and governance and judgment of God, the condition of the
   barbarians is so much better than ours, why among us the fortune of
   good men is harder than that of the wicked. Why should upright men fall
   ill and reprobates recover? Why does the whole world fall prey to
   powers for the most part unjust? Perhaps a rational and fairly
   consistent answer would be: "I do not know." For I do not know the
   secrets of God. The oracle of his heavenly word is sufficient proof for
   me in this case. God says, as I have already proved in my earlier
   books, that all things are subject to his oversight, his rule and his
   judgment. If you wish to know what doctrines you must accept, you have
   the sacred writings: the perfect course is to hold fast what you have
   read in them.

   Moreover, I would not have you ask me to account for God's actions in
   the cases of which I speak. I am a man; I do not understand the secrets
   of God, [139] I do not dare search them out, I am afraid to pry into
   them, for to seek to know more than is permitted is in itself a kind of
   rash sacrilege. [140] God says that he moves and ordains all things:
   let that suffice. Do you ask me why one man is greater and another
   less, one wretched and another happy, one strong and another weak? Why
   indeed God does such things. I do not know, but the proof that he is
   the source of all actions should convince you fully. As God is greater
   than the sum total of human reason, our knowledge that everything is
   done by him ought to have more weight with us than reason alone. You do
   not need, therefore, to hear any new argument on this point; let God's
   authority be set over against all reason from any source whatever.

   We are not at liberty to say that of the actions of the divine will one
   is just and another unjust, because whatever you see is done by God,
   whatever you are sure is done by him, you must confess is more than
   just. So much can be said of God's government and justice without
   further discussion and without uncertainty. I need not prove by
   arguments what is proved by his very words. When we read that God says
   he constantly sees all the earth, we have proof that he sees it, since
   he says so. When we read that he rules all creation, we have proof that
   he rules it, because he so affirms. When we read that he orders all
   things by his immediate judgment, his judgment is clearly proved by his
   own testimony. All other statements, made in human terms, need proofs
   and witnesses, whereas God's speech is its own witness, since the words
   of perfect truth must be perfect testimony to the truth. Yet since our
   God willed that we should through the Sacred Scriptures know certain
   things, as if from the archives of his spirit and mind--since the
   pronouncements of the Holy Scriptures are themselves in a way the mind
   of God--I shall not conceal anything that God has wished his people to
   know and preach.

   One thing, however, I should like to know before 1 begin--whether I am
   to address my words to Christians or to pagans. If to Christians, I do
   not doubt that I shall prove my case. But if I speak to pagans, I
   should scorn the attempt, not for any lack of proofs, but because I
   despair of profit from my discourse. Surely it is fruitless and lost
   labor when a perverse listener is not open to conviction. Yet because I
   think there is no one belonging to the Christian name who does not at
   least wish to seem a Christian, I shall address my words to Christians,
   However many pagans still adhere to their impious unbelief, it is
   enough for me to prove my contentions to a Christian audience.

   2. So you keep airing the question why we Christians who believe in God
   are more wretched than all other men. The words of the apostle to the
   churches might have furnished me with a sufficient answer to this:
   "That no man should be moved by these afflictions; for you yourself
   know that we are appointed thereunto." [141] Since the apostle says we
   are meant to endure hardships, miseries and sorrows, why is it strange
   that we suffer every evil, who are fighting for the sake of enduring
   all adversities? Since, however, many do not appreciate this, but think
   that Christians should receive from God, as the wages due to their
   faith, greater strength than all other races, because they are more
   religious than all others, let us agree to their opinion and argument.

   Let us see what it means to believe firmly in God. We who wish our
   reward for belief and faith in this life to be so great must consider
   what sort of belief and faith we should have. What is belief and what
   is faith? I think it is that a man believe in Christ faithfully, that
   he be faithful to God, that is, that he faithfully keep God's
   commandments. [142] For as the slaves of rich men or of government
   officials, to whom expensive furnishings and valuable stores are
   entrusted, cannot be called faithful if they have swallowed up the
   goods entrusted to them; so Christians also are proved unfaithful if
   they have corrupted the good things granted them by God.

   Perhaps you ask what the good is that God grants to Christian men? What
   else but all the substance of our faith, all those things through which
   we are Christians? First the law, then the prophets, thirdly the
   Gospels, fourthly the reading of the apostles, finally the gift of
   fresh regeneration, the grace of holy baptism, the unction of the
   divine chrism. You remember that of old among the Hebrews, the people
   especially chosen of God, when the office of the judges had passed over
   into the power of kings, God called the most approved and excellent men
   to reign through the royal unction. So every Christian, having
   performed all God's commands after receiving the chrism of the church,
   shall be called to heaven to receive the reward of his labors. Since
   these are the elements of our faith, let us see who keeps these great
   sacraments in such a way as to be judged faithful, for, as I said, the
   unfaithful must be those who do not keep their trust. And indeed I do
   not ask that a man perform all the commands of the Old and New
   Testaments: I exempt him from the censorial power of the old law, the
   threats of the prophets, even from the strictest interpretation of the
   apostolic books or the full doctrine of the Gospels in their complete
   perfection, though these last admit no exception. I only ask who lives
   in accordance with the least number of God's commands. I do not mean
   those which so many avoid that they are almost accursed. God's honor
   and reverence have advanced so far among us that those things which our
   lack of devotion leads us to neglect, we consider worthy even of
   hatred.

   For instance, who would deign even to listen to our Savior's bidding
   not to take thought for the morrow? Who obeys his order to be content
   with a single tunic? Who thinks the command to walk unshod possible or
   even tolerable to follow? These precepts then I pass over. For here our
   faith, in which we trust, falls short, so that we judge superfluous the
   precepts the Lord intended for our benefit. "Love your enemies," said
   the Savior, "do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
   despitefully use you and persecute you." [143] Who could keep all these
   commandments? Who would deign to follow God's commands in respect to
   his enemies, I do not say in wishes, but even in words? Even if a man
   compels himself to do so, still it is his lips alone that act, and not
   his mind; he lends the service of his voice to the action without
   changing the feeling of his heart. Therefore, even if he forces himself
   to say a prayer for his adversary, his lips move, but he does not
   really pray.

   To discuss all such cases would take too long; but one point I add,
   that we may know that not only do we fail to accede to all God's
   commands, but we actually obey almost none of them. This is why the
   apostle cried: "For if a man think himself to be something when he is
   nothing, he deceiveth himself." [144] We add this to our sins, that
   although we are guilty in every respect, we still believe ourselves to
   be pure and holy. Thus the offences of our iniquity are piled high by a
   false assumption of righteousness. "Whosoever hateth his brother," says
   the apostle, "is a murderer." [145] We may know from this that there
   are many murderers who think themselves innocent, because, as we see,
   murder is committed not only by the hand of him that kills, but also by
   the heart of him that hates. For this reason the Savior added to this
   precept a still harsher decree, saying: "Whosoever is angry with his
   brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment." [146]
   Anger is the mother of hatred. Hence the Savior wished to shut out
   wrath, that hatred might not spring from it. If then not only hatred
   but even wrath makes us guilty in God's judgment, we clearly see that
   as no one in the world is free from anger, so no one can be free from
   conviction of sin. Moreover, God seems to trace every fiber of that
   precept to its end, and cut off all its fruits and branches, when he
   says: "But whosoever shall say, Thou fool,' shall be in danger of hell
   fire; whosoever shall say to his brother, Racha,' shall be in danger of
   the council." Many do not know what kind of danger is involved in
   racha, but they know very well with what slanderous intent men are
   charged with folly. [147] So, using their knowledge rather than their
   ignorance, they prefer to expiate in the divine fires the guilt
   incurred by a form of abuse they understand, rather than to atone
   before human councils for one that they do not know.

   3. Since this is true, and since these commands of the Lord not only
   fail of being carried out by us, but are practically all reversed, when
   shall we come to obey his greater precepts? The Savior said: "Whosoever
   forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. . . . And he
   that taketh not his cross and followeth after me, is not worthy of me."
   [148] He who calls himself a Christian ought to walk as Christ walked.
   Certainly not only those who follow the delights and pomps of the
   world, but even those who abandon worldly interests fail to meet these
   requirements. Those who make a show of renouncing their wealth do not
   appear to make their renunciation complete, and those who are thought
   to be carrying their cross so carry it that they gain more honor in the
   name of the cross than suffering in its passion. Even though all those
   men should in good faith accomplish these precepts in some measure,
   still it is certain that none of them could succeed in walking along
   the paths of this life as the Savior walked. For the apostle says: "He
   that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he
   walked." [149]

   4. Perhaps certain men think the commands of the apostle are hard.
   Clearly they must be considered difficult, if the apostles exacted from
   others the performance of duties they did not lay upon themselves. But
   if, on the other hand, they enjoined upon others much lighter duties
   than on themselves, instead of being considered harsh teachers, they
   must be thought most indulgent parents, who, through their religious
   zeal, themselves in loving indulgence take the burdens their sons
   should bear.

   What was it that one of them said to the people of the church? "My
   little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be
   formed in you." And again: "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of
   Christ." [150] This is his command, that we imitate him who gave
   himself over to the imitation of Christ. Indeed, none can doubt that he
   himself imitated Christ. As Christ for our sake subjected himself to
   the world, so did Paul for Christ's sake. As Christ for us endured the
   heaviest pains and labors, so did Paul for Christ. As Christ for us
   suffered scorn and mockery, so did Paul for Christ. As Christ for us
   endured his passion and death, so did Paul for Christ. Therefore not
   without cause, conscious of his own merits, he said: "I have fought a
   good fight, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a
   crown of righteousness." [151]

   Since he so followed Christ, let us consider which of us seems to be a
   true follower of the apostle. He writes of himself first of all that he
   never gave offence to any, but in all things showed himself the
   minister of God, in much patience, in affliction, in necessities, in
   blows, in imprisonments, in stripes. [152] Elsewhere, comparing himself
   with others, he says: "Howbeit, whereinsoever any is bold (I speak
   foolishly) I am bold also: I speak as a fool, I am more; in labors more
   abundant, in prisons more frequent, in stripes above measure, in deaths
   oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice
   was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
   shipwreck." [153]

   Surely, even if we leave out of account the other apostolic virtues
   that he lists, when the apostle says that he has suffered shipwreck
   three times, in this at least we can outdo him. We have not merely been
   wrecked three times, but our whole life is one continuous shipwreck;
   indeed all men are living such vicious lives that there seems to be no
   Christian who is not wrecked constantly. [154]

   5. Some one may object that it does not befit our present time to
   endure for Christ such sufferings as did the apostles of old. It is
   true that there are no longer heathen princes, nor tyrannous
   persecutors; the blood of the saints is not shed now nor their faith
   tried by tortures. Our God is content with the service of our peace,
   that we please him simply by the purity of our spotless acts and the
   holiness of an unstained life. Our faith and devotion are the more due
   him because he demands lesser services from us and has foregone the
   greater exactions. Since even our princes are Christians, there is no
   persecution and religion is not disturbed, we who are not forced to
   test our faith by harsher trials ought certainly to seek the more to
   please God in small ways. For he by whom trifles are duly performed
   proves that if occasion arises he will be capable of greater things.

   6. Let us then pass over the trials of the most blessed Paul, let us
   even omit the accounts we read in the books later written about our
   faith, of the sufferings endured by almost all Christians, who,
   mounting to the doors of the heavenly palaces by their tortures,
   contrived steps for their ascent from the very racks and scaffolds. Let
   us see whether in those lesser and ordinary observances of religious
   devotion which we all as Christians can perform in utter peace at all
   times, we are really trying to accede to the Lord's commands.

   Christ orders us not to quarrel. Who obeys this order? He not only
   gives the command, but insists on it so far that he bids us renounce
   those things about which a dispute has arisen, provided we may thus end
   the suit. "For," he says, "if any man will sue thee at the law, and
   take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also." [155] I ask who there
   are who yield to the attempts of their adversaries to despoil them;
   further, who there are who do not try to rob their opponents in turn?
   For we are so far from leaving them other property in addition to our
   coats, that if we can find any way to do it we take away coats and
   cloaks as well from our enemies. Indeed, so eagerly do we obey the
   Lord's commands that it does not satisfy us to refuse our adversaries
   even the least part of our garments, unless we rob them of everything
   we possibly can, as far as the circumstances permit.

   Moreover, there is a second similar commandment joined with this one,
   in which the Lord says: "Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek,
   turn to him the other also." [156] How many men do we think there are
   who would listen politely to such words, or agree to them in their
   hearts, even if they pretended to listen? How often do you find a man
   who does not return many blows for the one that he has received? He is
   so far from turning his other cheek to the man who strikes him that he
   thinks that he is winning when he has outdone his adversary, not in
   being struck, but in striking.

   The Savior said: "What you wish that men should do unto you, do ye even
   so to them." [157] A part of this saying we know so well that we never
   overlook it -- a part we omit so constantly that we do not know it at
   all. For we know very well what we wish others to do for us, but we do
   not know what we ourselves ought to do for them. Would that we really
   did not know! For our guilt would be less if due to ignorance,
   according to the saying: "He who does not know his lord's will shall be
   beaten with few stripes; but he who knows and does not do according to
   his lord's will, shall be beaten with many stripes." [158] But now our
   offence is the greater because we cherish a part of this sacred command
   on account of its usefulness to our convenience, and pass over a part
   of it in injury to God. Paul the apostle also adds to this word of the
   Lord in his preaching, saying: "Let no man seek his own, but every man
   another's wealth." And again: "Look not every man on his own things,
   but every man also on the things of others." [159]

   You see then how faithfully he performed the precepts of Christ when,
   as the Savior bade us take thought for others just as we do for
   ourselves, he ordered us to consult the welfare of others more than our
   own, proving himself, to be sure, a good servant of a good master, and
   a glorious disciple of an exemplary teacher. He so followed in the
   steps of the Lord, that his own footprints somehow made those of his
   Master more evident and more clearly formed.

   Which of these do we Christians obey, the command of Christ or that of
   his apostle? I think we obey neither one. For we are so far from doing
   anything that inconveniences ourselves, that we choose instead to
   provide first of all for our own convenience, whatever discomfort this
   involves for others.

   7. Perhaps you may think we are choosing only the greater commandments,
   which no one follows, and which, as Christians themselves think, cannot
   be followed in any case, and are passing over others which can be and
   indeed are followed by all. But this point must be considered first,
   that no slave is allowed to choose according to his own wishes which of
   his master's commands he will carry out and which he will not, nor by a
   most insolent abuse to assume the task that pleases him and reject the
   rest. Certainly human masters think it impossible to tolerate calmly
   slaves who hear part of their orders and despise the rest, who,
   according to their own desires, carry out the commands they think
   should be performed and trample under foot those they think deserve
   such treatment. If slaves obey their masters according to their own
   free will alone, they are not rendering true obedience even when they
   seem to obey. When a slave obeys only such of his master's orders as he
   pleases, he is no longer doing his master's will but his own. If then
   we, who are but weak little men, are still utterly unwilling that our
   slaves, who are equal to us in their common humanity, though our
   inferiors in their condition of servitude, should despise us, how
   unjustly, forsooth, do we scorn our heavenly Master, since we, being
   ourselves men, yet think we ought not to be despised by men of our own
   condition! [160] Unless perhaps we have such great wisdom and deep
   intelligence that we who are unwilling to hear any insults from our
   slaves wish God to be subject to insults from us, and believe that he
   deserves to endure from us such treatment as we consider unfit for
   human endurance.

   For this reason, to return to our former topic, any who think that I am
   talking of the greater commands of God and omitting the lesser, must
   recognize the unreasonableness of their complaint. There is no just
   reason for preferring some commands, when all must be performed. As I
   have already said, just as the servants of carnal masters are by no
   means permitted to choose which of their master's precepts they are to
   perform and which they are not, so we, who are the servants of our
   Lord, ought not to think it in any way permissible to humor ourselves
   by choosing those commands that please us, or by an abusive indulgence
   of our pride to trample under foot those that displease us.

   8. Let us, however, come to an agreement with those who do not wish us
   to tell of the greater commands of the Lord, for the reason perhaps
   that they think they are fulfilling his lesser precepts, though it is
   not sufficient for salvation to perform the lesser commandments while
   scorning the greater. It is written: "For whosoever shall keep the
   whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." [161]
   Although for this reason it is not sufficient for us to obey all God's
   small and least commands, yet I agree to speak only of these, in order
   to show that most Christians have not performed even the least and
   slightest of their duties.

   Our Savior ordered that Christian men should not swear. The men who
   perjure themselves daily are more numerous than those who do not swear
   at all. He commanded that no one should curse. Whose speech is not
   cursing? For curses are always the first instrument of wrath; whatever
   in our weakness we cannot perform we ardently desire in our anger, and
   thus in every impulse of our wrathful hearts we use evil wishes as our
   weapons. [162] Hence every man shows plainly that whatever he wishes
   may happen to his adversaries he would do to them if he could. Since we
   ail put our tongues to this wicked use on the slightest provocation,
   our disregard of the Lord's will shows that we think it will be held of
   small account by God, who gave these commands. But the Holy Scripture
   says: "Revilers shall not inherit the kingdom of God." [163] From this
   we may judge how serious and deadly a crime evil-speaking is, which by
   itself shuts a man out of heaven, even though the rest of his life may
   have been good.

   Christ ordered that envy be far from us, but we, contrary to his
   teaching, envy not merely outsiders but even our friends. This is the
   ruling vice in the hearts of almost all: our greed for eating has its
   limits, but our greed for slandering others has no end; our appetite
   for food becomes sated, but our appetite for spite does not. Perchance
   the punishment for this fault is a slight one? "The slanderous man,"
   says the Holy Scripture, "shall be rooted out." [164] Surely that is a
   serious and fearful punishment, yet it does not serve to reform us.
   Every one of us thinks it worth while to endanger himself as long as he
   may continue to injure others. The retribution for this vice is clearly
   a suitable one, as it attacks, the doer only; it does no injury at all
   to the person slandered, but only punishes the man from whose lips the
   libel comes.

   I suppose I seem to be out of my mind in repeating these words, and I
   can easily bear the appearance of madness in such a case. For the Lord
   was not speaking senselessly when he enjoined us through his apostle:
   "Let all clamor be put away from you, with all malice." [165] Both of
   these evils indeed are ever present with us, but malice more than
   clamor. Clamor indeed is not always on our lips, but malice is always
   in our hearts. So I think that if clamor should cease among us, yet
   malice would remain to the end.

   Our God orders us also to live without murmuring and without
   complaints. [166] When in the history of the human race have these been
   unknown? In hot weather we complain of drought, in rainy weather of
   floods; if it is a bad season for the crops we complain of scarcity, in
   a good season, of low prices. We long for plenty, and when we get it we
   object to it. What could be more wicked or more disgraceful than this?
   We complain of God's mercy even in this, that he gives us what we ask.

   God bade his servants keep all scandal from their sight altogether, and
   so he said: "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath
   committed adultery with her already in his heart," [167] From this we
   can fully understand how chaste our Savior wished us to be, who even
   shut out licentiousness from our eyes. Knowing that our eyes are in a
   way the windows of our souls, [168] and that all evil desires make
   their way into the heart through the eyes as their natural passageways,
   he wished us to destroy such desires utterly while they were still
   outside that they might not spring up within us and put forth their
   deadly shoots within the soul, if they once germinated in our eyesight.
   [169] Therefore the Lord said that the wanton glances of lustful men
   are adulterous, meaning that a man who truly wishes to shun adultery
   must keep a watch on his eyes. The Savior, indeed, wishing to cultivate
   a most genuine and perfect sanctity in his worshippers, ordered them to
   avoid scrupulously even the least offences, on the ground that
   according to the cleanness of his eyesight, so also is the purity of a
   Christian's life. Just as a man's eye could not receive a mote of dust
   without impairing his sight, so our life should not permit any stain of
   dishonor to find a place in it. Whence come the following words of the
   Lord: "If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and if thy hand offend
   thee, cut it off; it is better for thee, that one of thy members
   perish, than that thy whole body be cast into hell." [170] If,
   therefore, according to the word of God, we are dragged down into hell
   by scandalous actions, surely it is right to sacrifice our eyes and
   hands in order to escape this punishment. No man should deprive himself
   of his members, but in the ease of certain domestic relationships so
   necessary to us that we have come to consider them as eyes or hands, it
   is right to deprive ourselves of their present service in order to
   escape the torture of eternal fire. When the choice lies between
   comfort and life, it is certainly better for the Christian to forfeit
   his convenience and gain life.

   9. In all the points of which we have spoken our Lord has ordered us to
   obey him, but where are those who obey all his ordinances or even a
   very few of them? Where are those who love their enemies or do good to
   those that persecute them, or overcome evil by doing good, who turn
   their cheeks to those that strike them, who yield their property
   without a lawsuit to those that rob them? Who is there that permits
   himself no slander whatever, that injures no man by evil speaking, that
   keeps his lips silent that they may not break out in bitter curses? Who
   is there that keeps these least commandments, not to speak of those
   greater ones which I mentioned a short time ago?

   Since this is the case and since we keep none of the Lord's commands,
   why do we complain of God, who has far more right to complain of us?
   Why should we grieve that he does not hear us, when we ourselves do not
   hear him? What right have we to whisper that God does not look upon the
   earth, when we ourselves do not look up to the heavens? What reason
   have we to be vexed that our prayers are despised by the Lord, whose
   commands we despise?

   Suppose that we were equal to our Lord; what chance is there for just
   complaint when each side receives the same treatment it gives? And this
   entirely overlooks a point easily proved, that we are very far from
   receiving what we give, since God really treats us much more kindly
   than we do him. For the moment, however, let us act on the assumption
   that I proposed. The Lord himself spoke thus: "I cried unto you and ye
   did not hear me: you too shall cry unto me and I shall not hear you."
   [171] What is more fair and just than this? We have not hearkened,
   therefore he does not hear us. We have not been mindful of him,
   therefore he does not consider us. What mortal master, I ask, is
   content to treat his underlings according to this rule, that he will
   scorn them only in proportion to their contempt of him? And yet we do
   not stop with such injurious scorn of God as mortal masters receive
   from their slaves, since the greatest contempt a slave can show is in
   not doing what he has been ordered. We, however, bend all our efforts
   and energy not only to neglecting our orders, but even to acting
   directly contrary to them. For God commands us all to love one another,
   but we rend each other in mutual hatred. God enjoins us all to give our
   goods to the poor, but we plunder other men's goods instead. God orders
   every Christian to keep his eyes pure; how many men are there who do
   not wallow in the filth of fornication?

   What more can I say? It is a heavy and sorrowful charge that I must
   bring: the church itself, which should strive to appease God in all
   things--what else does it do but arouse him to anger? Except a very few
   individuals who shun evil, what else is the whole congregation of
   Christians but the very dregs of vice? How often will you find a man in
   the church who is not a drunkard or glutton or adulterer or fornicator
   or robber or wastrel or brigand or homicide? And what is worst of all,
   they commit these crimes endlessly. I appeal to the conscience of all
   Christians; of these crimes and misdeeds that I have just named, who is
   not guilty of some part, who is not guilty of the whole? You would more
   easily find a man guilty of them all than of none. And because what I
   have said; may perhaps seem too severe an accusation I shall go much
   farther and say that you could more easily find men guilty of ail evils
   than of a few, more easily find men guilty of the greater faults than
   of the less. That is, it is easier to find men who have committed the
   greater sins along with the less than the less without the greater. For
   almost the whole body of the church has been reduced to such moral
   depravity that among all Christian people the standard of holiness is
   merely to be less sinful than others. Some hold the churches, which are
   the temples and altars of God, in less reverence than the houses of the
   least important municipal magistrates. The common run of men indeed do
   not presume to enter the doors, I shall not say of illustrious
   potentates, but even of governors or presiding officials, unless the
   official has called them or contracted business with them, or unless
   the honor due their individual position permits their entrance. If
   anyone enters without due occasion he is flogged or roughly put out or
   punished by some humiliation or personal indignity. [172] But to the
   temples, or rather the altars and sacred shrines of God, all mean and
   evil men resort violently, entirely without reverence for his sacred
   honor. I do not mean to deny that all should hasten thither to pray to
   God, but he who enters to win God's favor should not go out to arouse
   his anger. The same action should not demand his indulgence and provoke
   his wrath. It is a monstrous thing for men to keep committing the same
   sins which they lament having committed, and for those who enter the
   church to weep for their old misdeeds to go out [to commit new ones].
   [173]

   Go out, did I say? They are usually planning fresh crimes in the very
   midst of their prayers and supplications. While men's voices do one
   thing, their hearts do another; while their words lament their past
   misdeeds their minds plan further wrongs, and thus their prayers
   increase their guilt instead of winning pardon for it. So the
   scriptural curse is truly fulfilled upon them, that from their very
   prayers they go out condemned and their petition is turned into sin.
   [174]

   Finally, if any one wishes to know what men of this sort are thinking
   in church, let him consider this. When their religious duties are
   accomplished they all hurry off at once to their accustomed
   pursuits--some, for instance, to steal, others to get drunk, others to
   commit fornication, others to commit highway robbery--so that it is
   perfectly clear that they have spent their time inside the temple in
   planning what they will do after leaving it.

   10. Undoubtedly some men think that all these evils and all the
   infamous vice of which I have spoken above may be properly ascribed to
   slaves or to the lowest of men, whereas the freeman's reputation is not
   spotted by the stain of such disgraceful deeds. Yet what else is the
   life of all business men but fraud and perjury, of the curials but
   injustice, [175] of petty officials but slander, of all soldiers but
   rapine?

   Perhaps you think that one need not object to such a charge against
   characters of this sort. For, you say, their actions fit their
   professions, so it is no wonder that they act according to their
   business in life; as if, indeed, God wishes any man to do or profess
   evil. Or is it no offence whatever to His Divine Majesty that the lower
   classes are known to commit the greatest crimes, especially when by far
   the greater part of the human race belongs to this group? Without
   doubt, the insult that his divinity suffers is proportionate to the
   number of sinners.

   Do you say that the nobles are free from these crimes? At best that is
   but a small gain, for all the nobles in the world would seem no more
   than one man in a great crowd of people. Is even this small group free
   from guilt? First let us consider what the Divine Word says of men of
   this sort. You remember that the apostle, addressing the people of God,
   spoke thus: "Hearken, my beloved brethren. Hath God not chosen the poor
   of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath
   promised to them that love him? But ye have despised the poor. Do not
   rich men oppress you by their power? Do they not blaspheme that worthy
   name by the which ye are called?" [176]

   The testimony of the apostle is potent, unless perhaps the nobles think
   that they are exempt from his accusation because he named only the
   rich. The nobles, however, are either identical with the rich, or, if
   there are rich men who are not counted in their number, they are
   practically in the same category, for so great is the misery of our
   times that no one is considered of higher rank than he who has the
   greatest riches. It makes little difference which of these the apostle
   meant, or if he was talking of both; since his words certainly apply to
   both the rich and the noble, it does not signify which of the two he
   had in mind. What noble or what rich man ever had any horror of crime?
   Yet my query was mistaken--many indeed do fear it, but few avoid it.
   They fear in others the crimes they themselves constantly commit, being
   in a strange manner both the accusers and doers of the same evils. They
   denounce in public what they do in secret, and for that reason, when
   they think they are passing judgment on others they condemn themselves
   even more by their censure.

   Let us overlook those men who have the greater guilt, and ask what
   single rich man or noble there is who preserves his innocence and keeps
   his hands clean of every sort of crime? It was foolish for me to say of
   every sort--would God they were clean of the greatest! Great men seem
   to consider it their personal prerogative to commit the lesser crimes
   as a matter of course. So I shall say nothing of their more ordinary
   misdoings. Let us see if any one of them is free from the two which we
   consider capital offences, that is, homicide and sexual vice. Which of
   them is not either reeking with human blood or smeared with the filth
   of an impure life? Either one of these is enough to render him liable
   to eternal punishment, but there is hardly a wealthy man who has not
   committed both.

   11. Perhaps one of this number is thinking to himself: "I am not doing
   such things now." I commend you if you are not, yet probably you did in
   the past, and to have stopped is not equivalent to never having done
   them at all. But if it were, what value would there be in one man's
   desisting from wickedness when so many persist in their crime? The
   conversion of one man does not atone for the sins of the many, nor is
   it enough to appease God that one man should leave off sinning, while
   the whole human race offends him. Consider too that he who is converted
   for the sake of escaping eternal death certainly gains a great reward
   for his conversion in this escape. By no means could he succeed in
   turning away the punishment of damnation from others. It is a mark of
   intolerable presumption, and an enormous wickedness, for a man to think
   himself so holy that he even supposes wicked men can find salvation
   through him. God spoke thus of a certain land and a sinful people:
   "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel and Job, were in it, they shall
   deliver neither sons nor daughters, they only shall be delivered."
   [177]

   No one, I think, will be so shameless as to dare compare himself with
   such men as these. However much a man may now try to please God, yet to
   assert one's own morality is an example of the greatest
   unrighteousness. Thus is destroyed our confidence in the false notion
   that an innumerable host of sinners can be saved from the evils that
   threaten them by the intercession of a few good men. For since no one
   is equal to the three men named above, what hope can any have that
   countless wicked, men unrelated to them can be saved by a very few good
   men, when those saints, who were close to God, did not deserve of the
   Lord that their very members, in the persons of their children," should
   be saved? It is right that this should be so. Though all sons seem to
   be members of their parents, yet they must not be considered members of
   those whose love they have begun to cast aside, inasmuch as the
   wickedness of their degenerate lives has degraded their natural
   endowments. So it happens that even we who are said to be Christians
   lose the virtue of so great a name by our evil vices. It is of no
   possible benefit to have a holy name without morality, for a life that
   denies our Christian profession cancels the honor of a glorious rank by
   the baseness of unworthy actions.

   Since then we see practically no group among all the Christians, no
   corner in all the churches, that is not full of all manner of offence
   and stained with every deadly sin, why should we beguile ourselves with
   the name of Christian? Assuredly our guilt is made the greater by this
   most sacred name, if we belie it by our conduct. The name of Christian
   aggravates our offences against God, since we continue our sins in the
   very bosom of the church.

   district must make up from their own fortunes any deficit in the
   payments due had made it increasingly difficult to keep up the required

THE FOURTH BOOK

   1. Let us then give up that prerogative of the Christian name, of which
   I spoke above, by which we consider that because we are more religious
   than other people, we ought also to be stronger. For since, as I have
   said, the faith of a Christian is to believe faithfully in Christ,
   [178] to keep Christ's commandments, it surely follows that the man who
   is unfaithful has no faith, that he who crushes under foot Christ's
   commandments does not believe in Christ. The whole question centers on
   this point, that he who does not perform the work of a Christian does
   not appear to be one, for the name without its proper acts and function
   is nothing. A certain man [179] says in his writings: "What else is
   high office without lofty merits but an honorable title without the man
   honored, or what is lofty rank without worth but an ornament in the
   midst of filth,?"

   So, to use the same phrase ourselves, what else is a sacred name
   without merit but an ornament in the midst of filth? The sacred word
   bore witness to this in the divine writings, saying: "As a jewel of
   gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without
   discretion." [180] Thus among us also the name of Christian is like a
   golden ornament; if we use it unworthily, we make ourselves seem like
   swine wearing jewels.

   Finally, whoever wishes fuller proof that mere words are nothing
   without actions should consider how countless peoples, by failing in
   good works, have lost the names given them. The twelve tribes of the
   Hebrews, when they were of old chosen by God, received two holy names,
   for they were called the people of God, and Israel. We read: "Hear, O
   my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against
   thee." [181] Once the Jews bore both these titles, now they have
   neither. They who long since left off the worship of God cannot be
   called God's people, nor can they who denied his Son be given a name
   that means "Seeing God." So it is written: "But Israel does not know,
   my people doth not consider." [182]

   For this reason on another occasion our God spoke of the people of the
   Hebrews to the prophet, saying: "Call his name, Not Beloved." And
   speaking to the Jews themselves: "You are not my people and I am not
   your God." [183] Moreover, he himself showed clearly why he spoke thus
   about them, for he said: "They have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of
   living waters." [184] And again: "They have rejected the word of the
   Lord and there is no wisdom in them." [185]

   But indeed I am afraid that this is true of us now no less than it was
   of them, since we do not obey the words of the Lord, and our
   disobedience certainly shows that there is no wisdom in us. Unless
   perhaps we believe that we act wisely in scorning God, and consider it
   as a sign of the greatest prudence that we despise Christ's
   commandments. There is some reason why we should be thought to hold
   this opinion, for we all sin with as much accord as if we were doing it
   in pursuit of an elaborately planned policy.

   Since this is the case, what logical reason have we for deluding
   ourselves by a false notion into the belief that the good name of
   Christian can be of any possible help to us in the evils we commit? The
   Holy Spirit says that not even faith, without good works, can benefit
   Christian men. Yet surely to have faith requires much more than the
   name alone, for the name is the mere instrument by which a man is
   addressed, whereas faith is the fruit of the spirit. That this same
   fruit of faith is profitless without good works, the apostle testifies
   when he says: "Faith without good works is dead." And again he says:
   "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is
   dead also." [186] He adds also certain harder sayings for the confusion
   of those who delude themselves by their false claims to the Christian
   faith.

   2. "Yea, a man may say: Thou hast faith and I have works; show me thy
   faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.'"
   [187] By this, indeed, he shows that good acts serve also as witnesses
   of the Christian faith, because unless a Christian has performed good
   works, he cannot prove his faith at all, and since he cannot prove that
   it exists, it must be considered as altogether non-existent. [188] For
   he shows at once that it must be considered as nothing, in his
   additional words to the Christian: "Thou belie vest that there is one
   God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble." [189]
   Consider what the apostle meant by this. Let us not be angry at the
   divine testimony but assent to it; let us not speak against it but
   profit by it. "Thou believest," says the Divine Word to the Christian,
   "that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and
   tremble." Was not the apostle in error when he compared the faith of a
   Christian to that of a devil? Surely not, but wishing to demonstrate
   what was said above, that without good works a man should claim no
   merit through pride in his faith, for this reason he says that the
   devils also believe in God. The intent is, of course, that as the
   devils, though they believe in God, still persist in their wickedness,
   the sort of faith that they hold is like that of certain men who, while
   they assert their belief in God, still do not cease to do evil.
   Moreover, the apostle adds, for the confusion and condemnation of
   sinful men, that the devils not only believe in the name of God, but
   fear and tremble before it. Which is as much as to say: "Why do you
   flatter yourself, O man, whoever you are, for your belief, which
   without fear and obedience to God is as nothing? The devils have some
   advantage over you in this. For you have but one thing alone, and they
   have two: you have your belief, but not fear; they have belief and fear
   alike." Why do you wonder that we are chastised, that we are given over
   into the hands of the enemy, that we are weaker than all other men? Our
   miseries, our infirmities, our overthrow, our captivities and the
   punishments of our evil slavery are the proof that we are bad servants
   of a good master. How are we bad servants? Because, to be sure, our
   sufferings are only in proportion to our deserts. How are we the
   servants of a good master? Because he shows what we deserve, even
   though he does not inflict on us the punishment due, for he would
   rather correct us by the most kind and merciful chastisement than
   permit us to perish. As far as our misdoings are concerned, we deserve
   the penalty of death, but he, attaching more importance to mercy than
   to severity, prefers to better us by mercifully tempering his censure,
   than to slay us by the infliction of a just chastisement.

   I know only too well that we are ungrateful for the blows we receive.
   But why do we wonder that God strikes us for our sins, when we
   ourselves strike our slaves for theirs? Like unjust judges we petty men
   are unwilling to be scourged by God, though we scourge men of our own
   condition. I am not surprised that we are so unjust in this case, for
   our very nature and wickedness are of a servile sort. We wish to do
   wrong and not be beaten for it. In this we have the same
   characteristics as our poor slaves. We all wish to sin without
   punishment. I call all men to witness whether I lie: I declare that
   there is no one, however great his guilt, who admits that he deserves
   torture. From this we may observe how unjust and how exceedingly wicked
   a thing it is that we are most severe to others, but most indulgent to
   ourselves; harsh to others, but lax with ourselves. For the same crimes
   we punish others and let ourselves go free; truly a mark of intolerable
   indulgence [190] and presumption. We do not wish to recognize any guilt
   in ourselves, but we dare to claim the right to judge others. What can
   be more unjust or more perverse than we show ourselves in this? We
   think that very crime justifiable in our own case that we condemn most
   severely in others. So it is not without cause that the apostle cries
   out to us: "Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoever thou art,
   that judgest; for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
   thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things." [191]

   3. But some rich man may say: "We do not do the same things, not at all
   the same things, that slaves do; for slaves turn into thieves and
   runaways; slaves live only for their greedy appetites." It is true that
   these are vices characteristic of slaves, but their masters, though not
   all of them, have more and greater faults. Certain of them must indeed
   be excepted, though very few, whom I do not name for fear that in so
   doing I may appear less to praise them than to libel those whom I do
   not name.

   First then, slaves, if they are thieves, are usually forced into
   robbery by need, since even though the customary allowances are
   furnished them, these conform better to custom than to sufficiency and
   so fulfill the canon [192] without satisfying the needs of those who
   receive them. Their necessity makes the fault itself less blameworthy,
   since a convicted thief who seems compelled to robbery against his will
   deserves pardon. The Scripture itself seems to palliate the wrongdoing
   of needy men when it says: "Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to
   satisfy his soul when he is hungry." [193] He steals to satisfy his
   soul; it is for this reason that we think we cannot accuse strongly
   enough those who are pardoned by the Divine Word. Regarding the running
   away of slaves we speak in the same way as about their thefts; but with
   even more justification, forsooth, in this case, since not only their
   wretched condition but also their punishments drive them to try to
   escape. They fear their overseers, they fear those set to keep silence
   among them, they fear their masters' agents. Among all these there are
   scarcely any to whom they seem to belong less than to their owners;
   they are beaten and broken down by them all. What more can be said?
   Many slaves take refuge with their masters from fear of their
   fellow-slaves. We ought not to hold responsible the slaves who try to
   escape, but those who force them to make the attempt. Our slaves labor
   under a most unhappy compulsion; longing to serve, they have no choice
   but to flee. They have no desire whatever to leave their masters'
   service, but the cruelty of their fellows does not allow them to
   continue in it.

   They are called liars also. None the less, they are driven to falsehood
   by the brutality of the impending punishment--they lie in the hope of
   escaping torture. Why is it strange that a terrified slave would rather
   lie than be flogged? They are charged with having greedy mouths and
   stomachs, but this is nothing new; the man who has often endured hunger
   has the greater desire for satiety. Even supposing that he does not
   lack dry bread, he still hungers for delicacies, and so must be
   pardoned if he seeks more greedily that which is constantly lacking.

   But you who are noble, you who are rich, who have an abundance of all
   good things, who ought to honor God the more because you enjoy his
   benefits endlessly, let us see whether your actions are, I shall not
   say holy, but even harmless. What rich man, to repeat my former
   question, save only a few, is not stained by every sort of evil deed?
   And when I except a few, would that I might include many more in the
   exception! for then the innocence of the majority might be the
   salvation of all. I am speaking about none now save the man who
   recognizes that my words apply to him. If what I say lies outside his
   conscience my charge will do him no discredit. If, on the other hand,
   his heart admits the truth of my words, he should realize that it is
   not my tongue that is accusing him but his own conscience.

   To recount first the vices characteristic of slaves: if a slave is a
   runaway, so are you also, rich and noble though you are; for all men
   who abandon the law of the Lord are running away from their master.
   What fault can you rightly find in the slave? You are doing as he does.
   He flees from his master, and you from yours; but in this you incur
   more blame than he, for in all likelihood he is running away from a bad
   master, while you flee from a good one. In the slave you criticize
   incontinent greed. This is a rare fault in him, for want of means to
   satisfy it, but a daily one in you because of your abundance. Hence you
   see that the words of the apostle censure you more than him; nay, they
   censure you alone, for "wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
   thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things"; [194] nay, not
   the same, but far greater and more wicked. In the slave you punish an
   infrequent overindulgence of the appetite, while you constantly distend
   your own belly with undigested food. You think theft a servile fault,
   but you too, O rich man, commit robbery when you encroach on things
   forbidden by God. Indeed every man who performs illicit actions is
   guilty of theft.

   4. Why do I dwell on these petty details and speak in a sort of
   allegorical fashion, when absolutely unconcealed crimes make it clear
   that the wealthy commit not mere thefts but highway robbery on a grand
   scale? How often do you find a rich man's neighbor who is not himself
   poor, who is really secure in his acts and position? Indeed by the
   encroachments of overpowerful men, [195] weaklings lose their property
   or even their freedom along with their goods, so that it was not
   without reason that the Sacred Word alluded to them both, saying: "Wild
   asses are the prey of lions in the wilderness; so poor men are a
   pasture for the rich." [196] And yet not only the poor but almost the
   whole human race is suffering this tyranny. "What else is the official
   career of eminent men but the confiscation of all the property of their
   states? What else is the prefecture of certain men, whose names I
   suppress, but plundering? [197] Nothing causes greater devastation in
   the poorer states than the high officials. Honor is bought by a few to
   be paid for by the oppression of the many; what could be more
   disgraceful or more unjust than this? Wretched men pay the purchase
   price for honors which they do not buy for themselves,; they have
   nothing to do with the bargain, but know only too well the payments
   made; [198] the world is turned upside down that a few men may be
   glorified; the honor of one man is the ruin of the human race. [199]

   To conclude, the Spanish provinces know whereof I speak, for they have
   nothing left them but their name; [200] the provinces of Africa know
   it, whose very existence is at an end; [201] the lands of Gaul know it,
   for they are devastated, yet not by all their officials, and so they
   still draw the scanty breath of life in a few far corners, since the
   integrity of a few has supported for a time those whom the rapine of
   the many has impoverished. [202]

   5. But my sorrow has led me to wander too far afield. To return to my
   former topic: is there any respect in which even the nobles are not
   contaminated by servile vices, or have they, forsooth, a right to
   commit sins they punish in their slaves? A slave may not even dream of
   such ravages as these nobles perform. This, however, is not quite true,
   for certain of the slaves, gaining noble rank, commit like sins, or
   even worse. Still the remaining slaves can hardly be held responsible
   for the fact that some few have so blessedly lost the condition of
   servitude.

   Homicide is rare among slaves because of their dread and fear of
   capital punishment, whereas among the rich it is constantly committed
   because of their confident hope of immunity. Perhaps I am doing an
   injustice in reckoning the actions of the rich as sins, for when they
   kill their poor slaves they consider it an act of justice, not a crime.
   [203] Nor is this all; they also abuse their privilege in their vile
   breaches of chastity. What rich man keeps his marriage vows, who among
   them does not plunge headlong into passionate lust, who does not use
   his household slaves as harlots and pursue his madness against any one
   on whom the heat of his evil desires may light? They illustrate well
   the words of the Holy Scriptures about such men as they: "They are
   become as horses rushing madly on the mares." [204] Is it not a proof
   of what I just said, that the average man washes to make his own by
   physical union whatever his eyes have beheld with desire? To use the
   term concubine may perhaps seem unfair, since in comparison with the
   vices mentioned above it seems almost a form of chastity to be content
   with a few mates and restrain one's lusts to a fixed number of wives.
   [205] I say "wives" advisedly because we have come to such a pass that
   many consider their maidservants as actual wives. Would that they were
   content to have only those whom they do so consider! But the truth is
   more foul and loathsome by far--for certain men who have contracted
   honorable marriages take additional wives of servile rank, deforming
   the sanctity of holy matrimony by low and mean unions, not blushing to
   become the consorts of their slave women, toppling over the lofty
   structure of marriage for the vile beds of slaves, proving themselves
   fully worthy of the rank of those whom they judge worthy of their
   embrace.

   6. Doubtless many of those who either are or wish to be nobles listened
   with lofty scorn to my statement that some slaves are less
   reprehensible than their masters. But since I made this remark not
   about all of them but only those whom it fits, no one has any cause for
   anger if he thinks himself a very different sort of man, for his anger
   would be enough to betray his membership in the group of which I spoke.
   [206] On the other hand, any nobles who abominate this wickedness
   should be angry at such men as these, who defame the very name of
   nobility by the extreme baseness of their misdeeds. For although, men
   of that stripe are a heavy burden to all Christian people, still by
   their vileness they pollute especially the members of their own class.
   Therefore I have said that certain nobles are worse than slaves, and I
   have thus opened the way for contradiction, unless I can adduce proof
   for my words.

   Take for example this crime, a very great one indeed, of which almost
   the whole mass of slaves is guiltless. Has any slave throngs of
   concubines, is any one of them denied by the stain of polygamy or do
   they think they can live like dogs or swine with as many wives as they
   have been able to subject to their lust? The answer, I suppose, is
   obvious, that slaves have no such opportunities, for they surely would
   take them if they had. I believe this, but I cannot consider actions I
   do not see performed as having taken place. However dishonorable his
   intentions are, however evil his desires may be, no one is punishable
   for the crimes that he does not commit. It is generally agreed that
   slaves are wicked and worthy of our contempt. But, be that as it may,
   free-born men of noble rank are the more to be reproached if in their
   more honorable condition they are worse than slaves. Hence the
   inevitable conclusion is not that bondmen ought to be absolved from
   responsibility for their wrongdoings:, but that the majority of the
   rich are more to be condemned in comparison with slaves.

   Who can find words to describe the enormity of our present situation?
   Now when the Roman commonwealth, already extinct or at least drawing
   its last breath in that one corner where it still seems to retain some
   life, is dying, [207] strangled by the cords of taxation as if by the
   hands of brigands, still a great number of wealthy men are found the
   burden of whose taxes is borne by the poor; that is, very many rich men
   are found whose taxes are murdering the poor. [208] Very many, I said:
   I am afraid I might more truly say all; for so few, if any, are free
   from this evil, that we may find practically all the rich in the
   category to which I have just assigned many of them.

   Think a minute: the remedies recently given to some cities.--what have
   they done but make all the rich immune and heap up the taxes of the
   wretched? [209] To free the rich from their old dues they have added
   new burdens to those of the poor; they have enriched the wealthy by
   taking away their slightest obligations and afflicted the poor by
   multiplying their very heavy payments. The rich have thus become
   wealthier by the decrease of the burdens that they bore easily, while
   the poor are dying of the increase in taxes that they already found too
   great for endurance. So the vaunted remedy most unjustly exalted the
   one group and most unjustly killed the other; to one class it was a
   most accursed reward and to the other a most accursed poison. Hence I
   say that nothing can be more wicked than the rich who are murdering the
   poor by their so-called remedies, and nothing more unlucky than the
   poor, to whom even the general panacea brings death.

   7. Then what a state of things it is, what a holy condition of affairs,
   that, if a noble begins to be converted to God, he at once loses his
   noble rank! What honor is paid to Christ among a Christian people in
   whose eyes religion makes a man ignoble? For as soon as a man has made
   an attempt to improve himself, he meets the abusive scorn of worse men,
   and thus all are compelled to some degree of evil living that they may
   not be considered contemptible. Not without cause did the apostle cry
   out: "The whole world lieth in wickedness." [210] He spoke truly, for
   it is right to say that the whole world is lying in wickedness when the
   good cannot hold their place in it. Indeed, everything is so full of
   iniquity that either all who live are evil, or the few who are good are
   tortured by the persecution of the many. Therefore, as I said, if any
   man of honorable rank devotes himself to religion, he at once ceases to
   be honored. For when a man has changed his garments, [211] forthwith he
   changes his rank; if he has been of high degree, he becomes
   contemptible; if he has been most glorious, he becomes the vilest of
   the vile; if he has been altogether full of honor, he becomes
   altogether wretched in aspect.

   Yet certain worldly men and unbelievers wonder why they endure the
   wrath of God and his hatred, when they persecute him in the persons of
   all his saints; for all things are perverse and at variance with the
   ways of the past. If there is any good man, he is scorned as though he
   were evil: if a man is evil, he is honored as though he were good. Is
   it then strange that we who daily grow worse, endure worse tortures
   daily? [212] For men daily invent new evils and do not forsake the old;
   fresh crimes spring up, but the old are not abandoned.

   8. Is there any room for further discussion? However hard and bitter
   our lot, we still suffer less than we deserve. Why should we complain
   that God deals harshly with us? We treat him much more rudely. We anger
   him by our impure acts and force him, unwilling though he is, to punish
   us. And although the spirit and majesty of God are such that he is not
   moved by any passion or anger, yet such is the aggravation of our sins
   that they drive him to wrath. If I may say so, we subject his loving
   kindness to force, and seem to lay violent hands on his mercy. For
   although he is so gentle that ho would like to spare us constantly, our
   perversity compels him to punish our sins. As those who blockade
   well-fortified cities or attempt to capture and undermine their mighty
   strongholds, customarily lay siege to them with all sorts of machines
   and weapons, so we attack the mercy of God with every kind of frightful
   sin as if we, too, were using siege engines. Then we think God injures
   us, though we are acting most injuriously toward him. Indeed every
   fault of all Christians is an insult to his divinity. "When we perform
   those acts that are forbidden by God we trample underfoot the orders of
   him who forbade us. It is impious to blame God's severity for our
   misfortunes: we should instead accuse ourselves. For when we commit the
   sins that cause our torture, we are ourselves the authors of our
   torments. Why then do we complain of the bitterness of our punishments?
   Each one of us punishes himself.

   This is why the prophet said to us: "Behold, all ye that kindle a fire,
   that have added fuel to the flame; walk in the light of your fire and
   in the sparks that ye have kindled." [213] For the whole human race is
   rushing headlong into eternal punishment by the very course that the
   Scriptures describe. First we kindle the fire, then add fuel to the
   flames, and lastly enter the flames that we have prepared. When does
   man first kindle eternal fire for himself? Surely when he first begins
   to sin. But when does he add fuel to the flames? When he heaps up sins
   upon sins. When shall he enter the everlasting fire? When he has
   already completed the irrevocable account of wickedness by the increase
   of his sins, as our Savior said to the leaders of the Jews: "Fill ye up
   then the measure of your fathers, ye serpents, ye generation of
   vipers," [214] The men whom the Lord himself told to fill up the
   measure were not far from completing the full number of their sins.
   Because they were no longer worthy of salvation, they filled up the
   number of iniquities by which they were to perish. Whence also, when
   the ancient Law recalled that the sins of the Amorreans [215] were
   fulfilled, it is said that the angels spoke to the blessed Lot, saying:
   "Whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place,
   because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord, and
   the Lord hath sent us to destroy them." [216] For a long time, truly,
   that most sinful people had been kindling the fires by which they
   perished, and so when the tale of their iniquities was completed they
   burned in the flames of their own crimes. For they deserved so ill of
   God that they suffered in this world the Gehenna that is to come in the
   later judgment.

   9. But, you say, none now deserve the end of those men, for none are to
   be compared with them, in evil doing. Perhaps that is true, still what
   do we make of the fact that the Savior himself said that all who have
   spurned his Gospel are worse than they? And at Capernaum he said: "If
   the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom,
   it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, that it
   shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment
   than for thee." [217] If he said the people of Sodom are less to be
   condemned than all who neglect the Gospels, then we who in most of our
   actions show our neglect of the Gospel teachings are in graver danger,
   especially since we are not willing to be content with crimes long
   familiar, that seem a part of our daily life. Many are not satisfied
   with the customary vices, with litigation, slander and rapine, with
   drunkenness and gorging at feasts, with forgeries and perjury, with
   adultery and homicide. Finally, however inhuman the atrocities
   involved, all the crimes involving injury to their fellow men are not
   enough for them, but they must needs turn the blasphemous violence of
   their mad minds against the Lord also. For it is written of the wicked:
   "They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh
   through the earth. . . . And they say, How doth God know, and is there
   knowledge in the Most High?'" And again: "The Lord shall not see,
   neither shall the God of Jacob regard it." [218]

   To such men this prophetic saying may well be applied: "The fool hath
   said in his heart, There is no God.'" [219] For they who declare that
   nothing is seen by God are very near to denying his actual substance,
   as they deny his sight, and when they say that he sees nothing they
   deny his very existence.

   Although no evil deed has any rational foundation, [220] since there is
   no bond between reason and wickedness, yet no blasphemy, in my opinion
   at least, is more irrational than this or more insane. What is so mad
   as for a man, who does not deny that God created the whole world, to
   deny that he governs it? How can one admit that God is its maker, and
   deny that he takes any care of what be made? As if his intention in
   creating the universe was to neglect it when completed! I say that he
   cares so much for his creatures that I can prove that he cared for them
   even before their creation; indeed, the very act of creation makes this
   clear. He would not have created the world, if his care had not
   preceded the act, especially since we know that in our human kind there
   is scarcely a man so stupid that he would carry an undertaking through
   to completion without the intention of taking care of it when finished.
   For a man who tills a field does so in order to keep it for his own use
   after it is cultivated; he who plants a vineyard means to take care of
   it when he has planted it; he who gathers the nucleus of a herd means
   to exercise his skill in increasing it. He who builds a house or lays
   its foundations, even though he has as yet no finished dwelling-place,
   still embodies in the building he is trying to erect the hopes of a
   future home.

   Yet why should I speak of man alone, when even the smallest sorts of
   animals do all things with a view to future use? [221] Ants, hiding
   various sorts of grain from [the fields] [222] in underground
   storerooms, drag away and store their hoards because they cherish them
   in their desire to live. Why do the bees, when they lay foundations for
   the honeycomb or pluck their young from flowers, [223] search out thyme
   except from their eager desire for honey, or certain other flowerets
   but from love of the young they are to find there?

   Has God then instilled this love of their own functions into even the
   least of living things, and deprived himself alone of the love of his
   works? Have you considered that all our love of good things has come
   down to us from his good love? He himself is the fount and source of
   all our benefits, and since, as it is written: "In him we live and move
   and have our being," [224] from him surely we have received all the
   affection we give our offspring; for the whole world and the whole
   human race are the offspring of their creator.

   Therefore by that very love he has caused us to feel for our sons he
   wished us to know how greatly he loved his own. For we read, just as
   "the invisible things of him are clearly seen, being understood by the
   things that are made," [225] even so he wished his love for us to be
   known by the love that he gave us toward our own kindred. As it is
   written that he wished all fatherhood in heaven and in earth to be
   named after him, [226] so he wished us to recognize his fatherly love.
   Yet why do I say fatherly? for his love is far more than a father's.
   This is proved by the words of the Savior in the Gospel, when he said:
   "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son for the
   life of the world." [227] But the apostle also says: "God spared not
   his own Son, but delivered him up for us all. How hath he not with him
   also freely given us all things?" [228]

   10. This confirms my former statement, that God loves us more than a
   father loves his son. It is clear that his love surpasses a man's love
   for his sons, since for our sake he did not spare his own child. Nay, I
   add more, he did not spare his righteous Son, his only begotten Son,
   his Son who is himself God. What more can be said? And this was done
   for us, that is for wicked, unjust and most irreverent men. Who can
   justify this love of God toward us, save that his justice is so great
   that no shadow of injustice can fall on him? As far as human reason is
   concerned, any man would have acted most unjustly if he had had his
   good son put to death for his worst slaves. But for this very reason
   the love of God is the more surpassing and his goodness the more
   marvellous, that, as far as human weakness is concerned, the greatness
   of his justice almost bears the appearance of injustice. Therefore the
   apostle, to indicate as far as he might the boundless mercy of God,
   said: "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
   for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die." [229]
   Certainly in this one sentence he showed us the love of God. For if
   scarcely any one undertakes to die for the greatest righteousness,
   Christ dying for our iniquity proved what love he bore us. Why God
   should have done this, the apostle tells us at once in the words that
   follow, saying: "God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we
   were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now
   justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
   [230] He commends his love to us, in that he died for sinners; for a
   benefit is of greater worth that is given to men unworthy of it.

   So he says: "God commends his love toward us." How does he commend it?
   Surely in that he bestows it on the undeserving. If he had given it to
   holy men who deserved well of him, he would not seem to have given what
   was not due, but what he owed them.

   What then have we given in return for this great boon, or what return
   ought we to make for it? First of all, what the most blessed prophet
   testifies that he owes and will give, saying: "What shall I render unto
   the Lord for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of
   salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord." [231] This is the first
   repayment, that we return death for death, and all die for him who died
   for us, even though our death is of much less account than his. Whence
   it comes that even if we take death upon us, we cannot by this means
   repay our debt. But since we cannot requite him more fully, we seem to
   be paying the whole, if we return him all that we can. This, therefore,
   as I said, is our first payment.

   The second is, if we do not pay our debt by death, to pay it by love.
   The Savior himself, as the apostle says, by his death wished to commend
   his love to us all, to lead us by the example of his loving care to
   make a fitting return for such great affection. And just as certain
   marvellous natural gems, when one brings them into contact with iron,
   though it be of the hardest kind, hold it in suspense by an attraction
   that seems actually possessed of life, so also he, the greatest and
   most glorious gem of the heavenly kingdom, wished to come down from
   heaven to approach more closely to us, to draw us, in spite of our
   hardness, to his care as if by the hands of his love, that recognizing
   his gifts and benefits we might come to know what it befitted us to do
   for so good a master when he had done so much for his wicked servants.
   Then should be fulfilled the words of the apostle, that we should be
   killed all the day long for his love, and neither tribulation nor
   distress nor persecution nor famine nor nakedness nor the sword should
   be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
   the Lord. [232]

   11. Since our indebtedness to God is clearly established, let us see
   what return we make him for all that we owe. What return, indeed, but
   all the actions of which I have spoken before, namely, whatever is
   indecent, whatever is unworthy, whatever leads to injury of God, wicked
   deeds, disgraceful habits, drunken feasts, bloodstained hands, vile
   lusts, mad passions and whatever else can better be reckoned up by the
   conscience than in words! "For," said the apostle, "it is a shame even
   to speak of those things which are done of them in secret." [233] Nor
   is this all, for it is an old charge, and belongs no more to the
   present time than to the past. More serious and lamentable is the fact
   that we are adding new sins to the old, sins not only new but of a
   monstrous and heathen sort, such as have not before been seen in the
   churches of God. We blasphemously revile the Lord, saying that he is a
   God who does not care for us, a God who pays us no attention, a God who
   neglects us, who does not govern us, and hence he is pitiless and
   obdurate, inhuman, harsh and cruel. For, since he is described as not
   regarding us, as careless and neglectful, what remains but to call him
   harsh and cruel and inhuman? What blind impudence! what sacrilegious
   boldness! It is not enough for us, that, bound in our countless sins,
   we are in all things guilty before God, unless we are also his
   accusers. Yet what hope, I ask, shall a man have, who, while facing
   judgment himself, brings accusation against his judge?

   12. If God does regard human affairs, some one may say, if he cares for
   us, loves and guides us, why does he allow us to be weaker and more
   miserable than all nations? Why does he suffer us to be conquered by
   the barbarians? Why does he permit us to be subject to the rule of our
   enemies? [234] To answer very briefly, as I have already said, he
   suffers us to endure these trials because we deserve to endure them.
   Let us consider the disgraceful habits, the vices and crimes of the
   Roman people, as we have described them above, and we shall then
   understand whether we can have any claim on his protection when we live
   in such impurity. If we examine in this light our customary argument
   that our misery and weakness show God's neglect of human affairs, what
   do we really deserve? If he permitted us, living in such vice and
   wickedness, to be exceedingly strong, prosperous and completely happy,
   then perhaps there might be some ground for suspicion that God did not
   see the evil-doing of the Romans, if he allowed such wicked and
   abandoned men to be happy. Since instead he bids such vicious and evil
   men to be most abject and wretched, it is perfectly evident that we are
   seen and judged by God, for our sufferings are fully deserved.

   We, of course, do not think we deserve them, and consequently are the
   more guilty and blameworthy for failing to recognize our deserts. The
   chief accusation of wrongdoers is their proud assertion of innocence.
   Among a number of men charged with the selfsame crime none is more
   guilty than he who does not acknowledge his guilt even in his own
   thoughts. We have, therefore, this single addition to make to our
   wrongdoings, that we consider ourselves guiltless.

   But, you may object, grant that we are sinners and wicked men,
   certainly you cannot deny that we are better than the barbarians, and
   this alone makes it clear that God does not watch over human affairs,
   because we, who are better, are subject to men worse than ourselves.
   Whether we are better than the barbarians, we shall now consider;
   certainly there can be no doubt that we ought to be better. And for
   this very reason, we are worse than they, unless we are actually
   better, for the more honorable position makes any fault doubly
   blameworthy. The greater the personal dignity of the sinner, the
   greater is the odium of his sin. [235] Theft for example is a serious
   crime in any man, but a thieving senator is doubtless far more to be
   condemned than one of the lower classes. Fornication is. forbidden to
   all, but it is a much more serious vice in one of the clergy than in
   one of the people. So also we, who are said to be Christians and
   catholic, if we are guilty of vices like those of the barbarians, sin
   more seriously than they, for sins committed by men who claim a holy
   name are the more abominable. The more lofty our claim to honor, the
   greater is our fault; the very religion we profess accuses our faults,
   A pledge of chastity increases the sin of lewdness; drunkenness is more
   loathsome in one who makes an outward show of sobriety. Nothing is more
   vile than a philosopher who pursues a vicious and obscene life, since
   in addition to the natural baseness of his vices, he is further branded
   by his reputation for wisdom. We therefore, who out of the whole human
   race have professed the Christian philosophy, for this reason, must be
   believed and considered worse than all other nations, since, living
   under so great a profession of faith, in the very bosom of religion, we
   still sin.

   13. I know it seems to most men intolerable that we should be called
   worse than barbarians. What possible good does it do us to have this
   seem intolerable? Our condition is made so much the more serious if we
   are worse than they and yet insist on believing ourselves better. "For
   if a man think himself to be something," the apostle said, "when he is
   nothing, he deceiveth himself. But let every man prove his own work."
   [236] We ought to put our trust in our works, not in our opinion; in
   reason, not lust; in truth, not in our will alone.

   Since, then, some men think it unsupportable that we should be adjudged
   to be worse, or even not much better than the barbarians, let us
   consider in what way we are better, and in relation to which of the
   barbarians. For there are two kinds of barbarians in the world, that
   is, heretics and pagans. [237] To all of these, as far as the divine
   law is concerned, I declare that we are incomparably superior; as far
   as our life and actions are concerned, I say with grief and lamentation
   that we are worse. However, as I said before, let us not make this
   statement of the whole body of Romans without exception. For I except
   first of all those men who have devoted themselves to a religious life,
   and then some laymen who are equal to them; or, if that is too much to
   say, at least very like them in their upright and honorable actions. As
   for the rest, all or practically all are more guilty than the
   barbarians. And to be more guilty is to be worse.

   Therefore, since some men think it irrational and absurd that we should
   be judged as worse, or even not much better than the barbarians, let us
   see, as I said, how we are worse, and in relation to which barbarians.
   Now I say that except for those Romans alone, whom I mentioned just
   now, the others are all or almost all more guilty than the barbarians,
   and more criminal in their lives. You who read these words are perhaps
   vexed and condemn what you read. I do not shrink from your censure;
   condemn me if I do not succeed in proving my words; condemn me if I do
   not show that the Sacred Scriptures also have said what 1 now claim. I
   myself who say that we Romans, who judge ourselves far superior to all
   other nations on earth, are worse in many respects, do not deny that in
   certain ways we are superior. For while we are, as I have said, worse
   in our way of life and in our sins, yet in living under the catholic
   law we are incomparably superior. But we must consider this, that while
   it is not our merit that the law is good, it is our fault that we live
   badly. Surely it profits us nothing that our law is good, if our life
   and conversation are not; for the good law is the gift of Christ,
   whereas the faulty life is our own responsibility. On the contrary, we
   are more blameworthy if the law we worship is good and we who worship
   it are evil. Nay, we do not worship it, if we are evil, for an evil
   worshipper cannot be properly said to worship at all. He who does not
   worship sacredly that which is holy does not worship at all, and hereby
   the very law we hold accuses us.

   14. Disregarding, therefore, the privilege of the law, which either
   does not help us or even brings just condemnation upon us, let us
   compare the lives, the aims, the customs and the vices of the
   barbarians with our own. The barbarians are unjust and we are also;
   they are avaricious and so are we; they are faithless and so are we; to
   sum up, the barbarians and ourselves are alike guilty of all evils and
   impurities.

   Perhaps the answer may be made: if we are equal to them in viciousness,
   why are we not also equal to them in strength? Inasmuch as their
   wickedness is like ours and their guilt identical, either we should be
   as strong as they, or they as weak as we. That is true, and the natural
   conclusion is that we who are weaker are the more guilty. What proof
   have we? The proof is, of course, inherent in my demonstration that God
   does everything in accordance with judgment. For if, as it is written:
   "The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the
   good:" [238] and in the words of the apostle: "The judgment of God is
   according to truth against all wicked men," [239] we, who do not cease
   to do evil, see that it is by the judgment of a just God that we endure
   the penalties for our evil-doing. But, you object, the barbarians
   commit the same sins, and yet are not as wretched as we. There is this
   difference between us, that even if the barbarians do the same things
   that we do, our sins are still more grievous than theirs. For our vices
   and theirs can be equal without their guilt being as great as ours. All
   of them, as I said before, are either pagans or heretics. I shall
   discuss the pagans first, since theirs is the older delusion: among
   these, the nation of the Saxons is savage, the Franks treacherous, the
   Gepids ruthless, the Huns lewd--so we see that the life of all the
   barbarians is full of vice. Can you say that their vices imply the same
   guilt as ours, that the lewdness of the Huns is as sinful as ours, the
   treachery of the Franks as worthy of accusation, the drunkenness of the
   Alemanni as reprehensible as that of Christians, the greed of an Alan
   as much to be condemned as that of a believer?

   If a Hun or Gepid is deceitful what wonder is it in one who is utterly
   ignorant of the guilt involved in falsehood? If a Frank swears falsely,
   what is strange in his action, since he thinks perjury a figure of
   speech, and not a crime? And why is it strange that the barbarians have
   this degree of vice, since they know not the law and God, when a
   majority of the Romans, who know that they are sinning, take the same
   attitude?

   Not to speak of any other type of man, let us consider only the throngs
   of Syrian merchants who have seized the greater part of all our
   towns--is their life anything else than plotting, trickery and wearing
   falsehood threadbare? [240] They think words practically wasted that do
   not bring some profit to their speaker. Among these men God's
   prohibition of an oath is held in such high esteem that they consider
   every sort of perjury actually profitable to them. What wonder is it,
   then, that the barbarians, who do not know that falsehood is a sin,
   practice deception? None of their actions are due to contempt of the
   divine ordinances, for they do not know the precepts of God. A man
   ignorant of the law cannot act in defiance of it. This is our peculiar
   guilt, who read the divine law and constantly violate its terms, who
   say that we know God and yet walk roughshod over his commands and
   precepts; and therefore, since we despise him whom we believe and boast
   that we worship, the very appearance of worship is an injury to him.

   15. Lastly, to say nothing of our other sins, who is there among
   laymen, except a very few, that does not constantly have the name of
   Christ on his lips to swear by it? Hence this is the oath most commonly
   used by nobles and baseborn men alike: "By Christ I do this . . . ; by
   Christ I act thus . . . ; by Christ I am not going to say anything else
   . . . ; by Christ I am not going to do anything else." And what
   results? The abuse has been carried so far that, as we said before
   about heathen barbarians, Christ's name seems now to be not a binding
   oath but a mere expletive. For among the great majority this name is
   held to be so trivial that men never have less intention of doing a
   thing than when they swear by Christ to do it. Although it is written:
   "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain," [241]
   reverence for Christ has fallen so low that among all the vain words of
   this age scarcely any seems more vainly used than the name of Christ.

   Then many swear by the name of Christ to do things not merely trivial
   and foolish but even criminal. For this is their usual manner of
   speaking: "By Christ I'll steal that . . . ; by Christ I'll wound that
   man . . . ; by Christ I'll murder him." It has come to such a pass that
   they feel themselves bound by religion to commit the crimes they have
   sworn in Christ's name.

   Finally, let me tell an experience of my own. A short time ago, won
   over by the pleas of a certain poor man, I besought a man of
   considerable influence not to take from the poor wretch his property
   and substance, not to remove the sole prop and help that supported his
   poverty. Then he, who had swallowed the poor man's goods in ravenous
   haste, and had already devoured his prey with most ardent ambition and
   greed, glared at me with eyes blazing as if he thought I might take
   from him something he had not succeeded in filching from the other, and
   said he could not possibly do as I asked, since he was acting in
   accordance with a sacred command or decree that he absolutely could not
   overlook. When I asked the reason, he said most emphatically, brooking
   no contradiction: "I have made a vow to seize that man's property.
   Consider then whether I could or should fail to accomplish what I have
   sworn by the name of Christ." Then I left him, having heard the reason
   for his most pious crime, for what else was I to do, when his action
   was shown to be so just and sacred!

   16. At this point I ask all who are of sound mind: who would ever
   believe that human covetousness would reach such a pitch of audacity,
   would ever scorn God so openly that men should say it is for Christ's
   sake they intend to do a deed the very performance of which is an
   insult to Christ? "What an unthinkable and monstrous crime! Of what
   daring are the wicked minds of men not capable? They arm themselves for
   robbery in God's name; they make him somehow responsible for their
   crimes, and although Christ forbids and punishes all sin they claim
   that they perform their wicked deeds for his sake.

   Yet we, complaining of the injustice of the enemy, say that the heathen
   barbarians are guilty of perjury. How much less guilty are they who
   swear falsely by demons, than we who swear by Christ! How much less
   serious a crime it is to take the name of Jove in vain than that of
   Christ! In the one case it is a dead man by whom they swear, [242] in
   the other the living God by whose name they swear falsely. In the
   former instance there is no longer even a man; in the latter, the most
   high God; here, since the oath was taken in the most binding name, the
   greatest guilt and perjury must be involved; there, since that by which
   they swear scarcely exists, clearly there is no perjury, for since the
   God by whom they swear does not exist, there is no perjury when the
   oath is broken. Finally, let him who wishes to know the truth of this
   matter listen to the blessed apostle Paul uttering the very arguments I
   am giving. These are his words: "Now we know that what things soever
   the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law." And again:
   "Where no law is, there is no transgression." [243] In these two
   statements, did he not make clear that there are two divisions of the
   human race, those placed without the law, and those living under it?
   What men are there who now live under the law? Who indeed but the
   Christians? Such was the apostle himself, who said of himself: "I am
   not without law to God, but under the law to Christ." [244]

   Who then are outside the law of Christ? Who but pagans ignorant of the
   Lord's law? Therefore it is of these that he says: "Where no law is,
   there is no transgression." By this one word he shows that only
   Christians transgress the law when they sin, but the pagans who do not
   know the law sin without transgression, since no one can transgress in
   a matter of which he is ignorant. We alone therefore are transgressors
   of the divine law, we who, as it is written, read the law and do not
   follow it. Hence our knowledge brings us nothing but guilt, since its
   result is only that we give the more offence by our sins, for what we
   know from our reading and in our hearts, we spurn in our wantonness and
   scorn.

   So the words of the apostle to every Christian man were most justly
   spoken: "Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the
   law dishonorest thou God? For the name of God is blasphemed among the
   Gentiles through you." [245]

   Of what crimes the Christians are guilty may be learned from this one
   fact, that they defame the name of God. And although we have been
   charged to "do all things for the glory of God" [246] we, on the
   contrary, do all things for his injury. Although the Savior daily calls
   to us: "Let your light so shine before men, that the sons of men may
   see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven," [247]
   we, on the other hand, so live that the sons of men may see our evil
   deeds and blaspheme our Father which is in heaven.

   17. This being the case, we may indeed beguile ourselves with the great
   prerogatives of the name of Christian, we who so act and live that by
   the very fact that we are said to be a Christian people we seem to be a
   reproach to Christ. On the other hand, what do we find of this sort
   among the pagans? Can it be said of the Huns: "See what sort of men
   these are who are called Christians?" Can it be said of the Saxons or
   the Franks: "See what these men do who claim to worship Christ?" Can
   the sacred law be blamed for the savage customs of the Moors? Do the
   most inhuman rites of Scythians or Gepids bring curses and blasphemy on
   the name of the Lord our Savior? Can it be said of any of these: "Where
   is the catholic law that they believe? Where are the commandments of
   piety and chastity that they learn? They read the Gospel, and are
   unchaste; they listen to the apostles, and get drunk; they follow
   Christ, and plunder; they lead dishonorable lives, and say that they
   follow an honorable law." Can such things be said of any of these
   nations? Certainly not, but they are all truly said of us: in us Christ
   suffers reproach; in us the Christian law is accursed. Of us are said
   the words quoted above: "See what sort of men these are who worship
   Christ. They are plainly lying when they say that they learn good
   things, and boast that they keep the commandments of the sacred law.
   For if they learned good things they would be good. Their religion must
   be like its followers: doubtless they are what they are taught to be.
   Thus it appears that the prophets they have teach impurity; and the
   apostles they read have sanctioned wickedness; and the Gospel which
   they have learned preaches the actions that they perform; in fine, the
   lives of the Christians would be holy, if Christ had taught holiness.
   So the object of their worship must be judged from his worshippers. How
   can the teacher be good whose pupils we see are so evil? In him they
   are Christians--they hear Christ himself and read his words. It is easy
   for us all to learn the teachings of Christ. See what the Christians
   do, and you will clearly discern the teachings of Christ."

   Finally, what distorted and wicked notions the pagans have always had
   about the sacraments of the Lord is shown by the bloody inquisitions of
   brutal persecutors, who believed that at Christian services only vile
   and abominable rites were performed. Even the origins of our religion
   were thought to spring from two great crimes, the first being murder
   and the second incest, which is worse than murder. Nor were these mere
   murder and incest, but a more wicked thing than the bare commission of
   either of these crimes, the incest of holy mothers, and the murder of
   innocent infants, whom, they thought, the Christians not only murdered,
   but--which is more abominable--devoured.

   All this was supposed to be done to appease God, as if any evil would
   cause him greater offence! as an offering to atone for sin, as if any
   sin could be greater! to make him look with favor on sacrifices, as if
   any act could better arouse his aversion and horror! to win the right
   to eternal life, as if indeed, even supposing it could be won by such
   actions, it were worth while to attain it by such atrocious crimes!

   18. We may understand from this what the pagans have come to believe
   about the character of Christians, who worship God in such sacrifices,
   and what sort of God they think could have taught such things as sacred
   rites. Yet how did this belief arise? How else but through those who
   are called Christians, but are not; who by their shameful and
   disgraceful lives sully the name of their religion; who, as it is
   written, "profess that they know God, but in works deny him, being
   abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate"; [248]
   by whom, as we read, "the way of truth is evil spoken of" [249] and the
   sacred name of God violated by the profanity of sacrilegious men.

   How very difficult it is to atone for subjecting the name of divinity
   to the evil-speaking of the heathen, we are taught by the example of
   the most blessed David. By the suffrage of his former acts of justice
   he deserved to win release by a single act of confession, from eternal
   punishment for his offences. Yet even the penitence that pleaded for
   him did not avail to win pardon for, this grievous sin. For when Nathan
   the prophet had heard him confess his fault, and said to him: "The Lord
   hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not die," he added at once: "Howbeit,
   because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of
   the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born of thee shall surely
   die." [250]

   What followed? He laid aside his diadem, cast off his jewels, doffed
   the purple, gave up all the splendor of his royal state, and instead
   shut himself up alone in mourning, foully clad in sackcloth, drenched
   with his tears and besmirched with ashes. Yet though he sought the life
   of his little child with such lamentations and entreaties, and strove
   to move the tender heart of God with such fervent prayers, all his
   pleas and protests could not obtain his pardon, even though he had
   firmly believed that he should gain what he sought from God--which is
   the greatest aid to those who pray. From this we learn that there is
   absolutely no sin for which it is harder to atone than that of giving
   the heathen occasion to blaspheme. For whoever has gravely sinned
   without causing others to blaspheme brings condemnation only on
   himself, but he who has made others blaspheme drags many men down to
   death with him, and must be held answerable for all whom he has
   implicated in his guilt. Nor is this all; whenever a man sins; in such
   a way that his action does not give others occasion for blasphemy, his
   sin injures only him who has committed it, but does not insult the holy
   name of God by the sacrilegious curses of blasphemy. But if his
   wrongdoing has caused others to blaspheme, his sin must be immeasurably
   great, beyond the bounds of human guilt, for by the revilings of many
   he has caused incalculable insult to God.

   19. Moreover, as I have said, this evil is peculiar to us Christians,
   because God is blasphemed only through the agency of those who know the
   good and do evil; who, as it is written: "Profess that they know God,
   but in works deny him"; [251] who, as the same apostle says: "Rest in
   the law and know his will, and approve the things that are more
   excellent; who have the form of knowledge and of truth in the law; who
   preach a man should not steal, and themselves steal; who say a man
   should not commit adultery and themselves commit it; who make their
   boast in the law and through breaking the law dishonor God." [252]

   The Christians are worse than other men for the very reason that they
   ought to be better. They do not justify their profession of faith, but
   light against it by their evil lives. For evil doing is the more
   damnable in contrast with an honorable title; and a holy name becomes a
   crime in an impious man. Therefore our Savior also says in the
   Apocalypse to a lukewarm Christian: "I would thou wert hot or cold; so
   then because thou art lukewarm, I will spue thee out of my mouth."
   [253]

   The Lord commanded every Christian to be fervent in faith and spirit.
   For it is written: "That we may be fervent in spirit, serving the
   Lord." [254] In this fervor of spirit the ardor of religious faith is
   made known; he who has the largest share of such ardor is recognized as
   fervent and faithful, while he who has none at all is known to be cold
   and an unbeliever. But he who is betwixt and between is a lukewarm
   Christian and hateful to the Lord, who therefore says to him: "Would
   that thou wert hot or cold, now therefore since thou art lukewarm I
   will spue thee out of my mouth." That is to say: "Would that you had
   either the heat and faith of good Christians or the ignorance of
   pagans. For then either your warm faith would make you pleasing to God,
   or at least for the time being your ignorance of the law would give you
   some measure of excuse. But as it is, since you know Christ, and
   neglect him whom you know, you who have, so to speak, been received
   into the very presence of God by the recognition of the faith, are cast
   out because of lukewarmness."

   The blessed apostle Peter also made this plain when he said of the
   lukewarm and vicious Christians, that is, those who live wicked lives:
   "For it had been better for them not to have known the truth, than
   after they had known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered
   unto them. But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb,
   The dog is turned to his own vomit again, and the sow that was washed
   to her wallowing in the mire.'" [255]

   To make clear that this was said of those who live under the name of
   Christian in the vileness and filth of the world, hear what he says of
   such men in the same passage: "For if, after they had escaped the
   pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior
   Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the
   latter end is worse with them than the beginning." [256] This, indeed,
   the blessed Paul repeats in like manner: "For circumcision verily
   profiteth, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law,
   thy circumcision is made uncircumcision." [257] He himself shows very
   clearly that by circumcision Christianity is to be understood when he
   says: "For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit and
   have no confidence in the flesh." [258] By this we see that he is
   comparing the wicked Christians with pagans, and not merely comparing
   them but almost ranking them as of less account, when he says:
   "However, if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law,
   shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? And shall not
   uncircumcision, which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee,
   who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?" [259]

   From this we learn, as I said before, that we are much more
   blameworthy, who have the law and reject it, than those who neither
   have it at all nor know it, for no one despises what he does not know.
   "I had not known lust," the apostle says, "except the law had said,
   Thou shalt not covet," [260] Nor do men transgress the law which they
   do not know, for, as it is written: "Where no law is, there is no
   transgression." [261] If men do not transgress the law which they have
   not, neither do they despise the terms of the law which they have not,
   for no one, as I said, can despise what he does not know.

   We, therefore, are alike scorners and transgressors of the law, and
   thus we are worse than the pagans, because they do not know the
   ordinances of God, but we know them; they do not possess them, but we
   do; they do not perform precepts they have not heard, but we read and
   trample them under our feet. Hence what with them is ignorance is in us
   transgression, since there is less guilt in ignorance of the law than
   in contempt of it.

   [195] Even the imperial estates suffered from such encroachments; cf.
   the decree of Arcadius and Honorius, A.D. 399, providing for
   restitution of property unjustly seized on the imperial estates, and
   for a double penalty if restitution was delayed beyond a period of
   three months, applying also to those who had fled, unless they returned
   to restore the property stolen. The penalty applied to judges also if
   they did not give evidence against the exactores and conpulsores who
   were guilty. It is noteworthy that the decree claimed that but for the
   imperial clemency a fourfold penalty should have been exacted; one
   suspects impotence rather than clemency as the reason for the lighter
   fine (Cod. Theod. X. 1.10). On the general situation, cf. V. 8. infra.

   [196] Ecclesiasticus 13. 19.

   [197] Compare the description of Arvandus, praetorian prefect of Gaul,
   given by Sidonius Apollinaris Ep. I. 7.3, "He governed his first
   prefecture with great distinction, and his second with great
   destruction." Again, in Ep. V. 13 Sidonius described the "monster"
   Seronatus, "exhausting the individuals scattered outside the towns by
   unheard of forms of inflictions, and ensnaring them by the sinuous
   deceits of his calumnies." The same Seronatus (Ep. II. 1) "levies taxes
   as a master, exacts payments like a judge, slanders like a barbarian .
   . , fills the woods daily with fugitives, the villas with enemies, the
   altars with accused men, the prisons with clergy." We learn, however,
   from Ep. VII. 7. 2 that he was at last brought to justice and put to
   death, though the government hesitated to act against him.

   [198] So Sidonius, Ep. V. 13, said of Seronatus: "Some are freed by his
   venality, others by his vanity, none by his mercy."

   [199] On this whole passage cf. Haemmerle, Studia Salviana, I. 4, pp.
   29-33.

   [200] Since Gaul was overrun by the barbarians earlier than Spain, the
   latter province suffered heavier taxation at the hands of the imperial
   prefects, who tried to make up the Gallic deficit in the imperial
   taxation from this source. Cf. Orosius VII. 41. 7: "There are certain
   Romans among them who prefer to sustain poverty in freedom among the
   barbarians than the constant oppression of taxation among the Romans."

   [201] Africa, being under the praetorian prefect of Italy, as Spain was
   under that of Gaul, also suffered from the increase of taxation to make
   up for losses in Italy.

   [202] See Sidonius Ep. III. 6. 3: "Certainly the provinces are much
   discussed; a good year depends less on the crops than the officials."
   Again, in Ep. IV. 24. 5, Sidonius illustrated the "integrity of a few"
   by persuading an official friend to grant a year's immunity from taxes,
   and cancellation of the interest due, to a more straitened taxpayer, to
   free him "from the barbarous demands of the collectors yapping around
   him."

   [203] This attitude, however, was in defiance of a decree of
   Constantine of A.D. 319 (Cod. Just. IX. 14. 1), which made a master who
   intentionally killed a slave guilty of homicide, whatever was the
   method used.

   [204] Jeremiah 5. 8.

   [205] The increase of concubinage in the fourth century led to
   progressive legalization of the institution. Constantine in A.D. 326
   forbade it unconditionally (Cod. Just. V. 26) ; Arcadius and Honorius
   in 405 strictly limited the inheritance of concubines and their
   children (Ibid. 27. 2) ; Theodosius and Valentinian in 443 (Ibid. 27.
   3) provided that natural sons might have full inheritance rights if
   they entered the curial class, and natural daughters if they married
   curials. The last decree illustrates also how fiscal necessities led to
   increasing leniency on the part of the government toward the frailties
   of the propertied class, especially when direct benefit to the treasury
   would result.

   [206] See Jerome Adv. Rufinum I. 11: "When vice is attacked
   anonymously, the man who is angry at the attack accuses himself. It
   were the part of a prudent man, therefore, though annoyed, to hide his
   guilt and cover his clouded heart by a bright front."

   [207] This mention of the notion, prevalent in the fifth century, of
   the old age of the Roman power, is somewhat at variance with Salviun's
   usual point of view. Sidonius used "the old age of the world" as a
   commonplace (cf. Ep. VIII. 6. 3); Cyprian (Ad Demetrianum 4) made it
   the chief answer to the usual charges against the Christians: "You
   blame the Christians because as the world grows old its parts are
   weakened." Salvian, on the other hand, saw the old regime as continuing
   with new vigor, gained from the barbarians, to take the place of the
   old vices.

   [208] The efforts of the central government to do away with such
   inequalities are illustrated by the decree of Gratian, Theodosius and
   Valentinian, a.d. 383 (Cod. Theod. XI. 13. 1) : "Let all the privileges
   granted to a few individuals to the destruction of the many be
   annulled, and all who have received immunities of this sort by any
   means be reduced to an equal lot with the other provincials . . . "; by
   the decree of the same emperors in 385 (Ibid. I. 20) providing that all
   be bound "by the same equal form of levy"; and by that of Arcadius and
   Honorius in 399 (Ibid. I. 26) removing all privilege, making all men
   equally subject to taxation, especially in "those provinces from which
   the complaint arises." The repetition of such provisions illustrates
   clearly enough the futility of enacting them, which increased in the
   fifth century.

   [209] See V. 8 infra. We are reminded, however, how much the rich also
   had to complain of the burdens of taxation, by the description
   (Sidonius Ep. V. 17. 5) of a church festival of which the crowning
   pleasure was the conversation of Sidonius and his wealthy friends with
   "no mention of the imperial officers or of the taxes, not a word to be
   betrayed, and no one to betray it."

   [210] I John 5. 19.

   [211] See V. 10, infra: "Thinking the service of God depends more on
   costume than on actions, they have changed their garments but not their
   hearts." Caesarius of Arles, who is said by Cyprian (Vita I. 1. 11)
   never to have given up in the slightest degree the customs of the
   brothers at Lérins, said in the first chapter of his Regula ad monachos
   (Migne, PL, LXVII, col. 1099) : "In the first place if any man come to
   conversion . . . let his lay garments not be changed, unless he have
   first made bills of sale for his possessions." Elsewhere he said
   (Epistola ad germanos, ibid. col. 1155): "To lay aside secular garments
   and put on religious ones is the work of a moment. . . . Let him not be
   wont to wear a style of clothing either too mean, or displaying pride
   by frequent change, or of a ruinous elegance." Evidently, then, his
   idea of a religious habit was not a set uniform, but one distinguished
   from secular clothing chiefly by its simplicity. The emphasis laid by
   this prominent alumnus of the monastery at Lérins on the change in
   clothing as an indication of the adoption of a religious life seems
   adequate to settle the question much mooted among editors of Salvian,
   whether the change of garments in the present passage is to be taken
   literally or figuratively.

   [212] See Cyprian Ad Demetrianum 10: "And do you wonder that the wrath
   of God increasingly punishes the human race, when the sins to be
   punished increase daily?"

   [221] Cf. Lactantius De ira Dei 10. 44: "Nor is it probable that the
   smaller and humbler creatures should have a rule of life, while the
   larger and chief ones lack it."

   [222] There appears to be a slight lacuna in the text, unless, as
   Hartel conjectures (cf. Pauly's note ad loc.), the preposition ex, for
   which an object is here supplied, has crept into the MS text from a
   marginal notation, ex standing for exempla.

THE FIFTH BOOK

   1. I know that there are men, utterly lacking in faith and void of the
   divine truth, who think they have an easy answer to my arguments. They
   say that if the guilt of unfaithful Christians is so great that they
   sin more in disregarding the commands of the Lord which they know, than
   do the heathen tribes in their ignorance, then ignorance has proved of
   more benefit to the pagans than knowledge, and knowledge of the truth
   is only an obstacle to the Christians.

   My answer must be this: it is not the truth that stands in our way, but
   our own vices; not the law that does us injury, but our evil ways. In
   brief, give us good ways of living and the decrees of the law are in
   our favor; take away our vices and the law helps us. "For we know," the
   apostle said, "that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; knowing
   this, that the law is not made for a righteous man." Therefore, begin
   to be just, and you shall be free from the law, because the law cannot
   act against the holy life, in which it consists. "For we know," he
   said, "that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully; knowing this,
   that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and
   disobedient, for the unholy, for the ungodly and for sinners, and if
   there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine." [262] So
   the law is not so much fighting against you, my friend, as you against
   the law, nor does it by its good precepts take action against you, but
   you against it by your evil life. In fact, it is on your side, but you
   are against it. It gives you good counsel with holy words, while you
   fight against it with evil deeds, and yet not so much against it as
   against yourself. To oppose it is to oppose yourself, since in it lie
   your life and safety. When you desert the divine law, you abandon your
   own salvation. Thus our complaints of the Lord's law are like those of
   an impatient invalid against an excellent doctor. When his own fault
   has increased his illness, he accuses his physician of incompetence. As
   if, indeed, prescriptions could cure any illness if the patient did not
   obey them, or the regimen ordered by the physician work a cure if the
   patient did not follow it. What good can bitter draughts do the stomach
   if sweet ones are taken immediately after? What good can the silence of
   those about him do the delirious patient whose own ravings are killing
   him? Of what avail will the antidote be if the poison is poured over
   it?

   Now in our case the law is the antidote, the poison our wickedness. The
   antidote of the law cannot cure us who are being killed by the poison
   of our own vice. But of these matters I have said enough before, and if
   occasion arises shall speak again later with God's help.

   2. Meanwhile, since I mentioned above that there are two classes or
   sects of barbarians, namely, pagans and heretics, and I have already, I
   think, said enough of the pagans, let me now add what is necessary
   about the heretics. For my opponent may say: "Even if the divine law
   does not exact of the pagans that they keep commandments they do not
   know, it certainly does exact this of the heretics who know them; for
   they read the same books we do; they have the same prophets, the same
   apostles, the same evangelists, and therefore they are no less guilty
   than we are of neglect of the law. Really their neglect is much worse
   than ours, for although their Scriptures are the same, their actions
   are much worse."

   Let us consider both points. You say that they read the same books we
   do. How can their books be the same, being badly interpolated and
   falsified by unscrupulous men? They are not the same at all, for they
   cannot be said to keep their identity unchanged if they are corrupted
   in any part. Having lost their full completeness they are not unharmed,
   and being robbed of the power of the sacraments they do not keep their
   true value. We alone, therefore, have the Sacred Scriptures in full,
   unviolated and complete, who either drink them at their fount, or at
   least drawn from the purest source by the agency of an incorrupt
   translation; we alone read them well. I wish we might fulfil them as
   well as we read them! But I fear that we who fail to keep them do not
   read them correctly either. For there is less guilt in not reading the
   holy words than in reading and violating them. The other nations either
   do not possess the law of God or have it in a changed and weakened
   form, and, as I said, to have it in such a condition is the same thing
   as not to have it at all.

   If there are any among the barbarians who seem in their books to
   possess the Sacred Scriptures less interpolated and torn to pieces than
   the rest, still the corruptions in their texts are due to the tradition
   of their first teachers, whose disciples hold rather to their tradition
   than to the Scripture itself. For they do not abide by the instructions
   of the true law, but by the interpolations of an evil and distorted
   interpretation.

   The barbarians, indeed, lacking the Roman training or any other sort of
   civilized education, knowing nothing whatever unless they have heard it
   from their teachers, follow blindly what they hear. Such men,
   completely ignorant of literature and wisdom, are sure to learn the
   mysteries of the divine law through instruction rather than reading,
   and to retain their masters' doctrines rather than the law itself. Thus
   the interpretation and doctrine of their teachers have usurped the
   authority of the law among them, since they know only what they are
   taught. So they are heretics, but unwittingly. [263] Indeed it is only
   among us that they are heretics, and not among themselves, for they are
   so sure of their own orthodoxy that they libel us in turn by the
   accusation of heresy. As they are to us, so are we to them. We are
   convinced that they injure the holy incarnation in calling the Son
   inferior to the Father: they think that we do injury to the Father in
   believing the two equal. The truth is on our side, but they claim it
   for theirs. We truly honor God but they think their belief honors his
   divinity the more. They fall short in their Christian duty, but through
   what they think its fullest performance; their lack of reverence seems
   to them true piety. So they err, but with the best intentions, not
   through hatred, but through love of God, believing that they honor and
   love him. Although they have not the true faith, yet they think they
   possess the perfect love of God. How they shall be punished for the
   error of their false opinion on the day of judgment, none can know but
   the Judge. In the meantime, God bears with them patiently, I think, for
   he sees that though they have not the true faith, yet their error is
   due to the love of what appears to be the truth, especially since he
   knows that their wrongdoing is due to ignorance, while among us men
   neglect what they believe. So their sin is the fault of their teachers,
   while ours is our own; theirs is committed in ignorance, ours in full
   knowledge; they do what they think right, but we what we know to be
   perverse. Therefore with just judgment the patience of God bears with
   them but punishes us, because ignorance may be pardoned for a time, but
   contempt deserves no lenience. For it is written: "The servant who
   knows not his lord's will and does it not, shall be beaten with few
   stripes, but he who knows it and does it not, shall be beaten with
   many." [264]

   3. Let us not wonder that we are beaten with many stripes, since we err
   not through ignorance but through rebellion. For knowing the good we do
   not perform it, and knowing the distinction between right and wrong we
   pursue the wrong. We read the law and trample underfoot what is lawful;
   we learn the decrees of the sacred ordinances only to increase the
   gravity of our sins after their prohibition; we say that we worship
   God, but give our service to the devil. After all this, we wish to
   receive good gifts from God, while we heap wrong upon wrong
   continually; we wish to have God do our will, though we are unwilling
   to do his. We treat with him as his superiors; we wish him to accede to
   our wishes constantly, though we constantly fight against his.

   But he is just, however unjust we may be; for he punishes those he
   thinks deserve punishment, and bears with those he thinks deserve his
   patience. In each case his end is the same, that his chastisement of
   the orthodox may restrain their lust for sinning, and his forbearance
   at length bring the heretics to recognize the full truth of the faith,
   especially since he knows that those men are not apt to be unworthy of
   the catholic faith whom he sees superior to the orthodox in their way
   of living. All those of whom I speak are either Vandals or Goths, [265]
   for I say nothing of the multitude of Roman heretics, and shall not
   compare them with either Romans or barbarians, since their lack of
   faith makes them worse than the Romans, and their disgraceful lives
   than the barbarians. That the men of whom I speak are Romans, far from
   helping us, makes our case even worse. It is easy to estimate what the
   whole Roman state deserves, when part of the Romans offend God by their
   way of life, part by their lack of faith and their way of living also.
   Add that the very heresies of the barbarians spring originally from the
   false teaching they received from the Romans, and the inception of
   heresy among them becomes another heavy charge against us. [266]

   4. But as for the way of life among the Goths and Vandals, in what
   single respect can we consider ourselves superior to them, or even
   worthy of comparison? Let me speak first of their affection and
   charity, which the Lord teaches us are the chief of virtues, and which
   he commends not only through the Sacred Scriptures but also in his own
   words, when he says: "By this shall all men know that ye are my
   disciples, if ye love one another." [267] Now almost all barbarians, at
   least those who belong to one tribe, under one king's rule, love one
   another, whereas almost all the Romans are at strife with one another.
   What citizen is there who does not envy his fellows? Who shows complete
   charity to his neighbors? All are indeed far from their neighbors in
   affection, however near in place; though living side by side, they are
   far apart in spirit. While this is a most grievous wrong, I wish it
   were true only of citizens and neighbors. But the situation is still
   more serious, for not even relations preserve the bonds of kinship. Who
   renders a brotherly service for his next of kin? Who pays to family
   affection the debt he knows is due to the name he bears? Who is as
   closely related by his affections as by blood? Who is not fired with a
   dark passion of ill will? Whose emotions are not the prey of envy? Who
   does not look on another's good fortune as his own punishment? Who does
   not reckon another's good as his own evil? Who finds his own good
   fortune so ample that he is willing that another should be fortunate
   also? Most men are now suffering a strange and incalculable evil, in
   that it is not enough for any man to be happy himself unless another is
   thereby made wretched. What a situation is this, how savage, how rooted
   in the same impiety we deplore, how alien to barbarians and familiar to
   Romans, that they proscribe one another by mutual exactions. My last
   words, perhaps, give a wrong impression, for it would be much more
   tolerable if each man endured what he himself had inflicted on others.
   The present situation is harder to bear, for the many are proscribed by
   the few, who use the public levies for their individual gain, and
   convert the bills of indebtedness to the public treasury to their
   private profit. [268] Nor is it only the highest officials who do this,
   but the least too in almost equal measure; not only the judges, but
   their obedient underlings as well. [269]

   For what cities are there, or even what municipalities and villages, in
   which there are not as many tyrants as curials? [270] Still perhaps
   they preen themselves on their title, since it seems to be one of power
   and honor. Brigands usually rejoice and exult at being considered
   somewhat more ruthless than they really are. What place is there, as I
   said before, where the very lifeblood of widows and orphans is not
   drained by the leading men of their states, and with them that of all
   godly men? For these last are classed with widows and orphans, since
   they are either unwilling to protect themselves, out of devotion to
   their vows, or unable because of their simplicity and humility.
   Therefore not one of them is safe, indeed scarcely any are safe, except
   the very greatest, from the plunder and ruin of this universal
   brigandage, other than those who are a match for the brigands
   themselves. Matters have come to such an evil pass, to such a criminal
   condition, that only the wicked man may count himself secure. [271]

   5. But certainly, you object, even though there are so many who
   persecute good men, there must be some who come to the rescue of those
   in distress, and, as it is written, "deliver the poor and needy out of
   the hand of the wicked." [272] "There is none that doeth good, no, not
   one:" [273] as the prophet showed by these words, good men are so rare
   that scarcely one seems to remain among us. Who offers help to those
   who are distressed and suffering, when even the priests of the Lord
   make no resistance to the violence of the unscrupulous? The majority of
   the clergy either say nothing, or, if they do speak, their words are no
   more effective than silence. "With many of them it is not lack of
   resolution, but what they consider a prudent discretion that commends
   this course. [274] They are not willing to declare the truth openly,
   for this the sensitive ears of the wicked cannot bear. Not content with
   shunning the truth, our oppressors hate and curse it, they fail to
   evince any reverence or respect when they do hear the truth, and show
   utter scorn for it, in their stubborn and rebellious conceit.
   Therefore, even those who have occasion to speak remain silent and
   refrain from immediate attacks on those whom they know to be guilty.
   They dare not publish the whole truth openly for fear of increasing
   oppression by a too emphatic insistence.

   Meanwhile the poor are being robbed, widows groan, orphans are trodden
   down, so that many, even persons of good birth, who have enjoyed a
   liberal education, seek refuge with the enemy [275] to escape death
   under the trials of the general persecution. They seek among the
   barbarians the Roman mercy, since they cannot endure the barbarous
   mercilessness they find among the Romans. [276]

   Although these men differ in customs and language from those with whom
   they have taken refuge, and are unaccustomed too, if I may say so, to
   the nauseous odor of the bodies and clothing of the barbarians, [277]
   yet they prefer the strange life they find there to the injustice rife
   among the Romans. So you find men passing over everywhere, now to the
   Goths, now to the Bagaudae, or whatever other barbarians have
   established their power anywhere, [278] and they do not repent of their
   expatriation, for they would rather live as free men, though in seeming
   captivity, than as captives in seeming liberty. Hence the name of Roman
   citizen, once not only much valued but dearly bought, [279] is now
   voluntarily repudiated and shunned, and is thought not merely
   valueless, but even almost abhorrent. What can be a greater proof of
   Roman injustice than that many worthy noblemen to whom their Roman
   status should have been the greatest source of fame and honor, have
   nevertheless been driven so far by the cruelty of Roman injustice that
   they no longer wish to be Romans?

   The result is that even those who do not take refuge with the
   barbarians are yet compelled to be barbarians themselves; for this is
   the case with the greater part of the Spaniards, no small proportion of
   the Gauls, and, in fine, all those throughout the Roman world whose
   Roman citizenship has been brought to nothing by Roman extortion.

   6. I must now speak of the Bagaudae, [280] who, despoiled, afflicted,
   and murdered by wicked and bloodthirsty magistrates, after they had
   lost the rights of Roman, citizens, forfeited also the honor of the
   Roman name. We transform their misfortunes into crime, we brand them
   with a name that recalls their losses, with a name that we ourselves
   have contrived for their shame! We call those men rebels and utterly
   abandoned, whom we ourselves have forced into crime. [281] For by what
   other causes were they made Bagaudae [282] [283] save by our unjust
   acts, the wicked decisions of the magistrates, the proscription and
   extortion of those who have turned the public exactions to the increase
   of their private fortunes and made the tax indictions their opportunity
   for plunder? [284]

   Like wild beasts, instead of governing those put under their power, the
   officials have devoured them, feeding not only on their belongings as
   ordinary brigands would do, but even on their torn flesh and their
   blood. Thus it has come to pass that men who were strangled and half
   killed by brutal exactions began to be really barbarians, since they
   were not permitted to be Romans. They were satisfied to become what
   they were not, since they were no longer allowed to be what they had
   been; and they were compelled to defend their lives as best they could,
   since they saw that they had already completely lost their liberty.

   How does our present situation differ from theirs? Those who have not
   before joined the Bagaudae are now being compelled to join them. The
   overwhelming injuries poor men suffer compel them to wish to become
   Bagaudae, but their weakness prevents them. So they are like captives
   oppressed by the yoke of an enemy, enduring their torture of necessity,
   not of their own choice; in their hearts they long for freedom, while
   they suffer the extremes of slavery.

   7. Such is the case among almost all the lower classes, for the same
   circumstances force them to two very different alternatives. They are
   most strongly compelled to wish for freedom, but the compulsion they
   suffer deprives them of power to carry out their wish. Perhaps it may
   be asserted that the very men who have these desires would wish for
   nothing better than to be free of any occasion to feel them, for what
   they wish is the greatest misfortune. They would be much better off if
   they had no need for such ambitions. But what other wish can these poor
   wretches have? They must endure the frequent, even continuous, ruin of
   state requisitions, always menaced by severe and unremitting
   proscription; they desert their homes to avoid being tortured in them,
   and go into voluntary exile to escape heavy punishment. To such men the
   enemy are kinder than the tax collectors. This is proved by their
   actions, for they flee to the enemy to avoid the oppression of the
   levies. [285] Such taxation in itself, however harsh and brutal, would
   still be less severe and painful if all shared equally in the common
   lot. But the situation is made more shameful and disastrous by the fact
   that all do not bear the burden together; the tributes due from the
   rich are extorted from the poor, and the weaker bear the burdens of the
   stronger. The only reason why they do not bear the whole burden is that
   the exactions are greater than their resources. They are suffering the
   most diverse and dissimilar misfortunes, envy and need. For envy is
   involved in the payment, and need in the means by which it is made. If
   you consider the amount they pay, you will think them wealthy; but if
   you consider what they have, you will find them in dire need. Who can
   square the accounts of such injustice? They make the payments due from
   the rich while they suffer the poverty of beggars.

   My next point is still more serious. The rich themselves from time to
   time make additions to the amount of taxation demanded from the poor.
   You may ask how it is, when their assessment has already reached a
   maximum figure, and the payments due from them are very large, that the
   rich can possibly wish to increase the total. But I did not say that
   they increase their own payments, for they permit the increase simply
   because it does not cost them anything additional.

   Let me explain. Frequently there come from the highest imperial
   officials new envoys, new bearers of dispatches, sent under
   recommendation to a few men of note, for the ruin of the many. In their
   honor new contributions and tax levies are decreed. The mighty
   determine what sums the poor shall pay; the favor of the rich decrees
   what the masses of the lowly shall lose; for they themselves are not at
   all involved in these exactions. [286] Do you say that it is impossible
   not to give due honor and entertainment to the envoys sent by our
   superiors? Then be the first to contribute, you men of wealth, who are
   first to pass such decrees; be first to lavish your property who are
   first in largess of mere words. You who give, give of mine and thine
   alike; though absolute justice would require that any one who wishes
   sole claim on the resulting favor should also bear the expense alone.
   However, we poor men accede to the wish of the rich. What you few order
   let us all pay. What is so just and humane as this? Your decree burdens
   us with new debts; at least let this indebtedness be shared between us.
   What can be more unjust or unworthy than that you alone should be free
   from debt, who are making us all debtors?

   The poor, indeed, in the extremes of their misery, pay all the
   exactions of which I have spoken, in utter ignorance of the object or
   reason of the payments. For who is allowed to discuss the payments, or
   inquire into the reasons for the amounts due? The sum is openly
   published only when the rich fall out with one another, and some of
   them feel slighted because they learn that assessments have been passed
   without their advice and management. Then you will hear some among them
   say: "What an unconscionable crime! Two or three decide the ruin of the
   many; a few powerful men determine what is to be paid for by many poor
   wretches!" For each individual rich man thinks it due to his honor to
   object to any decree passed in his absence, but he does not consider it
   due to justice to object to any wrong being enacted in his presence.

   Finally, what they have criticized in others they themselves afterward
   establish in law, either in requital for the earlier contempt, or as
   proof of their power. As a result the most unhappy poor are like men
   far out at sea, buffeted by conflicting winds; they are overwhelmed by
   the billows that break over them now from one side, now from the other.

   8. But surely, you say, those who are unjust in this respect are known
   to be moderate and just in another, and atone for their wickedness in
   the one matter by their generosity in the other. For in proportion as
   they burden the poor with the weight of new indictions they sustain
   them by proffering new alleviations; in proportion as the lesser men
   are weighed down by new tributes, they are relieved by new remedies.

   But this is not the case, for the injustice is alike in both the
   exactions and the remedies. As the poor are the first to receive the
   burden, they are the last to obtain relief. For whenever, as happened
   lately, [287] the ruling powers have thought best to take measures to
   help the bankrupt cities to lessen their taxes in some measure, at once
   we see the rich alone dividing with one another the remedy granted to
   all alike. Who then remembers the poor? Who summons the needy and
   humble to share in the common benefit? Who allows the man who is always
   first in bearing the burden to have even the last place in receiving
   relief? What more can I say? Only that the poor are not reckoned as
   taxpayers at all, except when the weight of taxation is being imposed
   on them; they are outside the number when remedies are being
   distributed.

   Under such circumstances can we think ourselves undeserving of God's
   severe punishment when we ourselves continually so punish the poor? Can
   we believe that God ought not to exercise his judgment against us all,
   when we are constantly unjust? For where, or among what people, do
   these evils exist save only among the Romans? Who commit such grave
   acts of injustice as ours? Take the Franks, they are ignorant of this
   wrong; the Huns are immune to it; there is nothing of the sort among
   the Vandals, nothing among the Goths. For in the Gothic country the
   barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not
   even Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans
   in that region have but one desire, that they may never have to return
   to the Roman jurisdiction. It is the unanimous prayer of the Roman
   people in that district that they may be permitted to continue to lead
   their present life among the barbarians.

   Yet we are surprised that the Goths are not conquered by our
   resistance, when the Romans would rather live among them than at home.
   Not only have our kinsmen no desire at all to escape from them to us,
   but they even leave us to take refuge with them. I could find occasion
   to wonder why all the poor and needy taxpayers [288] do not follow
   their example, except for the one factor that hinders them, namely,
   that they cannot transfer their poor possessions and homes and their
   households. For, since many of them leave their tiny fields and shops
   to escape the enforced payment of taxes, how could they help wishing to
   take off with them, if it were at all possible, the property they are
   compelled to abandon? They are not capable of doing what they would
   probably prefer, hence they do the one thing they can. They put
   themselves under the care and protection of the powerful, make
   themselves the surrendered captives of the rich and so pass under their
   jurisdiction. [289] Still I should not consider this a serious or
   unfitting procedure; on the contrary, I should laud the public spirit
   of the powerful to whom the poor entrust themselves, if they did not
   sell their patronage, if the defence they claim to give the poor were
   due to their humanity and not to their greed. It is a serious and
   grievous situation, that the rich make a show of protecting the poor
   only in order to rob them, that they defend the wretched only on
   condition of making them more wretched still by this defence. For all
   those who seem to be enjoying protection assign to their patrons the
   bulk of their property before they receive any help, and thus the sons'
   inheritance is destroyed that the fathers may be secure. [290]
   Protection for the parents is assured by the beggary of the children.
   See then the aid and patronage afforded by the great: they do nothing
   for the benefit of those who come under their care, but only for their
   own. Some aid is granted the parents for the time being, but only on
   condition that in the future the children shall lose everything. It is
   a mere process of sale, and certain of the great are sure to demand a
   very dear price for everything they offer. I said it was a process of
   sale--I wish they would sell in the ordinary sense of the term, for in
   that case perhaps they would leave something to the purchaser! But this
   is a new sort of buying and selling; the seller gives nothing and
   receives everything, while the buyer receives nothing and loses all
   that he had. Now practically every sales agreement has this
   characteristic, that the element of desire is on the side of the buyer,
   and that of need on that of the seller, inasmuch as the buyer wishes to
   increase his substance and the seller to diminish his. This, however,
   is an unheard-of sort of trading, in which the property of the sellers
   increases while nothing remains to the buyers but sheer beggary.

   What an intolerable and monstrous thing it is, one that human hearts
   can hardly endure, that one can hardly bear to hear spoken of, that
   many of the wretched poor, despoiled of their tiny holdings, after they
   have completely lost their property, must still pay taxes for what they
   have lost! Though possession has been forfeited, the assessment is not
   cancelled: [291] they are without property but are overwhelmed with
   taxes. Who can fairly estimate this evil? The poor wretches pay taxes
   for the invaders who have swooped down on their estates. After the
   father's death, the sons have no claim on the little farms that should
   rightly be theirs, but are forced to pay ruinous taxes for them. As a
   result, what else is accomplished by this great wrongdoing except that
   men stripped naked by private robbery, die under the public exactions,
   and taxation ends the lives of those whose property has been carried
   off by plunderers? [292]

   Therefore some of those of whom I speak, who are either shrewder than
   the rest or have been sharpened by necessity, have lost their homes and
   farms by such encroachments, or have fled before the taxgatherers,
   because they cannot hold their property, and seek out the farms of the
   rich and great, to become their coloni. [293]

   Those who are driven by the terror of the enemy flee to the forts,
   [294] and those who have lost their immunity as free men take refuge in
   some asylum [295] out of sheer desperation. So also these men, who are
   no longer able to guard the home and condition of their birth, subject
   themselves to the lowly yoke of serfdom. They have been reduced to such
   a necessitous state that they are cut off not only from their former
   possessions, but also from their rank. They are exiled not alone from
   their property but from their very selves; losing all that was theirs
   along with their freedom, they lack any title to their holdings and
   forfeit the very rights of liberty. [296]

   9. Even this might through sheer necessity seem somehow tolerable, if
   there were not further misfortune to follow. Their lot is made more
   bitter by a worse injustice still. For they are received as strangers;
   they become natives only on the terms of their present condition.
   Recalling the example of that evil sorceress of old who is said to have
   changed men into beasts, we might say that all who are received on the
   farms of the rich are transformed as if by Circe's potions. For the
   owners begin to count those whom they have received as outsiders and
   aliens, as their own property; they turn into slaves men known to be
   free-born. Do we wonder that the barbarians are able to capture us,
   when we take our brothers captive? It is not at all strange that our
   states are being devastated and destroyed. We have long been providing
   by the oppression of the multitude for our own eventual capture,
   falling into captivity by our enslavement of others. Much later than we
   deserve, do we now at length suffer the treatment that we have meted
   out to others, and in the words of the Holy Scripture, eat the labor of
   our own hands. [297] Under the judgment of a just God we are paying
   what we owe. We showed no mercy to exiles; behold, we ourselves are in
   exile: we deceived wanderers; behold, we ourselves, now wanderers, are
   deceived in turn: we took advantage of circumstances to ruin free-born
   men; behold, we ourselves are beginning to live on alien soil, and fear
   the same ruin.

   How great is the deceptive blindness of sinful minds! We are suffering
   from the condemnation of God's judgment and still do not acknowledge
   that we are being judged. Some of the saints wonder that the others who
   have thus far not endured any such fate are not reformed by our
   example! Not even those of us who are already smitten by God are being
   corrected by the torments justly due to our wickedness. What
   intolerable pride is ours! However many are enduring the punishment
   that their sins require, no one deigns to acknowledge the cause of his
   trouble. The reasons for our pride are perfectly obvious: even though
   we are at last suffering a little, we do not yet suffer as we deserve.
   So great is the mercy of God that he does not wish us to endure the
   full penalties for our misdeeds, but only a part of what is due; he
   chastens the wicked, but not to the full measure of their sin. He
   wishes us to acknowledge our misdoings rather than to endure their
   penalties, to the end that by his loving and salutary correction he may
   show us what we deserve to suffer, but not inflict on us the stripes we
   deserve. In this he follows the words of the blessed apostle, who said:
   "Dost thou not know that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
   repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart thou treasurest
   up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath." [298]

   In truth our actions suit the words of the apostle, for God calls us to
   repentance, but we treasure up wrath; he invites us to receive pardon,
   but we daily heap up our offences. We bring force to bear on him by our
   iniquities; we ourselves arm the divine wrath against us. We compel God
   against his will to take vengeance on our monstrous crimes; we give him
   scarcely any opportunity to spare us. For although no token of
   injustice can ever light on him or appear in him, our actions are such
   that if he did not take vengeance on our sins he would seem to be
   unjust.

   10. Surely, you say, a man who has once been a sinner may have ceased
   to do wrong. Is there any end to wrongdoing? Do not men give up life
   sooner than iniquity? What man does not die in his evil pursuits, to be
   buried with his sins and crimes? Truly, one might apply to such men the
   words of the prophet: "Their graves are their homes forever, and they
   are compared to foolish cattle, and are become like them." [299] If
   only they were like cattle! It would at least have been something
   gained, to have gone astray through mere brute folly. To have sinned,
   not through ignorance, but in despite of God, is worse and deserves a
   heavier penalty. Do you claim that this is the case with the laity
   only, and not with even a few among the clergy? With worldly men only,
   and not with many of the religious also, or rather men given over to
   worldly vices under the empty show of religion? These, to be sure,
   after the shameful guilt of their past misdeeds, have gained themselves
   the honorary name of sanctity. They have altered in their profession
   but not in their actual way of life, and, thinking that the service of
   God depends on costume more than on action, have changed their garments
   but not their hearts. Why should men think their guilt less hateful,
   who, though they are said to have performed a sort of penance, do not
   put off their old habits when they lay aside their former style of
   dress? Their actions as a whole are such that there is less reason to
   suppose that they have already done penance for their misdeeds than
   that they afterwards repented of their penitence. There is less ground
   to think that they have repented their evil life than that they have
   since regretted their promise of a good one.

   Many men know that I am speaking the truth, and can even bear witness
   to my words in their own conscience. Chief among these are the
   religious who have gained some reputation by a general repentance and
   now seek after new honors, and buy powers they formerly lacked. They
   are so anxious to be not merely men of the world, but more than
   worldly, that what they were before their repentance does not now
   suffice them unless they may become greater than they were in the past.
   Do they not repent of their conversion?

   So also do those men repent of their conversion and their brief thought
   of God, who, abstaining from intercourse with their wives, do not
   refrain from invasion of other men's property; who, professing physical
   continence, run riot in incontinence of spirit. A strange sort of
   conversion, truly! They do not do what is permissible, but commit
   forbidden sins. They refrain from lawful wedded life but not from
   rapine.

   What vain delusion is this? Sins were forbidden us by God, not
   marriage. Your deeds do not suit your convictions; you who call
   yourselves adherents of virtue should not consort with crime. What you
   are doing is utterly absurd; this is not conversion to God but aversion
   from him. If, as is rumored, you have left off long since the functions
   even of lawful wedlock, now at last give up your sin. It is indeed just
   that you should refrain from crime of all sorts, but if you think this
   impossibly difficult, at least give up your greatest and most monstrous
   sins. Grant, whoever you are, that the neighbors whose land adjoins
   yours cannot remain prosperous; grant that the poor cannot support life
   near you; grant that you persecute the indigent and plunder the
   wretched; grant that you cause affliction to all men, provided that
   they are outside your own circle: still, I beg, at least spare your own
   family. And if you think it too hard and burdensome to spare all who
   are yours, then spare those who have preferred you not only to their
   other relatives and kinsmen, but even to those most closely bound to
   them and their dearly loved children. Yet why should I speak of their
   loved ones and their children, when they have preferred you almost to
   their very life and hope? There is nothing praiseworthy in this, as
   everyone who has committed the error now recognizes. But what has that
   to do with you, whom even their mistakes have advantaged? Your debt to
   such men is the greater because they have erred from too great trust in
   you. They were indeed blinded by devotion, and consequently are branded
   and censured by all; but even so you are under greater obligations to
   them because they have incurred the blame of all for love of you.

   11. What is there to compare with this among the barbarous Goths? Who
   among them injures those who love him, attacks his friends, and cuts
   the throats of his dear ones with his own dagger? You attack those who
   love you, you cut off the hands of those who offer gifts, you kill your
   closest friends, and do you not fear and tremble? What would you do if
   you had not felt the present judgment of God in the scourging you have
   just received? You increase the count and constantly add new crimes to
   your former misdeeds. Think what punishment awaits your worse deeds,
   when even lesser faults are regularly punished by demons. Be content
   now, I pray, with robbing your friends and companions. Let it be enough
   that the poor have been harried and beggars despoiled by you, that
   hardly any one can keep from trembling in your presence, no one can
   feel secure. Torrents rushing down from Alpine crags, or flames driven
   by the wind, are more easily borne. No such death as this--to use a
   well known figure--do sailors die, devoured by the engulfing whirlpool
   or by Scylla's proverbial dogs. You evict your neighbors from their
   little farms, those nearest you from their houses and property. Would
   you "be placed alone in the midst of the earth," [300] as it is
   written? This is the one end you cannot gain. Seize all that you can,
   occupy by force all that you can, still you shall always find a
   neighbor. Consider, please, other men, whom even you, willingly or not,
   regard with honor; consider others, whom even you, willingly or not,
   admire. They are above others in honor, but on a level with them in
   their own estimation; they are greater in their power and less in their
   humility. You yourself, to whom I am now speaking, surely know whom I
   mean, and you of whom I now complain ought to recognize whom I honor by
   this praise. I only wish that there were many who deserve such praise;
   the nobility of a great number might work healing for all.

   But suppose that you do not wish to win praise; tell me, why do you
   wish to be worthy of condemnation? Why is nothing dearer to you than
   injustice, nothing more delightful than avarice, nothing more cherished
   than the seizure of other men's goods? Why do you judge nothing more
   precious than wickedness, nothing more excellent than rapine? Learn the
   true good from a pagan, who says: "One should be fenced about by
   charity and goodwill, not by arms." [301]

   So your delusions lead you astray; the wickedness of your blind and
   evil heart deceives you. If you wish to be upright, to be powerful, to
   be great, you ought to surpass other men not in ill will but in honor.
   I once read somewhere: "No one is wicked but a fool; for if he were
   wise, he would prefer to be good." Do you, therefore, if you can at
   last return to sanity, put off your wickedness, if you wish wisdom. For
   if you hope to be at all wise or sane, you must discard all that you
   have been and change completely. Deny yourself that you may not be
   denied by Christ; cast yourself off that you may be received by him;
   lose yourself, that you may not perish. For the Savior says: "Whosoever
   will lose his life for my sake shall find it." [302] Wherefore love
   this profitable loss, that you may gain true safety. For God will never
   set you free, unless you have first condemned yourself.

   [263] The rest of this chapter is quoted in an abridged translation by
   Voltaire in his Dictionnaire philosophique, s.v. "Hérésie," with the
   prefatory remark that it is the most sensible attack on the spirit of
   intolerance that can be found. Voltaire had apparently forgotten or not
   read Augustine's treatise Contra epistolam Manichaei (Migne, PL, XLII,
   col. 173), in which (c. 1) he prays for "a mind calm and tranquil,
   thinking rather of your correction than your subversion. For although
   the Lord through his servants overturns the realms of error, yet he
   bids the men themselves, in so far as they are men, be amended rather
   than destroyed."

   [264] See Luke 12. 47-48.

   [265] Orosius' account of the conversion of the Goths, while agreeing
   with Salvian's on the responsibility of the Romans for the heresy of
   the Goths, illuminates by contrast the comprehension and sympathy with
   which Salvian states the absence of moral responsibility on the part of
   the barbarians for a heresy that appeared to them orthodox. Salvian's
   attitude is the more remarkable in one whose devotion to Christ is so
   strong that at times he has Christ overshadow the other Persons of the
   Trinity. Orosius says (VII. 33. 19): "Before this the Goths sent
   ambassadors to ask that bishops be sent from whom they might learn the
   precepts of the Christian faith. Valens the emperor, with damnable
   perversity, sent teachers of the Arian creed. The Goths have held to
   the instructions of the first faith that they received. So by a just
   judgment of God they burned alive the man through whose fault they,
   when they die, are doomed to burn for their vicious error."

   [266] See IV. 2 supra. As Zschimmer (op. cit., 58 n.l.) points out,
   this is a very notable statement. Salvian clearly understands the
   historical connection of Roman Arianism with that of the Germans;
   either he actually knew that Ulfilas in his translation of the Bible
   made alterations to suit the Arian doctrines, or he is merely repeating
   some of the usual charges brought against Ulfilas and other Arian
   missionaries by contemporaries of the orthodox faith.

   [267] John 13. 35.

   [268] For the efforts of the state to prevent such injustice, cf.
   especially Cod. Theod. XI. 1. 20, 26.

   [269] See Cod. Theod. XI. 7. 16, 20; 11. 1, for the penalties for undue
   aggression by minor officials.

   [270] See III. 5 supra. For the reverse of the picture, note the text
   of the contemporary decree of Theodosius and Valentinian issued a.d.
   443 (Cod. Just. V. 27. 2) beginning: "If any man whether free or bound
   in the toils of the curia . . . " In his own eyes the curial had become
   a slave rather than a tyrant, and in those of the government as well,
   but the necessity of tyranny toward the taxpayers was thereby
   increased. For the obligations of the office and the difficulty of
   filling it at this time, see Cod. Theod. XII. 1, De decurionibus.

   [271] That similar conditions prevailed also in the eastern portion of
   the empire at this time is shown by the account of the Roman regime
   given by the Greek whom Priscus found at Attila's court (Priscus,
   "Historia Gothica," in De Boor, Excerpta Constantiniana I, 135-138; see
   also Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, I, 213-223): "Their
   oppressions in time of peace are much more bitter than the calamities
   due to war, both on account of the harsh tributes and on account of the
   oppression of the wicked, since the laws are not enforced for all
   alike. If a rich or powerful man transgresses them, he does not pay the
   penalty for his misdeed; but if a needy man, who does not know how to
   conduct his affairs, transgresses, he must expect the penalty ordained
   by law; unless perhaps, before the sentence is decided, when much time
   has been spent in continual litigation and great amounts of money
   expended beside, his life ends. But the worst injustice of all is that
   law and justice are to be obtained only by bargaining and bribery. For
   no one will open the courts to any injured man before he turns over his
   money to the use of the judge and his assistants." Priseus countered
   with a description of the general justice of the Roman law and
   government, to which the exile replied that the laws of the Roman state
   were indeed good and the empire gloriously constituted, but the
   magistrates, less public-spirited than of old, were weakening and
   perverting it.

   [272] Psalms 82. 4.

   [273] Ibid. 14. 3.

   [274] Elsewhere Salvian speaks in the same vein (Ad ecclesiam IV. 8):
   "In such a situation what do those men do whom Christ has appointed to
   speak? They displease God, if they are silent; men, if they speak. But,
   as the apostle said in answer to the Jews, it is more expedient to obey
   God than men."

   [275] An important bit of contemporary evidence for a fundamental step
   in the transition from the Roman regime in the country districts to
   feudalism.

   [276] Orosius' similar statement in the case of Spain has already been
   cited; cf. IV. 4 supra. Sidonius (Ep. V. 7) speaks of the officials
   whose oppression of Gaul stands out in marked contrast to the clemency
   of the surrounding barbarians. The account given by Paulinus of Pella
   of Roman life among the Gothic invaders corroborates Salvian's
   statements, in a situation in which the victory of the Goths and the
   plundering before their departure made, his favorable account the more
   remarkable. He lamented (Eucharisticos 285-290) the disadvantage of
   having had no Goths quartered in his house to protect him from the
   ravages when their tribe withdrew: "for we know that certain of the
   Goths worked with the greatest humanity to benefit their hosts by their
   protection." Later his prayer (Ibid. 424-425) that "some share of my
   ancestral fortune might remain from the barbarian plundering by right
   of war, and from the Roman crime, which has at various seasons fattened
   freely on my losses, against all justice" was answered by a Goth's
   payment to him for a part of his old estate, which had fallen to the
   honest barbarian as part of his booty.

   [277] A similar distaste is expressed by Sidonius (Carmen XII) in his
   description of the difficulties of composing six-foot verses when
   seven-foot barbarians breathe onions and garlic into your face at
   daybreak.

   [278] Strictly speaking the Bagaudae were not barbarians, but revolted
   peasants from among the Roman citizenry, whose long-continued revolts
   had invested them in Roman eyes with a quasi-barbarian character; for
   the other barbarians note that in VII. 15 the Franks are described as
   especially hospitable.

   [279] So the tribune of the soldiers at Jerusalem said to Paul: "With a
   great price obtained I this freedom," i.e., Roman citizenship. (Acts
   22. 28.)

   [280] The revolt of the Bagaudae, analogous in many respects to that of
   the Jacquerie in the 14th century, broke out in Gaul in A.D. 283-4
   because of oppression in that province, due especially to overheavy
   taxation. The empire was engaged in war against usurpers, and the
   revolt spread rapidly. Maximian won great praise for suppressing it,
   but the Bagaudae continued to plunder the country districts and towns,
   and spread through Gaul and Spain, adding seriously to the difficulty
   of guarding the frontiers. In the 5th century their revolt again
   assumed serious proportions; their troops were now regular armies and
   their local units closely equivalent to the individual German states in
   menace to the unity of the empire, breeding increasing discontent with
   the official oppression. The last mention of the Bagaudae in the
   Chronicle of Idatius is in the year A.D. 449, and the movement seems to
   have come to an end not long after this. For the contemporary
   references, of which Salvian's account is the most detailed, cf. Seeck,
   s.v. "Bagaudae," in Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopädie.

   [281] That a man should not be held responsible for a crime committed
   under compulsion is recognized by a decree of Honorius and Theodosius
   in A.D. 416 (Cod. Theod. XV. 14. 14) prohibiting suits for crimes
   committed during the barbarian raids, "either through flight or through
   the herding together of refugees . . . for an act done to escape death
   is not considered a crime."

   [282] Salvian uses the term Bagaudae, apparently a word of Celtic
   origin, for which Seeck suggests the meaning "warlike," as equivalent
   to "outlawed rebels."

   [283]

   [284] The ten chief men of each town were responsible for handing over
   to the agents of the central government all that was due from their
   district in payment of the indiction, the term used from the time of
   Diocletian for the general provincial taxation on the basis of the
   amount of arable land, cattle and laborers in each locality. The
   periodical revisions of the taxable property also depended largely on
   the town officers, and usually caused much oppression of the poorer
   taxpayers, as Salvian here says. In this case, also, as in so many
   others, the rich could more easily gain substantial relief by bribery
   than the poor could do.

   [285] See Cod. Theod. XI. 1. 7 for the decree of Constantius and
   Constans in A.D. 361 relieving of payments pro his qui aufugerint any
   senators who could prove that they possessed none of the property of
   fugitive holders; and XI. 1. 31 for the similar decree of Honorius and
   Theodosius in A.D. 412. Salvian's description is closely paralleled by
   the passage from Priscus quoted in note 10.

   [286] The contrast between these practices and the imperial theory is
   shown by the five decrees in Cod. Theod. VIII. 11: "That the heralds of
   public good fortune are to receive no gifts from public levies or from
   forced payments."

   [287] See IV. 6 supra. No writer gives further details on these
   measures, and they are not mentioned in the Codex. Salvian's
   description of the profit made by the rich out of attempts at relief is
   confirmed by phrases in Cod. Theod. XII. 1. 173, of A.D. 410: "For
   relieving the fortunes of the poorer curials and restraining the
   oppression of the powerful. . . . Let them fear the knowledge of your
   power and dare make no attempt at relieving the rich and destroying the
   needy."

   [288] That is, free farmers, not coloni, for the latter would not be
   liable to direct taxation. The constant use of diminutives in reference
   to their property--agelli, resculae, habitatiunculae--shows the type of
   small farmer meant. The passage is an important one as an indication of
   the existence of independent small landholders in Gaul in Salvian's
   time.

   [289] See Cod. Theod. XII. 1. 146 of A.D. 395: "We have noted that many
   hide under the shadow of the powerful to defraud their country of the
   payments due"; and, in general, Cod. Theod. XI. 24; De patrociniis
   vicorum. A decree of A.D. 319 (ibid. XI. 3. 1) recognized as the cause
   of many arrears in the taxes that "some men, taking advantage of the
   temporary needs of others, get possession of the best farms on
   condition of holding them tax free without making up their arrears to
   the fiscus."

   [290] In Cod. Just. XI. 54. 1, A.D. 468, an attempt is made to prevent
   patronage by making testaments in such eases invalid; in Cod. Theod.
   XI. 24. 4 such patronage is made subject to very heavy fines.

   [291] Salvian uses the word capitatio, winch, as Haemmerle (op. cit.
   II. 11) points out, must be here equivalent to iugatio, not to the poll
   tax.

   [292] For attempts to remedy this wrong, ef. Cod. Theod. XI. 3. 1-5,
   providing for proper registration and payment of arrears on land
   acquired "in any way whatsoever."

   [293] That is, they give up their full citizen status, and become bound
   to the soil, being no longer subject to direct taxation. This would
   seem a harsher alternative than the preceding, yet actual conditions
   lead Salvian to reckon it as the wiser course.

   [294] Castella had already become frequent sanctuaries in exposed
   territories.

   [295] Churches had taken the right of sanctuary formerly held by pagan
   temples; cf. Cod. Theod. IX. 45.

   [296] Compare the commentary on their status in Haemmerle, op. cit. II.
   19-25, where Salvian's use of the terms coloni and inquilini as
   interchangeable is discussed.

   [298] Romans 2. 4-5.

   [299] Psalms 49.11-12.

   who was not fenced about with charity; for arms are stirred up by
   arms."

     __________________________________________________________________

  THE SIXTH BOOK

   1. I have been dealing with personalities for a long time now, and seem
   to have exceeded the rules of argument. For undoubtedly the reader (if
   anyone for Christ's sake does read these words written from love of
   Christ) is thinking or saying of me: "Since the subject he is pursuing
   is a general one, of what use is it to heap up so many accusations
   against a single person? Suppose --for it is credible--that the man of
   whom he speaks is as he describes him; still how can one man's goodness
   be blocked by another's guilt, or--a point of much greater
   importance--how is the general cause injured by one individual's
   crime?"

   The injury indeed I can prove by clear examples. For instance, Achar
   [303] once stole a part of an accursed thing, and the trespass of one
   man was the ruin of all. David ordered the children of Israel to be
   numbered, and the Lord punished his fault by the destruction of the
   whole people. [304] Rapsaces spoke scornfully of God, and God smote a
   hundred and eighty-five thousand men because the froward tongue of one
   profane man spoke evil of him. [305] Hence it was not without justice
   that the blessed apostle Paul ordered a noxious sinner cast out of the
   church and showed why he gave this order, saying: "A little leaven
   leaveneth the whole lump." [306] From this we clearly see that even one
   evil man very often works the destruction of many. Nor is this without
   justice. The reader should recognize that what I said above concerning
   one wicked man is not beside the point, since we read in the Scriptures
   that the wrath of the Divine Majesty has very frequently been kindled
   on account of one man's guilt. But my argument is not limited by this
   consideration, for we do not need to assume that one man blocks the way
   of all, since all are blocking each other; it is not fitting to
   consider that all are imperilled by one, since they are all imperilled
   by their own actions. For all men are rushing headlong into
   destruction, or at least, to put it somewhat more mildly, almost all.
   Where can the Christian people find such good fortune that the number
   of evildoers may be less than the number of the good, or failing that,
   be merely equivalent to it? How lamentable and grievous is our present
   wretchedness! How changed is the Christian people now from its former
   character! Of old, Peter, the chief of the apostles, punished with
   death the falsehood of Ananias and Sapphira. [307] The most blessed
   Paul also expelled one wicked man from the church, that he might not
   infect a great number by his presence. [308] But we are content to have
   an equal number of good and evil men. Why should I say we are content?
   We ought rather to exult and dance for joy, if we could achieve such an
   equal balance. See to what depths we have fallen, to what state we have
   been reduced after that glorious purity of the Christian people which
   kept them all unspotted, for now we think that the church would be
   happy if it contained even as much good as evil. How could we fail to
   consider it blessed if half its members were guiltless, since now we
   lament that they are almost all guilty?

   Since this is the case, it was useless, useless indeed, to speak so
   long of one evil man, useless to weep for one man's crimes, since all
   or almost all require our tears and lamentations. There are many who
   are of this sort or who wish to be so, which is no less incriminating,
   and who strive by their zeal for evil to seem guilty of the charge. On
   this account, even if their lesser capacity accomplishes less evil,
   they are themselves as wicked as the rest, for it is their lack of
   ability and not their will that prevents them. Their hopes alone are
   within their own control, and in these they are criminals; they yield
   to none in their desire for wrongdoing, and in this, as far as their
   means permit, they strive to excel. Different though the two cases are,
   their rivalry is like that of good men, for as the good desire to outdo
   all others in honorable aims, so the evil yearn to surpass in
   depravity. As the glory of good men is to grow daily better, even so
   the glory of the wicked is to become worse; and as the best wish to
   reach the height of all virtues, so the worst hope to claim the palm in
   all vices. To our misfortune this is particularly characteristic of us,
   the Christians, since, as I have already said, we think wickedness is
   wisdom. Of these God spoke particularly: "I will destroy the wisdom of
   the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
   [309] When the apostle cried, "if any man seemeth to be wise, let him
   become a fool, that he may be wise," [310] he meant that if a man
   wishes to be wise, he should be good, for no one is truly wise unless
   he is truly good. We, on the contrary, through the viciousness of our
   perverse spirits and our "reprobate minds"--to use the scriptural
   phrase [311] --reject goodness in favor of folly. Loving corruption
   more than wisdom, we think we become daily wiser in proportion as our
   depravity increases.

   2. Yet what hope of betterment is there in us, I ask, who are not led
   into evil by mistaken opinion, but strive with all the eagerness of our
   perverted natures to appear constantly worse and worse? This is the
   reason why I have long lamented that we are much worse than the
   barbarians, for ignorance of the law excuses them, whereas our
   knowledge of it accuses us. They prefer the evil to the good through
   inexperience of the truth, because they do not know what things are
   good; we, by our knowledge of the truth, know very well what things are
   good, [but consider them inferior to the evil in many] [312] ways.

   In the first place, there is almost no crime or vice that does not
   accompany the games. [313] In these the greatest pleasure is to have
   men die, or, what is worse and more cruel than death, to have them torn
   in pieces, to have the bellies of wild beasts gorged with human flesh;
   to have men eaten, to the great joy of the bystanders and the delight
   of onlookers, so that the victims seem devoured almost as much by the
   eyes of the audience as by the teeth of beasts. [314] That such things
   may take place the whole world is ransacked; great is the care with
   which the search is carried on and perfected. Hidden retreats are
   entered, pathless ravines are searched, impenetrable forests traversed,
   the cloud-bearing Alps are climbed, the depths of valleys plumbed, and
   in order that the flesh of men may be devoured by wild beasts, the last
   secrets of the world of nature are revealed.

   My opponents object that this is not done all the time. True, and a
   glorious excuse it is for wrongdoing, that it is not constantly carried
   on--as if any time were appropriate for actions that injure God! Are
   evil deeds well done because they are not done incessantly? Even
   murderers are not always employed in murder, but they are still
   murderers when they are not actually killing, for their hands are at
   all times stained with bloodshed. Bobbers do not steal all the time,
   but they do not cease to be robbers, for when they are not engaged in
   theft, their minds are occupied with it. Certainly men who take
   pleasure in the animal fights of the arena are by no means free from
   the guilt involved in such spectacles, even when they are not actually
   looking at them. Would they not enjoy watching them always if they
   could?

   Nor is this the only possible example of our sins, but there are still
   greater ones. For instance, do not the consuls even now have hens fed
   after the custom of the sacrilegious pagans? Are not auguries still
   sought from the flight of birds, and almost all those superstitions
   kept up which even pagan writers of old thought laughable? [315] Now
   when the very men who give their names to the years and with whose
   office the years themselves begin do such things, are we to believe
   that years begun under these auspices can continue their course
   propitiously? [316] I wish that these actions might pollute only the
   consuls who are responsible for them. But the situation is the more
   desperate because while such things are done with the public consent,
   the honor of a very limited number becomes the guilt of all, and so,
   although only two men are inaugurated in any given year, scarcely any
   one in the whole world escapes infection.

   3. Let this much suffice about the games, seeing that they are, as you
   say, not performed all the time. We shall speak, instead, of everyday
   obscenities. These the hosts of demons have contrived of such a sort
   and so innumerable that even honest and upright hearts, though they can
   scorn and tread down some among them, yet can scarcely find a way to
   overcome them all completely. Armies about to engage in battle are said
   either to intersect with pitfalls the places through which they expect
   the troops of the enemy to march, or plant them with stakes, or fill
   them with caltrops, so that even if some of their snares fail to entrap
   a victim, none of the enemy can fail to be caught. In like manner the
   demons have prepared so many treacherous lures in this life for the
   human race that even though one escapes many of them, he is finally
   caught by one or another.

   And since indeed it would take too long to tell of all these snares,
   that is, the amphitheaters, the concert halls, games, parades,
   athletes, rope dancers, pantomimes and other monstrosities of which one
   is ashamed to speak, since it is shameful even to know of such
   wickedness, I shall describe only the vices of the circuses and
   theaters. For the evils that are performed in these are such that no
   one can mention them, or even think of them without being polluted.
   [317] Other vices as a rule claim only some one portion of our being;
   for instance, base thoughts affect the mind only, immodest glances the
   eyes, shameful sounds the ears, so that when any one of these has gone
   astray, the rest can still be free from wrongdoing. But in the theaters
   no part of our bodies is free from guilt, for our minds are polluted by
   evil desires, our ears by hearing and our eyes by what they see, and
   all these are so disgraceful that a man cannot even describe them
   without loss of decency.

   Who without injuring his modesty can tell of those representations of
   base acts, those obscenities of words and voice, those disgraceful
   motions and foul gestures? The very fact that they forbid description
   shows what great sin there is in all these. Some of the very greatest
   crimes can be named and discussed without injury to the character of
   the speaker, as homicide, robbery, adultery, sacrilege and so forth; it
   is only the vice of the theaters that cannot even be attacked without
   loss of modesty. So in arraigning these vile and disgraceful abuses the
   prosecutor has a strange experience, in that, although the honesty of
   the would-be accuser is unquestioned, he cannot without prejudice to
   his honor relate or attack them. All other evils pollute those who
   perform them, not those who merely see or hear them. You may, for
   instance, hear a man blaspheme, but since your mind disapproves of his
   sacrilege you are not polluted by it. Or if you happen to be present
   during a robbery, you are not denied by the act, inasmuch as it is
   abhorrent to your principles. The indecencies of the spectacles alone
   involve actors and audience in substantially the same guilt. For all
   those who approve such performances and take pleasure in seeing them
   perform them through the medium of their sight and approval. To such
   men the words of the apostle apply with a peculiar force, since not
   only "they which commit such things are worthy of death" but also
   "those who have pleasure in them that do them." [318]

   Therefore in these pictures of vice the whole people commits
   fornication mentally, and any who happen to come to the spectacle
   chaste go home from it adulterers. They are guilty of this fornication
   not only when they go home, but also when they come to the theater, for
   the very desire of the obscene makes a man unchaste who is hurrying
   toward an impure spectacle.

   4. You see then in what actions all or the majority of Romans
   participate. None the less, we who do such things say we are forsaken
   by God, though we ourselves are forsaking him. Let us suppose that our
   Lord would like to watch us even though we do not deserve it: can he do
   so? See countless thousands of Christians daily spending their time at
   shows representing shameful acts. Can God look at them at such a time?
   Can God watch over men who are revelling in the circuses and wantoning
   in the theaters? Or do we perhaps think it fitting and desirable that
   when God sees us in the circuses and theaters, he should see with us
   what we ourselves see there, and look with us at the disgraceful sights
   at which we gaze? One of two things must happen; either, if he deigns
   to look on us, he must also see our surroundings, or if he averts his
   eyes from them, which he surely does, then he must avert them equally
   from us, who are among them.

   In spite of this, without interruption we continue to do those things
   of which I speak. Do we perhaps suppose that, like the ancient pagans,
   we have a god of theaters and circuses? For they built the theaters and
   circuses long ago because they believed that such vanities were a
   delight to their idols. [319] How can we imitate them in this, who
   surely know that our God hates such things? Of course, if we know that
   these vile shows please God, there can be no objection to our
   performing them incessantly. But if in our hearts we know that God
   abhors and abominates them, that as they are the devil's food so are
   they also a cause of offence to God, then how can we say that we
   worship God in the church, we who always serve the devil in the obscene
   games with full knowledge and understanding and with deliberate
   intention? What hope, I ask, shall we have before God, who injure him
   not by chance or by ignorance, but after the manner of those old giants
   of whom we read that they attempted to scale the heavens in their mad
   ambition and climbed, as it were, into the clouds? So we, by the
   injuries that we constantly inflict on God throughout the world, as if
   by common consent, are making war on heaven.

   Therefore we offer up to Christ--O monstrous folly!--to Christ we offer
   up circuses and mimes, and we do this chiefly when we receive some
   benefit from him, when some mark of prosperity is granted us by him, or
   a victory over the enemy is bestowed on us by his divine favor! How do
   we seem in this to differ from a man who injures a generous benefactor,
   or responds to endearments with cutting abuse, or pierces with his
   dagger the lips that seek to kiss him? I ask all the rich and powerful
   men of this world, what punishment they think fitting for a slave who
   plots evil against a good and loving master, who quarrels with a master
   who deserves only good of him, and returns only foul words for the
   liberty that he has received. Undoubtedly he is guilty of the greatest
   wrongdoing who returns evil for good, when he should not even feel free
   to return evil for evil. But this is what we do who are called
   Christians: we arouse a merciful God against us by our licentious acts,
   we insult him by our filthy deeds when he is propitious, we lash him
   with abusive words when he speaks gently to us.

   5. To Christ then--O monstrous folly!--we offer circuses and mimes, to
   Christ in return for his benefits, we offer the obscenities of the
   theaters, to Christ we dedicate the vilest shows as sacrificial
   offerings. Was this the teaching given us by the Savior, incarnate for
   our sake? Was this his preaching, or that of his apostles? For this did
   he endure the humiliation of human nativity and take upon himself a
   shameful origin in his mortal birth? For this he lay in a manger, whom
   angels served as he lay there. For this he willed to be wrapped in
   swaddling clothes, and wearing them ruled heaven; for this he hung upon
   the cross, whom the world feared as he hung there. "Who though he was
   rich," the apostle said, "yet for your sakes became poor, that ye
   through his poverty might become rich." [320] "And being in the form of
   God," I quote farther, "he humbled himself unto death, even the death
   of the cross." [321]

   These then are the precepts that Christ gave us at the time of his
   passion. A glorious return we are making for his suffering, who, having
   received redemption by his death, offer him in return most disgraceful
   lives! The blessed Paul said: "For the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
   hath appeared, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts,
   we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;
   looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God
   and our Savior Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might
   redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a people worthy of
   acceptance, zealous of good works. [322]

   Where are men who do those things for which the apostle says Christ
   came? Where are those who flee from worldly lusts? Where are those who
   live righteous and godly lives, who show in their good works that they
   hold the blessed hope, and by living immaculate lives prove that they
   await the kingdom of God, since they deserve to receive it? "The Lord
   Jesus Christ," Paul said, "came to purify unto himself a people worthy
   of acceptance, zealous of good works." Where is that pure people, that
   acceptable people, that people of good works, that people of
   righteousness? "Christ," the Scripture says, "suffered for us, leaving
   us an example, that we should follow his steps." [323] So we follow the
   Savior's steps in the circuses; we follow the Savior's steps in the
   theaters. Is this the example Christ left for us? We read that he wept,
   not that he laughed. In both he gave us an example, for weeping is the
   remorse of the heart, laughter the corruption of uprightness. For this
   reason he said: "Woe unto you that laugh now; for ye shall weep;" and
   again: "Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh." [324] But we
   do not think it enough to laugh and rejoice, unless we rejoice in sin
   and madness, unless our laughter is mixed with impure and disgraceful
   actions.

   6. Who can describe this delusion of ours, this folly? Are we really
   unable to enjoy ourselves day by day, and to laugh, without turning our
   laughter and joy into crime? or do we perhaps consider wholesome
   enjoyment profitless and find no pleasure in innocent laughter? What
   wickedness is this, I ask, and what insanity? Let us laugh indeed, let
   us rejoice unstintedly, and as constantly as you please, if only we do
   so innocently. What folly and madness it is for us to think laughter
   and joy worthless unless they involve injury to God! Injury indeed, and
   a very great one. The spectacles involve a sort of apostasy from the
   faith, a fatal violation of the creed itself and of the divine
   sacraments. For what is the first confession of faith made by
   Christians in baptism for their salvation? What else than their vow to
   renounce the devil and his pomps and spectacles and his works? So in
   the very words of our profession of faith spectacles and pomps are the
   works of the devil [325] How then, O Christian, shall you after baptism
   seek the spectacles, which you confess are the work of the devil? You
   have once renounced the devil and his spectacles, and therefore as a
   rational and intelligent being must recognize that in resorting again
   to them, you are returning to the devil. For you have renounced them
   both at the same time and declared them to be one and the same. If you
   return to one, you return to them both. For your words were: "I
   renounce the devil, his pomps and spectacles and his works." [326] What
   follows in your baptismal vows? "I believe in God the Father Almighty
   and in Jesus Christ his Son." First then, you renounced the devil that
   you might believe in God, for he who does not renounce the devil does
   not believe in God and therefore he who returns to the devil forsakes
   God.

   Furthermore, the devil is present in his spectacles and pomps, and
   therefore when we return to the devil's spectacles, we abandon our
   Christian faith. Thus all the sacraments of our belief are broken, and
   all that follows in the creed is shaken and totters; for nothing that
   follows remains intact if the chief clause has fallen. Tell me then,
   you who are a Christian, how you think you are keeping the latter
   portions of the creed, whose first clauses you have abandoned? The
   limbs without the head are worth nothing, and everything depends on its
   own first principles; these surely, if they perish, will drag all the
   rest down with them to destruction. If the main stock is removed, the
   other parts either cease to exist or if they continue are useless, for
   without its head nothing can subsist.

   If any one thinks the wickedness of the spectacles a trivial matter,
   let him consider well all that I have said, and he will see that in
   them is not pleasure but death. For what else is it but death, to have
   lost the source of life? When the foundations of our creed are
   overthrown, life itself is strangled.

   7. I must return again to my oft-repeated contention, what have the
   barbarians like this? Where in their lands are circuses, where are
   theaters, where those other wicked vices that are the ruin of our hope
   and salvation? Even if they had such things, being pagans, their error
   would involve less offence to what is sacred, and less guilt, for
   though such sights as these are impure, still they would not involve
   violation of a sacrament.

   But as for us, how can we answer in our own behalf? We hold the creed
   and overthrow it. We are equally ready to confess the gift of salvation
   and to deny it. Where then is our Christianity, when we only receive
   the sacrament of salvation [327] to the end that falling from grace we
   may thereafter sin more grievously than before? We prefer vain shows to
   God's churches, we scorn his altars and honor the theaters. To
   conclude, we love and honor everything else; only God, in contrast with
   worldly pleasures, is vile in our sight.

   One case in itself proves the truth of my contention, disregarding all
   the rest. Whenever it happens, as it does only too often, that on the
   same day we are celebrating a feast of the church and the public games,
   [328] I ask it of everyone's conscience, which is it that collects
   greater crowds of Christians, the rows of seats at the public games or
   the court of God? Do all men throng to the temple in preference to the
   theater, love the words of the Gospel more than those of the stage--the
   words of life or of death, the words of Christ or of a mime? Without
   doubt; we love more that which we place first. For on every day when
   the fatal games are given, whatever festival of the church it may be,
   not only do men who claim to be Christians fail to come to the
   services, but any who do happen to have come unwittingly, if they
   chance to hear, while in the church, that games are being given, leave
   the building at once. The temple of God is scorned for a rush to the
   theater; the church is emptied and the circus filled; we leave Christ
   alone on the altar and feast our adulterous eyes on the foulest sights
   of the vile games. So it is with the greatest justice that the Lord God
   says to us: "For your filthiness you have been driven out in
   banishment." And again he says: "The altars of this laughter shall be
   brought to nothing." [329]

   8. At least, you say, this answer can be made, that such things are not
   done in all the cities of the Romans. True, and I shall even go so far
   as to say that they are not now being done in all places where they
   have been hitherto. For instance, no shows are given now in Mayence,
   but this is because the city has been destroyed and blotted out; [330]
   nor at Cologne, for it is overrun by the enemy. They are not being
   performed in the most noble city of Trèves, which has been laid low by
   a destruction four times repeated, [331] nor finally in many other
   cities of Gaul and Spain. Then woe to us and our iniquities, woe to us
   and our impurities! What hope have Christian congregations in the sight
   of God when these evils cease to exist in the Roman cities only from
   the time when the cities themselves have come into subjection to
   barbarian jurisdiction? This mark of vice and impurity seems to be a
   native characteristic of the Romans, an inborn trait, for wherever
   there are Romans, these evils prevail. Do you think that this is a
   serious and unjust accusation? Serious indeed, if it is without
   foundation. But how can it fail to be false, since the activities of
   which I spoke are now carried on in only a few Roman cities? Most of
   our cities, you claim, are not now polluted by the taint of these
   vices; even though they are the same places which were the homes of our
   old wickedness, still their former indulgences have ceased.

   So we must now consider the question, why those cities still seem to be
   the haunts of the games, whereas the games have ceased. They are still
   the homes and abiding places of disgraceful vice because all sorts of
   vile deeds have hitherto been enacted in them. Moreover, the only
   reason for the cessation of the games themselves is that they cannot be
   given at the present time because of the misery and poverty in which we
   live. That they were presented before was due to our depravity; that
   they are not given now, to our necessity. For the collapse of the
   imperial fiscus and the beggary of the Roman treasury do not permit
   money to be lavished on trifling matters that make no return. Let men
   squander as much as they please, casting their money into the mire;
   they cannot lose as much as they could formerly, for they have not as
   much to lose. In respect of our lustful desires and our base pleasures
   we should certainly like to have more abundance, if only that we might
   be able to transmute our wealth into disgraceful filth. The amounts
   squandered in our beggary are an indication of what we should like to
   spend if we were rich and magnificent. The bane and ruin of our present
   depraved condition is that though our poverty has nothing left to lose,
   our sinful souls yearn for more wealth to cast away.

   We cannot therefore console ourselves at all on these grounds, that is,
   by saying that the former extravagances are not now being committed in
   all our cities. For the only reason for their abandonment is that
   cities where they were carried on in the past are no longer in
   existence, or that in the places where such things used to be

   done, [means are lacking] [332] to perform them. Thus the spectacles
   are no longer possible in the cities where they were formerly
   performed; as God himself said to sinners through his prophet: "The
   Lord remembered these things and it came into his mind, and the Lord
   could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings and because of
   the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a
   desolation, and an astonishment and a curse." [333] So it has come to
   pass that the greater part of the Roman world is become a desolation
   and an astonishment and a curse.

   9. Would that these abominations had only been committed of old and
   that Roman depravity would at length cease such performances! Then
   perhaps, as it is written, God would be merciful to our sins. But we do
   not so act as to propitiate him. We constantly add evils to evils and
   pile sins upon sins, and though many of us have already perished we
   seek to complete our own destruction. Who, tell me, seeing another man
   killed beside him is not in terror for himself? Who can see his
   neighbor's house burn and not try by every means in his power to keep
   his own from being set on fire? But we not only see our neighbors
   burning [334] but know that the flames have already spread over the
   greater part of our own bodies. What unspeakable evil is this that we
   are suffering? We are on fire, on fire, I say, and yet we do not fear
   the flames that burn us. That the evils committed formerly are at last
   diminishing is the result of our miseries, not the fruit of a true
   repentance.

   This is easily proved; only give back our former prosperity and you
   shall see at once the old interests everywhere restored. Note this
   also: as far as men's wishes are concerned, even if the games are no
   longer actually being given in many places, yet they still exist as of
   old, for the Roman people everywhere wish them given. When nothing but
   sheer necessity hinders a man from an evil deed, the mere desire for a
   base act is as much to be condemned as the action. For if, as I said,
   according to the words of our Lord: "Whosoever looketh on a woman to
   lust after her is guilty of the adultery conceived in his heart," [335]
   we can understand that while of necessity we do not commit disgraceful
   acts worthy of condemnation, we are nevertheless guilty if we only
   desire forbidden things.

   Why should I mention desire? Most men actually do these things whenever
   they can. When the inhabitants of other cities come to Ravenna or Rome
   they join the Roman plebs in the circus, and the people of Ravenna in
   the theater. Therefore let no one consider himself acquitted on the
   ground of his distance from the spectacles. All are united in the
   turpitude of their actions who join one another in their desire for
   disgraceful deeds.

   Yet we flatter ourselves on the uprightness of our ways, the rarity of
   our vices. So I shall carry my charges farther: not only do men still
   yield as of old to the pollution of those infamous games but their
   guilt in this is much greater than before. For in the past the various
   members of the Roman world flourished unimpaired; the public wealth had
   made the storehouses inadequate; the citizens of all the towns had
   abundance of riches and delights, and amid such overflowing prosperity
   the authority of religion could hardly exercise due censorship of
   conduct. Then indeed those who exploited base desires found rich
   grazing on all sides, but there was no lack of wealth to satisfy their
   greed; no one worried about the public disbursements and expenses, for
   the cost was not felt. The state indeed seemed in a way to seek an
   opportunity to squander what it could scarcely continue to hold. Thus
   the heaped-up wealth that had already begun to exceed just bounds
   furnished abundance for lavishness even in trivial matters.

   But of the present situation what can we say? Our old abundance has
   deserted us; the resources of former times are gone, and we are in a
   wretched state, but do not cease our frivolities. Although even orphan
   wastrels are usually benefited by poverty, leaving off the error of
   their ways as soon as they have squandered their wealth, we seem to be
   a new class of profligates, in whom opulence has ceased to dwell, but
   dissipation persists. The causes of our corruption lie not as with
   other men in outside enticements, but in our hearts, and our minds are
   the source of our depravity, so that [we] are not [moved] to amend our
   ways by the loss of our wealth, but [go on] [336] sinning through love
   of wickedness.

   10. Although I may have shown sufficiently what serious vices the
   Romans have, from which the barbarian tribes are free, still I shall
   add many points that I have omitted. But before I continue, let me
   remind you that a fault of any sort which dishonors God should in no
   sense seem a trivial matter to anyone. It is never permissible to
   dishonor an illustrious and powerful man, and anyone who dishonors such
   a one is held guilty in the eyes of the law and is condemned in due
   course as responsible for the injurious action. How much more difficult
   of atonement is the accusation of injury to God! The fault of the
   wrongdoer always increases in proportion to the position of the person
   injured, since necessarily the greater the person of the man who
   suffers abusive action, the greater is the guilt of the man who commits
   such action. Wherefore we read in the law that even those who seem to
   have committed only slight offence against the sacred ordinances have
   nevertheless been most severely punished; to the end that we might know
   that nothing pertaining to God should be considered unimportant. Even
   what seemed to be a petty fault became a grave one, inasmuch as it was
   an injury to the divine power.

   What did Oza, the Levite of God, do against the divine commandment,
   when he tried to steady the ark of the Lord? There was no law laid down
   regarding this. Yet immediately he took hold of it, he was struck down,
   apparently not because he did anything in an impudent fashion or with
   an undutiful intention, but his very service was undutiful because he
   exceeded his orders. [337]

   When a man of the Israelites had gathered wood on the Sabbath, he was
   struck down and killed by the judgment and command of God, who is truly
   a most gentle and merciful judge, who would doubtless have preferred to
   spare rather than to kill, if the consideration of severity had not
   outweighed consideration of mercy. For one incautious man perished to
   save many from perishing thereafter through lack of caution. [338]

   But why do I speak of single individuals? The children of Israel in
   their journey through the desert, because they longed for their
   accustomed meat, lost a part of their number. The desire for meat had
   not yet been forbidden them, but God, I think, wished to further the
   observance of the law by the suppression of rebellious desires. He
   intended the whole people to learn the more easily how earnestly one
   should avoid what God forbade in his divine writings, since even those
   acts injured him which he had not yet forbidden by law. [339]

   The same people also murmured at the hardships they underwent, and for
   this reason were punished by the Lord's rods, not because it is
   forbidden a man to groan at hardships, but because their murmurs were
   displeasing to God, inasmuch as they seemed to accuse him of causing
   them too much labor. From this we should learn how much a man enjoying
   the blessings of good fortune ought to seek to please God, since it is
   not even permitted to complain of those ills that seem painful.

   11. What is the purpose of these examples? What else than that nothing
   should seem trivial that causes injury to God? For we were talking of
   the public games, which are truly mockeries of our hopes, mockeries of
   our life. While we sport in the theaters and circuses, we perish,
   according to the Sacred Word which says: "It is as sport to a fool to
   do mischief." [340] So we too, when we laugh amidst disgraceful and
   shameful sights, are committing crimes, and crimes of no slight extent.
   Our wrongdoing is the more worthy of punishment for this very reason,
   that though it seems to be of a most trivial nature, it is really
   pestilential and deadly in its outcome. There are two chief evils, for
   a man to destroy himself and for him to injure God; both of these are
   committed in the public games, where through criminal and shameful
   sights the eternal salvation of the Christian people is utterly
   destroyed, and through a sacrilegious superstition the divine majesty
   is violated. There can be no doubt that the games injure God,
   consecrated as they are to idols. For Minerva is worshipped and honored
   in the gymnasia, Venus in the theaters, Neptune in the circuses, Mars
   in the arena, Mercury in the palaestra, and thus the superstitious
   worship varies according to the character of its sponsors. [341] Impure
   actions of all sorts are performed in the theaters; there is wanton
   luxury in the palaestras, immoderate vice in the circuses, madness in
   the arenas. In one of these is wantonness, in another lasciviousness,
   in another intemperance, in another insanity, in them all the devil;
   nay, in each individual place where shows are held, not merely one
   devil, but devils of all varieties, for they preside over the places
   dedicated to their worship. Therefore in spectacles of this sort
   neither allurements nor vices are found alone. It is sacrilege for a
   Christian to mingle with this superstition, sharing in the worship of
   those in whose festivals he takes delight. While such a thing is always
   serious enough, it becomes more intolerable when either our adversity
   or our prosperity, exceeding the ordinary measure of our life, makes
   our acts more blameworthy. In adversity there is double need to appease
   God, and in prosperity to avoid grieving him. Surely he must be
   appeased when he is angry, and must not be alienated when he is
   propitious; for our adversities come to us through his wrath, our
   prosperity through his favor. But we do everything by contraries.

   How, do you ask? Listen. First, if won over by his own mercy--for we
   never so live that we deserve his favor--if, as I say, at any time won
   over by his own mercy God gives us peaceful seasons, plentiful crops,
   tranquillity rich in all good things and abundance increasing beyond
   our hopes, we let ourselves be so corrupted by great prosperity and
   fortune, we let ourselves be so depraved by insolent manners that we
   altogether forget God and ourselves. Although the apostle says that
   every benefit of the peace given by God depends on this: "That we lead
   a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty," [342] the
   only use we make of the quiet he gives is to live in drunkenness and
   luxury, in wantonness and rapine, in all manner of crime and
   wickedness. We look on his goodly gift of peace as an opportunity for
   licentiousness, and take the quiet given by his truce as a chance to
   sin more freely and safely.

   Therefore we are unworthy of heavenly gifts, who make no good use of
   God's kindness, and see in the means of good works only material for
   vice. Hence it comes that the peace which we so abuse itself works
   against us, and is actually harmful to us, since we use it to our
   detriment. Is this worthy of belief? We change nature itself by our
   wickedness, and the good things that God has made as his loving gift to
   us are turned to evil by our wanton lives.

   12. We who are corrupted by prosperity, you say, are corrected through
   adversity. Long peace had made us unruly, but we are brought back by
   strife to moderation. In what cases have the dwellers in our cities,
   who were licentious in prosperity, begun to be chaste in adversity?
   When has drunkenness, which increased in the time of our peace and
   prosperity, ceased under the ravages of the enemy?

   Italy has already been devastated by many disasters: have the vices of
   the Italians therefore ended? The city of Rome has been besieged and
   taken by storm: [343] have the Romans therefore ceased their mad
   blasphemy? Barbarous nations have overrun the states of Gaul: have the
   crimes of the Gauls therefore changed in character, as far as their
   evil habits are concerned? Tribes of Vandals have crossed over into the
   Spanish countryside: the fortune of the Spaniards has indeed changed,
   but not their corruption. Lastly, that no part of the world might be
   immune from fatal destruction, wars have begun to cross the seas, they
   have devastated and overthrown cities shut off by the waves, in
   Sardinia and Sicily, the imperial granaries. Having, as it were, cut
   off the vital channels of the empire, they captured Africa, which may
   be called its heart. What then? As barbarians entered that land, did
   its vices cease, even through fear? Or, as even the most worthless
   slaves are usually reformed for the time being, did terror drive them
   to modesty and self-restraint? Who can rightly estimate this evil? The
   barbarians' arms clashed about the walls of Cirta and Carthage [344]
   while the Christian congregation of the city raved in the circuses and
   wantoned in the theaters. Some had their throats cut without the walls,
   while others still committed fornication within; part of the people
   were captive to the enemy without, while part within the city were
   captive to their own vices. It is hard to decide which suffered the
   worse misfortune. The former indeed were captive externally in the
   flesh, the latter inwardly in the soul. Of the two deadly evils, it is
   less, I think, for a Christian to endure captivity of the body than of
   the soul, according to the teachings of the Savior himself in the
   Gospel, that the death of the soul is much more fatal than that of the
   body. [345]

   Or do we perhaps believe that those men were not captive in soul, who
   then rejoiced in the time of their people's captivity? Was he not
   captive in mind and heart, who laughed amid the punishments of his
   people, who did not know that his throat was being cut along with
   theirs, that in their deaths he also died? Outside the walls, as I have
   said, and inside them too, was heard the din of battle and of the
   games; the voices of dying men mingled with the voices of revellers;
   the outcry of the people slain in the war could scarcely be
   distinguished from the clamor of those who shouted in the circus. What
   was accomplished by this but the hastening of the destruction of the
   people who chose such a course, though God perhaps did not yet wish to
   destroy them?

   13. These places, however, are far away, almost removed to another
   world, and seem irrelevant to the discussion when I consider that even
   in my own country, [346] in the Gallic states, almost all men of high
   degree have been made worse by their misfortunes. I myself have seen
   men of lofty birth and honor, though already despoiled and plundered,
   [347] still less ruined in fortunes than in morality; for, ravaged and
   stripped though they were, something still remained to them of their
   property, but nothing of their character. They were so much more
   hostile to themselves than to alien enemies that, though they had
   already been ruined by the barbarians, they now completed their own
   destruction. It is sad to tell what we saw there; honored old men,
   feeble Christians, when the ruin of their state was already imminent,
   making themselves slaves to appetite and lust. What are the first
   grounds of accusation? That they were honored, old, Christians, or in
   danger? Who would deem it possible that such things should be done by
   old men even in utter security, or by boys in a crisis, or at any time
   whatever by Christians? They reclined at feasts, forgetful of their
   honor, forgetting justice, forgetting their faith and the name they
   bore. There were the leaders of the state, gorged with food, dissolute
   from winebibbing, wild with shouting, giddy with revelry, completely
   out of their senses, or rather, since this was their usual condition,
   precisely in their senses. In spite of all this, what I have next to
   say is still worse: not even the destruction of their towns put an end
   to their excesses. The wealthiest city of Gaul was taken by storm no
   less than four times. [348] It is easy to recognize the city of which I
   speak. The first captivity should surely have sufficed to mend the ways
   of the citizens, so that the renewal of their sins would not have
   renewed the destruction. But what followed? The tale is incredible. The
   constant repetition of misfortunes in that city increased its crimes.
   Like that fabulous monster whose heads multiplied as they were cut off,
   [349] so also in the most excellent city of Gaul, wickedness gathered
   strength from the very blows that punished it. You would have thought
   that the punishment intended to end the crimes of its people acted
   instead as the begetter of vice. What then? By the daily multiplication
   of swarming evils it has come to such a pass that the city could more
   easily exist without inhabitants than any of its citizens could do
   without crime.

   So much then for this city. What of another not far distant but of
   almost equal magnificence? [350] Has it not suffered the same ruin of
   fortunes and of morals? For aside from all else, when it was utterly
   demoralized by the two chief evils common to all, avarice and
   drunkenness, it finally reached such a state of rabid greed for wine
   that the very rulers of the city did not rise from their feasts when
   the enemy were actually entering the gates. God wished to make clear to
   them why they perished, since at the moment of their final disaster
   they were leading the very life through which they had come to ruin. I
   myself saw lamentable sights there, with no distinction between boys
   and old men. The scurrility and levity of all were alike; all vices
   reigned at once--extravagance, drinking bouts, wantonness--all the
   people revelled together. They drank, gamed, committed adultery. Old
   and honored men waxed wanton at their feasts; men already almost too
   feeble to live proved mighty in their cups; men too weak to walk were
   strong in drinking; those whose steps tottered were nimble dancers.
   What more can be said? Through all that I have recounted they became so
   degraded that the words of the Sacred Scripture were fulfilled in them:
   "Wine and women make men of understanding to fall away from God." [351]
   For while they drink, dice, rape and play the madman, men begin to deny
   Christ. After all this do we wonder that men who have long since
   undergone moral ruin suffer the ruin of their fortunes? Let no one
   think that such a city perished only at the time of its physical
   destruction, for the deeds of its people had brought its ruin long
   before their death.

   14. I have told the fate of the most famous cities. What of the many
   others in various parts of Gaul? Have they not fallen, too, because of
   like vices on the part of their citizens? All were so completely
   possessed by their crimes that they did not fear any danger they had
   foreknowledge of captivity and did not dread it. Fear indeed was taken
   away from these sinful men to prevent them from the exercise of
   caution. Therefore, though the barbarians were settled almost within
   their sight, men felt no fear, the cities remained unguarded. Such was
   the blindness of their hearts, or rather of their sins, that although
   doubtless no one wished to die, no one did anything to ward off death.
   Everything was in the grip of carelessness and sloth, negligence and
   gluttony, drunkenness and sleep, as has been written of such men:
   "Because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them." [352] A deep
   sleep indeed fell upon them that destruction might follow closely. For
   when, as it is written, a sinner's iniquity is full [353] and he is due
   to perish, foreknowledge is taken from him, that he may not escape his
   doom. But enough of this. I have made my point sufficiently clear, I
   think, that not even in the time of the greatest danger did the vices
   of the people come to an end before the actual overthrow of their
   cities.

   15. Perhaps such things have occurred in the past, but have now come to
   an end, or will do so at some future time. Yes, forsooth, if today any
   city or province that has been smitten by God's scourge or devastated
   by the enemy appears humbled, converted and amended, if practically all
   who bear the Roman name do not prefer death to reformation, the end of
   their life to the end of their vices! This can be quickly tested by the
   example of the greatest city of Gaul, three times destroyed by
   successive captures, [354] yet when the whole city had been burned to
   the ground, its wickedness increased even after its destruction. Those
   whom the enemy had not killed when they pillaged the city were
   overwhelmed by disaster after the sack; those who had escaped death in
   the capture did not survive the ruin that followed. Some died lingering
   deaths from deep wounds, others were burned by the enemy's fires and
   suffered tortures even after the flames were extinguished. Some
   perished of hunger, others of nakedness, some wasting away, others
   paralyzed with cold, and so all alike by diverse deaths hastened to the
   common goal.

   Worse than all this, other cities suffered from the destruction of this
   single town. There lay all about the torn and naked bodies of both
   sexes, a sight that I myself endured. These were a pollution to the
   eyes of the city, as they lay there lacerated by birds and dogs. The
   stench of the dead brought pestilence on the living: death breathed out
   death. Thus even those who had escaped the destruction of the city
   suffered the evils that sprang from the fate of the rest.

   What followed these calamities? Who can assay such utter folly? The few
   men of rank who had survived destruction demanded of the emperors [355]
   circuses as the sovereign remedy for a ruined city. O that I might here
   and now be gifted with eloquence adequate to cope with this shocking
   event, that there might be at least as much virtue in my complaint as
   there is sorrow at its cause! Who can even decide what chiefly merits
   accusation in the tale, irreverence or stupidity, extravagance or
   insanity? In these terms the whole is comprised. What is more
   irreverent than a petition that works injury to God? What is more
   stupid than not to consider your petition carefully? What so clear a
   proof of hopeless extravagance as to desire luxuries in a time of
   general mourning? Or more insane than to be in the midst of evils
   without any understanding of them?

   Among these, however, insanity is the least culpable, for the will is
   not at fault when sin is committed through sheer madness. Therefore
   those of whom I speak deserved the greater blame, because, though sane,
   they acted senselessly. Do you, O citizens of Trèves, long for circuses
   when you have been plundered and captured, after slaughter and
   bloodshed, after stripes and captivity, and the repeated destruction of
   your ruined city? What is more lamentable than this stupidity, more
   grievous than this folly? I confess I thought you most miserable when
   you were suffering destruction, but I see that you are now more
   miserable when you demand public shows. At first I thought you had lost
   only your material property in the capture of your city; I did not know
   that you had lost also your intelligence and control of your senses. Do
   you then ask for theaters, and demand a circus from our emperors? For
   what condition, I ask, what people and what city? A city burned and
   destroyed, a people captive and killed, who have perished, or mourn
   their dead; a city of which nothing survives but sheer calamity, whose
   people are altogether anxious in their grief, worn out by tears,
   prostrate in bereavement, so that it is hard to say whether the lot of
   the living or the dead is worse to bear. So great are the miseries of
   the survivors that they surpass the ill fortune of the dead.

   Do you then seek public shows, O citizen of Trèves? Where, pray, are
   they to be given? Over the pyres and ashes, the bodies and blood of the
   dead? For what part of your city is free from these? Where has blood
   not been shed, where are bodies and mangled limbs not strewn?
   Everywhere the city's appearance betrays its capture, everywhere are
   the horror of captivity and the image of death. [356] The remains of a
   most unhappy people lie on the graves of their dead, yet you ask for
   circuses; the city is blackened by fire, yet you put on a festive
   countenance; all things mourn, but you rejoice! Yea more, by your
   infamous pleasure you provoke God, and by your vile superstitions
   arouse his divine wrath. Can there be any wonder that such a fate has
   befallen you, when threefold destruction has not corrected you, so that
   you richly deserved to perish by the fourth?

   16. I have given the above account in somewhat full detail to prove
   that we have borne all our sufferings not through the failure of God's
   providence or through his neglect, but because of his justice and
   judgment--a most just dispensation and worthy retribution--and that no
   portion whatever of the Roman world and Roman name, however greatly
   chastised by afflictions sent from heaven, has ever been corrected.
   Thus we prove that we do not deserve to enjoy prosperity, since we are
   not corrected by adversity.

   Good gifts are given us from time to time, however, unworthy though we
   are. The good God, like a most indulgent father, sometimes lets us be
   humbled for our sins, but does not suffer us to be afflicted long. So
   at one time he chastises his children by adversity, in accordance with
   his discipline, and again favors them with peace, according to his
   mercy. As the best and most skilful doctors give different cures for
   various diseases and succor some by sweet, others by bitter drugs; cure
   certain ills by cautery, others by soothing poultices; employ ruthless
   surgery for some, but pour healing oil on others; seeking the same good
   health by utterly different cures: so also our God, when he restrains
   us by harsher blows, is seeking to cure us by cautery and surgery; when
   he favors us with good fortune he is offering us soothing oil and
   poultices--for by means of different treatments he wishes to restore us
   all to the same good health.

   Gentle treatment usually corrects even the most incorrigible slaves
   whom punishment has failed to reform, and kindness subdues those whom
   the lash failed to make submissive to their masters. Babies, too, and
   almost all stubborn children, whom threats and blows do not make
   amenable, are often led to obedience by goodies and endearments. Hence
   we should realize that we are more worthless than the worst slaves, and
   more stupid than foolish children, since torments do not correct us as
   they do bad slaves, nor coaxings win us over as they do naughty
   children.

   17. I think I have now proved adequately that punishment has not
   corrected any part of the Roman people; it remains to prove that
   neither the gifts nor the gentle words of God correct us. What then are
   the gifts and gentle words of God? What indeed but our peace and quiet,
   the calmness of prosperity that attends on our hopes and wishes? Let me
   give you a particular instance, since the case demands it.

   Whenever we are in fear, distress and danger, when cities are besieged
   by the enemy or provinces devastated, or the members of the state
   wounded by any other adversities, and we offer prayers and vows to the
   heavenly hosts for help, then if by the aid of the divine mercy our
   cities are saved, the devastation ended, the hostile armies routed and
   all fear removed by God's grace, what do we immediately do? Do we
   endeavor to recompense our Lord God by our worship, honor and reverence
   for the benefits we have received at his hands? For this is the fitting
   action and in accordance with human custom, that those who give us
   gifts may receive due return for them. This then perhaps we do, giving
   God recompense in human fashion, and making a good return for the good
   we have received of him.

   So we run at once to the Lord's house, and prostrate ourselves on the
   ground, we supplicate him, our joy mixed with tears, and bedeck his
   doorway with, votive garlands, we adorn his altars with gifts, and
   since we ourselves are making a festival of gifts to him, transfer the
   joy of our countenance to his temples also. Or at least, an act no less
   pleasing to him, we renounce the vices of our former lives, we give
   good works as a sacrifice to him, and offer up a new conversion in
   return for our new joys. Lastly we declare a holy war on all
   uncleanliness, shun the madness of the circus, curse the vileness of
   the shows in the theater, vow a new life to the Lord and, to obtain his
   protection forever, dedicate ourselves to God.

   18. Although all that I have described should be given to God for his
   recent benefits, let us consider what we actually do. Men run at once
   to the games, fly off to their old insanity, the folk pour into the
   theaters, the whole people riot madly at the circuses. God gives us
   good gifts to assure our merit, but we, as often as we receive his
   benefits, multiply our crimes. He by his mercies calls us to
   righteousness, but we rush headlong into wickedness; he by his mercies
   calls us to repentance, but we rush to destruction; he calls us to
   chastity, but we rush into impurity. A noble response we make to his
   holy favors, nobly do we recognize and honor his gifts, who repay the
   kindness we have received from him by an equal measure of injustice! Is
   this not injury to our God, or can any injury be less deserved, [when]
   great and frequent [gratitude] is needed instead? [357]

   But since by the taint of wickedness ingrained in our nature we cannot
   fail to be prey to vice except by ceasing to live at all, what hope of
   good is there in us? Those who sin through ignorance correct themselves
   when they learn their error; those who do not know the true religion
   begin to change their way of life when they change their faith. Lastly,
   those who are spoiled by excessive abundance and security, as I said,
   cease their depravity when they are no longer secure. We do not err
   through ignorance, nor are we outside the true religion, nor corrupted
   by prosperity and security: quite the reverse. We know the true
   religion, so ignorance cannot serve as our excuse; we lack the peace
   and wealth of our former days; all that we had has been taken from us
   or changed--only our vices have been increased. Nothing remains of our
   former peace and plenty but our crimes, which have made our prosperity
   cease.

   Where are now the old resources and honors of Rome? The Romans were of
   old the mightiest of men, now they are without strength; of old they
   were feared, but now they live in fear; barbarous nations paid tribute
   to them, but to these same nations they are now tributary. [358] The
   enemy sell us the very daylight; almost our whole safety is purchased
   for a price. Alas for our misfortunes! to what a pass have we come! For
   this we give thanks to the barbarians, that we are allowed to ransom
   ourselves from them at a price. What could be more abjectly wretched
   than to live on such terms? Yet after all this we think that we are
   living, we whose lives depend on tribute! We even make ourselves
   additionally ridiculous by pretending that the gold we pay is merely a
   gift. We call it a gift, yet it is really a ransom--but a ransom paid
   on unusually hard and wretched terms. When captives have been redeemed,
   they gain their liberty, whereas we pay ransom constantly and are never
   free. The barbarians deal with us like those masters who hire out for
   wages slaves not needed for their own service. In like fashion, we are
   never free of the payments due: we pay ransom constantly in order to
   have the privilege of continuing endlessly to pay.

   [312] Here there is a lacuna in the MSS. I have followed Pauly's
   conjecture to fill out the sense, but am inclined to agree with
   Zschimmer, op. cit., p. 35, that the abrupt introduction of the subject
   of the games indicates a more substantial loss in the text.

   [313] Salvian's diatribe against the games has been one of the most
   quoted portions of his work as Grégoire and Collombet note (Oeuvres de
   Salvien, II, 476), it was much used by the French clergy in the 18 th
   century, especially as a source for Lenten sermons. The Italian
   translation by S. Carlo Borromeo (Milan, 1579) is actually entitled
   Libro di Salviano Vescovo di Marsiglia contra, gli spettacoli ed altre
   vanità del mondo. The subject was one on which the majority of the
   Fathers wrote with vehemence, and there is naturally a considerable
   degree of similarity in their attacks. Salvian's chapters on the
   spectacles are perhaps closest to Tertullian, De spectaculis, and to
   what Lactantius has to say on the subject in various sections of his
   Institutiones divinae.

   [314] This sentence shows that in spite of all attempts to check the
   custom, men were still being "thrown to the lions" in the middle of the
   5th century. Constantine in A.D. 325 decreed (Cod. Just. XI. 44) :
   "Bloody spectacles in a time of civil peace and domestic quiet do not
   meet with our favor, wherefore we absolutely prohibit the existence of
   gladiators." Rittershausen aptly queries whether the spectacle of men
   torn and devoured by wild beasts was more suited to civil peace and
   quiet than were gladiatorial combats.

   [315] See Minucius Felix Octavius 26.

   [316] Already in the fourth century the chief functions of the consuls
   at Rome had come to be the giving of their names to the official year,
   and giving games to the people; this example therefore has an added
   pertinence in the discussion of the games. See Seneca De ira III. 31,
   in the importance of the consul ordinarius as compared with the consuls
   later in the year, who were deprived of that immortality for their
   names, which until the general adoption of the Christian era was really
   considerable.

   [317] See Seneca Ep. VII. 2: "Nothing is so ruinous to good character
   as to spend time at any spectacle."

   [324] Luke 6. 25, 21.

   [325] Tertullian makes a similar connection between spectacula and
   pompa diaboli in De spectaculis 4. On his other uses of the phrase, and
   its generally symbolic meaning at this time, cf. P. de Labriolle's
   article, "Pompa Diaboli," Bulletin du Cange, II (1926), 170-181. The
   actual word spectacula was not included in the baptismal vow, but in
   Salvian's interpretation was inherent in the pomp and works of the
   devil. So Tertullian, in the passage cited above, says: "If then the
   whole apparatus of the spectacles is proven to consist of idolatry,
   there is no doubt that our vow of renunciation at the font refers also
   to the spectacles, which are by their idolatry in the service of the
   devil and his pomp and angels."

   [326] See Isidore, Etymologiae XVIII. 59: "These spectacles of cruelty
   and vanity were instituted not only by the vices of men but by the
   orders of demons also. Therefore a Christian should have nothing to do
   with the insanity of the circus, with the indecency of the theater,
   with the cruelty of the amphitheater, with the atrocities of the arena,
   with the voluptuousness of the games. For he who prefers such sights
   denies God, being made a traitor to the Christian faith, who seeks
   again what he once renounced at the font; that is, the devil, his pomps
   and works."

   [327] That is, baptism.

   [328] Another instance of popular disregard for imperial edicts. Cod.
   Theod. II. 8. 20, in A.D. 392, forbade circuses on Sunday except when
   the emperor's birthday fell on that day. Another decree, ibid. II. 8.
   23, of A.D. 399, forbade theaters and races and all sorts of public
   shows, with the same exception. In A.D. 409 (ibid. II. 8. 25), the
   prohibition hold even for the emperor's birthday and the anniversaries
   of his rule. A few years after Salvian's book was published, the
   emperors Leo and Anthemius in the East (Cod. Just. III. 12. 9, A.D.
   469) inflicted heavy penalties for presence at the spectacles on
   Sunday, and on any officials who should authorize such performances "on
   the pretext of public business."

   [329] Sources? Compare Isaiah 16.4 and 10.

   [330] Haemmerle, op. cit., I. 27-28, puts the destruction of Mayence in
   A.D. 405-406 (see Jerome, Ep. 123; Migne, PL, XXII, col. 1057), and
   that of Cologne between 438 and 440, as it is here connected with the
   fourth sack of Trèves. Salvian, Ep. I, agrees with this in his account
   of the effect on his relatives of the recent sack of the city.

   [331] The dates of the four destructions of Trèves here mentioned have
   been much discussed with widely differing conclusions. The 12th century
   Gesta Treverorum described four captures of the city, but, ranging as
   they do from that of the "Greeks" under the Arian Constans in A.D. 380
   to that of the Franks in 463, they do not suit the conditions required
   by Salvian's text. The recent tendency has been to ascribe all four
   captures of the city to the Franks, and to set them fairly close
   together, emphasizing the phrase ter continuatis vicibus in VI. 15
   infra. Rudolph and Kenterich (Quellen zur Rechts- und
   Wirtschaftsgebiete der rheinischen Städte: kurtrierische Städte: I.
   Trier, Bonn 1915, 5-6) incline to date the first capture in A.D.
   411-412, the second and third in the period from 412 to 416, and the
   fourth in 427-428, dates that connect well with Salvian's account and
   with local conditions. The earlier and later dates assigned by some
   commentators, while suitable as far as the history of Trèves is
   concerned, are less consistent with the conditions required by
   Salvian's account. For summaries of various opinions on this point, see
   Haemmerle, Studia Salviana I, 19-26. Haemmerle himself suggests the
   date 406 as that of a sack by the Vandals, and 411-413, 418, 438-439 or
   earlier, as Frankish destructions of the city. This conjecture is not
   far from that of Rudolph and Kenterich.

   [332] The text is badly corrupted, and no satisfactory emendation has
   been proposed. The bracketed words are supplied on the basis of the
   preceding sentence.

   [333] Jeremiah 44. 21-22.

   [334] Baluze, referring this phrase to the burning of Trèves, somewhat
   gratuitously concluded that Salvian could not have been a native of
   that city.

   [335] Matthew 5. 28.

   [336] The corrupt text is here emended according to Pauly's
   conjectures.

   [341] See Tertullian De spectaculis 10-11.

   [342] I Timothy 2. 2.

   [343] That the reference here is to the sack of Rome by Alaric in A.D.
   410 is clearly shown by the order of events cited; if it had been
   intended, as those who use this passage to prove that Salvian's book
   was written after A.D. 455 assume, to refer to the Vandal sack, it
   would hardly have been made the first of a series of events ending with
   the Vandal destruction of Carthage some years before their sack of
   Rome.

   [344] Gaiseric captured Carthage in A.D. 439, after ten years of
   general Vandal control in Africa. The orthodox clergy were given their
   choice of slavery or exile, as were the nobles. Church property was
   given over to the Arians.

   [345] Luke 9. 24-25.

   [346] This phrase was overlooked by those commentators who held that
   Salvian was born in the province of Africa.

   [347] That is, in the first sack of the city of Trèves.

   [348] The reference to Trèves is obvious. This estimate of the city is
   supported by the general testimony of the writers of the early empire.
   Ausonius puts Trèves in the fourth place in his Ordo urbium
   clarissimarum, the first being assigned to Rome, the second to
   Constantinople and Carthage, and third to Antioch, so that Trèves is
   second only to Rome in western Europe. The choice of the city as the
   seat of the praetorian prefect of Gaul is a significant indication of
   its preeminence. See also Cod. Theod. XIII. 3. 11, De medicis et
   professoribus (A.D. 376): "For the most glorious city of Trèves we have
   thought best to make a somewhat more ample allowance, that thirty
   annonae be paid to a teacher of rhetoric, twenty to a teacher of Latin
   grammar, and twelve to one of Greek, if a worthy one can be found."

   [349] That is, the Lernaean hydra. The labors of Heracles were a
   popular subject for light verse; cf. Ausonius Monosticha de XII
   aerumnis Herculis.

   [350] Brouwer, Antiquitatum et Annalium Treverensium libri XXV (1671),
   V. 14, p. 275, identified this city as Mayence, which seems to fit
   better than Metz or Cologne, the description of utter ruin. In VI. 8
   supra, Salvian mentioned Mayence especially as having been destroyed,
   while Cologne was only spoken of as being full of the enemy. Haemmerle,
   op. cit., I. 18, follows Baluze in identifying the city here mentioned
   with Cologne instead.

   [351] Ecclesiasticus 19. 2.

   [352] I Samuel 26. 12.

   [353] Genesis 15. 16.

   [354] This phrase offers some support for the adoption of dates for the
   first three captures of the city close to each other in point of time:
   c.f. note 29 supra.

   [355] Haemmerle, op. cit., I. 22-23, pointed out the importance of this
   plural for dating the third sack of Trèves, since the joint rule of
   Honorius and Constantius, A.D. 420-421, was the only possible date
   before Salvian's withdrawal to Lérins, when there could have been two
   imperatores in the West to whom such an appeal could have been made.
   Hence the third sack of the city must have taken place at about 420. He
   suggests further that the people of Trèves hoped by the circuses to
   attract more residents for the rebuilding of the city.

   [356] The Vergilian phrase, imago mortis (Aeneid II. 360).

   [357] The lacuna indicated by Halm is supplied according to Pauly's
   conjecture.

   [358] Tribute had been paid to barbarians in return for guarantees of
   the integrity of the frontier since the early empire: beginning with
   the fourth century such tributes came to be due more and more to
   weakness, rather than to policy, till the condition was reached which
   Salvian here describes.

  THE SEVENTH BOOK

   1. My description, at the end of the previous book, of the weakness and
   misery of the Romans, may seem to be at variance with my general
   proposition. I admitted that the very people who, as pagans, conquered
   and ruled the world, are being conquered and enslaved, now that they
   have become Christians. Is not this clear evidence of God's neglect of
   human affairs? The charge is easily refuted by what I said long ago
   about the pagan nations. Those who know the law of God and neglect it
   are more guilty than those who fail to observe it through lack of
   knowledge.

   However, if God is willing, since we have reached the point in our
   undertaking at which something should be said of the old Romans, we
   shall, with God's help, prove that his favor to them in the past was as
   just as is his present severity toward us, and that his help to them in
   former times was as fully deserved as is our punishment now. [359]

   Would that this same punishment were of benefit to us! Much harder and
   more grievous than punishment is the fact that no amendment follows.
   The Lord wishes to cure us by his chastisement, but improvement does
   not result. How can we explain this evil? Cattle and flocks are cured
   by surgery; when the diseased organs of mules, asses and swine have
   been cauterized they acknowledge the healing effect of the fire, and at
   once when the corruption of the infected parts has been burned away or
   cut out, living flesh grows in place of the dead tissue. But we are
   burned and cut, yet are not healed by the surgeon's tools or the
   burning of the cautery. What is more serious, such care makes us even
   worse. It is not mere chance that we undergo the same treatment as
   flocks and cattle afflicted by incurable diseases. For in all parts of
   the world, since the healing care that is given us has no effect, our
   lives are being brought to an end by death and destruction. Indeed, not
   to repeat what I said some time ago, how can we define these disorders
   except by saying that we are at the same time living in misery and in
   luxury? Grant that luxury is the vice of the fortunate (though no one
   can be both infamous and happy at the same time, since there is no true
   happiness without honor), grant that these are the vices of a long
   peace and plentiful security, why then are they found where there is no
   longer peace or security? Almost throughout the Roman world peace and
   security have ceased. Why do only the vices they engender survive? Who
   can tolerate licentiousness in a needy man? Wantonness in poverty earns
   the more reproach, and a worthless fellow is more heavily censured if
   his condition is wretched.

   The whole Roman world is at once wretched and voluptuous. What poor man
   is also wanton? What man awaiting captivity thinks of the circus? Who
   laughs in the shadow of death? Yet we, in the fear of captivity,
   continue to frequent the games, and shadowed by the fear of death, we
   laugh. You would think the whole Roman people had been steeped in
   Sardonic herbs: [360] they are dying, yet they laugh. So in almost
   every part of the world tears follow close upon our laughter; and the
   saying of our Lord comes home to us at the present time: "Woe unto you
   that laugh, for ye shall weep." [361]

   2. The great length at which I have spoken of the disgraceful character
   of the public spectacles may have led you to assume that the abstinence
   of the barbarians from this particular vice of ours is their only point
   of moral superiority to us, inasmuch as we are not polluted as they are
   by the crime of carnal lust and the filth of mortal fornication. Let us
   then, if you please, compare the Romans in this respect also with other
   nations. I cannot indeed think of any with whom we may be more justly
   compared than those whom God has put into the very bosom of the state
   and made owners and lords of the Roman land. Although there was
   absolutely no ground to dispute his judgment in this, still, since he
   has taken away from us the best part of our territory, and given it to
   the barbarians, let us see whether he seems to have exercised justice
   in this transfer.

   No one questions that the Aquitanians and the Nine Peoples [362] had
   the very marrow of the Gallic provinces, rich in every sort of
   fertility, and not in fertility alone, but in qualities sometimes
   ranked above this, charm, beauty and luxury. Almost all that district
   is still covered with close-planted vines, flowering meadows, plowed
   fields, fruit orchards, charming groves, springing fountains, flowing
   streams or waving grain, so that the owners and masters of the land
   truly seem to have taken for their own not so much a section of ground
   as a likeness of paradise. What conclusion can be drawn from this?
   Unquestionably those men ought to have been more fervent in service to
   God whom he had especially enriched by the most abundant evidence of
   his favor. What is more right and fitting than that those whom their
   Lord seemed especially to have favored by his gifts should themselves
   make an earnest effort to please him by their religious worship,
   particularly since God lays no heavy or burdensome demands on us? For
   he does not call on us to plow or hoe, to spade up the earth or prepare
   the ground for vines, nor, to sum up, does he exact from his slaves
   what we require of ours. What does he himself say? "Come unto me, all
   ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest; take my
   yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye
   shall find rest unto your souls; for my yoke is easy, and my burden is
   light." [363]

   So we see that the Lord calls us not to labor but to rest. What does he
   exact of us, what does he order us to offer him, save only faith,
   chastity, humility, sobriety, mercy and sanctity? All these assuredly
   do not burden but adorn us. Nor is this all; they adorn our present
   life to the end that they may adorn even more the life to come. O good
   and loving master, of inestimable mercy! He has given us the gifts of
   religion at the present time that he may later reward us for the gifts
   he now gives! These virtues, then, all the Aquitanians should have
   cultivated, and indeed, as I said before, they should have made more
   especial efforts in this direction, since they had received the
   especial gifts of God. What resulted from their prosperity? What was
   bound to result? Was it not the exact reverse of what should have
   happened? In all the provinces of Gaul these men who are first in
   wealth, are first also in vice: nowhere is pleasure more shameless,
   life more vicious, or moral standards more corrupt. This is the return
   they have given God for his sacred gifts, that as far as by his
   generosity he had drawn them to his favor, so far they by their abuse
   have labored to arouse his anger.

   3. Or is this perhaps false, and are all my statements due to envy
   rather than truth? I shall not use the method of proof some men employ
   in the courts, bringing in as witnesses outsiders or persons unsuitable
   to testify for some other reason. I shall cross-question the very men
   by whom these things have been done. I have spoken falsely if they deny
   me. They confess, and indeed, which is much more serious, they confess
   without any apparent grief. For now in their confession they have the
   same attitude as in their commission of the fault. Just as then they
   were not ashamed to perform disgraceful acts, so now they do not in the
   least repent having performed them. We must indeed make exception for a
   very small number of men distinguished for their holiness, who, as one
   of their number has said, "have given their wealth to redeem their
   crime." [364] Of these we must make an exception, men who, we believe,
   were actually guilty only of lesser crimes even in the midst of the
   almost universal entanglements of vice, and who merited conversion by
   God's divine power. Now one for whom favor is reserved has not been
   altogether injurious to his master in his actions. What more can I say?
   I think that a man whom God has persuaded at last to cease from his
   wrongdoing has always had God in mind, even in the midst of his error.

   The rest, however, at least the great majority and the most noble, are
   all very nearly of a kind: the intemperance of all is a devouring
   whirlpool, their life a brothel. Why should I speak of brothels? Even
   those I think are less wicked than the men of whom I spoke. For the
   prostitutes in them have not experienced the marriage bond, and so do
   not defile what they do not know; their shameless lives require
   atonement, it is true, but they are not liable to the charge of
   adultery. Add to this that such haunts are few, and few the prostitutes
   who have condemned themselves to a most unhappy life in them. Among the
   Aquitanians, on the other hand, what city in its richest and most
   elegant quarters was not practically a brothel? What rich and powerful
   man did not live in lustful vice? Who among them did not plunge into
   the pit of the most sordid associations? Who honored his wife by a
   faithful observance of his marriage vows? Nay, as far as passive
   endurance of their lust is concerned, who among them did not reduce his
   wife to the status of his maidservants and degrade the sacrament of
   holy matrimony so far that no woman in the house was made to seem more
   contemptible by her husband's conduct than she who was made chief in it
   by the dignity of marriage?

   4. Perhaps some one is thinking that what I say is not strictly
   accurate; for the matrons of southern Gaul did continue to exercise
   their rights and to hold honor and power as mistresses of their
   households. That is true. Many of them indeed did keep unimpaired their
   right of government, but scarcely one kept her marriage rights
   unpolluted. Our present object of investigation is not the power of
   women, but the infamous conduct of their husbands. However, I should
   not even say that the matrons kept their power uninjured, since a wife
   who has not kept her connubial rights safe and inviolate has not kept
   her full rights of domination. When the master of the house acts as
   husband of the maidservants, the mistress is not far removed from the
   mean position of the slave. Who among the rich men of Aquitania did not
   so act? Who among them has not been considered by his shameless maids,
   and with good, reason, as either adulterer or husband? For, as the
   prophet said: "They were as fed horses in the morning; everyone neighed
   after his neighbor's wife." [365] Those of whom he spoke sinned perhaps
   less grievously, and, I think, with less intention of wrong than did
   our men. The Aquitanians more truly resembled the post horses: they
   whinnied not after a few women merely, but after all their household
   maids--that is, after their own herds--and, like those; beasts called
   the stallions of the herd, they waxed wanton with the heat of their
   intoxicating passion, and attacked whatever woman was first exposed to
   the onslaught of their shameless lust. Since this is the case, I ask
   the wise what sort of families they think were found where such men
   were heads of the households? What corruption do they think there would
   be among the slaves, where there Avas such great vice among the
   masters? For if the head is diseased no part of the body is sound, and
   no member performs its functions when the dominating part is not
   functioning. Moreover, the master's relation to his house is that of
   the head to the body, its very life, setting up standards of living for
   all its members. The most unfortunate aspect of the matter is that all
   follow the worse example more readily, and evil associations corrupt
   good manners more easily than good ones will correct the evil.
   Furthermore, since even good and honorable heads of families cannot
   make their slaves good, what do you think becomes of the household
   morality when the master himself sets an example of lewdness? And yet
   in such a case we have not only an example of immorality but a sort of
   enforced necessity, since the slave women are compelled to obey their
   wanton masters against their will, and the lust of those in power is
   the compulsion of their subjects. From this we may see how great was
   the filth of shameless vice when women subject to the most depraved of
   masters were not allowed to be chaste even when they wished.

   5. It may be difficult, you think, to prove this, and no traces are
   likely to be found remaining of the past debauchery and lust. See,
   then, how many of these men, even though they no longer have any
   country, and are living as paupers in comparison with their past
   wealth, are really worse than before. They are worse not only in that
   they continue to live as they did formerly, but in the very fact that
   their crimes never cease. Indeed their evil deeds, though not worse
   than before in character, are more numerous; thus, even though no new
   devices lend novelty to their sins, the number of their misdoings is
   increased.

   Add to this that, as I have said, it is old men, and poor ones, who
   live in such a fashion; for each of these points increases the evil.
   Surely it is less shocking for young men and rich to sin. But what hope
   of cure is there for men who are not recalled from their wonted vice
   either by miserable poverty or by extreme age? Some of them, I suppose,
   are relying on a foolish assurance of long life or the intention of
   eventual penitence; is it not a strange prodigy that men should be
   given over to vice even at the very time of death? This being the case,
   what more can be said? I add one more point, however, that many are
   living in this fashion today, even among the enemy, and subject as
   captives to daily fear and danger, and although it was on account of
   the excessive wickedness of their lives that God surrendered them into
   the hands of the enemy, they do not forsake their vice even among the
   barbarians.

   6. Perhaps those among whom they now live are of such a character that
   these vices please them, and they would be most grievously offended if
   they were to see the Romans living chastely in the midst of their
   vices. If this were the ease, still the wickedness of others ought not
   to make us wicked. It should be of more importance in every man's eyes
   to be good on his own account than to be wicked for another. We should
   strive to please God by our uprightness rather than men by our vices.
   Consequently, even if a man lives among unchaste barbarians, he ought
   to seek chastity, which is of service to him, rather than lewdness,
   which pleases his lustful enemies. But note a point that serves to
   increase our guilt: among chaste barbarians we ourselves are unchaste.
   [366] I shall say even more; the barbarians themselves are offended by
   our vices. Among the Goths no one is permitted to indulge in
   fornication; only the Romans in their land, by national and titular
   prerogative, are allowed this vice. What hope, I ask, have we then in
   the sight of God? We love vice, while the Goths execrate it; we flee
   from purity, while they love it; fornication with them is a perilous
   vice, but with us a mark of honor. Do we think that we can stand before
   God, do we think that we can attain salvation, when every crime of
   impurity, every disgraceful vice, is committed by the Romans and
   censured by the barbarians? At this point I ask those who consider us
   better than the barbarians to tell me which of these evils are
   committed by even a very few of the Goths, and which of them are not
   committed by all or nearly all of the Romans? Yet we wonder that the
   lands of the Aquitanians and of us all have been given by God to the
   barbarians, though those same barbarians are now purifying by their
   chastity the places polluted by the fornication of the Romans.

   7. Is this the case in Aquitania alone? Let us pass under review other
   parts of the world also, and not speak exclusively of the Gauls. Have
   not the same crimes or greater ones destroyed the provinces of Spain?
   Even if the divine wrath had handed these lands over to any other
   barbarians you might name, the enemies of chastity in them would have
   suffered tortures worthy of their vices. But as an added evidence of
   the condemnation of their shamelessness they were delivered into the
   hands of the Vandals, the most shamefast of barbarians. In the
   captivity of Spain God wished to give a twofold evidence of his hatred
   of carnal lust and love of chastity, when he put the Vandals in command
   solely on account of their preeminent chastity and subjected the
   Spaniards to them solely on account of their surpassing lewdness. What
   do I mean by this? Were there not anywhere in the world stronger
   barbarians to whom the Spanish lands might be surrendered? Many,
   without doubt, nay, all of them were stronger, if I am not mistaken.
   [367] But he handed the people of Spain over to the weakest of the
   enemy expressly to show that it was not the strength but the merit of
   the Vandals that conquered, and that we were not being overwhelmed by
   the power of our foes, who then seemed most unheroic, but only by the
   wickedness of our vices, that the saying of the Lord to the Jews might
   be fulfilled in us: "According to their uncleanness and according to
   their transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them."
   [368] Elsewhere speaking to the same people, he said: "The Lord shall
   bring a nation against them from far . . . with the hoofs of his horses
   shall they tread down all thy streets; they shall slay thy people by
   the sword." [369]

   So all that the Lord said has been fulfilled in us, and our punishment
   has vindicated the force of his divine words.

   8. Since the majority of barbarian nations have drunk Roman blood and
   torn our flesh, we may ask why it is especially into the power of those
   once considered the most cowardly of the enemy that the Lord has
   delivered the greatest resources of the state and the wealthiest people
   who bear the Roman name. Why else indeed, except to make us recognize,
   as I said before, that the outcome depended on merit, not on strength,
   and that this should serve to confound and punish us, that we were
   given into the power of the weakest, and must recognize the correction
   of God's hand in the fact that not the bravest but the most despised of
   our enemies overcame us. For we read that whenever God has willed that
   men should clearly see his great works, the action has been performed
   through the medium of a few men, of men of the lowest sort, so that his
   divine handwork might not be ascribed to human power.

   Thus indeed Sisera, the captain before whom the Hebrew army trembled,
   was laid low by a woman; [370] a woman's hand struck down Abimelech,
   the stormer of cities, [371] and the ironclad hosts of the Assyrians
   were routed by the help of a widow. Not to speak of women only, did not
   the Lord wish Benedad, king of Syria, whom thirty-two kings and armies
   of like proportions served, as well as countless thousands of his own
   people, to be conquered by a few serving-men, so that God himself might
   be recognized as the author of so great a victory? [372] Against the
   Midianites also, who, as the Book of Judges relates, had filled all the
   land like locusts, Gideon was ordered to fight with a few men, not
   because he had not more in his army, but he was forbidden to lead many
   men to battle for fear that a multitude might claim some share in the
   victory as their own. When Gideon had gathered together thirty thousand
   armed men, the Lord spoke thus to him: "The people that are with thee
   are too many for me to give Midian into their hands." [373] What
   followed? He left Gideon, to fight against countless thousands of
   barbarians, only three hundred men. Indeed, he commanded the force of
   soldiers to be reduced to such a scanty number in order that their lack
   of men might prevent any claim of credit for a victory divinely won.
   Why he did this, the Lord himself declared most plainly: "Lest Israel
   vaunt themselves against me, saying: Mine own hand hath saved me.'"

   Let all the wicked hearken, I say, let all the presumptuous hearken,
   and all who excel in power; let all men hear what the Lord says: "Lest
   Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved
   me.'"

   9. Let all men hear, I repeat, who utter blasphemies against the Lord,
   let all hear who put their trust in man. God declares that all men
   speak against him who presume to think that they can be freed by their
   own might. Who is there among the Romans who does not hold this
   opinion? Who is there in our number who does not blaspheme in this
   respect almost constantly? It is common knowledge that the state has no
   longer any strength, yet not even now do we acknowledge to whose favor
   we owe it that we still live. Whenever God gives us a degree of
   prosperity beyond our hopes and deserts, one man ascribes it to fate,
   another to chance, another to the strategy of our leaders, another to
   their foresight, another to the administration, another to his patron,
   but none to God.

   Yet we wonder that his divine hand fails to give us some things for
   which we wish, though we deny him credit for what he has given in the
   past. What else are we doing, when we ascribe the good things he gives
   us to the blind workings of chance, the ability of our leaders, or any
   other minor agencies? Following such arguments we ought to thank the
   earth for our yearly harvests, the vineyards for the vintage, the sea
   for hauls of fish, the forests for the wood we cut, the sheep for our
   clothing, and other beasts for the meat with which we are filled. What
   sense is there in our willingness to be grateful to God for his other
   gifts when we deny him gratitude for his greatest benefits? What man of
   our condition would be satisfied to have another thank him for some
   minor favor if he had denied him credit for his greatest gifts? So
   though we cannot thank God worthily, we shall fall far short of what is
   due him if we are grateful to him only for the means of daily life, and
   withhold from him our gratitude for helping us in time of trouble,
   freeing us in the midst of dangers and preserving us by his constant
   protection when we are placed in the midst of barbarous nations.

   Not so do the Goths or the Vandals regard him, being better in this
   respect than ourselves, though trained by heretical teachers. However,
   I have grounds to suspect that certain men are offended by what I say.
   Since the truth must outweigh the fear of giving offence I shall say it
   nevertheless, and say it repeatedly: not so do the Goths or the Vandals
   act, for when they are in danger they beg help of God and they call
   their prosperity the gift of his divine love. In fact our misfortune in
   the last war furnished proof of this difference between us. For the
   Goths through fear put their hope in God, and we through presumption
   put ours in the Huns. The Goths sought peace and we denied it; they
   sent bishops to make terms and we rejected them; they honored God even
   in the person of alien priests and we despised him in our own. Was not
   the outcome of these events consonant with the actions of each side? To
   them in the depths of fear was given the palm of victory; to us in the
   height of confidence was given confusion, so that the words of our Lord
   were clearly exemplified in us and in them: "For whosoever exalteth
   himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be
   exalted." [374] To them was given exaltation for their humility and to
   us humiliation for our pride.

   10. This the general of our forces learned when he entered as a captive
   the same city of the enemy that he had boasted he would enter that same
   day as victor. [375] He proved indeed the words of the prophet: "For a
   man's way is not his own, nor is it in his own power to walk and direct
   his steps." [376] Since he thought his actions were under his own
   control, he could neither direct his steps nor find the way of safety.
   So we read: "He poureth contempt upon the prince and causeth him to
   wander in the wilderness where there is no way. . . . He has been
   brought to nothing, even as the waters which run continually." [377] In
   him, indeed, in addition to his actual misfortune, the present judgment
   of God was clearly shown. He has endured all the sufferings that he had
   boasted he would inflict on others. Because he trusted that the enemy
   could be taken without God's aid and consent, he has himself been
   captured; he claimed foreknowledge and wisdom and has met with disgrace
   for his presumption; he himself has worn the chains he prepared for
   others.

   What clearer proof, I ask, could there have been of the judgment of
   God, than that the general who boasted of plundering should be counted
   as booty; that he who counted his triumph already won should be led in
   another's triumph--be surrounded, seized, and bound, his arms twisted
   behind his back; that he should see those hands tied whose prowess he
   vaunted; that he should become a spectacle for women and children, see
   barbarians making sport of him, endure the derision of both sexes, and
   though he had the greatest pride in his bravery, meet a coward's death?
   Would that this might have been a speedy cure for his wrongdoing,
   without longer suffering! But, as befits the greatness of his
   punishment, wasted by the days of his captivity and by the prolonged
   anguish of a barbarian prison, [378] he was reduced to such misery that
   he roused the pity of the enemy, and this most men think harder and
   more bitter to bear than the imprisonment itself. Why did these things
   happen? Surely because, as I have already indicated, the enemy were
   humble before God, whereas we were rebellious; they believed the
   victory lay in his hand, we that it lay in our own--a sacrilegious and
   wicked conception that makes our sin so much the worse and more
   injurious to us. Lastly, we learn from an authentic report that the
   king of the enemy [379] himself lay on haircloth and prayed up to the
   very day of the conflict; when battle was imminent he lay in prayer,
   and rose only to fight. Before he assumed command in the battle he
   fought in prayer, and so went forth to the fight with confidence in a
   victory already earned by his prayers.

   11. Moreover, the experience of the Vandals was not dissimilar: when
   our people went against them in Spain and had as much confidence in a
   complete victory as they had recently against the Goths, the same
   overweening pride engulfed them in the same disastrous ruin. [380] Then
   the words of the prophet were fulfilled for our army: "The Lord shall
   reject thy confidence and thou shalt not prosper in it." [381]

   For we trusted in our own wisdom and strength against the command of
   the Lord, who said: "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither
   the mighty man in his might, but let him that glorieth glory in this,
   that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord." [382]

   So we have not been conquered undeservedly, for the enemy sought better
   aid than we did. While we prided ourselves on arms and auxiliaries, on
   the side of the enemy the Book of the Divine Law opposed us. To its
   help most of all the fear and terror of the Vandals then resorted, to
   oppose to us the Divine Word and to open up to those who came against
   them in rivalry the writings of the Sacred Book which may be called the
   very voice of God. At this point I ask: who of our number ever did
   this, or who would not have been derided if he had thought it should be
   done? He would have been scorned indeed, as almost all religious acts
   are derided among us. Then what value can our claim to a religious
   title have for us, what use is it to say we are catholic, to boast that
   we possess the true faith, to despise the Goths and Vandals, reviling
   them as heretics, when we are living in a truly heretical depravity?
   The words of the Divine Scripture addressed to the Jews who trusted in
   the law are most fittingly applied to us: "How do you say, We are wise
   and the law of the Lord is with us?' . . . Trust ye not in lying words,
   saying, The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of
   the Lord, are these.' For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your
   doings; if ye oppress not the stranger and the fatherless and the widow
   and shed not innocent blood in this place, then will I cause you to
   dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers for ever
   and ever." [383] By this surely it is shown that if we do not amend our
   ways, it is useless for us to vaunt our claims to Catholicism.

   Enough of this has been said already, and more must perhaps be said
   later, though there seems little need to discuss the point further,
   since the judgment of God is constantly manifested. Recent history
   shows his verdict both upon us and upon the Goths and Vandals; they
   increase daily while we diminish; they gain in power while we are
   humbled; they flourish and we wither away. So the words of the Holy
   Scriptures concerning Saul and David may be truly spoken of us also:
   "David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker
   and weaker." [384] For the Lord is righteous, as the prophet says: "He
   is righteous and his judgments are upright." [385]

   12. We are judged by the ever-present judgment of God, and thus a most
   slothful race has been aroused to accomplish our destruction and shame.
   They go from place to place, from city to city, and destroy everything.
   First they poured out from their native land into Germany, which lay
   nearest them, a country called barbarous, but under Roman control.
   After its destruction, the country of the Belgae burst into flames,
   then the rich estates of the luxurious Aquitanians, and after these the
   whole body of the Gallic provinces. This ruin spread gradually,
   however, in order that while one part was being visited with
   destruction, another might be reformed by its example. [386] But when
   has there been any amendment among us, or what part of the Roman world,
   whatever its affliction, is corrected by it? As we read: "They are all
   gone out of the way, they are altogether become useless." [387] And in
   like manner the prophet cried out to the Lord, saying: "Thou hast
   stricken them but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but
   they have refused to receive correction; they have made their faces
   harder than a rock; they have refused to return." [388]

   How truly this applies to us the present situation shows. Gaul long
   endured devastation; did Spain, her near neighbor, mend her ways? Not
   undeservedly, since they showed no fear whatever, and no reform, the
   people of Spain began to catch fire from the flames by which the Gauls
   were consumed. [389] The worst and most evil aspect of all this is, as
   I have said before, that the fires which, to speak figuratively,
   consumed the bodies of these sinful men, did not burn away their vices.

   Thus God has been compelled by our crimes to scatter the enemy's forces
   as a scourge for our sins, from place to place, from city to city, and
   to send nations aroused almost from the very ends of the earth even
   across the sea, to punish the crimes of our people in Africa. Why was
   this? Having been led forth from their own country, could the Vandals
   not have remained within the Gallic states? Could fear have prevented
   these tribes from abiding there, who had already devastated all the
   land without injury from us? But suppose they had cause for alarm in
   Gaul, why should they have feared to settle and stay in Spain, where
   they had completely crushed our armies in battle, where they were
   already triumphantly victorious, having reached such a height of valor
   as to learn that after trial in a war long anticipated, the strength of
   the Roman state, even with barbarian reinforcements, could not equal
   theirs?

   13. They could have stayed there, then, and were not afraid, but surely
   the heavenly hand that had dragged them thither to punish the vices of
   the Spanish compelled them also to cross the straits to devastate
   Africa. In fact, they themselves confessed that they did not act of
   their own volition, for they were driven and urged on by a divine
   command. From this we may learn how great are our misdoings, since to
   destroy and punish us the barbarians are compelled to move against
   their will, following the words of the devastator of the land of
   Israel, the king of the Assyrians, when he said: "And now without the
   will of the Lord am I come up against this land? The Lord said unto me,
   Go up against this land, to destroy it.'" [390] And elsewhere the
   Sacred Word says: "Therefore thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of
   Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nabuchodonosor [391] the king of
   Babylon, my servant, and when he cometh, he shall smite the land of
   Egypt.'" [392]

   From this we may know that all things which are afflicted are indeed
   smitten by the judgment of God; their overthrow, however, as I have
   often remarked, is due to sin. So whatever is done on account of sin is
   not to be ascribed to God, since a deed is rightly ascribed to that
   cause which has made it unavoidable. For example, a murderer sentenced
   to death by the judge is actually punished by his own crime; a thief or
   a man who has committed sacrilege is consumed not by the flames that
   burn his body, but by his own sin. Whence we see that the Vandals did
   not cross to Africa because of God's severity but because of the sins
   of the Romans in that country. By their grave and long continued
   iniquity these people were forcing the Vandals to come before they
   actually left their native land. Therefore we must understand that only
   God's mercy postponed the punishment so long due, and their misdeeds
   and crimes at length brought upon these sinful people the chastisement
   they deserved. Or are we to believe that they did not deserve their
   fate? Have any people better deserved ruin than these, in whom all
   sorts of shameful and indecent lust have flourished at once? For the
   rest of the world, though bound by some disgraceful vices, has some
   virtue still remaining: men who are subject to drunkenness are free
   from malevolence; those who live in a fever of lust do not suffer from
   raging greed; finally, many who are accused of physical incontinence
   are commended by the simplicity of their minds. But among the people of
   Africa, with few exceptions, you will find none with an equal measure
   of good and evil, for almost the whole population is evil. So the
   purity of their original nature has been shut out and their vices have,
   as it were, created a new character among them.

   14. Indeed, aside from a very few servants of God, what was the whole
   territory of Africa but one house of vice, like that bronze vessel of
   which the prophet said: "Woe to the bloody city! to the bronze vessel
   whose scum is therein, and whose scum hath not gone out from it,
   because the blood shall not go out from it!" [393] He compared the
   city, as we see, to a bronze vessel and its iniquity to blood, that we
   might know that the iniquity of the people in a city is like blood
   seething in a brazen pot. And again, not unlike this is another saying
   of the Sacred Word: "The houses of Israel have all been made a mixture
   before me of brass and iron and tin and lead, in the midst is silver
   mixed with the mass. Therefore say this; thus saith the Lord God:
   Inasmuch as ye are all made one mass I shall blow upon you and melt you
   in the fires of my wrath.'" [394]

   How are the very dissimilar metals that the Scriptures have named
   melted together in one furnace? Surely in the diversity of metals the
   unlike qualities of men are figured. Thus even silver, that is, metal
   of the nobler sort, is cast in the same fires as the rest because men
   have debased the gifts of their nobler natures by their degenerate
   lives. Even so we read that the Lord spoke also of the king of Tyre
   through his prophet: "Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king
   of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God: thou hast been the
   seal of likeness, and a crown of beauty in the delights of paradise;
   every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius and topaz and
   emerald.'" [395] Again he says: "With silver and with gold hast thou
   filled thy treasuries, from the multitude of commerce hast thou filled
   thy storehouses." [396] Do not all these things seem to have been said
   expressly of the people of Africa? Where are greater treasuries, where
   is greater commerce, where are fuller storehouses? "With gold," he
   says, "hast thou filled thy treasuries from the multitude of thy
   commerce." I add more: Africa was once so rich that the abundance of
   her commerce seems to have filled not only her own treasuries but those
   of the whole world as well.

   What did the prophet say next? "Thine heart was lifted up because of
   thy beauty, because of the multitude of thine iniquities have I cast
   thee to the ground." [397] How does this apply to the power of Africa,
   and how does that land seem to have been laid prostrate on the ground?
   How except that when she lost the height of her former power, she also
   lost her almost celestial honor? "And I shall bring forth," said the
   prophet, "a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee." [398]
   What could be truer than this? The fire of sin went forth from the
   midst of their iniquity, and devoured the happiness of former times.
   "And all they that know thee among the people shall be sore afflicted
   over thee." [399] We might think that this phrase did not apply to
   them, were it not that the destruction of Africa is the sorrow of the
   human race. "Thou art become destruction," said the prophet, "and never
   shalt thou be any more." [400] It is only too well known that
   everything in that province has been completely destroyed; all that we
   can do is to prevent those evils which are now being punished from
   being continued forever.

   15. May God in his merciful kindness not permit this! Indeed, as far us
   the deserts of our crimes are concerned, there is no reason why he
   should not. What misdeeds are not constantly committed there? I shall
   not speak of them all, for their enormity is such that they cannot be
   known or discussed. I shall talk chiefly of the obscene nature of their
   indecencies, and, which is more serious still, of their acts of
   sacrilege. I pass over their insane greed, a vice shared by the whole
   human race; I pass over their inhuman avarice, an evil characteristic
   of most of the Romans; let their drunkenness be left unmentioned, since
   it is common to noble and base alike; let swelling pride be omitted,
   for this is so particularly the province of the rich, that they would
   perhaps think they were losing something of their just due if anyone
   else wished to claim any share in it. Finally, let almost all the
   wickedness involving frauds, forgeries and perjuries be passed over,
   for no Roman city was ever free from these evils. Yet this crime was
   the especial prerogative of all the people of Africa. For just as the
   filth of a boat is washed down into the bilge water in its depths, so
   vices seem to have flowed into their habits from the whole world. I
   know of no wickedness that did not abound there, whereas even pagan and
   barbarous nations, though they have evil ways especially characteristic
   of their own races, still do not merit reproach in all things. The race
   of the Goths is treacherous but chaste, the Alans unchaste but not
   treacherous; the Franks are deceitful but hospitable, the Saxons savage
   in their cruelty but admirable for their chastity; to conclude, all
   races have their own peculiar vices accompanied by their own good
   qualities. But among the people of Africa practically without exception
   there is nothing but evil. If inhumanity is the subject of our
   accusation they are inhuman; if drunkenness, they are drunken; if
   falsehood, they are most false; if deceit,, they are unexcelled in
   deceitfulness; if greed, they are surpassingly greedy; if perfidy,
   theirs is unequalled. Their impurity and blasphemy must not be confused
   with these other sins, since in the evils of which I have spoken above
   they have surpassed the vices of other nations, but in these they have
   outdone their own.

   16. To speak first of their impurity--who does not know that all Africa
   has always flamed with the torches of obscenity, so that you would
   think it not a land and abiding place of men, but an Aetna of unclean
   fires? As Aetna has always seethed with certain inner flames of heat
   implanted in it by nature, so also has Africa with the abominable fires
   of fornication. I do not wish you to believe my words alone in this
   matter, but to seek the corroboration of the whole human race. Who can
   fail to recognize that all the people of Africa are unchaste unless
   they happen to have been converted to God, and changed by their
   religious faith? This however is as rare and strange as to see a Gaius
   who is not a Gaius or a Seius who is not a Seius. [401] It is as
   unusual and rare for an African not to be unchaste as for him not to be
   an African.

   So general is the vice of impurity among them that whoever ceases to be
   indecent seems to be no longer an African. I shall not discuss the
   individual cities nor mention all the different localities, for fear of
   seeming to search out examples too curiously. I shall content myself
   with one city instead, the chief of all the cities of that land, and in
   a way the mother of them all, the eternal rival of Rome's citadel, of
   old in arms and courage, afterwards in splendor and dignity. It is
   Carthage of which I speak, the greatest rival of the city of Rome, and
   a sort of Rome in the African world; she alone suffices as an example
   and witness of my words, since she has contained within herself all the
   resources and governance of statecraft in the world.

   There you would find all the appurtenances of the public offices,
   schools of the liberal arts, the studies of the philosophers, training
   schools in languages and ethics; there also were military forces and
   the powers that control the army, there was the office of the
   proconsul, there the daily judge and ruler of the province--in name,
   indeed, proconsul, but in power a very consul; there lastly were the
   administrators of the state properties, their honors differing from one
   another in rank and name--procurators, as I may call them, of the
   public streets and crossroads--governing all the wards of the city and
   all sections of the people. With this one city we may well be content
   as an example of the others, and as evidence of their condition, so
   that having seen the character of the city where the officials have
   always been of the highest grade, we may infer what those towns were
   like that had the supervision of less honored men.

   At this point I almost repent of my promise made above, to omit almost
   all the vices of the people of this province and to speak chiefly of
   their obscenities and blasphemies. For I see the city overflowing with
   vice, boiling over with every sort of iniquity--full indeed of people,
   but even fuller of dishonor, full of riches but fuller still of vice;
   men striving to outdo one another in depravity and lust, some vying
   with their mates in rapacity, others in indecency. Some are languid
   with wine, others distended with feasting, some garlanded with flowers,
   others smeared with unguents, all wasted by various forms of
   dissipation, but sunk in the same mortal error. Not all, indeed, were
   intoxicated with winebibbing, but all were drunk with their sins.

   You would judge such a people lacking in sanity, not in full possession
   of their senses, steady neither in mind nor in gait, attacking each
   other in a mob like drunken men. Now we must consider also another
   charge of a serious kind, unlike this in its nature but not unlike it
   in gravity, unless its greatness sets it in a different class. I mean
   the proscriptions of orphans, the afflictions of widows and the
   crucifixion of the poor. All these made their moan daily to God, and
   prayed for an end of their sufferings. Nay, what is worse, they were
   sometimes driven by their bitter woes even to pray for the arrival of
   the enemy. These have now at last obtained from God the privilege of
   enduring with the rest such ruin from the barbarians as they formerly
   suffered alone from the Romans!

   17. But let us pass over these matters, for they may be paralleled in
   practically every part of the Roman world, and I promised to mention
   them only briefly. As to the unchastity and impurity which I have been
   discussing, would these not have been sufficient of themselves to
   destroy Africa? What part of the state was not full of indecency, what
   street or bypath was not a place of shame? Lust had so cut off most of
   the crossroads and streets with its snares, and entangled them with its
   nets, that even those who utterly abhorred such vices could scarcely
   avoid them. You might compare them to brigands lurking in ambush and
   snatching their spoils from passers-by; they so hedged in the paths,
   the winding roads and byways with their close-set traps, that scarcely
   anyone could be cautious enough not to fall into some of their
   treacherous snares, however many he escaped. All the citizens reeked,
   if I may use the expression, with the stench of lust, all inhaled the
   fetid odors of their mutual impurity. Yet this horrid condition
   inspired no loathing in them, for the same plague had infected them
   all. You would think the city a sinkpot of lust and fornication, like
   the muck collected from the offscourings of all the streets and sewers.
   What hope could there be in such a place, where, except for the temple
   of the Lord, there was nothing to be seen but filth?

   Yet why should I except the temple of God? The church was, to be sure,
   completely under the care of the priests and clergy, whom I prefer not
   to discuss. I am bound by reverence for my Lord's ministry, and think
   that those men who served at the altars alone preserved their purity,
   as we read that Lot stood alone on the mountain when the people of
   Sodom perished. As for the people, however, who among such countless
   numbers was chaste? Chaste, did I say? Who was not guilty of
   fornication, or adultery, and that too without ceasing? Therefore must
   I cry out again--what hope could there be in that people? One adulterer
   sometimes pollutes a whole church congregation, but there you could
   scarcely find one chaste man among thousands, if you searched most
   diligently, even in the church.

   I have much more than this to say. Would that what I have said included
   the whole accusation, and that these men in their indecency had been
   content to satisfy their lust with fornication of fallen women only!
   Their fault was still more serious and wicked than this, for nearly all
   the vices of which the blessed apostle Paul complained so bitterly
   existed in Africa. "The men leaving the natural use of women burned in
   their lust toward one another; men with men working that which is
   unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error
   which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their
   knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things
   which are not convenient." [402] Was it not of barbarous and savage
   races that the blessed apostle spoke? Nay verily, but of us, that is,
   expressly of the Romans, whom indeed the people of Africa, since they
   were not able of old to overcome them in power and might, have now
   outdone in the only way left to them, to wit, in lust. Whoever thinks
   he has a right to be angry at my words should rather be incensed at the
   apostle, for what I have said of the character of the inhabitants of
   Africa, he once said of their masters, the Romans.

   18. Perhaps the vices of which I spoke were hidden, or the men in
   charge of the public morals in different places took care that the
   diffusion of such crimes should not sully the eyes of the people. If
   this had been done, however many had been defiled by the actions
   themselves, all would not have been injured by the sight and thought of
   them. However disgraceful a vice is, it does not as a rule deserve full
   credence when it is committed secretly. But to commit the greatest sins
   and feel no shame for what one has done, demands censure passing that
   of the sins themselves. What more prodigious wrong could have been
   performed there? In a Christian city, in a church which the apostles
   founded by their teachings, [403] which martyrs had crowned by their
   passion, men took upon themselves the functions of women, without any
   shame to cloak their action, without the shield of modesty; as if their
   sin would be too slight if only the authors of these evils were stained
   by them, through the public knowledge of their vice it became the
   wrong-doing of the whole city. The entire city saw this and suffered
   it, the judges saw and condoned it, the people saw and applauded, and
   thus when fellowship in disgraceful lust was spread through the city,
   the general consent made it common to all. But, you say, perhaps there
   was at length an end to the evil and some emendation of the wrong. Who
   could believe or even hear calmly that men converted to a feminine
   passivity not only their natural functions but even their looks, their
   step, their clothing and everything characteristic of the male sex and
   appearance? So completely was nature reversed in them that although
   nothing should be more shameful to men than to seem to have any
   feminine characteristics, [404] [405] nothing seemed to certain of
   these men more disgraceful than to seem in any respect masculine.

   19. You may argue that this disgrace was that of a few men only, and
   what was not perpetrated by the majority could not injure all. Indeed,
   I have said before that very often among the people of God the crime
   even of one man has been the ruin of many, as the people were betrayed
   by the theft of Achar, a pestilence arose from the jealousy of Saul,
   and a plague came from the numbering of the people by the blessed
   David. For the church of God is like an eye. If even a little mote fall
   into the eye, it blinds the whole sight; so, if even a few men in the
   body of the church act indecently, it darkens the whole light of the
   church. Therefore the Savior called the chief part of the church its
   eye, saying: "The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye
   be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be
   evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness," [406] Whence the
   apostle asked: "Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole
   lump?" [407] I should not say, however, that there was in Africa a
   little of this evil, but overmuch, not that most of the people there
   were effeminate, but that the effeminacy of the few was the corruption
   of the many. Even if there are few who live disgracefully there are
   many who are stained by the filth of the few. As one harlot makes many
   commit fornication, so the abominable unions of the effeminate few
   infect the vast majority of the people.

   Nor do I know which of them are worse in the sight of God, since in the
   Sacred Scriptures they are condemned by one and the same decree.
   "Neither effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, shall
   inherit the kingdom of God," [408] said the apostle. This makes it the
   more lamentable and deplorable that such a sin should appear to be the
   wrongdoing of the whole city, and that the honor of the Roman name
   should be branded with the infamy of prodigious wickedness. Men took
   the garb of women and made their steps more mincing than women do; they
   wrought for themselves the tokens of a monstrous impurity and swathed
   their heads with the wrappings of feminine veils. And this they did
   publicly in a Roman city, the greatest and most famous city in that
   region! Was this not a disgrace to the Roman power, which permitted a
   most execrable wrong to be openly committed in the very bosom of the
   commonwealth? A great and strong power, capable of preventing the
   greatest crime, must approve the actions which with full knowledge it
   suffers to be committed, for he who has prohibitory power sanctions any
   action that he does not prevent.

   20. Once again, impelled by my grief, I ask those who are angry at my
   words in what barbarian nations such things have at any time been done
   or permitted with general impunity? Finally, to save the necessity of
   longer discussion or investigation of this point, let us compare the
   actual devastators of Africa with the people whom they conquered. What
   actions of this sort have been performed by the Vandals? Surely
   barbarians, swollen with pride, puffed up with victory, rendered lax by
   the abundance of riches and luxuries, would have been changed by their
   unusual good fortune and prosperity, however chaste and continent they
   had always been before. They had, as it is written in the Scriptures,
   entered "a land flowing with milk and honey," [409] a fertile land, so
   rich in all delicacies as to be almost intoxicating in its plenty.
   Under these conditions it would be no cause for surprise that a
   barbarous tribe should wax wanton where nature herself seems
   unrestrained. Who would doubt that the Vandals, upon entering such a
   country, would plunge into all manner of filthy and unclean vice? Or,
   to speak more moderately, that they would at least copy the constant
   behavior of the people of Africa, into whose province they had come?
   Indeed, if that were all they did, they would deserve to be judged most
   continent and moderate, whom good fortune had not rendered more
   corrupt. For how often do you find a wise man whom prosperity does not
   change, whose faults do not increase with his fortunes? It is certain
   that the Vandals were most temperate, if they, the victors, merely
   resembled their captive subjects. In such great abundance of wealth and
   luxury, however, not one of them was rendered effeminate. Does that
   seem a small matter? Certainly the Romans of noble birth made
   effeminacy a regular practice. What more have I to add? Not one of the
   Vandals was polluted by the incest of the effeminate Romans about him.
   Certainly, effeminacy had long been considered by the Romans as a
   virtue rather than a vice, and those men thought themselves models of
   manly strength who had put others to the basest uses. For this reason
   the attendant boys, who once followed the soldiers, were given as a
   reward for services well performed on campaign, the privilege of being
   shamefully used as women, since they had proved themselves brave men.
   What a crime was this! Such were the actions of Romans, and Romans not
   of the present time; nevertheless--not to accuse the men of old--they
   were not the ancient Romans, but those who had already become corrupt
   and dissolute, no longer living up to their former reputation, but
   resembling Greeks more than Romans. Hence, as I have often said before,
   it should cause no surprise that the Roman state is at length suffering
   what it has long deserved.

   21. This vice began among the Romans before Christ's Gospel, but that
   it did not cease after the Gospel was preached among them is still more
   grievous. After recalling this fact, who can help admiring the Vandals?
   They entered the wealthiest cities, where such vices were common, and
   took over the riches of dissolute men in such a way that they rejected
   their corrupting customs and now possess and use those things that are
   good, and avoid the degrading influence of those that are evil. [410]
   This ought to be enough in their praise even if I add nothing more; for
   they have abominated the illicit acts of men. Still more noteworthy is
   it that they have also abstained from the corruption of women; they
   have shrunk from evil haunts and brothels, they have avoided illicit
   unions and the company of harlots. Can it be credible that the Romans
   permitted these things and barbarians abhorred them? Is there anything
   more to be said after this? There is indeed, and much more. That they
   have avoided foul actions is the lesser part; for a man can abhor
   disgraceful deeds without abolishing them. Their great and singular
   merit is that not only do they themselves avoid pollution by this
   stain, but they take care that others shall not be polluted. Indeed, a
   man is in some sort a guardian of human welfare who not only endeavors
   to be good himself, but also strives to bring it about that others may
   cease to be evil.

   What I have said is a great point, surely, great and of preeminent
   importance. Who could believe that the Vandals in the Roman cities
   committed such sins? Sexual vice has been completely abolished by them.
   How was it removed? Not as some crimes are wont to be prohibited by the
   Romans, who decree that there shall be no theft, and go on thieving;
   who decree that there shall be no adultery, and are first to commit it.
   Yet I should scarcely say that they commit theft, for theirs is no mere
   theft but highway robbery. A judge punishes a petty theft in another
   though he is himself a robber: he punishes rapine, though he is himself
   guilty of the same crime; he punishes the cutthroat, though he himself
   wields a sword; he punishes those who break down bars and doors, though
   he himself destroys cities; he punishes those who burglarize houses,
   though he himself robs the provinces. Would that this were true only of
   those who are set in positions of power and to whom the very honor
   conferred on them gives some right to carry on their robberies; it is
   worse and more intolerable that even private citizens do the same, that
   is, men who have previously held high office. The honor once given them
   affords them this much advantage, that they may keep forever the legal
   right to plunder. So even when they have ceased to wield public
   administrative power, they do not cease to enjoy the private right of
   plundering. Thus the power they had as judges is slighter than that
   they have as private citizens, for in the former case successors were
   sure to be appointed for them, but now they have no successors.

   See then how much legal decrees are worth, what profit we gain from the
   passage of ordinances which those men most scorn who administer them!
   The humble and lowly are forced to obey, the poor are compelled to
   accede to the orders of their superiors, and if they fail in their
   obedience, they are punished. The same rule is observed in this case as
   in that of the taxes: the poor are the only ones to obey the public
   decrees, as they alone pay the taxes. Thus in the laws themselves and
   in the execution of justice, injustice is most criminally wrought,
   since the lesser men are compelled to observe as sacred the laws that
   their betters continually trample under foot as of no importance.

   22. Indignation has led me to exceed somewhat the appointed order of my
   discourse; let me now return to the original topic. I said that the
   cities of Africa were full of monstrous vices, and especially the queen
   and mistress of them all, but that the Vandals were not polluted. How
   unlike the Romans: did these barbarians prove themselves, in cleansing
   the stains of our disgrace! For they have removed from every part of
   Africa the vice of effeminacy, they have even abhorred intercourse with
   harlots, and have not only shunned or done away with it for the time
   being, but have made it absolutely cease to exist. O kindly Master, O
   good Savior! How much the desire of discipline accomplishes with your
   help, through which the vices of nature can be changed, as they have
   been by the Vandals! Let us see how they have been changed, since it is
   important to show not only the results of this action, but also the
   method by which it was made effective. It is difficult to have lewdness
   removed by a word or order, unless it has been done away in fact, and
   to have decency required by a command unless it has been enjoined
   before. Knowing this to be true, they removed unchastity while
   preserving the unchaste; they did not kill the unfortunate women, lest
   they should stain their prevention of vice with cruelty, and sin
   themselves in the very act of destroying the sins they desired to
   abolish. But they corrected the erring in such a way that the change
   should be a medicine, not a penalty. They ordered and compelled all
   prostitutes to marry; they transformed harlots into wives, fulfilling
   the word and command of the apostle that every woman should have her
   husband and every man his wife, [411] that since incontinence cannot be
   restrained without some permissible indulgence of the flesh, sexual
   desire might have this legitimate outlet without sinful lust. In this,
   indeed, provision was made not only that women who could not live
   without husbands should have them, but also that through their domestic
   guardians those who did not know how to protect themselves should be
   safe. While the marriage bond constantly bound them, even if the
   customary unchastity of their former lives enticed them to sin, their
   husbands' guardianship should keep them from going astray. The Vandals
   also added severe requirements of chastity to prevent lust, coercing
   lewdness by the sword with the obvious purpose of preserving the
   chastity of both sexes by conjugal affection at home, and the fear of
   the laws in public. Thus purity should rest on a double basis of love
   at home and fear abroad. Moreover, the laws they possessed were not at
   all like those enactments that removed a part of the wickedness without
   preventing all of its obscenity, or like those Roman decrees that cut
   off adulterers from other men's wives but left them free access to
   single women, forbidding adultery while encouraging houses of ill fame.
   [412] Those seem to have feared that men would be too chaste and pure
   if sexual vice were entirely forbidden. Not such are those of whom we
   speak, who have forbidden loose living as well as adultery, who wish
   women to be women only to their husbands and men to exercise their male
   functions only with their wives; who do not permit sexual desires to
   stray beyond the marriage bed, but order their laws after the pattern
   of the divine law, so that they think nothing permissible to them in
   this matter that God did not wish to permit. So they did not think any
   man should be given license by them to do anything that is not
   permitted to all by the divine power.

   23. I know that what I say may seem to some intolerable, but I must
   treat these matters, in the light of reason, not of personal
   prejudices. [413] Let anyone who is angry at what I say tell me this,
   has not Socrates always been considered the wisest of all men, and that
   too on the testimony of the Delphic demon, who might be called the
   prince of philosophers, as he was the prince of demons? Let us then
   consider what laws Socrates decreed as to chastity and what those men
   of whom we have been speaking have ordained about it.

   Socrates said: "Let no man have a wife of his own, for marriage should
   be common to all; for so there will be greater harmony among the
   states, if all men have intercourse indiscriminately with all women,
   and all women with all men, and if all men become husbands of all
   women, and all women wives of all men." [414] Have we ever known any
   madman, or any possessed or driven out of his senses by any sort of
   insanity, say such a thing as this? You say, O chief of philosophers,
   that by the terms of this ordinance all men will be the husbands of all
   women, and all women the wives of all men, and all their children the
   offspring of all parents. But I maintain that no man would then be any
   woman's husband, no woman the wife of any man, and no child the
   offspring of any parents, for where all is promiscuous and confused, no
   one can claim anything as his own. And some men say that it was not
   sufficient for the wisest of philosophers to teach others such ideas,
   but he must needs carry them out for himself, handing his wife over to
   another man, as indeed the Roman Cato, that second Socrates of Italian
   birth, actually did. [415] See then the examples given us by the Roman
   and Attic wisdom; as far as in them lay, they made all husbands panders
   of their wives. Yet Socrates outdid the rest, for he wrote books on the
   subject, and handed his shameful ideas down to posterity. [416] So he
   had the more reason to glory in his teachings; as far as his principles
   were concerned, he made a brothel of the world. He is said to have been
   unjustly condemned by the judges. That is true, for it would have been
   better for the whole human race to condemn a man for preaching such
   doctrines. Without doubt it has condemned him. Since, indeed, as far as
   this theory goes all have repudiated his doctrines, all have condemned
   him not only by the authority of the sentence passed at his trial, but
   even more by their choice of a way of life, and rightly too.

   Let us now compare with his statutes those of the men whom God has
   recently ordered to rule in Africa. Socrates decreed that no one should
   have a wife of his own, they that no one should have one not his own.
   He wished every woman to be subject to all men, they that no woman
   should know any man but her husband. He wished a mixed and promiscuous
   generation, they one purely born and regulated. He ordained that all
   houses should be of evil reputation, and they that there should be none
   such. He tried to build evil resorts in every dwelling, they removed
   them even from entire cities. He wished to prostitute all maidens, they
   made the prostitutes chaste.

   Would that Socrates' error had been his alone, and not that of many, or
   even the majority of Romans! These follow Socrates' precepts in this
   matter even if they accept his teachings in nothing else, for many men
   have more than one wife apiece, and countless women have many husbands
   each. Are not all our cities full of dens of vice, and reeking with
   houses of ill fame? When I said all, I meant of course the noblest and
   loftiest, for such is the prerogative of dignity and honor in our great
   cities that they excel others as much in indecency as they do in size.

   What hope, I ask you, can there be for the Roman state when barbarians
   are more chaste and pure than the Romans? What I say is all too little:
   what hope of life or pardon, I ask, can we have in the sight of God
   when we see chastity in the barbarians and even so are not willing to
   be chaste ourselves? Should we not feel shame and confusion at this?
   Already among the Goths you will find none impure except the Romans,
   none unchaste among the Vandals except the Romans. So much has the
   desire for chastity accomplished for the barbarians, so much has the
   severity of their moral code gained, that not only are they themselves
   chaste, but--though it is so new and strange an event as to be almost
   incredible--they have even made some Romans chaste.

   If my human frailty permitted, I should wish to shout beyond my
   strength, to make my voice ring through the whole world: Be ashamed, ye
   Roman people everywhere, be ashamed of the lives you lead. No cities
   are free of evil haunts, no cities anywhere are free from indecency,
   except those in which barbarians have begun to live. Do we then wonder
   that we are wretched who are so impure, that we are conquered by the
   enemy who are outdone by them in honor, that they possess our
   properties who abjure our wickedness? It is neither the natural
   strength of their bodies that makes them conquer nor the weakness of
   our nature that makes us subject to defeat. Let no one think or
   persuade himself otherwise--it is our vicious lives alone that have
   conquered us. [417]

   [359] Since this promise is not carried out, we have here a clear
   indication that Salvian's book either was not finished, or has since
   been mutilated. The manner of his projected proof of the point raised
   may be surmised from his description in Book I. 10 of the virtues of
   the early Romans.

   [360] One of the best known of ancient proverbial expressions; cf.
   Isidore, Etymologiae XIV. 6. 40: "the herb recalled by many writers and
   poets, which, contracts men's jaws and kills them while they seem to
   laugh."

   [361] Luke 6. 25.

   [362] The inhabitants of Novem Populana, the southwestern province of
   Gaul, between Aquitania and Spain.

   [363] Matthew 11. 28-30.

   [364] See Paulinus of Nola Ep. 33. 3. The passage was identified by C.
   Weyman, "Salvianus und Paulinus von Nola," Historisches Jahrbuch XV
   (1894), 372-373. This is the only case in which Salvian gives a clue to
   the personal identity of the rare exceptions he makes to the general
   vice of prominent men; he could scarcely have chosen a more appropriate
   one.

   [365] Jeremiah 5. 8.

   [366] The chastity of the Germans had long been a Roman tradition; cf.
   Tacitus Germania 19.

   [367] It was not until Gaiseric's capture and sack of Carthage and
   later of Rome that the Vandals took on in the eyes of the Romans the
   character that has since made their name proverbial.

   [373] Judges 7. 2.

   [374] Luke 14. 11.

   [375] Litorius had been put in command in Gaul by Aetius. Made
   overconfident by his success at Narbonne, he undertook in A.D. 439 to
   besiege Toulouse, then the Gothic capital, with the aid of Hunnish
   auxiliaries, but was defeated and captured.

   [376] See Proverbs 16. 9; 20. 24.

   [377] Psalms 107. 40; 58. 7.

   [378] Idatius (Chronicon A.D. 439) gives a different version: "He
   himself was wounded and captured, and after a few days was put to
   death." His notorious paganism and dependence on soothsayers made
   Litorius a particularly apt contrast to the piety of the barbarian
   king.

   [379] Theodoric I, king of the Visigoths.

   [380] In A.D. 432 when Boniface and Castinus were conducting the war in
   Spain against the Vandals with an army largely Gothic, the jealousy of
   the two leaders led to a disastrous defeat of the Romans in battle,
   when the Vandals had been almost at the point of surrender due to
   famine. The defeat ended the Roman rule in Spain.

   [386] The Germany of this account was, of course, the Roman military
   district along the Rhine. The pauses in the course of the invasion are
   naturally explained by the custom of the Germanic tribes of "following
   up with the plow their conquests by the sword."

   [388] Jeremiah 5. 3.

   [389] Orosius' account of the Vandal conquest of Spain furnishes a
   parallel for Salvian's estimate of the barbarians (Historia adv.
   paganos VII. 40. 10): "After grave destruction of property and men, of
   which they themselves now repent, they drew lots and distributed the
   land and still live in possession of it."

   [390] Isaiah 36. 10.

   [391] That is, Nebuchadnezzar.

   [400] Ibid. 28. 19.

   [401] Gaius and Seius appear frequently as the John Doe and Richard Roe
   of Latin authors. Gaius is most commonly used, perhaps because of the
   Ubi tu Gaius, ego Gaia, of the marriage ceremony. In Cod. Just. Titius
   is used instead of Seius. Tertullian uses Gaius Seius and Lucius
   Titius; cf. Ad nationes I. 4.

   [402] Romans 1. 27-28.

   [403] Tertullian, himself a native of Africa, does not include Carthage
   in the list of apostolic churches (Liber de praescriptionibus 32), but
   in Salvian's time the orthodox church of Africa claimed an apostolic
   origin in their controversy with the Donatists, and it was natural that
   Salvian should accept their claim.

   [404] See Tertullian De idololatria 16: "Finally I find no type of
   clothing censured by God, save the feminine when worn by a man."

   [407] I Corinthians 5. 6.

   [408] Ibid. 6. 9-10.

   [409] Exodus 13. 5.

   [410] That Salvian spoke too soon is suggested by Procopius De Bello
   Vandalico II. 6. His description of the habits of the Vandals 'since
   the time when they gained possession of Libya" includes all the
   luxuries and vices that Salvian thinks they rejected.

   [411] I Corinthians 7. 2.

   [412] Note the phrasing in Cod. Theod. IX. 7.1 (A.D. 326): " . . .
   those women, the vileness of whose lives has proved them unworthy of
   the protection of the law."

   [413] With this chapter compare Lactantius Inst. div. III. 21.

   [414] The ultimate source of this passage is of course Plato Republic
   V. 457; it is not clear through what channel Salvian derived it. He
   does not appear to have read Greek, and the Latin of the paragraph does
   not suggest Cicero's De re publica as a direct source. It was, however,
   a well-known topic, and may have been the subject of rhetorical
   exercises in the schools.

   [415] The locus classicus for this is Lucan De bello civili II.
   329-333, from which Augustine (Bon. coniug. 21) clearly drew his
   example of the Younger Cato, handing his wife Marcia to a friend "to
   fill another's house with sons." See Souter, Classical Review, XIV
   (1900), 164. This was a popular exemplum, especially among Christian
   writers, as is shown by H. Kohl, De scholasticarum declamationum
   argumentis ex historia petitis (Paderborn, 1915), p. 104.

   [416] Salvian here confused Socrates with the "Socratic dialogues" of
   Plato.

   [417] Compare Augustine Sermo de tempore barbarico (Migne, PL, XL, col.
   703): "Neither by the enemy, nor by the barbarians, but by their own
   action are all men slain in their souls by seeing, consenting and not
   preventing. We have all abided in quiet, and as long as we do not wish
   the perverse peace of our state disturbed, we do not receive the true
   peace that we deserve. We scorn to preserve the peace of a good life,
   and so the peace of our times has come to an end."
     __________________________________________________________________

THE EIGHTH BOOK

   1. I think, nay, I am certain, that the great length of my argument
   will arouse distaste in many, especially since it upbraids our vicious
   lives. For most men wish praise, and no one enjoys censure. Worse than
   this, however evil a man is, however profligate, he would rather be
   falsely praised than rightly reproved, and prefers to be deceived by
   the mockery of false praise than healed by the most salutary
   admonitions. Since this is true, what are we to do? Must we accede to
   the will of wicked men? Or if they wish even empty praise conferred on
   them, is it fitting to proffer silly and meaningless eulogies? Surely
   we must consider that, as men of honor should not mock even those who
   wish to make themselves ridiculous, so they should not laud in lying
   phrases those who yearn to be adorned by praise, however false. [418]
   We must not take into account the preferences of individuals, but
   rather what is fitting for us to say, especially since the prophet
   said: "Woe unto them that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter."
   [419]

   We must by every means hold fast to the truth, so that what a thing is
   in fact, it may also be in words, and those that contain sweetness be
   called sweet, and those that contain bitterness, bitter. This is the
   more obligatory in the present discussion of a sacred matter, when our
   iniquities are made by many a cause of wrath against God, and men try
   to avoid seeming themselves worthy of accusation by first accusing him.
   When they blasphemously call him careless and neglectful of human
   affairs, and say that he does not govern according to justice, or even
   that he does not govern at all, what else are they doing but accusing
   God of laziness and abuse and injustice? Alas for the blindness of
   human folly! for the madness of insane audacity! It is God, O man, that
   you call careless and neglectful. If you injured any freeborn man with
   such slanders, you would be accused at law of malicious abuse; if you
   so attacked any illustrious or eminent man you would be sentenced in
   the courts. Such slanders are chiefly hurled at prodigal wards; it is
   the special byword for profligate youths, to call them wastrels and
   careless and negligent about their property. What sacrilegious words!
   what profane impudence! We use such terms of God as we would not employ
   of any men except those of the most abandoned sort. Yet this is not all
   the abuse given him: as I said before, men even brand him as unjust. If
   we claim that we do not deserve our sufferings and are unworthy to
   endure our present misfortunes, surely we are calling God, who bids us
   endure undeserved evils, unjust. You say, however, that he does not
   bid, but merely permits us to endure them. Suppose we grant this point,
   still I ask how far he is from ordering what he permits? For he who
   knows we endure such woes and can prevent our suffering them, proves
   beyond a doubt that we ought to endure whatever he permits. From this
   it is manifest that his acquiescence is part of his judgment, and that
   we are enduring a sentence from heaven. As all things, are subject to
   sacred authority and the will of God rules everything, whatever evils
   and whatever punishments we bear daily are the censure of his divine
   hand, which censure, indeed, we constantly arouse and kindle by our
   sins. We kindle the fire of the celestial wrath and arouse the flames
   by which we are burned, so that the words of the prophet may rightly be
   used against us as often as we endure such ills: "Make your way into
   the flames of the fire that you have kindled." [420] From this we see
   that according to the sacred sentence each sinner is preparing for
   himself the suffering that he endures. None of our misfortunes can be
   imputed to God; we are the authors of our own misery. For God is
   gracious and merciful and, as the Scripture says, he wishes no one to
   perish or be injured. So whatever is done against us is done by our own
   actions; there is nothing more cruel to us than ourselves; we, I say,
   are torturing ourselves even against God's will.

   But, forsooth, I seem to be contradicting myself; whereas I said before
   that we are punished by God on account of our sins, now I say that we
   are punishing ourselves. Both are true; we are indeed punished by God,
   but we ourselves force him to punish us. Inasmuch as we cause our own
   punishment, who can doubt that we are chastising ourselves by our
   crimes? For whoever gives cause for his punishment chastises himself,
   according to the saying: "Every one is bound by the chains of his
   sins." [421] If wicked men are bound by the chains of their sins, every
   sinner doubtless binds himself when he sins.

   2. Since I have already spoken at length of the unchastity of Africa,
   let me now briefly discuss its blasphemies, for the paganism of the
   majority has had no interruption. They have indeed confined within
   their own walls their native crime, by which of course I mean that
   "Celestial" demon of the Africans, [422] to which I suppose the pagans
   of old gave so fair-sounding a title in order that having no divinity
   it should at least have a name, and lacking any virtue derived from
   actual power should gain honor from its designation. Who among them has
   not been initiated into the worship of that idol? Who has not been
   dedicated to it by his very family and birth? I am not speaking now of
   men who are pagans as much by profession and name as in their way of
   life, and whose name indicates their heathen error. Paganism is
   certainly more tolerable and less evil in men avowedly pagan; the more
   deadly peril lies in the fact that many who have made their vows to
   Christ continue to give their real devotion to idols. For did not those
   who were called Christians turn from the worship of Christ to that of
   the "Celestial deity," or--which is far worse--worship her even before
   they paid their devotions to him? Who among them did not cross the
   Lord's threshold redolent of the odor of demoniacal sacrifices and go
   up to the altar of Christ reeking with the foulness of very demons, so
   that it would be less monstrous not to come at all to the Lord's temple
   than to come in such a fashion? For a Christian who does not come to
   church is guilty of neglect, but one who comes in such a way is guilty
   of sacrilege. It is less difficult to atone for failure to honor God
   than for direct insult to him. So we see that any who have acted thus
   have not given honor to God, but have taken it away from him. They have
   even in a way given the attention due to the church of God to an idol,
   because that to which priority is accorded gains in honor from that
   which is relegated to second place. See then the faith of the Africans,
   and especially of the noblest among them! See what their religion and
   their Christianity have been! It was in scorn of Christ that men called
   them Christians. Though the apostle cries: "Ye cannot drink the cup of
   the Lord and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's
   table and of the table of devils," [423] it was not enough for them to
   drink the cup of the Lord with the cup of devils, but they must take
   the latter first. It was not enough for them to match the table of
   devils with the Lord's table, unless they came to the temple of God
   fresh from the worship of infamous superstitions and breathed on the
   holy altars of Christ the foul miasma of the diabolical spirit itself.

   3. But, you say, they do not all do these things--only the highest and
   most powerful are guilty of these wrongs. Suppose I agree to this.
   Still, since the greater part of a city is made up of the richest and
   most powerful households, you see that the whole city was polluted by
   the sacrilegious superstition of a few great men. No one indeed can
   doubt that all the households are either like the masters who rule
   them, or worse, and usually worse! Therefore, since even good masters
   as a general rule have bad slaves, it is easy to decide what sort of
   households all of these were, in which servile minds, already disposed
   to evil, were made more vicious by the wickedness of their masters.

   Suppose for the sake of the argument that what we said was true only of
   all the most powerful and noble. Were the vices that were common to
   noble and ignoble alike less serious? I mean the hatred and abuse of
   all holy men, for surely it is a sort of sacrilege to hate those who
   worship God. Just as the man who injures our slaves thereby harms us,
   and the man who flogs another's sons tortures the father's affection by
   his children's suffering, so anyone who injures a servant of God
   violates the divine majesty, as the Lord said to his apostle: "He that
   receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that despiseth you, despiseth me."
   [424] Our most gracious and loving Lord shared his honor and disgrace
   alike with his servants, to the end that no one who injured a servant
   of God should think that the man alone was hurt by his action, since
   injury to God would undoubtedly be mingled with the harm inflicted on
   his followers. Of this God gave us proof, according to his most
   indulgent love, in these words: "For he that toucheth you toucheth the
   pupil of my eye." [425] To express the tenderness of his love he used
   the most tender part of the body, that we might clearly understand that
   God is injured by a contempt of his saints as slight as the touch
   required to injure the eyesight. So the people of Africa injured and
   hated the servants of God and God himself in them.

   4. But perhaps the question will be asked: "In what ways was their
   hatred manifested?" In the same manner, of course, in which also the
   Jews' hatred of Christ was declared when they said to him: "Thou art a
   Samaritan and hast a devil," [426] when they mocked and cursed him,
   when they breathed into his face and gnashed their teeth over his head.
   Whence also the Savior himself says in the Psalms: "All they that saw
   me laughed me to scorn; they shot out their lips and shook their
   heads." [427] And elsewhere he says: "They have tempted me and laughed
   me to scorn, they gnashed upon me with their teeth." [428] So is the
   hatred of the Africans for the monks--that is, for the servants of
   God--proved, because they mocked at and cursed them, because they
   attacked and execrated them, because they did practically everything
   against them that the wickedness of the Jews contrived against our
   Savior before they actually shed his divine blood. But they, you say,
   did not kill the saints, while we read that the Jews did.

   Whether they killed or not, I do not know; I make no claims of that,
   but yet how great a defence is it that the only element of pagan
   persecution lacking was the very end of persecution? Let us assume that
   the saints were not killed there; what then shall we make of the fact
   that they are not far from killing who hate with the desire to kill,
   especially as the Lord himself says: "Whosoever hateth his brother
   without a cause is a murderer?" [429]

   Yet it was not without cause that they persecuted the servants of God.
   For who can say that it was without a cause, seeing that these men
   differed from them in all the characteristics of their life and habits,
   that in them they saw nothing that was theirs, since all was God's? The
   greatest cause of discord is diversity of interests, because it is
   nearly or quite impossible that a man should love in another that with
   which he himself is at variance. So it was not without cause, as I
   said, that they hated those in whom they saw everything hostile and
   inimical to them. For they lived in constant wickedness, but the saints
   in constant innocence; they lived in lust, these in chastity; they in
   evil dens, these in monasteries; they almost constantly with the devil,
   and these incessantly with Christ. It was not without cause that within
   the cities of Africa, and especially within the walls of Carthage, a
   people as unhappy as they were unfaithful could scarcely look without
   reviling and curses at a man pale and in monkish garb, his flowing
   locks cut even to the shaved skin. And if ever any servant of God from
   the monasteries of Egypt or the sacred places of Jerusalem or the holy
   and venerable retreats of the desert came to that city in performance
   of his sacred mission, as soon as he appeared to the people, he met
   with contumely, sacrilege and curses. Nor was this all, he was flayed
   by the vile derision of dissolute men and hissing mockery of the
   coarsest sort; so that if any man uninformed of these things witnessed
   the scene, he would not think that a man was being mocked, but that
   some strange and unheard-of monster was being expelled from the city.

   5. Consider the faith of the Africans and especially the people of
   Carthage. It was safer for the apostles of old to enter the cities of
   the pagans, and those wild and barbarous assemblies had less hatred of
   their arrival and presence. The holy vessel of election, Paul the
   apostle, spoke of the worship and majesty of one God, and the people of
   the Athenians, most superstitious though they were, heard him
   patiently. [430] The Lycaonians also so marvelled at the apostles that,
   seeing their divine strength, they thought they were not men. [431] But
   in Carthage the servants of God were scarcely allowed to appear in the
   streets and public squares without mockery and cursing. Certain men
   think that this was not persecution because they were not actually
   killed. You know that brigands have a proverb that those they spare owe
   their lives to them. [432] But in Carthage this benefit was due less to
   the men than to the laws, for the laws of the Twelve Tables forbade a
   man to be put to death without a trial. Hence we see that the power of
   the Lord's religion was indeed great in a place where his servants were
   only permitted to escape death at the hands of Christians because they
   were defended by pagan law. Yet we wonder that such Christians are now
   suffering at the hands of the barbarians, when they themselves
   inflicted barbarous treatment on the saints.

   So God is just and his judgments are righteous, for, as the Scripture
   says: "What men have sowed, that shall they also reap." [433] God seems
   to have referred to the wickedness of the people of Africa, when he
   said: "Recompense her according to her work; according to all that she
   hath done do unto her; for she hath been proud against the Lord." [434]
   Let us [435] then be surprised and angry that they now endure some few
   trials at the hands of men! Their conduct toward God has been far worse
   than any treatment they have received, especially if one compares their
   sufferings and their misdeeds with due consideration of the distinction
   between the persons concerned. [436]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [418] Compare Sidonius Ep. VIII. 10: "If you had had any consideration
   for my modesty you would have kept in mind the saying of Symmachus: as
   true praise adorns, so false praise reproves.' "The saying is not found
   in Symmachus' writings, but Grégoire and Collombet cite it as used by
   Caesarius of Arles in his 25th homily to the monks of Lérins, which I
   have been unable to trace, and by Pope Pelagius I in a letter to
   Sapaudus, bishop of Aries, as the saying of a vir doctissimus.

   [419] Isaiah 5. 20.

   [420] Ibid. 50. 11.

   [421] See Proverbs 5. 22.

   [422] That is, the goddess Tanit, frequently called Dea Caelestisby
   Latin authors.

   [423] 1 Corinthians 10. 21.

   [424] Matthew 10. 40; Luke 10. 16.

   [425] Zechariah 2. 8.

   [426] John 8. 48.

   [427] Psalms 22. 7.

   [428] Jeremiah 20. 7; Psalms 35. 16.

   [429] 1 John 3. 15.

   [430] Acts 17. 16-34. One scarcely expects to find the Athenian
   Ecclesia cited as an example of a wild and barbarous assembly.

   [431] Acts 14.

   [432] See Cicero Or. Philippica II. 3. 5.

   [433] Galatians 6. 7.

   [434] Jeremiah 50. 29.

   [435] Here Pauly inserted the negative minime, for which the MSS give
   no authority. I have omitted it as unnecessary; without it the sentence
   furnishes a characteristic example of Salvian's irony. See H. K.
   Messenger, op. cit., sec. 48.

   [436] Here ends the text as it is preserved in the MSS. Whether the
   succeeding chapters have been lost, or the author left his work
   unfinished, cannot now be determined. In view, however, of the many
   years between the composition of the book and Salvian's death, the
   former alternative seems the more probable.
