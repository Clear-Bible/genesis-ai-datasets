SERMON CCVII.

  OF THE NECESSITY OF GOOD WORKS.

   This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm
   constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to
   maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto
   men.--Tit. iii. 8.

   FROM these words I have proposed to handle these two points:

   First, The certain truth or credibility of this saying or proposition,
   That they which have believed in God ought to be careful to maintain
   good works. This I have spoken to, and come now to the

   Second, The great fitness and necessity of inculcating frequently upon
   all that profess themselves Christians, the indispensable necessity of
   the practice of the virtues of a good life. In the handling of this
   point, I shall do these two things:

   First, I shall shew the great fitness and necessity of pressing upon
   people the indispensable necessity of the virtues of a good life. And,

   Secondly, Answer an objection or two, to which the preaching of this
   kind of doctrine may seem liable. I begin with the

   First of these, viz. To shew the great fitness and necessity of
   inculcating and pressing upon all Christians the indispensable
   necessity of the virtues of a good life. And this will appear to be
   very fit and necessary upon these two accounts:

   I. Because men are so very apt to deceive themselves in this matter,
   and so hardly brought to that wherein religion mainly consists, viz.
   the practice of real goodness.

   II. Because of the indispensable necessity of the thing to render us
   capable of the Divine favour and acceptance, and of the reward of
   eternal life and happiness.

   I. Because men are so very apt to deceive themselves in this matter,
   and so hardly brought to that wherein religion mainly consists, viz.
   the practice of real goodness. They are extremely desirous to reconcile
   (if it be possible) the hopes of eternal happiness in another world,
   with a liberty to live as they list in this present world: they are
   loath to be at the trouble and drudgery of mortifying their lusts, and
   subduing and governing their passions, and bridling their tongues, and
   ordering their whole conversation aright, and practising all those
   duties which are comprehended in those two great commandments, the love
   of God and our neighbour. They would fain get into the favour of God,
   and make their calling and election sure, by some easier way, than by
   "giving all diligence, to add to their faith, virtue, and knowledge,
   and temperance, and patience, and brotherly kindness, and charity."

   The plain truth of the matter is, men had rather religion should be any
   thing, than what indeed it is, the thwarting and crossing of our
   vicious inclinations, the curing of our evil and corrupt affections;
   the due care and government of our unruly appetites and passions, the
   sincere endeavour and constant practice of all holiness and virtue in
   our lives; and, therefore, they had much rather have some thing that
   might handsomely palliate and excuse their evil inclinations, than to
   extirpate them and cut them up: and rather than reform and amend their
   vicious lives, make God an honourable amends and compensation for them
   in some other way.

   This hath been the way and folly of mankind in all ages, to defeat the
   great end and design of religion, and to thrust it by, by substituting
   something else in the place of it, which they hope may serve the turn
   as well, and which hath the appearance of as much devotion and respect,
   and perhaps of more cost and pains, than that which God requires of
   them. Men have ever been apt thus to impose upon themselves, and to
   please themselves with a conceit of pleasing God full as well, or
   better, by some other way, than that which he hath pitched upon and
   appointed for them; not considering that God is a great king, and will
   be observed and obeyed by his creatures in his own way; and that
   obedience to what he commands is better and more acceptable to him than
   any other sacrifice that we can offer, which he hath not required at
   our hands; that he is infinitely wise and good, and therefore the laws
   and rules which he has given us to live by, are more likely and certain
   means of our happiness, than any inventions and devices of our own.

   Thus, I say, it hath been in all ages. The old world, after that
   general deluge which God sent to punish the raging wickedness and
   impiety of men, by sweeping all mankind from off the face of the earth,
   excepting only one family, which was saved to be the seminary of a new
   and better race of men; I say, after this, the world in a short space
   fell off from the worship of the true God to the worship of idols and
   false gods; being unwilling to bring themselves to a conformity and
   likeness to the true God, they chose false gods like themselves, such
   as might not only excuse, but even countenance and abet, their lewd and
   vicious practices.

   And when God had made a new revelation of himself to the nation of the
   Jews, and given them the chief heads and substance of the natural law
   written over again with his own finger in tables of stone, and many
   other laws concerning religious worship, and their civil conversation,
   suited and adapted to their present temper and condition; yet, how soon
   did their religion degenerate into external observances, purifications
   and washings, and a multitude of sacrifices, without any great regard
   to the inward and substantial parts of religion, and the practice of
   those moral duties and virtues, which were in the first place required
   of them, and with out which all the rest found no acceptance with God.
   Hence are those frequent complaints in the prophets, that their
   religion was degenerated into form and ceremony, into oblations and
   sacrifices, the observance of fasts, and sabbaths, and new-moons; but
   had no power and efficacy upon their hearts and lives; was wholly
   destitute of in ward purity and holiness, of all substantial virtues,
   and the fruits of righteousness in a good life. Thus God complains by
   the prophet Isaiah: (chap. i. 11, &c.) "To what purpose is the
   multitude of your sacrifices unto me, saith the Lord? Bring no more
   vain oblations. Incense is an abomination unto me, the new-moons and
   sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is
   iniquity, even the solemn meeting. Wash you, make you clean, put away
   the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Cease to do evil, learn
   to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
   plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reason together, saith the
   Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet," &c. Upon these terms God
   declares himself ready to be reconciled to them, and to have mercy on
   them. But all their external services and sacrifices, separated from
   real goodness and righteousness, were so far from appeasing God's
   wrath, that they did but increase the provocation. And to the same
   purpose, (chap. lxvi. 2, 3.) "To this man will I look, even to him that
   is poor, and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. He that
   killeth an ox, is as if he slew a man: he that sacrificeth a lamb, as
   if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he
   offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an
   idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighted in
   their abomination." (Jer. vi. 19, 20.) "Hear, O earth: behold, I will
   bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because
   they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.
   To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba; and the sweet
   cane from a far country? Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor
   your sacrifices sweet unto me." They thought to please God with costly
   in cense and sacrifices, whilst they rejected his law. And, (chap. vii.
   4-6.) "Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, the
   temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are these. For if ye
   thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute
   judgment between a man and his neighbour; if ye oppress not the
   stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in
   this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt: then will I
   cause you to dwell in this place." And, (ver. 8-10.) "Behold, ye trust
   in lying words that cannot profit. Will ye steal, murder, and commit
   adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after
   other gods whom ye know not; and come and stand before me in this
   house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all
   these abominations?" This was to add impudence to all their other
   impieties, to think that the worship of God, and his holy temple, did
   excuse these gross crimes and immoralities. (Micah vi. 6-8.) There God
   represents the Jews as desirous to please God at any rate, provided
   their lusts and vices might be spared, and they might not be obliged to
   amend and reform their lives: "Wherewith shall I come before the Lord,
   and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with
   burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleased
   with thousands of rams, and with ten thousand rivers of oil? shall I
   give my first-born for my transgressions, the fruit of my body for the
   sin of my soul?" All this they would willingly do: but all this will
   not do without real virtue and goodness. "He hath shewed thee, O man,
   what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly,
   and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"

   And in the time of our blessed Saviour, those who pretended to be most
   devout among the Jews, were wholly busied about their pretended
   traditions of washing of hands, and the outsides of their cups and
   dishes, and about the external and lesser things of the law, the
   tithing of mint, and anise, and cummin, and all manner of herbs,
   omitting in the mean time "the weightier matters of the law, judgment,
   mercy, and faith, and the love of God," as our Saviour describes their
   religion, (Matt. xxiii. 23.)

   And after the clear revelation of the gospel, the best and most perfect
   institution that ever was, in the very beginning of Christianity, what
   licentious doctrines did there creep in, turning the grace of God into
   lasciviousness, and releasing men from all moral duties, and the
   virtues of a good life; "by reason whereof the way of truth was evil
   spoken of," as St. Peter and St. Jude expressly tell us concerning the
   sect of the gnostics. And St. John, like wise, describes the same sect
   by their arrogant pretence to extraordinary knowledge and illumination,
   whilst they "walked in darkness," and allowed themselves in all manner
   of wickedness of life; they pretended to perfection and righteousness,
   without keeping the commandments of God.

   And in the next following age of Christianity, how was it pestered with
   a trifling controversy about the time of the observation of Easter, and
   with endless disputes and niceties about the doctrine of the trinity,
   and the two natures and wills of Christ! by which means the practice of
   Christianity was greatly neglected, and the main end and design of that
   excellent religion almost quite defeated and lost.

   After this, when the mystery of iniquity began to shew itself, in the
   degeneracy of the Roman church from her primitive sanctity and purity,
   and in the affectation of an undue and boundless power over other
   churches, the Christian religion began to be overrun with superstition,
   and the primitive fervour of piety and devotion was turned into a
   fierce zeal and contention about matters of no moment and importance;
   of which we have a most remarkable instance here in our own nation,
   when Austin the monk arrived here to convert the nation, and preach the
   gospel amongst us, as the church of Rome pretended; but against all
   faith and truth of history, which assures us, that Christianity was
   planted here among the Britons several ages be fore, and perhaps sooner
   than even at Rome itself; and not only so, but had got considerable
   footing among the Saxons before Austin the monk ever set foot amongst
   us; I say, when Austin the monk arrived here, the two great points of
   his Christianity were to bring the Britons to a conformity with the
   church of Rome in the time of Easter, and in the tonsure and shaving of
   the priests, after the manner of St. Peter, as they pretended, upon the
   crown of the head, and not of St. Paul, which was by shaving or cutting
   close the hair of the whole head, as from some vain and foolish
   tradition he pretended to have learned: the promoting of these two
   customs was his great errand and business, and the zeal of his
   preaching was spent upon these two fundamental points; in which, after
   very barbarous and bloody doings, he at last prevailed. And this is the
   conversion of England, so much boasted of by the church of Rome, and
   for which this Austin is magnified for so great a saint; when it is
   very evident, from the history of those times, that he was a proud,
   ignorant, turbulent, and cruel man, who, instead of first converting
   the nation to the faith of Christ, confounded the purity and simplicity
   of the Christian religion, which had been planted and established among
   us long before.

   In latter ages, when the man of sin was grown up to his full stature,
   the great business of religion was the pope's absolute and universal
   authority over all Christians, even kings and princes, in order to
   spiritual matters; ecclesiastical liberties and immunities; and the
   exemption of the clergy, and all matters belonging to them, from the
   cognizance of the secular power; the great points which Thomas a Becket
   contended so earnestly for, calling it the cause of Christ, and in the
   maintenance whereof he persisted to the death, and was canonized as a
   saint and a martyr. And among the people, their piety consisted in the
   promoting of monkery, and founding and endowing monasteries: in
   infinite superstitions, foolish doctrines, and more absurd miracles to
   confirm them; in purchasing indulgences with money, and hearing of
   masses for the redemption of souls out of purgatory; in the idolatrous
   worship of saints and their relics and images, and especially of the
   blessed Virgin, which at last grew to that height, as to make up the
   greatest part of their worship and devotion both public and private.
   And in deed they have brought matters to that absurd pass, that one may
   truly say, that the whole business of their devotion is to teach men to
   worship images, and images to worship God. For to be present at Divine
   service and prayers celebrated in an unknown tongue, is not the worship
   of men and reasonable creatures, but of statues and images, which,
   though they be present in the place where this service is performed,
   yet they bear no part in it, being void of all sense and understanding
   of what is done. And indeed in their whole religion, such as it is,
   they drive so strict a bargain with God, and treat him in so arrogant a
   manner by their insolent doctrine of the merit of good works, as if God
   were as much beholden to them for their service and obedience, as they
   are to him for the reward of it, which they challenge as of right and
   justice belonging to them. Nay, so high have they carried this
   doctrine, as to pretend not only to merit eternal life for themselves,
   but to do a great deal more in works of supererogation, for the benefit
   and advantage of others; that is, when they have done as much as in
   strict duty they are obliged to, and thereby paid down a valuable
   consideration for heaven, and as much as in equal justice between God
   and man it is worth, the surplusage of their good works they put as a
   debt upon God, as so many bills of credit laid up in the treasury of
   the church, which the pope, by his pardons and indulgences, may
   dispense and place to whose account he pleaseth. And thus by one device
   or other they have enervated the Christian religion to that degree,
   that it hath quite lost its virtue and efficacy upon the hearts and
   lives of men, and instead of the fruits of real goodness and
   righteousness, it produceth little else but superstition and folly; or
   if it bring forth any fruits of charity, it is either so misplaced upon
   chimeras (as hiring of priests to say so many masses for the dead, to
   redeem their souls out of purgatory), that it signifies nothing; or
   else the virtue of it is spoiled by the arrogant pretence of meriting
   by it. So apt have men always been to deceive themselves by an affected
   mistake of anything for religion, but that which really and in truth is
   so! And this is that which the apostle St. Paul foretold would be the
   great miscarriage of the last times, that under a great pretence of
   religion men should be destitute of all goodness, and abandoned to all
   wickedness and vice, "having a form of godliness, but denying the power
   of it," (2 Tim. iii. 5.)

   And though things have been much better since that happy reformation
   from the corruptions and errors of popery, yet even among protestants
   the malice and craft of the devil hath prevailed so far, as to
   undermine, in a great measure, the necessity of a good life, by those
   luscious doctrines of the antinomians concerning free grace, and the
   justification of a sinner merely upon a confident persuasion of his
   being in a state of grace and favour with God, and consequently that
   the gospel dischargeth men from obedience to the laws of God, and all
   manner of obligation to the virtues of a good life; which doctrines,
   how false and absurd soever in themselves, and pernicious in their
   consequences, did not only prevail very much in Germany, a little after
   the beginning of the Reformation, but have since got too much footing
   in other places, and been too far entertained and cherished by some
   good men, who were not sufficiently aware of the error and danger of
   them. But blessed be God, the doctrine of our church, both in the
   articles and homilies of it, hath been preserved pure and free from all
   error and corruption in this matter on either hand, asserting the
   necessity of good works, and yet renouncing the merit of them in that
   arrogant sense in which the church of Rome does teach and assert it;
   and so teaching justification by faith, and the free grace of God in
   Jesus Christ, as to maintain the indispensable necessity of the virtues
   of a good life.

   And thus I have done with the first reason, why it is so fit and
   necessary to press frequently upon Christians the indispensable
   necessity of the virtues of a good life; viz. because men are and ever
   have been so very apt to deceive themselves in this matter, and so
   hardly brought to that wherein religion mainly consists, viz. the
   practice of real goodness. I shall be brief upon the

   II. Second reason; namely, Because of the indispensable necessity of
   the thing to render us capable of the Divine favour and acceptance, and
   of the reward of eternal life. And this added to the former, makes the
   reason full and strong. For if men be so apt to deceive themselves in
   this matter, and to be deceived in it be a matter of such dangerous
   consequence, then it is highly necessary to inculcate this frequently
   upon Christians, that no man may be mistaken in a matter of so much
   danger, and upon which his eternal happiness depends. Now, if obedience
   to the laws of God, and the practice of virtue and good works, be
   necessary to our continuance in a state of grace and favour with God,
   and to our final justification by our absolution at the great day; if
   nothing but holiness and obedience can qualify us for the blessed sight
   of God, and the glorious reward of eternal happiness; then it is matter
   of infinite consequence to us, not to be mistaken in a matter of so
   great importance; but that we "work out our salvation with fear and
   trembling, and give all diligence to make our calling and election
   sure," by adding "to our faith and knowledge the virtues of a good
   life; that by patient continuance in well-doing, we seek for glory, and
   honour, and immortality, and eternal life;" and that we so demean
   ourselves "in all holy conversation and godliness," as that we may,
   with comfort and confidence, "wait for the blessed hope, and the
   glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who
   gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
   purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." That this
   is indispensably necessary to our happiness, I have in my former
   discourse shewn at large, from the great end and design of religion in
   general, and of the Christian religion in particular, from the whole
   design and doctrine of the gospel, from the constant tenor of the
   Bible, and from the nature and reason of the thing.

   I know it hath been the great design of the devil and his instruments,
   in all ages, to undermine religion, by making an unhappy separation and
   divorce between godliness and morality, between faith and the virtues
   of a good life; and by this means, not only to weaken and abate, but
   even wholly to destroy, the force and efficacy of the Christian
   religion, and to leave men as much under the power of the devil and
   their lusts, as if there were no such thing as Christianity in the
   world. But let us not deceive ourselves; this was always religion, and
   the condition of our acceptance with God, to endeavour to be like God
   in purity and holiness, in justice and righteousness, in mercy and
   goodness, "to cease to do evil, and to learn to do well." And this you
   will find to be the constant doctrine of the Holy Scriptures, from the
   beginning of the Bible to the end. (Gen. iv. 7.) "If thou doest well,
   shalt thou not be accepted?" (Psalm xv. 1, 2.) "Lord, who shall abide
   in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell upon thy holy hill? he that walketh
   uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth from his
   heart." (Psal. l. 23.) "To him that ordereth his conversation aright,
   will I shew the salvation of God." (Isa. i. 16-18.) "Wash ye, make you
   clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to
   do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
   the fatherless, plead for the widow. Come now, and let us reason
   together, saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
   as white as snow." (Isa. iii. 10, 11.) "Say ye to the righteous, that
   it shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their
   doings. Woe unto the wicked, it shall be ill with him: for the reward
   of his hands shall be given him." (Micah vi. 8.) "He hath shewed thee,
   O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do
   justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"

   And our blessed Saviour, in his sermon upon the mount, tells us plainly
   what manner of persons we must be, if ever we hope to be happy, and to
   enter into the kingdom of God; and wherein his religion consists, in
   righteousness, and purity, and meekness, and patience, and
   peaceableness; and declares most expressly, that if we hope for
   happiness upon any other terms than the practice of these virtues, we
   build upon the sand. (Acts x. 34.) "Of a truth I perceive, (says St.
   Peter there,) that God is no respecter of persons; but, in every
   nation, he that feareth God, and worketh righteousness, is accepted
   with him." (Gal. vi. 7, 8.) "Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for
   whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to
   the flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to
   the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting." (Eph. v. 6.)
   "Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things
   cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience." (1 John
   iii. 7.) "Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doeth
   righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous." And here in the
   text, "This is a faithful saying," &c. "These things are good and
   profitable to men," acceptable to God, and honourable to religion, and
   the only way and means to eternal life, through the mercy and merits of
   Jesus Christ, our blessed Lord, and Saviour.

SERMON CCVIII.

  OF THE NECESSITY OF GOOD WORKS.

   This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm
   constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to
   maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto
   men.--Tit. iii. 8.

   I COME now to the second thing I proposed, which was, to answer an
   objection or two, to which the preaching of this kind of doctrine may
   seem liable.

   First, That this is to advance and set up morality.

   Secondly, That this seems to contradict St. Paul's doctrine of
   "justification by the free grace of God in Jesus Christ, and by faith
   without the works of the law." I shall endeavour to answer both these.

   First, That this is to advance and set up morality. To which I answer
   two things:

   I. That if by morality men mean counterfeit virtue, and the specious
   show of justice, and charity, and meekness, or any other virtue,
   without the truth and reality of them, without an inward principle of
   love to God and goodness, out of ostentation and vain-glory, or for
   some other bye and sinister end, such as probably were the virtues of
   many heathens, and it is to be feared of too many Christians; if this
   be that which the objectors mean by morality, then we do assure them,
   that we preach up no such morality, but those virtues only which are
   sincere, and substantial, and real, the principle and root whereof is
   the love of God and goodness, and the end the honour and glory of God,
   and a necessary ingredient whereof is sincerity and truth. It is
   "righteousness and true holiness," the sincere love of God and our
   neighbour, real meekness, and patience, and humility, and sobriety, and
   chastity, and not the glittering show and appearance, the vain and
   affected ostentation, of any of these virtues, which we persuade and
   press men so earnestly to endeavour after.

   Not that I believe that all virtues of the heathen were counterfeit and
   destitute of an inward principle of goodness; God forbid that we should
   pass so hard a judgment upon those excellent men, Socrates, and
   Epictetus, and Antoninus, and several others, who sincerely endeavoured
   to live up to the light and law of nature, and took so much pains to
   cultivate and raise their minds, to govern and subdue the irregularity
   of their sensual appetites and brutish passions, to purify and refine
   their manners, and to excel in all virtue and goodness. These were
   glorious lights in those dark times, and so much the better for being
   good under so many disadvantages, as the ignorance and prejudice of
   their education, the multitude of evil examples continually in their
   view, and the powerful temptation of the contrary customs and fashions
   of the generality of mankind.

   Nor were they wholly destitute of an inward principle of goodness; for
   though they had not that powerful grace and assistance of God's Holy
   Spirit which is promised and afforded to all sincere Christians (as
   neither had the Jews, who were the peculiar people of God, and in
   covenant with him), yet it is very credible, that such persons were
   under a special care and providence of God, and not wholly destitute of
   Divine assistance, no more than Job and his friends, mentioned in the
   Old Testament, and Cornelius in the New, who surely were very good men,
   and accepted of God, though they were gentiles, and "aliens from the
   commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenant of promise:"
   but yet not excluded from the blessing of the Messias, though they were
   ignorant of him, as many of the Jews likewise were, nor from the
   benefit of that great propitiation, which in the fulness of time he was
   to make for the sins of the whole world.

   So that there is no need so uncharitably to conclude (as some of the
   ancients have done, not all, nor the most ancient of them neither),
   that there were no good men among the heathen, and that the brightest
   of their virtues were counterfeit, and only in show and appearance. For
   there might be several good men among the gentiles, in the same
   condition that Cornelius was before he became a Christian; of whom it
   is said, whilst he was yet a gentile, that "he was a devout man, and
   feared God, and that his prayer and his alms were accepted of God;" a
   certain sign that they were not counterfeit. And if he had died in that
   condition, before Christ had been revealed to him, I do not see what
   reasonable cause of doubt there can be concerning his salvation; and
   yet it is a most certain and inviolable truth, "that there is no other
   name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved, but the
   name of Jesus; neither is there salvation in any other." And good men
   in all ages and nations from the beginning of the world, both before
   the law, and under the law, and without the law, such as "feared God,
   and wrought righteousness," were accepted of him in that name, and by
   the meritorious sacrifice of that Lamb of God, which, in respect of the
   virtue and efficacy of it, is said to have been "slain from the
   foundation of the world."

   II. But if by moral virtues be meant those which concern the manners of
   men, from whence they seem to have taken their name, and which are in
   truth the duties commanded and enjoined by the natural or moral law,
   and are comprehended under those two great commands (as our blessed
   Saviour calls them), the love of God, and our neighbour; I say, if this
   be the meaning of it, then we do advance this kind of morality, as that
   which is the primary and substantial part of all religion, and most
   strictly enjoined by the Christian. To which purpose our Saviour tells
   us, (Matt. v. 17.) that he was not "come to destroy the law and the
   prophets, but to fulfil them." And, (ver. 19.) "Whosoever therefore
   shall break one of the least of these commandments, and teach men so,
   shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall
   do and teach them, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven;"
   that is, under the dispensation of the gospel. So that this is a
   principal part of the Christian religion, to teach and practise the
   duties of the moral law. This the pharisees were defective in, placing
   their religion in external and little things, but neglecting the great
   duties of morality, "the weightier matters of the law, mercy, and
   judgment, and fidelity, and the love of God." And therefore he adds,
   (ver. 20.) "I say unto you, except your righteousness exceed the
   righteousness of the scribes and pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
   into the kingdom of heaven." It is not possible in more express and
   emphatical words to enjoin the observation of the duties of the moral
   law. And then for that great principle and rule of moral justice, "To
   do to all men, as we would have them to do to us;" our Saviour enjoins
   it as an essential part of religion, and the sum and substance of our
   whole duty to our neighbour, and of all the particular precepts
   contained in the law and the prophets. (Matt. vii. 12.) "Therefore all
   things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to
   them: for this is the law and the prophets." And St. Paul most
   expressly declares, that he was so far from weakening or making void
   the obligation of the law by his doctrine of justification by faith,
   that he did thereby confirm and establish it: (Rom. iii. 31.) "Do we
   then make void the law through faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the
   law."

   So that moral duties and virtues are the same with Christian graces,
   and with that holiness and righteousness which the gospel requires, and
   differ only in name and notion. They are called virtues, with relation
   to the intrinsical nature and goodness of them; and graces, with
   respect to the principle from which they flow, being the fruits and
   effects of the gracious operation of the Spirit of God upon our minds.
   And it hath been a very ill service to religion, to decry morality as
   some have done, not considering that moral duties are of primary
   obligation, and bound upon us by the law of nature; and that
   Christianity hath reinforced and seconded the obligation of them by
   more powerful motives and encouragements. But I proceed to the

   Second objection; viz. That this discourse seems to be contrary to St.
   Paul's doctrine of justification by the free grace of God in Jesus
   Christ, by faith, without the works of the law.

   To which I answer, that St. Paul, when he does so vehemently and
   frequently assert justification by the free grace of God, and by faith,
   without the works of the law, does not thereby exclude the necessity of
   works of righteousness, and obedience to the moral precepts of the
   gospel, as the condition of our continuance in the favour of God, and
   of our final and perfect justification and absolution by the sentence
   of the great day; but, on the contrary, does every where declare the
   necessity of a holy and virtuous life to this purpose. And this is most
   plainly the tenor and current of his doctrine throughout all his
   epistles. But whenever he contends that "we are justified by faith
   without works," he denies one of these three things:

   1. That the observation of the law of Moses is necessary to our
   justification and salvation. And this he does in opposition to those
   who troubled the Christian church, by teaching that it was still
   necessary to Christians to keep the law of Moses; and that unless they
   did so, they could not be saved; of which we have a full account given,
   Acts xv. And this for the most part is the meaning of that assertion,
   so frequent in his Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians, that "we
   are not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Christ."
   And this is very evident from the tenor of his reasoning about this
   matter, in which he does so frequently urge this argument, and insist
   so strongly upon it; viz. that men were justified before the law of
   Moses was given, for which he instances in Abraham, and therefore the
   observance of that law cannot be necessary to a man's justification and
   salvation.

   2. Sometimes he, in his discourse upon this argument, denies the merit
   of any works of obedience and righteousness to gain the favour and
   acceptance of God; so that we cannot challenge any thing of God "as of
   debt, and as a ground of boasting," but we owe all to the free grace
   and mercy of God; and when we have done our best, have done but our
   duty. And this he likewise frequently insists upon in his Epistle to
   the Romans, in opposition to an arrogant opinion, common among the
   Jews, of the merit of good works, and that God was indebted to them for
   their obedience. In this sense, he says, (Rom. iv. 4.) "Now to him that
   worketh is the reward reckoned, not of grace but of debt;" that is, he
   that claims justification and the reward of eternal life, as due to him
   for his obedience, does not ascribe it to the free grace of God, but
   challengeth it as a debt due to him.

   3. Sometimes he denies the necessity of any works of righteousness,
   antecedently to our first justification, and being received into a
   state of grace and favour with God; and asserts, on the contrary, that
   by the faith of Christ, and sincerely embracing the Christian religion,
   men are justified: and though they were never so great sinners before,
   all their past sins are forgiven, and God is perfectly reconciled to
   them. In which sense he says, (chap. iv. 5.) that "God justifies the
   ungodly" upon their believing. So that, whatever sins they were guilty
   of before, and though they never did any one good action in their
   lives, yet, if they sincerely embrace the Christian religion, and
   thereby engage themselves to reform their lives, and to obey the
   precepts of the gospel for the future, God will there upon receive them
   into his favour, and pardon the sins of their former lives. And in this
   Epistle to Titus, (chap. iii. 5. 7. immediately before the text) "Not
   by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
   mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and by the renewing
   of the Holy Ghost: that, being justified by his grace, we should be
   made heirs according to the hope of eternal life;" that is, though
   their former life had been very bad, (as he describes it before, ver.
   3. "For we ourselves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, serving
   divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice, and envy, and hatred of
   one another;") I say, notwithstanding this, though they had clone no
   works of righteousness, but on the contrary, yet, upon their solemn
   profession of Christianity at their baptism, and declaration of their
   repentance, and engagements to live better, they were justified freely
   by God's grace, and saved by his mercy. But then he does not say, that,
   after this solemn profession of Christianity, works of righteousness
   were not necessary, to continue them in this state of grace and favour
   with God, but quite contrary; he plainly declares the necessity of them
   in the very next words; "This is a faithful saying," &c.

   And the consideration of this will fully reconcile the seeming
   difference between St. Paul and St. James, in this matter of
   justification. St. Paul affirms, that a sinner is at first justified
   and received into the favour of God, by a sincere profession of the
   Christian faith, without any works of righteousness preceding. St.
   James affirms, that no man continues in a justified state, and in
   favour with God, whose faith doth not bring forth good works, and that
   it is not a true and lively faith which doth not approve and shew
   itself to be so, by the works of obedience and a good life. (James ii.
   14.) "What doth it profit a man, my brethren, if a man say that he hath
   faith, and hath not works; can faith save him?" And, (ver. 17.) "Faith
   if it have not works is dead, being alone." And (ver. 20.) he repeats
   it again, "Know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead." And
   (ver. 22.) speaking of Abraham, "Seest thou how faith wrought with his
   works, and by works was faith made perfect?" And, (ver. 26.) "For as
   the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead
   also." The sum and result of all which is this: that though we be
   justified at first by faith without works preceding, yet faith without
   good works following it will not finally justify and save us; nay,
   indeed, that faith which does not bring forth the fruits of a good
   life, was never a true, and living, and perfect faith; but pretended,
   and dead, and imperfect, and therefore can justify no man; and he that
   hath only such a faith does but make an empty and ineffectual
   profession, but is really destitute of the true faith of the gospel.

   And this is agreeable to that explication which was given by our first
   reformers here in England, of the nature of justifying faith. "That it
   is not a mere persuasion of the truths of natural and revealed
   religion, but such a belief as begets a submission to the will of God,
   and hath hope, love, and obedience to God's commandments joined to it.
   That this is the faith which in baptism is professed, from which
   Christians are called the faithful; and that, in those Scriptures where
   it is said we are justified by faith, we may not think that we be
   justified by faith, as it is a separate virtue from hope and charity,
   the fear of God and repentance; but by it is meant faith, neither only
   nor alone, but with the aforesaid virtues, containing an engagement of
   obedience to the whole doctrine and religion of Christ. And that
   although all that are justified, must of necessity have charity as well
   as faith, yet neither faith nor charity are the worthiness and merit of
   our justification, but that is to be ascribed only to our Saviour
   Christ, who was offered upon the cross for our sins, and rose again for
   our justification;" as may be seen more at large in a treatise
   published at the beginning of our Reformation, upon this and some other
   points. And I do not see what can be said upon this point with more
   clearness and weight.

   All the application I shall make of this discourse shall be briefly
   this; that if we be convinced of the necessity of the virtues of a good
   life to all that profess themselves Christians, we would seriously and
   in good earnest set about the practice of them; if "this be a faithful
   saying," then I am sure it greatly concerns us to be careful of our
   lives and actions, and that "our conversation be as becometh the gospel
   of Christ;" because if this be true there is no possible way to
   reconcile a wicked life, no, nor a wilful neglect and violation of any
   of the du ties and laws of Christianity, with the hopes of heaven and
   eternal life. In this the Scripture is positive and peremptory, that
   "every man that hath this hope in him, must purify himself even as he
   is pure;" that "without holiness no man shall see the Lord:" but "if we
   have our fruit unto holiness, our end shall be everlasting life."

   And here I might particularly recommend to your careful practice, the
   great virtues of Christianity; those which St. Paul tells us are the
   proper and genuine "fruits of the Spirit of Christ, love, joy, peace,
   long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, temperance,"
   But I have not time to insist particularly upon them. I shall content
   myself briefly to mention those duties, which the apostle in this
   Epistle doth more especially press upon the several conditions and
   relations of men. Those who are teachers and instructors of others,
   that they would not only be careful to "preach sound doctrine," but "in
   all things to shew themselves patterns of good works." Those who are
   subject to others, and under their government, that they would pay all
   duty and obedience to their superiors, as children to their parents,
   servants to their masters; that they may "adorn the doctrine of God our
   Saviour in all things," as the apostle speaks, (chap. ii. ver. 10.) And
   so likewise, those who are subjects, that they live in all peaceable
   and humble obedience to princes and magistrates. This our apostle
   speaks of as a great duty of Christian religion, and reckons it among
   good works; (chap. iii. 1.) "Put them in mind to be subject to
   principalities and powers, and to obey magistrates, and to be ready to
   every good work."

   And then those who are of an inferior condition, that they labour and
   be diligent in the work of an honest calling, for this is privately
   good and profitable unto men and to their families; and those who are
   above this necessity, and are in a better capacity, to maintain good
   works, properly so called, works of piety, and charity, and justice;
   that they be careful to promote and advance them, according to their
   power and opportunity, because these things are publicly good and
   beneficial to mankind. "And besides this, (as St. Peter exhorts, 2 Pet.
   i. 5, 6, &c.)--And besides this, giving all diligence, add to your
   faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance;
   and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to
   godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity. For
   if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall
   neither be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
   off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins;" that is,
   doth not consider that the design of Christianity is to renew and
   reform the hearts and lives of men. "Wherefore the rather, brethren (as
   he goes on), give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for
   if ye do these things, ye shall never fall. For so an entrance shall be
   ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ."

   I will conclude all with that excellent saying of St. Paul in this
   Epistle to Titus, which so fully declares to us the great design, and
   the proper efficacy of the Christian doctrine upon the minds and
   manners of men; (chap ii. 11-13.) "For the grace of God that bringeth
   salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying
   ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously,
   and godly, in this present world: looking for that blessed hope, and
   the glorious appearance of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."

   "To whom, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all glory and honour
   now and for ever. Amen."

SERMON CCIX.

  OF DOING ALL TO THE GLORY OF GOD.

   Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
   glory of God.--1 Cor. x. 31.

   THESE words are a general conclusion inferred from a particular case,
   which the apostle had been discoursing of before; and that we may the
   better understand the meaning of this general rule, it will not be
   amiss to look back a little upon the particular case the apostle was
   speaking of; and that was concerning "the partaking of things offered
   to idols," and that in two cases; either by partaking of the
   idol-feasts in their temples, after the sacrifices; or by partaking of
   things offered to idols, whether they were brought by Christians in the
   market, or set before them at a private entertainment, to which by some
   heathens they were invited.

   The first he condemns as absolutely unlawful: the other not as unlawful
   in itself, but in some circumstances upon the account of scandal.

   The first case he speaks of from ver. 14, to 23. "Wherefore, my beloved
   brethren, flee from idolatry. I speak to wise men: judge ye what I
   say." As if he had said, You may easily apprehend what it is I am going
   to caution you against. And first he tells them in general, that they
   who communicated in the worship of any deity, or in any kind of
   sacrifice offered to him, did, in so doing, own and acknowledge that
   for a deity. To this purpose he instanceth in communicating in the
   Christian sacrament, and in the Jewish sacrifices, (ver. 16-18.) "The
   cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of
   Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body
   of Christ? For we being many are one bread and one body: for we are all
   partakers of that one bread. Behold Israel after the flesh: (that is,
   the Jews) are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the
   altar?" Thus it is in the Christian and the Jewish worship. And the
   case is the same, if any man partake of the idol-feasts in their
   temples. This he does not express, but takes it for granted they
   understood what this discourse aimed at.

   And then he answers an argument, which it seems was made use of by
   some, particularly the gnostics, of whom the apostle speaks, (chap.
   viii.) and that was this. If an idol be nothing, and consequently
   things sacrificed to idols were not to be considered as sacrifices,
   then it was lawful to partake of the idol-feasts, which were celebrated
   in their temples. And that the apostle speaks of these, is plain from
   his discourse against the gnostics, who made use of this argument for
   the lawfulness of communicating at the idol-feasts, (chap. viii. 4.)
   "As concerning, therefore, the eating of things which are offered in
   sacrifice unto idols; we know that an idol is nothing in the world,"
   &c. And (ver. 10.) "if any man see thee which hast knowledge (alluding
   to the very name of gnostics)--if any man see thee which hast knowledge
   sit at meat in an idol temple."

   This then is that partaking of idol-feasts, which the apostle here
   speaks of, which they pretended to be lawful, because an idol is
   nothing. This, says the apostle, I know as well as you, that an idol is
   no real deity, but for all that the devil is really worshipped and
   served by this means: (ver. 20.) "But I say that the things which the
   gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God; and I
   would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. Ye cannot drink
   the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils! ye cannot be partakers of
   the Lord's table, and the table of devils."

   Having declared this way of partaking of things offered to idols to be
   unlawful in itself, and a virtual renouncing of Christianity; then he
   proceeds to the consideration of the other case, of eating of things
   offered to idols out of their temples, which might happen several ways.
   Sometimes, being sold by the priests, they were exposed to sale in the
   market. Sometimes the heathens carried some remainders of the
   sacrifices to their houses, and, inviting the Christians to a feast,
   might set these meats before them; what should Christians do in either
   of these cases?

   First, He determines, in general, that out of the temples it was lawful
   to eat these things, because in so doing they communicated in no act of
   worship with the heathens; it is lawful, he says, in itself; but
   because it might be harmful to others, and give scandal, in such
   circumstances, it became unlawful by accident. (Ver. 23.) "All things
   are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient; all things are
   lawful for me, but all things edify not." Things which are lawful in
   themselves, may in some cases be very dangerous and destructive to
   others, and we should not only consider ourselves, but others also.
   "Let no man seek his own, but every man another's welfare." And then he
   comes to the particular cases. "Whatever is sold in the shambles, that
   eat, asking no question for conscience sake: for the earth is the
   Lord's, and the fulness thereof." We may take these things from God's
   hand, who is the true Lord of them and of all creatures. For this
   reason we may, without scrupulous inquiry, use those meats which are
   publicly exposed to sale.

   And so likewise, in the other case, if we be invited to the table of a
   heathen, we may eat what is set before us, without inquiring whether it
   be part of an idol-sacrifice. But if any man tells us, that this meat
   was offered in sacrifice to idols, in that case we ought to abstain
   from eating of it, "for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience
   sake;" that is, out of regard to the opinion of those who think these
   meats unlawful: "for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof."
   Also, in another sense, God hath made such abundant provision for us,
   that we may abstain from this or that meat without any great
   inconvenience. "Conscience, I say, not thine own but another's." He had
   said before, we should "eat of what was set before us, asking no
   question for conscience sake;" that is, not making it a matter of
   conscience to ourselves: now, he says, if we be told it was offered to
   an idol, we should "not eat for conscience sake;" that is, not as
   making a matter of conscience of it to ourselves, but out of regard to
   the conscience of another, to whom it might be a scandal. "For why is
   my liberty judged of another man's conscience? and if I with
   thanksgiving be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which
   I give thanks?" that is, why should another man's conscience be a
   prejudice to my liberty? If another makes conscience of it as unlawful,
   why should his conscience govern mine, and make me think so too; or why
   should I be evil spoken of, for thinking it lawful to eat any thing set
   before me, for which I give thanks? This is a little obscure; but the
   plain meaning of the apostle's reasoning seems to be this:--though I
   have that regard to another man's weak conscience, as to abstain from
   eating what he thinks unlawful; yet am I not therefore bound to be of
   his opinion, and think it unlawful in itself; I will consider his
   weakness so far as to forbear that which I am persuaded is lawful to
   do, but yet I will still preserve the liberty of my own judgment; and
   as I am content to give no scandal to him, so I expect that he should
   not censure and condemn me for thinking that lawful, which he believes
   not to be so: and then, from all this discourse, the apostle
   established! this general rule in the text; "Wherefore, whether ye eat,
   or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God." To which is
   parallel that other text, (1 Pet. iv. 11.) "That God in all things may
   be glorified." So that this general rule lays a duty upon all
   Christians of designing the glory of God in all their actions; all the
   difficulty is, what is here meant by this, of doing all things "to the
   glory of God." The Jews have a common saying, which seems to be
   parallel with this phrase of the apostle, "That all things should be
   done in the name of God." And this they make so essential to every good
   action, that it was a received principle among them, that he who obeys
   any command of God, and not in his name, shall receive no reward. Now,
   that to do things "in the name of God," and to do them "to his glory,"
   are but several phrases signifying the same thing, is evident from that
   precept of the apostle, (Col. iii. 17.) "And whatsoever ye do in word,
   or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ;" that is, to
   his glory. Now for our clear understanding of the sense of this phrase
   of glorifying God, or doing things to God's glory; we will consider the
   various use of it in Scripture, and so descend to the proper and
   particular sense of it here in the text.

   The glory of God is nothing else but the honour which is given to him
   by his creatures; and consequently, the general notion of glorifying
   God, or doing any thing to his glory, is to design to honour God by
   such and such actions: and this phrase is in Scripture more especially
   applied to these following particulars:

   I. We are said in Scripture to glorify God by a solemn acknowledgment
   of him and his perfections, of his goodness and mercy, of his power and
   wisdom, of his truth and faithfulness, of his sovereign dominion and
   authority over us. Hence it is that all solemn actions of religion are
   called the worship of God, which is given to him by his creatures,
   signified by some outward expression of reverence and respect. Thus we
   are said to worship God, when we fall down before him, and pray to him
   for mercy and blessings, or praise him for favours and benefits
   received from him, or perform any other solemn act of religion: (Psal.
   lxxxvi. 9.) "All nations whom thou hast made, shall come and worship
   before thee, O Lord, and shall glorify thy name."

   But, especially, the duty of praise and thanks giving is most
   frequently in Scripture called glorifying of God, or giving glory to
   him. (Psal. lxxxvi. 12.) "I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all
   my heart, and will glorify thy name." (Matt. v. 16.) "Let your light so
   shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
   Father which is in heaven;" that is, praise him upon that account.
   (Luke v. 25.) It is said of the man sick of the palsy, that when he was
   healed, "He departed to his own house glorifying God;" that is,
   praising God for his great mercy to him. And (Luke xvii. 18.) our
   Saviour, speaking of the ten lepers that were healed, says, that "but
   one of them returned to give glory to God;" that is, to return thanks
   to God for his recovery.

   II. Men are said in Scripture to give glory to God by the
   acknowledgment of their sins, and repentance of them. (Josh. vii. 19.)
   "And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give glory to the Lord God of
   Israel, and make confession to him." In like manner, the prophet
   Jeremiah, exhorting the people to repentance, useth this expression:
   (Jer. xiii. 16.) "Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause
   darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains." And
   (Rev. xvi. 9.) it is said, that those upon whom great plagues fell,
   "repented not to give God glory." We glorify God by confession of our
   sins and repentance, because in so doing we acknowledge his authority,
   and the holiness of those righteous laws which we have broken.

   III. We are said, likewise, in Scripture to glorify God by our holiness
   and obedience. Thus we are commanded to glorify God by the chastity of
   our bodies, and the purity of our minds: (1 Cor. vi. 20.) "Glorify God
   in your body, and in your spirit, which are his." Thus our Saviour is
   said to have glorified God in the world, by his perfect obedience to
   his will: (John xvii. 4.) "Father, I have glorified thee upon earth."
   And thus he tells us we may glorify God, by the fruits of holiness and
   obedience in our lives: (John xv. 8.) "Herein is my Father glorified,
   if ye bring forth much fruit." So likewise St. Paul prays for the
   Philippians, that they may be "filled with the fruits of righteousness,
   which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God."

   IV. We are said likewise, in an especial manner, to glorify God by our
   sufferings for his cause and truth. (John xxi. 19.) Our Saviour
   foretelling St. Peter's martyrdom, expresseth it by this phrase of
   glorifying God by his death; "This spake he, signifying by what death
   he should glorify God."

   V. And lastly, And because religion is the solemn honour, and public
   owning and acknowledgment of the Deity; hence it is, that in Scripture
   we are said to glorify God in a peculiar and eminent manner, when in
   all our actions we consult the honour and advantage of religion. Upon
   this account, St. Peter exhorts the ministers of the gospel so to
   preach to the people, and so to perform the public offices of religion,
   as may be for the honour of religion; and this he calls glorifying of
   God: (1 Pet. iv. 11.) "If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles
   of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God
   giveth; that God in all things may be glorified." And because the peace
   and unity of Christians is so very much for the honour and advantage of
   religion, therefore we are said, in an especial manner, to glorify God,
   by maintaining the peace and unity of the church: (Rom. xv. 5, 6.) "Now
   the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one
   toward another, that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God,
   even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." And here in the text, we are
   said to "do all things to the glory of God," when in all our actions we
   have a regard to the promoting and advancing of religion, and the
   edification of Christians. For here, by eating and drinking" to the
   glory of God," the apostle plainly means, that when things offered to
   idols are set before us, we should refrain from them, when, by our
   eating, the interest of religion, and the edification of Christians,
   may receive any prejudice; that is, when our eating may be a scandal to
   others, that is, a stumbling-block, or an occasion of falling into sin.
   And that this is the apostle's meaning is evident from ver. 23. "All
   things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient; (ou panta
   sumpherei, all things profit not;) all things are lawful for me, but
   all things edify not;" that is, though I know it is a thing very lawful
   in itself, to eat things which have been offered to idols, if they be
   bought in the market, or accidentally set before me at a feast; yet, in
   some circumstances, it may not be for the advantage of religion, and be
   so far from edifying, that it may be an occasion of sin to them. For
   instance, I am invited to a feast, where things offered to idols are
   set before me, and one says, This was offered in sacrifice unto idols;
   a sufficient intimation to me that he thinks it unlawful; and therefore
   I will forbear, because of the inconvenience to religion, and the
   manifold scandal that might follow upon it, by hindering others from
   embracing religion; or by tempting weak Christians, either to the doing
   of a thing against their conscience, or to apostatize from religion. In
   this case, he that ab stains from these meats, and contents himself
   with others, eats "to the glory of God."

   And, that this is the true notion of scandal or offence, not barely to
   grieve others, or do things displeasing to them, but to do such things
   as are really hurtful to others, and may be a prejudice or hinderance
   to their salvation, and an occasion of their falling into sin: I say,
   that this is the true and proper notion of scandal is evident from what
   follows immediately after the text; "Give none offence, to the Jews,
   nor to the gentiles, nor to the church of God; as I please all men in
   all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that
   they may be saved." "Give no offence to the Jews, nor to the gentiles,
   nor to the church of God f the apostle intimates, that such an action
   as this we are speaking of, might be an occasion of sin to all these,
   and a hinderance of their salvation: it might hinder the Jew from
   turning Christian, and harden him in his infidelity; for he might say,
   See how well you Christians worship one God, when you can partake of
   things offered to idols: it might confirm the heathen in his
   superstition, and keep him from embracing Christianity; for he might
   say, surely, Why should the Christians persuade me to forsake the
   worship of idols, when they themselves will knowingly eat things
   offered to them? It might tempt the weak Christians either to sin
   against their consciences by following my example, or to apostatize
   from Christianity upon this offence taken against it; therefore, says
   the apostle, "do all things to the glory of God;" that is, for the
   honour and advantage of the Christian religion, and the furtherance of
   men's salvation: for so, says he, I do, in these and all other actions
   of my life; I study the advantage of all men, in all things, not
   regarding mine own convenience in comparison of the eternal salvation
   of others.

   And thus I have as briefly and clearly as I could explained this phrase
   to you, of doing things "to the glory of God."

   The result of all is, that we glorify God by doing our duty, by all
   actions of worship and obedience to God, and by our repentance in case
   of sin and disobedience, by doing and by suffering the will of God,
   more especially by using our Christian liberty, as to things lawful in
   themselves, so as may make most for the honour and advantage of
   religion, for the unity and edification of the church, and the
   salvation of the souls of men, which is the proper notion here in the
   text of eating and drinking, and doing whatever we do, "to the glory of
   God."

   From all this discourse it will be evident, that three things must
   concur, that our actions may be said to be done "to the glory of God."

   1. Our actions must be materially good; we must do what God commands,
   and abstain from doing what he hath forbidden. Sin is in its nature a
   dishonour to God, a contradiction to his nature, and a contempt of his
   authority and laws; so that we cannot glorify God by transgressing our
   duty.

   2. Our actions must not only be good, but they must be done with regard
   to God, and out of conscience to our duty to him, and in hopes of the
   reward which he hath promised, and not for any low, and mean, and
   temporal end. The best action in itself may be spoiled, and all the
   virtue of it blasted, by being done for a wrong end. If we serve God to
   please men, and be charitable out of vain glory "to be seen of men;" if
   we profess godliness for gain, and are religious only to serve our
   temporal interest, though the actions we do be never so good, yet all
   the virtue and reward of them is lost, by the mean end and design which
   we aim at in the doing of them; because all this while we have no love
   or regard for God, and the authority of his laws; we make no conscience
   of our duty to him, we are not moved by the rewards of another world,
   which may lawfully work upon us, and prevail with us, but we are swayed
   by little temporal advantages, which if we could obtain as well by
   doing the contrary, we would as soon, nay, perhaps, much sooner, do it.

   And this is so essentially necessary, that no action, though never so
   good, that is not done with regard to God, and upon some of the proper
   motives and considerations of religion, such as are the authority of
   God, conscience of our duty to him, love of him, faith in his promises,
   fear of his displeasure; I say, no action that is not done upon all, or
   some of these motives, can be said to be done "to the glory of God."
   And this is the meaning of that saying among the Jews which I mentioned
   before, "That he who obeys any command of God, but not in his name,
   shall receive no reward." Moral actions receive their denomination of
   good or evil, as well from the end, as from the matter of them; and as
   the best end cannot sanctify an action bad in itself, so a bad end and
   design is enough to spoil the best action we can do; and as it is great
   impiety to do a wicked thing, though for a religious end, so it is
   great hypocrisy to be religious for mean and temporal ends.

   3. That all our actions may be done "to the glory of God," we must not
   only take care that they be lawful in themselves, but that they be not
   spoiled and vitiated by any bad circumstance; for circumstances alter
   moral actions, and may render that which is lawful in itself, unlawful
   in some cases: so that if we would "do all things to the glory of God,"
   we must in some cases refrain from doing that which is lawful in
   itself. As, when such an action that I am about to do, may .through the
   prejudice or mistake of men probably redound to the dishonour and
   disadvantage of religion, by causing factions and divisions, by
   hindering some from embracing the true religion, or making others
   apostatize from it, or by being any other way an occasion to men of
   falling into sin, or any impediment to their salvation; in these and
   the like cases, we are bound to have that consideration of religion,
   that regard to the peace and unity of the church, that tenderness and
   charity for the souls of men, as to deny ourselves the use of things
   otherwise lawful; and if we do not do it, we offend against a great
   rule both of piety and charity.

   I shall only farther at present endeavour to give a brief resolution to
   two questions, much debated upon occasion of this rule of the apostle,
   of doing "all things to the glory of God."

   First, How far we are bound actually to intend and design the glory of
   God in every particular action of our lives. To this I answer,

   1. That it is morally impossible that a man should do every particular
   action with actual and explicit thoughts and intentions of glorifying
   God thereby, and therefore there can be no obligation to any such
   thing.

   2. It is not necessary, no more than for a man that takes a journey,
   every step of his way actually to think of his journey's end, and at
   the place whither he intends to go; a constant resolution to go to such
   a place, and a due care not to go out of the way; and in case of any
   doubt, to inform ourselves as well as we can of the right way; and to
   keep in it, is as much consideration of the end of a man's journey, as
   is needful to bring him thither, and more than this would be
   troublesome and to no purpose; the case is the very same in the course
   of a man's life. From whence it follows, in the

   3. Third place, That a habitual and settled intention of mind, to
   glorify God in the course of our lives, is sufficient; because this
   will serve all good purposes, as well as an actual intention upon every
   particular occasion. He that doeth things with regard to God, and out
   of conscience of his duty to him, and upon the proper motives and
   considerations of religion, in obedience and love to God, in hopes of
   his reward, and out of fear of his displeasure, glorifies God in his
   actions. And if this principle be but rooted and settled in his mind,
   it is sufficient to govern his life, and is virtually, and to all
   purposes, as true and constant an intention of glorifying God, as if we
   did actually and explicitly propound this end to ourselves in every
   particular action of our lives.

   Secondly, Whether a man be bound to prefer the glory of God before his
   own eternal happiness, as Moses and St. Paul seem to have done; the one
   in being content to have his name blotted out of the book of life, the
   other to be anathema from Christ, for the salvation of Israel? To this
   I answer,

   If we could admit the supposition, that the glory of God and a man's
   eternal happiness might come in competition, there could be no
   obligation upon a man to choose eternal misery upon any consideration
   whatsoever. The preference of one thing before another, supposeth them
   both to be objects of our choice; but the greatest evil known and
   apprehended to be so, cannot be the object of a reasonable choice;
   neither the greatest moral nor natural evil of sin, or misery. Sin is
   not to be chosen in any case, no, not for the glory of God. The apostle
   makes the supposition, and answers it; that if the truth and glory of
   God could be promoted by his lie, yet we are "not to do evil that good
   may come," (Rom. iii. 7, 8.)

   Nor is the greatest natural evil the object of our choice. God himself
   hath planted a principle in our nature to the contrary, to seek our own
   happiness, and to avoid utter ruin and destruction; and then surely
   much more that which is much worse, as eternal misery is, whatever some
   learned men, in despite of nature and common sense, have asserted to
   the contrary, that it is better and more desirable to be extremely and
   eternally miserable, than not to be; for what is there desirable in
   being, when it serves to no other purpose but to be the foundation of
   endless and intolerable misery? And if this be a principle of our
   nature, can any man imagine that God should frame us so, as to make the
   first and fundamental principle of it directly opposite to our duty?

   As to the instance of Moses, it does not reach this case; because the
   phrase of "blotting out of the book of life," does in all probability
   signify no more than a temporal death. As to that of St. Paul, it is by
   no means to be taken in a strict sense, but as a vehement and
   hyperbolical expression of his mighty affection to his brethren
   according to the flesh, "For whom (says he) I could wish to be an
   anathema from Christ." Besides the reason of the thing, the form of the
   expression shews the meaning of it, "I could wish;" that is, I would be
   content to do or suffer almost any thing for their salvation; insomuch,
   that I could wish, if it were fit, and lawful, and reasonable, to make
   such a wish, to be accursed from Christ for their sakes. It is plainly
   a suspended form of speech, which declares nothing absolutely. But,

   2. It is a vain and senseless supposition, that the glory of God and
   our eternal happiness can stand in competition. By seeking the glory of
   God, we naturally and directly promote our own happiness; the glory of
   God and our happiness are inseparably linked together; we cannot
   glorify God by sin; and so gracious hath God been to us, that he hath
   made those things to be our duty which naturally tend to our felicity;
   and we cannot glorify God more than by doing our duty, nor can we
   promote our own happiness more effectually than by the same way. From
   whence it plainly follows, that the glory of God and our happiness
   cannot reason ably be supposed to cross and contradict one another; and
   therefore the question is frivolous, which supposeth they may come in
   competition. (1 Cor. xv. 58.) The apostle exhorts Christians to be
   "steadfast, and unmoveable, and abundant in the work of the Lord,
   knowing that their labour shall not be in vain in the Lord." And (Tit.
   i. 1, 2.) the apostle calls himself "a servant of Jesus Christ, in hope
   of eternal life, which God that cannot lie hath promised." To serve God
   in hope of eternal life, is to glorify God; and therefore the glory of
   God and our eternal happiness are never to be opposed.

   I shall briefly draw two or three inferences from this discourse, and
   so conclude.

   I. See here the great goodness of God to man kind, who is pleased to
   esteem whatever is for the good of men, to be for the glory of God; and
   whatever tends to the eternal salvation of ourselves or others, to be a
   glorifying of himself.

   II. We learn hence, likewise, the excellency of the Christian religion,
   which requires, not only a conscientious care of ourselves to do
   nothing but what is lawful, but likewise a charitable regard to others
   in the use of our liberty; in the doing or not doing of those things
   which we may lawfully do; after the securing of our own happiness by
   doing our duty, we are to consult the edification and salvation of
   others, in the charitable use of our liberty in those things which God
   hath left indifferent.

   III. Here is a great argument to us to be very careful of our duty, and
   to abound in the fruits of holiness, because hereby we glorify God.
   "Herein is my Father glorified, (says our Saviour) if ye bring forth
   much fruit; and the apostle tells us, that "the fruits of righteousness
   are to the praise and glory of God." We having all from God, our very
   being, our souls and bodies, and the powers and faculties of both,
   therefore we should give him the glory of his own gifts; our souls and
   bodies were not only made by him at first, but are like wise redeemed
   by him, and bought with a price, and therefore, as the apostle argues,
   "we should glorify him in our bodies, and in our souls, which are his."

   IV. And lastly, We should in all our actions have a particular regard
   to the honour and advantage of religion, the edification of our
   brethren, and the peace and unity of the church; because, in these
   things, we do in a peculiar manner glorify God. In vain do men pretend
   to seek the glory of God by faction and division, which do in their own
   nature so immediately tend to the dishonour and damage of religion.
   Next to the wicked lives of men, nothing is so great a disparagement
   and weakening to religion, as the divisions of Christians; and
   therefore, instead of employing our zeal about differences, we should
   be zealous for peace and unity, "that with one mind, and one mouth, we
   may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."

SERMON CCX.

  DOING GOOD, A SECURITY AGAINST INJURIES FROM MEN.

   And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is
   good?--1 Pet. iii. 13.

   THE apostle, in this and the former chapter, earnestly presseth
   Christians to a holy and unblameable conversation, that the heathen
   might have no occasion, from the ill lives of Christians, to reproach
   Christianity; particularly, he cautions them against that abuse of
   Christian liberty, which it seems too many were guilty of, casting off
   obedience to their superiors under that pretence; telling them, that no
   thing could be a greater scandal to their religion, nor raise a more
   just prejudice in the minds of men against it: and therefore he
   strictly chargeth them with the duty of obedience in their several
   relations, as of subjects to their governors, of servants to their
   masters, of wives to their husbands; and, in short, to practise all
   those virtues, both among themselves and towards others, which are apt
   to reconcile and gain the affections of men to them; to be charitable
   and compassionate, courteous and peaceable, one towards another, and
   towards all men: not only to abstain from injury and provocation, but
   from revenge by word or deed; and instead thereof to bless and do good,
   and by all possible means to preserve and pursue peace. (Ver. 8, 9.)
   "Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love
   as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous, not rendering evil for evil, or
   railing for railing, but, contrariwise, blessing; knowing that ye are
   there unto called, that ye should inherit a blessing."

   And to encourage them to the practice of these virtues, he tells them,
   that they could by no other means more effectually consult the safety
   and comfort of their lives: (ver. 10.) "For he that will love life, and
   see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that
   they speak no guile; let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek
   peace, and ensue it."

   And this was the way to gain the favour of God, and engage his
   providence for our protection: (ver. 12.) "For the eyes of the Lord are
   over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers; but the
   face of the Lord is against them that do evil."

   And that this would also be the best way to reconcile men to us, and to
   gain their good-will, and to prevent injuries and affronts from them:
   (ver. 13.) "And who is he that will harm you," &c.

   In these words we have, first, a qualification supposed, "If ye be
   followers of that which is good."

   Secondly, The benefit and advantage we may reasonably expect from it:
   viz. security from the ill usage and injuries of men. "Who is he that
   will harm you?"

   First, The qualification supposed is, that we be "followers of that
   which is good." But what is that? The apostle takes it for granted,
   that every body knows it, and he had given instances of it before. He
   does not go about to define or explain it, but appeals to every man's
   mind and conscience, to tell him what it is. It is not any thing that
   is disputed and controverted, which some men call good, and others
   evil; but that which all are agreed in, and which is universally
   approved and commended by heathens as well as Christians, that which is
   substantially good, and that which is unquestionably so. It is not zeal
   for lesser things, about the ritual and ceremonial part of religion,
   and a great strictness about the external parts of it, and much nicety
   and scrupulousness about things of no moment, as the pharisees tithing
   of mint, &c. about meats and drinks, and the observation of days, and
   the like; but a pursuit of the weightier things of the law, a care of
   the great duties of religion, mercy, and justice, and fidelity; those
   things wherein the kingdom of God consists, righteousness and peace:
   such as these the apostle had instanced in, as substantial and
   unquestionable parts of goodness, things which admit of no dispute, but
   do approve themselves to the reason and conscience of all mankind; and
   the practice of these he calls following of that which is good. [1]

   "Be ye followers of that which is good;" the word is mimetai`, "if ye
   imitate the good you see in others;" in one copy the word is zelotai,
   "if ye be zealous of that which is good;" and this is not amiss. Zeal
   about lesser and disputable things is very unsuitable and misbecoming;
   but we cannot be too earnest and zealous in the pursuit of things which
   are substantially and unquestionably good; it is good, and will become
   us to be zealously affected about such things. Some things will not
   bear much zeal, and the more earnest we are about them, the less we
   recommend ourselves to the approbation of sober and considerate men.
   Great zeal about little and doubtful things, is an argument of a weak
   mind, infatuated by superstition, or overheated by enthusiasm; but
   nothing more becomes a wise man, than the serious and earnest pursuit
   of those things which are agreed on all hands to be good, and have an
   universal approbation among all parties and professions of men, how
   wide soever their differences may be in other matters. This, for the
   qualification supposed, "if ye be followers of that which is good." I
   proceed to the

   Second thing in the text, The benefit and advantage which may
   reasonably be expected from it; and that is, security from the ill
   usage and injuries of men: "Who is he that will harm you," &c. The
   apostle doth not absolutely say, none will do it; but he speaks of it
   as a thing so very unreasonable, and upon all accounts so unlikely and
   improbable, that we may reasonably presume that it will not ordinarily
   and often happen. Not but that good men are liable to be affronted and
   persecuted, and no man's virtues, how bright and unblemished so ever,
   will at all times, and in all cases, exempt him from all manner of
   injury and ill treatment; but the following of that which is good (as I
   have explained it), doth in its own nature tend to secure us from the
   malice and mischief of men, and very frequently does it, and, all
   things considered, is a much more effectual means to this end, than any
   other course we can take; and this the apostle means when he says, "Who
   is he that will harm you?"

   And this will appear, whether we consider the nature of virtue and
   goodness; or the nature of man, even when it is very much depraved and
   corrupted; or the providence of God.

   I. If we consider the nature of virtue and goodness, which is apt to
   gain upon the affections of men, and secretly to win their love and
   esteem. True goodness is inwardly esteemed by bad men, and many times
   had in very great esteem and admiration, even by those who are very far
   from the practice of it; it carries an awe and majesty with it; so that
   bad men are very often withheld and restrained from harming the good,
   by that secret and inward reverence which they bear to goodness.

   There are several virtues which are apt in their own nature to prevent
   injuries and affronts from others. Humility takes away all occasion of
   insolence from the proud and haughty, it baffles pride, and puts it out
   of countenance. Meekness pacifies wrath, and blunts the edge of injury
   and violence. Suffering good for evil is apt to allay and extinguish
   enmity, to subdue the roughest dispositions, and to conquer even malice
   itself. And there are other virtues which are apt in their own nature
   to oblige men, and gain their good-will, and make them our friends, and
   to tie their affections strongly to us; as courtesy and charity,
   kindness and compassion, and a readiness to do all good offices to all
   men; and the friendship and good-will of others, is a powerful defence
   against injuries. Every man will cry shame of those who shall fall foul
   upon him that hurts nobody. He that obliged many, shall have many to
   take his part when he is assaulted, to rise up in his defence and
   rescue, and to interpose between him and danger. "For a good man (says
   the apostle) some would even dare to die."

   Besides, it is very considerable, that none of these virtues expose men
   to any danger and trouble from human laws. When Christianity was
   persecuted, because it differed from, and opposed the received religion
   and superstition of the world, it was commonly acknowledged by the
   heathen (as Tertullian tells us), that the Christians were very good
   men in all other things, saving that they were Christians. When the
   laws were most severe against Christians for their meetings, which they
   called seditious, and for their refusal to comply with the received
   superstition of the world, which they called contempt of the gods, yet
   there were all this while no laws made against modesty, and humility,
   and meekness, and kindness, and charity, and peaceableness, and
   forgiveness of injuries. These virtues are in their nature of so
   unalterable goodness, that they could not possibly be made matter of
   accusation; no government ever had the face to make laws against them.
   And this the apostle takes notice of as a singular commendation, and
   great testimony to the immutable goodness of these things, that, in the
   experience of all ages and nations, there was never any such in
   convenience found in any of them, as to give occasion to a law against
   them: (Gal. v. 22, 23.) "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
   peace, long-suffering, gentleness, fidelity, meekness, temperance.
   Against such things there is no law." So that goodness from its own
   nature hath this security, that it brings men under the danger of no
   law.

   II. If we consider the nature of man, even when it is very much
   depraved and corrupted. There is something that is apt to restrain bad
   men from injuring those that are remarkably good; a reverence for
   goodness and the inward convictions of their own mind, that those whom
   they are going about to injure, are better and more righteous than
   themselves; the fear of God, and of bringing down his vengeance upon
   their heads, by their ill treatment of his friends and followers; and
   many times the fear of men, who, though they be not good themselves,
   yet have an esteem for those that are so, and cannot endure to see them
   wronged and oppressed, especially if they have been obliged by them,
   and have found the real effects of their goodness in good offices done
   by them to themselves.

   Besides that, bad men are seldom bad for nought, without any cause
   given, without any manner of temptation and provocation to be so. Who
   will hurt a harmless man, and injure the innocent? For what cause, or
   for what end, should he do it? He must love mischief for itself, that
   will do it to those who never offered him any occasion and provocation.

   III. If we consider the providence of God, which is particularly
   concerned for the protection of innocency and goodness. "For the
   righteous Lord loveth righteousness, and his countenance will be hold
   the upright." This the apostle takes notice of, in the verse before the
   text, as the great security of good men against violence and injury:
   "The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to
   their prayer." So that if bad men were never so ill disposed toward the
   good, and bent to do them all the injury and mischief they could
   devise, the providence of God hath a thousand ways to prevent it; and
   if he pleases to interpose between them and danger, who can harm them
   if they would? He can snare the wicked in the works of their own hands,
   and make the mischief which they devised against good men, to return
   upon their own heads; he can weaken their hands and infatuate their
   counsels, so that they shall not be able to bring their wicked
   enterprises to pass; he can change their hearts, and turn the
   fierceness and rage of men against us, into a fit of love and kindness,
   as he did the heart of Esau towards his brother Jacob; and their
   bitterest enmity against truth and goodness, into a mighty zeal for it,
   as he did in St. Paul, who, when he came to Damascus, fell a preaching
   up that way, which he came thither on purpose to persecute. And this
   God hath promised to do for good men who are careful to please him.
   "When a man's ways please the Lord, he will make his enemies to be at
   peace with him."

   So that, considering the nature of goodness, and the nature of man, and
   the providence of God, who is like to harm us, "if we be followers of
   that which is good?" None can reasonably do it, and he must be a very
   bad man that can find in his heart to do it, when there is no cause, no
   temptation, or provocation to it; and the providence of God, who hath
   the hearts of men in his hands, and can sway and incline them as he
   pleaseth, is particularly concerned to preserve good men from harm and
   mischief.

   And yet we are not to understand this saying of the apostle, as
   declaring to us the constant and certain event of things, without any
   exception to the contrary. For good men to appearance, nay those that
   are really so, and the very best of men, are sometimes exposed to great
   injuries and sufferings; of which I shall give you an account in these
   following particulars:

   I. Some that seem to be good, are not sincerely so; and when they, by
   the just judgment of God, are punished for their hypocrisy, in the
   opinion of many, goodness seems to suffer. Some, under a great
   profession and colour of religion, have done very bad things, and when
   they justly suffer for great crimes, they call punishment persecution,
   and the party and church which they are of call them saints and
   martyrs.

   II. Some that are really good, are very imperfectly so, have many flaws
   and defects, which do very much blemish and obscure their goodness;
   they are "followers of that which is good," but they have an equal zeal
   for things which have no goodness in them, or so little that it is not
   worth all that stir and bustle which they make about them; and will
   contend as earnestly for a doubtful, and it may be for a false opinion,
   as for the articles of the creed, and for "the faith which was once
   delivered to the saints;" and will oppose a little ceremony with as
   much heat as the greatest immorality. In these cases, it is not men's
   goodness which raiseth enmity against them, but their imprudent zeal,
   and other infirmities which attend it: but, however, bad men are glad
   to lay hold of these occasions and pretences of enmity, which their
   indiscretion offers. Good men may be, and frequently are, mistaken in
   their opinions and apprehensions of things; but it is a great mistake
   to have an equal zeal for little and doubtful things, as for the great
   and indispensable duties of the Christian life, and yet many times so
   as to neglect those to a great degree; and men must blame themselves
   for the inconveniences that happen to them for their own indiscretion;
   for neither will the nature of the thing bear them out alike, nor will
   the providence of God be equally concerned to protect men in the
   following of that which they, through a gross mistake and a heady
   conceit of their own knowledge in religion, think to be good, as in the
   following of that which is really and unquestionably good.

   III. The enmity of some men against goodness is so violent and
   implacable, that no innocency, no excellency of goodness, how great
   soever, can restrain their malice towards good men, or hinder the
   effects of it, when it comes in their way, and they have power to do
   them mischief. Against these the providence of God is our best
   safeguard, and it is wisdom, as much as is possible, to keep out of
   their way, and to pray with St. Paul, that we may be "delivered from
   wicked and unreasonable men." Men of so absurd a malice against
   goodness, that it is not to be prevented by any innocency or prudence;
   and so implacable, that there is no way to gain and reconcile them,
   nor, perhaps, is it much desirable: their good word would be no credit
   to us, and their friendship would be pernicious, when it cannot be had
   upon other terms than of conniving at their faults, and being concerned
   in their quarrels, and at last quarrelling and breaking with them,
   unless we will "run with them to the same excess of riot." The
   friendship of such men is more terrible than their enmity, and their
   malice much less to be dreaded than their kindness,

   IV. The last and chief exception is that of the cross, when the
   sufferings and persecutions of good men are necessary for the great
   ends of God's glory, for the advancement of religion, and the example
   and salvation of others. And with this exception, all the declarations
   of Scripture concerning the temporal prosperity and safety of good men,
   and all the promises of the New Testament, are to be understood. And
   this exception our Saviour him self expressly makes: (Mark x. 29, 30.)
   "Verily, I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or
   brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or
   lands, for my sake and the gospel's, but he shall receive a
   hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and
   mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world
   to come eternal life;" that is, so far as a state of persecution would
   admit, all these losses should be recompensed to them in this present
   time; as they were to the apostles in a remarkable manner: when they
   who had but little to part with for the gospel, had the estates of
   Christians laid at their feet and committed to their disposal, for the
   noblest purposes of charity, and common support of Christians, which
   was as much to them as if they had been masters of the greatest
   estates; and whatever was wanting to any of them in the accomplishment
   of this promise, was abundantly made up to them in the unspeakable and
   eternal happiness of the world to come. And this exception the apostle
   St. Peter is careful to mention expressly, immediately after the text;
   for after he had said, "Who is he that will harm you, if ye be
   followers of that which is good?" he immediately adds, "But, and if ye
   suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye; and be not afraid of their
   terror, neither be troubled, but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts;"
   that is, in this case, fear God more than men; "and be ready always to
   give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that
   is in you;" that is, if ye be questioned for being Christians, be ready
   to own your profession, and to give a reason of it: so that the apostle
   supposeth, that, notwithstanding what he had said, that ordinarily it
   is not in the nature of men to persecute men for true goodness, yet
   they must not expect to be exempted from, persecution, which was
   necessary for the establishment of the Christian religion.

   In these cases, God permits the devil to instigate and exasperate evil
   men against those that are good, to act beyond their usual temper. Thus
   God, when he designed an illustrious example of patience for all ages
   of the world, he lets loose the devil, not only to stir up his
   instruments the Chaldeans and Sabeans against Job, but to afflict him
   immediately himself with bodily pains and diseases. In these and the
   like cases, the best men are exposed to the greatest sufferings. Thus
   God permitted Socrates, that great light among the gentiles, and the
   glory of philosophy, to be cruelly treated and put to death for an
   example of virtue, and a testimony against their impious and abominable
   idolatry. And thus, likewise, when it was necessary for the common
   salvation of men, and to give the world an example beyond all exception
   of the greatest innocency, en during the greatest indignities and
   sufferings with the greatest patience, that one should suffer for all
   mankind, he permitted the best man that ever was, God and goodness
   incarnate, "by wicked hands to be crucified and slain;" and afterwards,
   when it was necessary for the propagation and establishment of
   Christianity in the world, that the truth of it should be sealed by the
   death of so many martyrs, God was pleased to suffer the rage of bad men
   to break out into all manner of violence and cruelty.

   But yet, notwithstanding these exceptions, those who make it their
   business to do good, and to excel in those virtues which are apt to win
   and oblige mankind, may, in ordinary cases and times, expect great
   safety and protection against the injuries of the world, from an
   exemplary piety, and innocency, and goodness; for these sayings in the
   New Testament, that "through many tribulations we must enter into the
   kingdom of God," and that "who ever will live godly in Christ Jesus
   must suffer persecution," are not equally to be extended to all places
   and times; but more peculiarly to be under stood of the first times of
   Christianity, when the providence of God thought fit to establish the
   Christian religion upon the innocent lives and patient sufferings of
   the first professors of it.

   The result from all this discourse is, that we should not be weary of
   well-doing; but mind and follow the things which are substantially and
   unquestionably good; not doubting but, besides the infinite reward of
   it in the other world, it will ordinarily turn to our great security
   and advantage in this life, and save us harmless from a great many
   mischiefs and inconveniences which others are exposed to. If we
   endeavour to excel in those Christian virtues which the apostle
   mentions before the text, and which he means by our being "followers of
   that which is good;" we shall undoubtedly find the comfort of it, in
   those temporal benefits that will redound to us: for the Scripture hath
   not said in vain, "Trust in the Lord and do good, so shalt thou dwell
   in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. Blessed are the meek, for
   they shall inherit the earth. Glory, and honour, and peace, to every
   man that worketh good." That "the fruit of righteousness is sown in
   peace of them that work peace;" that, "by well-doing, we shall put to
   silence the ignorance of foolish men;" that "the kingdom of God is not
   meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy, in the Holy
   Ghost;" and that "he that in these things serveth Christ, is accepted
   of God and approved of men."

   But if we mistake religion, and place it in those things wherein it
   doth not really consist, in airy notions and doubtful opinions, in
   superstitions conceits and practices, and in a fiery and furious zeal
   for things of no weight and substance, of no real virtue and goodness;
   if we be defective in the great virtues of meekness and humility, of
   peaceableness and charity, of kindness and courtesy, of forbearance and
   forgiveness, of "rendering good for evil, and overcoming evil with
   good," qualities which will universally endear us and recommend us to
   the favour and protection of God, and to the esteem and good-will of
   men; and if, instead of these, we abound in malice and envy, be proud
   and conceited, censorious and uncharitable, contentious and
   unpeaceable, rude and uncivil, impatient and implacable; we must not
   think it strange if we be ill treated in this world, not for our
   goodness, but for our want of it; and we have no reason to wonder, if,
   at every turn, we meet with the inconveniences of our own heat and
   indiscretion, of our peevish and morose temper, of our factious and
   turbulent disposition. For this is an eternal rule of truth, "As we
   sow, so shall we reap;" every man shall be "filled with his own ways,
   and eat the fruit of his own doings."

SERMON CCXI.

  OF DILIGENCE IN OUR GENERAL AND PARTICULAR CALLING.

    [Preached at Whitehall, 1685.]

   Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might: for there is
   no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither
   thou goest.--Eccl. ix. 10.

   THESE words of the royal preacher are a general exhortation to
   diligence and industry, in that work which is most proper for us to do
   in this world. And I shall consider in them these two things:

   First, The matter of this advice and exhortation; and that is, that we
   would use great diligence about those things which are the proper work
   and employment of this life. "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it
   with thy might."--"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do;" that is, the
   work which is before thee, which is most proper for thee to propose to
   thyself, as the great end and design of thy life, the province and
   charge which is appointed thee. So that these words, in the full
   compass and extent of them, may very well comprehend every reasonable
   purpose and undertaking, whatever is incumbent upon us as a duty, and
   is matter of reasonable choice. "Do it with thy might;" that is, set
   about it with great care, use all possible diligence and industry for
   the effecting and accomplishing of it.

   Secondly, Here is the argument whereby the wise preacher doth enforce
   this counsel and exhortation; because this life is the proper season of
   activity and industry, of designing and doing those things which are in
   order to a future happiness; and when this life is at an end, there
   will be no farther opportunity of working, there will nothing then
   remain, but to reap the fruit, and to receive the just recompence of
   what we have done in this life; "For there is no work, nor device, nor
   knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."--"In the
   grave," this the LXX. render by the word a'des, by which the Greeks
   used to express the state of the dead, the condition of separate souls
   of good or bad men after they are departed this life, and entered into
   another world. In which state, Solomon does not mean that departed
   souls have no knowledge and sense of any thing, but that then there
   will be no place for any counsel and design, for any activity and
   industry, in order to our happiness: what we do to this purpose, we
   must do whilst we are in this world; it will be too late afterwards to
   think of altering or bettering our condition.

   These are the two parts of the text, and they shall be the two heads of
   my following discourse; and God grant that what shall be said upon
   them, may be effectual to persuade every one of us seriously to mind
   our great interest and concernment, and to apply ourselves with all our
   might to that which is our proper work and business in this world.

   First, We will consider the matter of this counsel and exhortation; and
   that is, that we would use great diligence and industry about that
   which is our proper work and business in this life: and this may very
   probably comprehend in it these two things:

   I. Diligence in our great work and business, that which equally
   concerns every man; I mean the business of religion, in order to the
   eternal happiness and salvation of our souls.

   II. Diligence in our particular calling and charge, whatever it be.

   I. Diligence in our great and general work, that which equally concerns
   every man, the business of religion, in order to the eternal happiness
   and salvation of our souls; and this consists in these two things:

   1. In a sincere care and endeavour of universal obedience to God, by
   the conformity of our lives and actions to his laws.

   2. In case of sin and miscarriage, in a sincere repentance for our
   sins, and a timely care to be reconciled to God.

   1. In a sincere care and endeavour of universal obedience to God, by
   the conformity of our lives and actions to his will and law. And this
   is a great work, and requires our greatest care and diligence to
   rectify our minds, to restrain our evil inclinations, to subdue and
   mortify our lusts, to correct the irregularity of our passions, to
   moderate and govern our appetites and affections, and to keep them
   within due and reasonable bounds, "to take heed to our ways, that we
   offend not with our tongue," nor transgress our duty by word or deed;
   to serve God with true devotion of mind, both in public and private; to
   attend upon the duties of his worship, and to perform all acts of piety
   and religion, with care and constancy, in the sincerity and uprightness
   of our hearts; to be meek and humble, peaceable and patient, cheerful
   and contented with our condition; to be ready not only to forgive
   injuries, but to requite them with kindness and good turns; to do all
   offices of humanity and charity to all men, according to our ability
   and opportunity; to instruct the ignorant, and to reduce those that are
   in error to the knowledge of the truth, by wise counsel and good
   example; to endeavour "to turn men from the evil of their ways," and
   "to save their souls from death; to be ready to supply men's outward
   wants and necessities, to comfort them in their sorrows, and to relieve
   them in their affliction and distress.

   And these works of compassion and charity are, perhaps, more
   particularly intended here in the text; for so the Chaldee paraphrase
   interprets these words of Solomon, as a precept of charity, rendering
   them thus, "Do all thou canst, according to thy utmost ability in alms
   and charity:" for nothing but this will turn to our account in another
   world; no other way of laying out our estates will be of any advantage
   to us in the future state. And though I do not think Solomon did here
   intend to exclude any part of religious practice, yet he might very
   well have a more especial eye and regard to this, as one of the
   principal instances and best evidences of a true and sincere piety,
   according to that of St. James, (chap. i. ver. 27.) "Pure religion, and
   undefined before God and the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless
   and widows in their affliction." To be sure, our Saviour lays mighty
   weight upon it, by making it the great article by which men shall be
   tried at the judgment of the great day. And, indeed, no religion is to
   be valued, that wants humanity and compassion; for so far as it departs
   from this, it departs from the true nature of God and religion.

   So that it is a vast work which lies upon our hands, and which every
   one of us, from the highest to the lowest, are engaged in; this
   business of religion, this care of our whole man, and of our whole
   duty, of the inward frame and disposition of our minds, and of all our
   words and actions, "to keep our hearts with all diligence," and
   carefully to observe and govern all the inclinations and motions of our
   souls, and "to order our whole conversation aright;" in a word, to do
   God all the service, and men all the good, that possibly we can, while
   we are in this world. This is the first.

   2. And, because "in many things we offend all, and there is no man that
   sinneth not," another part of our work and care is, in case of
   transgression and miscarriage in any part of our duty, to exercise
   repentance for it, that so we may be reconciled to God, and at peace
   with him.

   And this is absolutely necessary, because our life and happiness depend
   upon it, and "except we repent we must perish," and be miserable for
   ever. It cannot be denied but that this work of repentance is very
   harsh and unpleasant, like the taking of physic, and searching into a
   wound; but because it tends to our health and safety, and is the
   necessary way and means to a better condition, this severity must be
   submitted to, if we desire to be cured, and have a mind to be well; and
   the sooner we make use of this remedy the better, we shall find so much
   the less difficulty and pain in the cure.

   And there is great reason why we should frequently exercise and renew
   our repentance, because our failings are frequent, and in one kind or
   other we offend and provoke God every day: especially when we are
   coming to the holy sacrament, in which we solemnly renew our covenant
   with God, and promise him better obedience for the future; we should
   examine our lives more strictly, and call our sins more particularly to
   remembrance, and exercise a most solemn and deep repentance for them;
   this is the way to keep our accounts in a good measure even. And this
   surely is great wisdom, to provide that we may have no long account to
   make up, no great scores to wipe off, when we come to be overtaken by
   sickness, and to lie upon our death bed; that innumerable
   transgressions unrepented of may not then compass us about, and stare
   us in the face, and fill our souls with fear and confusion, with horror
   and amazement, in a dying hour; that an insupportable load of guilt may
   not then lie upon our minds, and oppress our consciences, when we are
   least able to bear it, and most unfit to deal with it, when we may not
   have time to call our sins particularly to remembrance, and to exercise
   a particular repentance for them, and yet perhaps a general repentance
   may not be sufficient, and available with God, for the pardon and
   forgiveness of them.

   Therefore we should exercise ourselves much in this work of repentance
   in the days of our health, when we are fittest for it, and when it will
   be most acceptable to God, and when the sincerity of it will be most
   evident and comfortable to us, when we may know it to be true by the
   real and certain effects of it, in the change and amendment of our
   lives. Whereas a death-bed repentance is infinitely hazardous, because
   we may not perhaps have time and opportunity for the exercise of it; or
   if we should have that, yet hardly can we have opportunity for the
   trial of it, whether it be sincere or not, and consequently must needs
   die very uncomfortably, and in great doubt and anxiety of mind, what
   will be our fate and doom in another world.

   So that it is a great work which lies upon our hands, and equally
   concerns every one of us. The business of religion, which consists in
   the strict care of our duty to God and man, and in the frequent
   exercise of repentance for the sins and miscarriages of our lives; and
   we may consequently judge, how great a care and diligence a work of so
   much difficulty, and of so great moment and importance, does require
   and call for at our hands. But besides this, we must in the

   II. Second place, likewise, be diligent in our particular calling and
   charge, in that province and station which God hath appointed us,
   whatever it be; whether it consists in the labour of our hands, or in
   the improvement of our minds, in order to the gaining of knowledge for
   our own pleasure and satisfaction, and for the use and benefit of
   others; whether it lie in the skill of government, and the
   administration of public justice; or in the management of a great
   estate, of an honourable rank and quality above others, to the best
   advantage, for the honour of God, and the benefit and advantage of men,
   so as, by the influence of our power and estate, and by the authority
   of our example, to contribute all we can to the welfare and happiness
   of others.

   For it is a great mistake to think that any man is without a calling,
   and that God does not expect that every one of us should employ himself
   in doing good in one kind or other. Some persons indeed, by the
   privilege of their birth and quality, are above a common trade and
   profession, but they are not hereby either exempted or excused from all
   business, and allowed to live unprofitably to others, be cause they are
   so plentifully provided for themselves: nay, on the contrary, they have
   so much the greater obligation, having the liberty and leisure to
   attend the good of others; the higher our character and station is, we
   have the better opportunities of being publicly useful and beneficial;
   and the heavier will our account be, if we neglect these opportunities.
   Those who are in a low and private condition, can only shine to a few,
   but they that are advanced a great height above others, may, like the
   heavenly bodies, dispense a general light and influence, and scatter
   happiness and blessings among all that are below them.

   And as they are capable of doing more good than others, so with more
   ease and effect; that which persons of an inferior rank can hardly
   bring others to, by all the importunity of counsel and persuasion, as,
   namely, to the practice of any virtue, and the quitting and abandoning
   of any vice, a prince and a great man that is good himself may easily
   gain them to, without ever speaking a word to them, by the silent
   authority and powerful allurement of his example. So that though every
   man have not a particular profession, yet the high est among men have
   some employment allotted to them by God, suitable to their condition, a
   province which he expects they should administer and adorn with great
   care.

   The great business of the lower part of mankind is to provide for
   themselves the necessaries of life, and it is well if they can do it
   with all their care and diligence; but those who are of a higher rank,
   their proper business and employment is to dispense good to others;
   which surely is a much happier condition and employment, according to
   that admirable saying of our Saviour, mentioned by St. Paul, "It is a
   more blessed thing to give, than to receive." Those of meaner condition
   can only he men to one another, and it were well if they would be so;
   but he that is highly raised and advanced above others, hath the happy
   opportunity in his hands, if he have but the heart to make use of it,
   to be a kind of god to men.

   Let no man then, of what birth, or rank, or quality soever, think it
   beneath him to serve God, and to be useful to the benefit and advantage
   of men; let us remember the Son of God, a person of the highest quality
   and extraction that ever was, who spent himself wholly in this blessed
   work of doing good, toiled and laboured in it as if it had been for his
   life, submitted to all the circumstances of meanness, to all the
   degrees of contempt, to all kind of hardship and sufferings, for the
   benefit and salvation of men, sweat drops of blood, and at last poured
   it all forth in full streams, to save us from eternal misery and ruin;
   and is any of us better than "the Son of God, the heir of all things,
   and the elder brother of us all?" Shall any of us, after this, think
   ourselves too good to be employed in that work which God himself
   disdained not to do, when he appeared in the likeness and nature of
   man?

   If we would esteem things rightly, and according to reason, the true
   privilege and advantage of greatness is, to be able to do more good
   than others; and in this the majesty and felicity of God himself doth
   chiefly consist, in his ready and forward inclination, and in his
   infinite power and ability, to do good. The creation of the world was a
   great and glorious design, but this God only calls his work; but to
   preserve and support the creatures which he hath made, to bless them
   and to do them good, to govern them by wise laws, and to conduct them
   to that happiness which he designed for them, this is his rest, his
   perpetual sabbath, his great delight and satisfaction to all eternity;
   to do good is our duty and our business, but it is likewise the
   greatest plea sure and recreation, that which refreshed) the heart of
   God and man.

   I have insisted the longer upon this, that those who are thought to be
   above any calling, and to have no obligation upon them, but to please
   themselves, may be made sensible, that, according to their ability and
   opportunity, they have a great work upon their hands, and more business
   to do than other men; which, if they would but seriously mind, they
   would not only please God, but, I dare say, satisfy and please
   themselves much better than they do in any other course. I know it is a
   duty particularly incumbent upon the lower part of man kind, to be
   diligent in their particular calling, that so they may provide for
   themselves and their families; but this is not so proper for this
   place, and if it were, the necessity of human life will probably prompt
   and urge men more powerfully to this, than any argument and persuasion
   that I can use. I proceed therefore, in the

   Second place, To offer some considerations to excite our care and
   diligence in this great work, which God hath given us to do in this
   world, I mean chiefly the business of religion, in order to the eternal
   happiness and salvation of our souls. And to this purpose, I shall
   offer five or six arguments, reserving the great motive and
   consideration in the text to the last, because "there is no work, nor
   device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."

   I. Let us consider the nature of our work, which is such, as may both
   excite and encourage our diligence and care about it. It is indeed a
   service, but such as is our perfect freedom; it is the service of God,
   whom to serve is the greatest honour that man or any other creature is
   capable of; it is obedience, but even obedience, considering our
   ignorance and frailty, is much wiser and safer for us, than a total
   exemption from all law and rule; for the laws which God hath given us,
   are not imposed upon us merely for his will and pleasure, but chiefly
   for our benefit and advantage. So that to obey and please God, is in
   truth nothing else but to do those things which are really best for
   ourselves.

   Besides, that this work of religion will abundantly recompense all the
   labour and pains it can cost, if we consider the fruit and end of it,
   which is "the salvation of our souls;" so St. Paul assures us, (Rom.
   vi. 22.) that if we have "our fruit unto holiness," our end shall be
   everlasting life. Nay, this work cloth not want its present
   encouragement and reward, if we consider the peace and pleasure which
   attends it; "Great peace (saith David) have they which love thy law,
   and nothing shall offend them." Religion doth not design to rob men of
   the true delights of life, of any lawful pleasure and enjoyment; it
   only appoints them their due place, and season, and measure, without
   which they cannot be truly tasteful and pleasant: if we make pleasure
   and recreation our business, it will become a burden, and leave a sting
   behind it; but if we make it our great business to be good, and to do
   good, we shall then take true pleasure in our recreations and
   refreshments, we shall "eat our bread with joy, and drink our wine with
   a merry heart," as Solomon expresseth it a little before the text.
   Religion doth not ordinarily debar men of any contentment which they
   can wisely and safely take, in any of the enjoyments of this life, but
   directs us to do those things which will yield the truest and most
   refined plea sure, and so governs ns in the vise and enjoyment of
   worldly comforts, that there shall he no bitterness in them, or after
   them: and in truth, after all our search and inquiry after pleasure and
   happiness, we shall find that there is no solid and lasting pleasure,
   but in living righteously and religiously: and the pleasure of this is
   so great, that a heathen philosopher, speaking of a virtuous life,
   according to the true precepts of philosophy, breaks out in this
   rapture and transport concerning the wonderful pleasure of it, Vel unus
   dies vere et ex præceptis tuis actus peccandi immortalitati est
   anteferendus; "Even one day truly spent according to thy precepts is to
   be valued above an immortality of sinning." There is no life so
   pleasant as that of the pious and good man, who being contented with
   himself, every thing about him contributes to his cheerfulness, Gratior
   it dies, et soles melius nitent; "The day passeth more pleasantly, and
   the sun shines brighter to him;" and every object which he beholds is
   more delightful, because the man is at peace and ease within himself.

   II. Let us consider how great our work is, and then we shall easily be
   convinced what care it requires, what diligence it calls for from us.
   Very few persons, I doubt, are sufficiently sensible how much thought
   and consideration, how much care and vigilancy, how firm a resolution
   and earnest attention of mind, is necessary to the business of
   religion, to the due cultivating and improving of our minds, to the
   mortifying and subduing of our lusts, to the mastering and governing of
   our passions, to the reforming of our tempers, to the correcting of all
   the irregularities of our appetites and affections, and to the reducing
   of our crooked wills, which have been long obstinately bent the wrong
   way, to the straightness of that rule which God hath given us to walk
   by.

   Few, I fear, consider how much pains is necessary to the storing of our
   minds with good principles, and to the fixing and riveting in our souls
   all the proper motives and considerations to engage us to virtue, that
   in all the occasions of our lives they may have their due force and
   influence upon us. Few of us take pains to understand the just bounds
   and limits of our duty, and so to attend thereto, as to be always upon
   our guard against the infinite temptations of human life, and the many
   malicious enemies of our souls, that we may not be circumvented by the
   wiles of the devil, nor caught in those snares which he lays before us
   in our ways, that we be not wrought upon by the insinuations, nor
   overreached by the deceitfulness of sin.

   How few consider what care and watchfulness of ourselves, what
   constancy and fervency of prayer to God, is necessary to the due
   discharge of every part of our duty; or to the right exercise of every
   grace and virtue! Besides an earnest imploring of the Divine
   assistance, there is required likewise a particular care and
   application of mind, that we may fail in no point; and that, as St.
   James expresseth it, "We may be entire, wanting nothing;" that our
   faith and our hope, our devotion and our charity, our humility and our
   patience, and every other grace, may be exercised in the best manner,
   and have its proper work.

   III. Consider what incredible pains men take, what diligence they will
   use, for bad purposes, and for ends infinitely less considerable; Ut
   jugulent homines, surgunt de nocte latrones, ut teipsum serves, non
   expergiscere? "Thieves will rise and travel by night to rob and kill,
   and shall we use no care, no vigilance, to save ourselves?" What
   drudges and slaves are many men to their sensual pleasures and lusts?
   How hot and fierce upon revenge? And what hazards will they run to
   satisfy this unreasonable and devilish passion; and thereby make way
   for a speedy and bitter repentance, which always treads upon the heels
   of revenge? For no sooner hath any man executed his rage upon another,
   but his conscience presently turns it upon himself.

   How industrious do we see men at their recreations and sports, taking
   really more pains for the sake of pleasure, than the poor man does that
   works for his living?

   What a violent thirst, and insatiable covetousness, possesseth some men
   after learning and knowledge! How will they toil and watch, wear out
   their eyes, and waste their spirits, and pursue their studies, not only
   with the neglect of fitting diversion, but even of the necessary
   support and reparation of nature, by meat and sleep? nay, many times,
   to increase their learning, they weaken their understandings, and for
   the gaining of more knowledge, do disable that power and faculty which
   should make use of it when they have it.

   How will men attend for several hours to a lewd and extravagant play,
   and sit not only with patience, but with delight, to hear things
   spoken, which are neither fit to be spoken nor heard?

   And, above all, how eager and earnest, how busy and industrious, are a
   great part of mankind, in the pursuit of their ambitious and covetous
   designs; how sorely will they labour and travail? how hardly will they
   be contented to fare, and how meanly will they live themselves, to make
   they know not whom rich? even any body that happens to come in their
   way, when they make their last wills.

   And are men at all this pains for compassing of their low and mean, of
   their vile and wicked designs, to do themselves no good; nay, for the
   most part, to hurt and destroy themselves? and are the present
   pleasures and satisfaction of our minds, and eternal life and happiness
   in another world, things of no value and esteem with us? Is salvation
   itself so slight and inconsiderable a thing, that it deserves none of
   this care and diligence to be used for the obtaining of it?

   IV. Consider that when we come to die, nothing will yield more true and
   solid consolation to us, than the remembrance of an useful and
   well-spent life, a life of great labour and diligence, of great zeal
   and faithfulness in the service of God; and, on the contrary, with what
   grief and regret shall we look back upon all those precious hours which
   we have so fondly misplaced in sin and vanity! How shall we then wish
   that we could recal them, and live them over again, that we might spend
   them better! all that time which now lies upon our hands, and we know
   not how to bestow it and pass it away, will then most assuredly lie
   heavy upon our consciences. What anguish and confusion have I seen in
   the looks and speeches of a dying man, caused only by the grievous
   remembrance of an unprofitable and ill-spent life! So foolish are many
   men, as never seriously to think for what end they came into the world,
   till they are just ready to go out of it.

   V. Consider that the degrees of our happiness in another world, will
   certainly bear a proportion to the degrees of our diligence and
   industry in serving God, and doing good. And it is an argument of a
   mean spirit, not to aspire after the best and happiest condition, which
   is to be attained by us. To be contented barely to live, when by our
   pains and industry we may become considerable, and raise ourselves
   above the common level of men, is a sign of a poor and degenerate mind;
   so it is in the business of religion; to be contented with any low
   degrees of virtue and goodness, and consequently of glory and
   happiness, when, by a great diligence and industry in "serving our
   generation according to the will of God," we may be of the number of
   those, "whose reward shall be great in heaven," and have a place there,
   among those righteous persons, who "shall shine as the sun in the
   kingdom of their Father."

   Besides that, it may prove a thing of a dangerous consequence to us, to
   deal thus strictly with God, and to drive so near and hard a bargain
   with him; we may easily miss of happiness, and come short of heaven, if
   we only design just to get thither; we may be mistaken in the degree of
   holiness and virtue, which is necessary to recommend us to the Divine
   favour and acceptance, and to make us capable of the glorious reward of
   eternal life: for "unto whomsoever much is given, (saith our Saviour)
   of him much shall be required;" to him that hath only one talent
   committed to him, it may be sufficient to have gained one; but he that
   hath many talents entrusted to him, may gain one, and yet be a wicked
   and slothful servant; proportionably to our advantages and
   opportunities, our duty increaseth upon our hands, and better and
   greater things may justly be expected from us. The consideration
   whereof should make us unwearied in our endeavours of doing good, "and
   steadfast and unmoveable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord,
   forasmuch as we know that our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord."

   VI. And lastly, Let us consider the argument here in the text, "There
   is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave,
   whither we are going." Longe quiescendi tempora fata dabunt, we shall
   then rest from our labours, and our works will follow us. This life is
   the time of our activity and working, the next is the season of
   retribution and recompence; we shall then have nothing to do, but
   either to reap and enjoy the comfort of well-doing, or to repent the
   folly of an ill-spent life, and the irreparable mischief which thereby
   we have brought upon ourselves; "there is no work, nor wisdom, in the
   grave, whither thou goest;" intimating, that our life is a continual
   journey towards the grave, shorter or longer as God pleaseth; and many
   times when we think ourselves far from it, we may be just upon it, and
   ready to stumble into it. So that our time of working may be very
   short, to be sure it is very uncertain.

   And it is very well worth our consideration, that as "there is no work
   nor wisdom in the grave," so there is very little to be exercised when
   we come to draw near to it, whether it be by sickness or old age:
   "Sufficient (surely) for that day will be the evil thereof." We had
   need then to have nothing else to do, but to be old and weak, to be
   sick and die; we shall find that to be burden and trouble enough.

   "Let us, therefore, work the work of him that sent us into the world
   while it is day; for the night cometh," saith our Saviour (by which may
   probably be meant the time of sickness or old age), "the night cometh,
   when no man can work;" so that what we do, we must do quickly, mind the
   work which is before us, and ply it with all our might, as if it were
   the last opportunity we should ever have; and so it may prove, for
   aught we know, for it is ten to one but that some here present, and God
   knows which of us it may be, may now have the last opportunity in our
   hands, and that but a slippery hold of it, and may never have this
   counsel given us again, nor, perhaps, be long in a capacity to make use
   of it; for when death hath once over taken us, it will fix us in an
   unchangeable state, "as the tree falls, so it shall lie."

   This is the time of our work and preparation for another world, and
   what we do towards it in this life, will avail us in the other; but if
   this opportunity be neglected, there is nothing to be done by us
   afterwards, but to inherit the fruit of our own folly and neglect; to
   sit down in everlasting sorrow, and to be immutably fixed in that
   miserable state, which whilst we were in this world we could never be
   persuaded to take any tolerable care to avoid.

   And if we can do nothing for ourselves to help and relieve us in that
   state, much less can we think it can be done for us by others, by the
   consigning of masses and prayers, of merits and indulgences, to our use
   and benefit in another world. No, so soon as ever we are passed into
   the other state, we shall enter upon a condition of happiness or
   misery, that is never to be altered. So that this life is the proper
   season for wisdom to shew itself, and to exercise our best industry for
   the attaining of happiness; it will be too late afterwards to think of
   altering or bettering our condition, for death will conclude and
   determine our state one way or other, and what we are when we leave the
   world, good or bad, fitted for happiness or misery, we shall remain and
   continue so for ever.

   Therefore it infinitely concerns all of us, to exercise our best wisdom
   in this present life, and what we have to do for our souls, and for all
   eternity, to do it with our might: to contrive and use the best means
   to be happy, while the opportunity of doing it is yet in our hands; we
   may easily let it slip, but no care, no wisdom, no diligence, no
   repentance, can retrieve it; when it is once lost, it is lost for ever.

   Hear then the conclusion of the whole matter; would we enjoy ourselves
   and the peace of our minds while we live? would we have good hopes and
   comfort in our death, and after death would we be happy for ever? Let
   us lay the foundation of all this, in the activity and industry of a
   religious and holy life; a life of unspotted purity and temperance in
   the use of sensual pleasures, of sincere piety and devotion towards
   God, of strict justice and integrity, and of great goodness and
   charity, towards men.

   And let us consider that many of us are a great way already on our
   journey towards the grave, that our day is declining apace, and the
   shadows of the evening begin to be stretched out; therefore, that
   little of our life which is yet behind us should be precious to us, ut
   esse solis gratius lumen solet, jam jam cadentis, we should improve
   that which yet remains, as it were for our lives, always remembering
   that our only opportunity of working, of designing, and doing great and
   happy things for ourselves, is on this side the grave, and that this
   opportunity will expire and die with us; "for there is no work, nor
   device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave," whither we are going.

   "Now God of his infinite mercy grant, that we may all of us know, in
   this our day, the things which belong to our present peace, and future
   happiness, before they be hid from our eyes, for his mercy's sake in
   Jesus Christ; to whom, with thee, O Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all
   honour and glory, thanksgiving and praise, now and for evermore."

SERMON CCXII.

  OF THE BLESSEDNESS OF GIVING, MORE THAN THAT OF RECEIVING.

   And to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more
   blessed to give than to receive.--Acts xx. 36.

   The whole verse runs thus:

   I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support
   the weak; and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It
   is more blessed to give than to receive.

   THE words which I have read to you, have this particular advantage to
   recommend them to our more attentive consideration, that they are a
   remarkable saying of our Lord himself, not recorded by any of the
   evangelists among his other sayings and discourses, but remembered by
   the apostles, and by some of them delivered to St. Paul, and by him
   preserved to us in his farewell speech to the elders of Ephesus. In
   which, after he had given them some needful advice, and commended them
   to the grace of God, he appeals to them concerning the integrity of his
   conversation among them; that he was so far from seeking his own
   advantage, and from coveting any thing that was theirs, that be had not
   only supported himself, but also relieved others by the labour of his
   own hands; giving them herein a great example of charity, which it
   seems he was wont to enforce upon them by an excellent saying of our
   Lord, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."

   And it is really a particular endearment of this saying to us, that,
   being omitted by the evangelists, and in danger of being lost and
   forgotten, it was so happily retrieved by St. Paul, and recorded by St.
   Luke. The common sayings of ordinary persons perish without regard, and
   are spilt like water upon the ground, which nobody goes about to gather
   up; but the little and short sayings of wise and excellent men are of
   great value, like the dust of gold, or the least sparks of diamonds.
   And such is this saying of our Lord, which is not only valuable out of
   respect to its author, but for the sake of that admirable sense which
   is contained in it.

   Some interpreters have needlessly troubled themselves to find these
   words, or something equivalent to them, in the gospel. That the sense
   of them may be inferred from several passages in the gospels, none will
   deny; but that they are either expressly to be found there, or that
   there is any saying that sounds to the same sense, I think nobody can
   shew. Besides that St. Paul cites a particular sentence or saying of
   our Lord, that was retos, and in those very words spoken by him.

   And there is no reason to imagine, that the gospels are a perfect and
   exact account of all the sayings and actions of our Lord, though St.
   Luke calls his gospel, "a treatise of all things that Jesus did and
   spake;" that is, of the principal actions of his life, and the
   substance of his discourses, at least so much of them as is needful for
   us to know: for St. Luke leaves out several things related by the other
   evangelists. And St. John expressly tells us, that Jesus did
   innumerable things not recorded in the history of his life: and there
   is no doubt but the disciples of our Lord remembered many particular
   sayings of his, not set down in the gospels, which upon occasion they
   did relate and communicate to others, as they did this to St. Paul.

   The words themselves are the proposition I shall speak to, "It is a
   more blessed thing to give than to receive." This I know seems a
   paradox to most men, who know no happiness but in hoarding up what they
   have, and in receiving and heaping up more; but as strange as this
   saying may appear, the sense of it is owned and assented to by those
   great oracles of reason, the wisest and most considerate heathens; tes
   aretes mallon to` eu poiein e` to' eu pa'schein, "It is a more virtuous
   thing to do, than to receive good," says Aristotle; which according to
   his opinion was to say, it is a greater happiness, because he placed
   happiness in the practice and exercise of virtue. To the same purpose
   is that saying of Plutarch, eu poiein e'dio'n estin e` pa'schein;
   "There is more pleasure in doing a kindness than in taking one." And
   that of Seneca, Malim non recipere beneficia, quam non dare; "Of the
   two, I had rather not receive benefits, than not bestow them." And that
   the heathen have spoken things to the same sense with this saying of
   our Saviour's, is so far from being any prejudice to this saying of our
   Saviour, that it is a great commendation of it, as being an argument
   that our Saviour hath herein said nothing but what is very agreeable to
   the best notions of our minds, and to the highest reason and wisdom of
   mankind. In the handling of this proposition, I shall do these two
   things:

   First, Endeavour to convince men of the truth and reasonableness of it.

   Secondly, To persuade men to act suitably to it.

   First, To convince men of the truth and reasonableness of this
   principle, that "it is more blessed to give than to receive." And this
   will fully appear by considering these three things:

   I. That it is an argument of a more happy spirit and temper.

   II. Of a more happy state and condition, And,

   III. That it shall have the happiness of a greater reward.

   I. To be governed by this principle, is an argument of a more happy
   spirit and temper. To do good, to be useful and beneficial to others,
   to be of a kind and obliging disposition, of a tender and compassionate
   spirit, sensible of the straits and miseries of others, so as to be
   ready to ease and relieve them (for to this kind of goodness and
   charity the apostle applies this saying of our Saviour, as appears by
   the context), this certainly is the happiest spirit and temper in the
   world, and is an argument of a noble, and generous, and large heart,
   that is not contracted within itself, and confined to little and narrow
   designs, and takes care of nobody but itself, envying that others
   should share with it, and partake of its happiness; but is free and
   open, ready to do good, and willing to communicate, and thinks its own
   happiness increased by making others happy.

   It is the property of narrow and envious spirits to think their own
   happiness the greater, because they have it alone to themselves; but
   the noblest and most heavenly dispositions desire that others should
   share with them in it. Of all beings, God is the farthest removed from
   envy and ill-will, and the nearer any creature approacheth to him, the
   farther it is from this hellish disposition. For it is the temper of
   the devil to grudge happiness to others; he envied that man should be
   in paradise, and was restless till he had got him out.

   Some perfections are of a more solitary nature and disposition, and
   shine brightest when they are attained to but by few, as knowledge and
   power: but the nature of goodness is to diffuse and communicate itself,
   and the more it is communicated the more glorious it is. And therefore
   knowledge and power may be in a nature most contrary to God's; the
   devil hath these perfections in a high degree.

   To receive good from others is no certain argument of virtue or merit,
   for the unworthy and unthankful often receive benefits: but to be good
   and do good is the excellency of virtue, because it is to resemble God
   in that which is the most amiable and glorious of all his other
   perfections. And therefore when Moses desires "to see God's glory,"
   (Exod. xxxiii. 19.) he tells him, that "he will cause all his goodness
   to pass before him." Without goodness the power and wisdom of God would
   be terrible, and raise great dread and superstition in the minds of
   men. Without goodness power would be tyranny and oppression, and wisdom
   would degenerate into craft and mischievous contrivance. So that a
   being endowed with all power and wisdom, and yet wanting goodness,
   would be a dreadful and omnipotent mischief. We are apt to dread power,
   and to admire knowledge, and to suspect great wisdom and prudence; but
   we can heartily love and reverence nothing but true goodness. It is not
   the infinite power and knowledge of God considered abstractedly, and in
   themselves, but these in conjunction with his great goodness, that make
   him at once the most awful and amiable being in the world; which is the
   reason why our Saviour, (Matt. v. 48.) speaks of the mercy, and
   goodness, and patience of God, as the top and sum of the Divine
   perfections, "Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father which is in
   heaven is perfect." How is that? la being "good to the evil and
   unthankful, as God is, who makes his sun to rise, and his rain to fall,
   not only on the just but unjust." And therefore St. Luke renders it,
   "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father which is in heaven is
   merciful." To be good and merciful as God is, is to be perfect as he
   is; because it is to imitate him in that which is his chief perfection.

   Gratitude is one of the noblest virtues, and our goodness to men is
   gratitude in us to God. It is an acknowledgment of the blessings we
   have received from God; the best use we can make of them, and the best
   requital we can make to him for all his benefits. For we can give him
   nothing again, because he stands in need of nothing. But a truly
   grateful person, who hath a kindness done to him by one that is out of
   all capacity and reach of requital, will inquire whether there be any
   of his family and relations, to whom he may shew kindness for his sake.
   Yea, benefits have often been requited by thankful persons, upon those
   who did but resemble their benefactors, though they were no ways
   related to them. Though we can do nothing to God, yet we may do it to
   men, who are "made after the image of God." We may shew kindness to his
   relations, and to those of his household and family, to his creatures,
   to his servants, to his friends, and to his children here in the earth.

   Besides that our goodness to others like ourselves, is an argument of
   great consideration and prudence; it is a sign that we know ourselves,
   and consider what we are, and what we may be: it shews that we have a
   due sense of the indigence and infirmity of human nature, and of the
   change and vicissitude of human affairs; it is a just sense and
   acknowledgment of our state, that we are insufficient for our own
   happiness, and goodwill, and friend ship of other men; that we all
   either do or may stand in need of others, one time or other: for he who
   is now in the greatest plenty and abundance of all things, and thinks
   his mountain so strong that he can never be moved, may, by a sudden
   revolution of fortune, by a thousand accidents, be thrown down from his
   height of prosperity into the depth of misery and necessity.

   And as it is an argument of consideration, so of great prudence. He
   that is good to others, apt to commiserate their sad case, and to
   relieve them in their straits, takes the wisest and surest way that can
   be, to incline and engage others to be good to him, when it shall fall
   to his lot to stand in need of their kindness and pity. Upon this
   account our Saviour commends the prudence of the unjust steward, who
   laid in for the kindness of others, against himself should have
   occasion for it.

   And though it should happen otherwise, and that we should have an
   uninterrupted tenor of prosperity (which few or none have), or that
   coming to stand in need of others, our kindness should meet with no
   equal returns, yet it would not be quite lost; for, as Seneca truly
   says, delectat eliam sterilis beneficii conscientia, though our charity
   should fall upon stony and barren ground, and we should find no fruit
   of it from those whom we have obliged, yet there is a pleasure in being
   conscious to ourselves that we have done well, what was worthy and
   generous, and what became wise and considerate men to do, whatever the
   event and success be; for, setting aside all selfish respects, purely
   out of humanity, and charity, and a generous compassion, we should be
   ready as we have opportunity to do good to all that stand in need of
   our kindness and help.

   So that a disposition to do good is the best and happiest temper of
   mind, because it is the nearest resemblance of the Divine nature, which
   is perfectly happy: it is a grateful acknowledgment of our obligations
   to God, and all that we can render to him for his benefits; it is an
   argument of great wisdom and consideration; it gives ease and
   satisfaction to our minds, and the reflection upon any good that we
   have done, is certainly the greatest contentment and pleasure in the
   world, and a felicity much be yond that of the greatest fortune of this
   world: whereas the spirit, contrary to this, is always uneasy to
   itself; the envious and malicious, the hard hearted and ill-natured man
   carries his own torment and hell about him, his mind is full of
   tumultuous agitations and unquiet thoughts; but were our nature
   rectified and brought back to its primitive frame and temper, we should
   take no such plea sure in any thing, as in acts of kindness and
   compassion, which are so suitable and agreeable to our nature, that
   they are peculiarly called humanity, as if without this temper we were
   not truly men, but something else disguised under a human shape.

   II. To give, is an argument of a more happy state and condition, than
   to receive. To receive from others is an argument of indigency, and
   plainly shews that we are in want and necessity; either that we stand
   in need of something, or that we think we do; and either of these
   conditions is far from perfect happiness; but to give, is an argument
   of fulness and sufficiency, that we have more than is necessary for
   ourselves, and something to spare.

   To receive kindness from others, supposeth we stand in need of it; and
   to stand in need of it, is to be in a state of being obliged and
   indebted. Obligation is a dear thing, and a real debt which lies heavy
   and uneasy upon a grateful mind: so much obligation as any man hath to
   another, so much he hath lost of his own liberty and freedom; for it
   gives him that hath obliged us a superiority and advantage over us: and
   what Solomon says of the borrower, that he is a servant to the lender,
   is in proportion true in this case, that the receiver is a servant to
   the giver.

   But to be able to benefit others is a condition of freedom and
   superiority, and is so far from impairing our liberty, that it shews
   our power; and the happiness which we confer upon others by doing them
   good, is not only a contentment to ourselves, but we do in some sort
   enjoy the happiness we give, in being conscious to ourselves that we
   are the authors of it. And could we but once come to this excellent
   temper, to delight in the good that others enjoy, as if it were our own
   (and it is our own, if we be the instruments of it, and take pleasure
   in it); I say, could we but once come to this temper, we need not envy
   the wealth and splendour of the most prosperous upon earth, for upon
   these terms the happiness of the whole world would in some sort be
   ours, and we should have a share in the pleasure and satisfaction of
   all that good which happens to any man any way, especially by our
   means.

   To depend upon another, and to receive from him, and to be beholden to
   him, is the necessary imperfection of creatures; but to confer benefits
   upon others is to resemble God, and to approach towards divinity.
   Aristotle could say, that by narrowness and selfishness, by envy and
   ill-will, men degenerate into beasts, and become wolves and tigers to
   one another; but by goodness and kindness, by mutual compassion and
   helpfulness, men become gods to one another. To be a benefactor, is to
   be as like God as it is possible for men to be; and the more any one
   partakes of this Divine quality and disposition, the liker and the
   nearer he is to God, who is good to all, and whose tender mercies are
   over all his works.

   The blessed angels, who behold the face of God continually, are, as it
   were, perfectly transformed into the image of the Divine goodness, and
   therefore the work which, with so much cheerfulness and vigour, they
   employ themselves in, is to be ministering spirits for the good of the
   elect, to bring men to goodness, and to encourage, and assist, and
   comfort them in well-doing. And our blessed Lord, when he was upon
   earth, did in nothing shew himself more like th6 Son of God, than in
   going about doing good: and the wonderful works which he did gave
   testimony of his divinity, not so much as they were acts of power as of
   goodness, and wrought for the benefit and advantage of men; and the
   true advantage of greatness, and wealth, and power, does not consist in
   this, that it sets men above others, but that it puts them in a
   capacity of doing more good than others. Men are apt to call them their
   betters, who are higher and richer than themselves; but in a true and
   just esteem of things, they only are our betters who do more good than
   we. From the meanest creature below us up to God himself, they are the
   best, and happiest, and most perfect beings, who are most useful and
   beneficial to others, who have the most power and the strongest
   inclinations to do good.

   III. To give, that is, to be beneficial and to do good to others, hath
   the happiness of a great reward. There is no grace or virtue
   whatsoever, which hath in Scripture the encouragement of more and
   greater promises than this, of happiness in general; of temporal
   happiness in this life, of happiness at death, and of everlasting
   happiness in the world to come.

   1. For promises of happiness in general. "He hath dispersed, he hath
   given to the poor, his righteousness endures for ever;" that is, shall
   never be forgotten, shall not pass unrewarded. (Prov. xiv. 21.) "He
   that giveth to the poor, happy is he." (Matt. v. 7.) "Blessed are the
   merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." (Luke vi. 38.) "Give, and it
   shall be given unto you, good measure, pressed down, and shaken
   together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom; for with
   the same measure that ye mete withal, it shall be measured to you
   again;" that is, according to our goodness and compassion towards
   others, we must expect to find the charity of men, and the compassions
   of God towards us. Job speaks as if some eminent and peculiar blessing
   did attend and follow acts of charity: (Job xxv. 19.) "The blessing of
   him that was ready to perish came upon me."

   2. Promises of temporal happiness in this life: (Psal. xxxvii. 3.)
   "Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and
   verily thou shalt be fed." (Prov. xxviii. 27.) "He that giveth to the
   poor shall not lack." Nay, God hath promised to have a particular
   respect to such as do good, in every condition, and all kinds of
   troubles that befal them. (Psal. xli. 13.) "Blessed is he that
   considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble. The
   Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed
   upon the earth; and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his
   enemies. The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
   wilt make all his bed in his sickness."

   3. Of happiness in death. "The righteous (saith Solomon, Prov. xiv.
   32.) hath hope in his death." By the righteous, in Scripture, is
   frequently meant the merciful and good man. And so it is to be
   understood, as appears from the context; "He that oppresseth the poor,
   reproacheth his Maker; but he that honoureth him, hath mercy upon the
   poor. The wicked is driven away in his wickedness; but the righteous
   hath hope in his death." If God designs to send calamities upon the
   earth, upon the place where the good man lives, which it would grieve
   him to see, or which he might be involved in, so as either to make his
   life uncomfortable, or to cut him off by a violent death; God considers
   the merciful man, and removes him out of the way into a better and
   safer place: (Isaiah lvii. 1.) "The merciful man is taken away from the
   evil to come."

   4. The promises of eternal life and happiness in the world to come.
   (Luke xiv. 13, 14.) "But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the
   maimed, the lame, and the blind: and thou shalt be blessed. For they
   cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the
   resurrection of the just." And, (chap. xvi. 9.) "And I say unto you,
   (saith our Lord,) Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
   unrighteousness," that is, to do good with what you have, "that when ye
   fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations." (1 Tim. vi.
   17-19.) "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
   high-minded, nor trust to uncertain riches; but in the living God, who
   giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be
   rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying
   up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come,
   that they may lay hold on eternal life." And the more to fix upon our
   minds the necessity of doing good, especially in ways of mercy and
   charity, our Lord represents this as the great matter of inquiry at the
   great day of judgment, how they have behaved themselves in this kind,
   what good they have done, or omitted and neglected to do; especially to
   those who were in misery and want; and as if the sentence of eternal
   happiness or misery would accordingly pass upon them. And this,
   methinks, should make a mighty impression upon us, to think that when
   we shall appear before the great Judge of the world, we are to expect
   mercy from him, according to the measure that we have shewed it to
   others. And now, if men be thoroughly convinced of the happiness of
   this temper, methinks it should be no difficult matter to persuade them
   to it. If we believe this saying of our Lord, that "It is more blessed
   to give than to receive;" let us do accordingly.

   I know that to carnal and earthly-minded men, this must needs seem a
   new and wrong way to happiness. For if we may judge of men's
   persuasions by their practice (which seems to be a reasonable and good
   sure way of judging), I am afraid it will appear, that few believe this
   to be the way to happiness. If we mind the course of the world, and the
   actions of men, it is but too evident that most men place their
   greatest felicity in receiving and getting the good things of this
   world; almost all seek their own things, and but few the good of
   others. Many say, Who will shew us? who will do us any good? but few
   ask that question, "What good thing shall I do that I may inherit
   eternal life? And when our Lord tells men that they must "give to the
   poor," if they would have "treasure in heaven;" that they must be
   charitable, if they would be happy; that, "It is a more blessed thing
   to give than to receive;" these are sad and melancholy sayings to those
   who have great possessions; and most men are ready with the young man
   in the gospel to part with our Lord, and to break with him, upon these
   terms.

   But let us remember, that this was the saying of our Lord Jesus, whom
   we all profess to believe, and to imitate in all things; but more
   especially let us do so in this, because it was not a bare speculation,
   a fine and glorious saying, like those of the philosophers, who said
   great and glorious things, but did them not; but this was his constant
   practice, the great work and business of his life. He who pronounced it
   the most blessed thing to do good, spent his whole life in this work,
   and "went about doing good." To this end all his activity and
   endeavours were bent. This was the life which God himself, when he was
   pleased to become man, thought lit to lead in the world, giving us
   herein an example, that we should follow his steps. He made full trial
   and experience of the happiness of this temper and spirit; for he was
   all on the giving hand. He would receive no portion and share of the
   good things of this world; he refused the greatest offers. When the
   people would have made him a king, he withdrew and hid himself; he was
   contented to be worse accommodated than the creatures below us. "The
   foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests: but the Son of
   man hath not where to lay his head." He would not so much as have any
   fixed abode and habitation, that he might be at liberty "to go about
   doing good." He received nothing but injuries and affronts, base and
   treacherous usage, from an ungrateful world, to whom he was so great
   and so universal a benefactor. The whole business of his life was to do
   good, and to suffer evil for so doing. So fixed and steady was he in
   his own principle and saying, "It is a more blessed thing to give than
   to receive." He gave away all that he had to do us good, he parted with
   his glory and his life, "emptied him self, and became of no reputation;
   and being rich, for our sakes became poor, that we through his poverty
   might be made rich."

   So that he adviseth us nothing, but what he did himself; nor imposeth
   any thing upon us, from which he himself desired to be excused. And
   surely we have great reason to be in great love with this pattern, when
   that very goodness which he propounds to our imitation was all laid out
   upon us, and redounds to our benefit and advantage; when our salvation
   and happiness are the effects of that goodness and compassion which he
   exercised in the world! He did it all purely for our sakes; whereas all
   the good we do to others, is a greater good done to ourselves.

   So that here is an example and experiment of the thing in the greatest
   and most famous instance that the whole world can afford. The best and
   happiest man that ever was, the Son of God and the Saviour of men, and
   who is the most worthy to be the pattern of all mankind, "went about
   doing good," and governed his whole life, and all the actions of it, by
   this principle, that "It is more blessed to give than to receive." "Let
   the same mind be in us that was in Jesus Christ: let us go and do
   likewise."

SERMON CCXIII.

  THE EVIL OF CORRUPT COMMUNICATION.

   Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth; but that which
   is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the
   hearers.--Ephes. iv. 29.

   As discourses against sin and vice in general are of great use, so it
   is likewise very necessary to level them against the particular vices
   of men, and to endeavour by proper and intrinsical arguments, taken
   from the nature of that vice we treat of, to dissuade and deter them
   from it; because this carries the discourse home to the consciences of
   men, and leaves them no way of escape. For this reason, and in
   compliance with their Majesties pious proclamation, for the
   discountenancing and sup pressing of profaneness and vice, I have
   chosen to treat upon this subject, of corrupt and filthy communication,
   as being one of the reigning vices of this wicked and adulterous
   generation; of the evil whereof the generality of men are less sensible
   than almost of any other, that is so frequently and so expressly
   branded in Scripture. And to this purpose I have pitched upon the words
   which I have read unto you, as containing a plain and express
   prohibition of this vice, "Let no corrupt communication," &c.

   I remember St. Austin in one of his epistles tells us, that Tully, the
   great master of the art of speaking, says of one of the great orators,
   Nullum unquam verbum quod revocare vellet, emisit: "That no word ever
   fell from him that he could wish to have recalled." This I doubt is
   above the perfection of human eloquence, for a man always to make such
   a choice of his words, and to place them so fitly, that nothing he ever
   said could be changed for the better. But the greatest faults of speech
   are not those which offend against the rules of eloquence, but of
   piety, and virtue, and good manners; and who can say that his tongue is
   free from all faults in this kind, and no word ever proceeded from him
   which he could wish to have recalled? "In many things (says St. James,
   chap. iii. 2.) we offend all;" and in this kind as much, perhaps, and
   as often, as in any. He is a good and a happy man indeed, that seldom
   or never offends with his tongue. "If any man (as St. James goes on)
   offend not in word, the same is a perfect man;" that is, he hath
   attained to an eminent degree of virtue indeed, and is above the common
   rate of men, and may reasonably be presumed blameless in the general
   course of his life and practice, and "able (as follows) to bridle the
   whole body;" that is, "to order his whole conversation aright."

   To govern the tongue is a matter of great difficulty, and consequently
   of great wisdom, and care, and circumspection; and therefore, one of
   the great endeavours of a wise and good man should be, to govern his
   words by the rules of reason and religion; and we should every one of
   us resolve and say, as David does, (Psal. xxxix. 1.) "I will take heed
   to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue." For as the virtues, so the
   vices of the tongue are many and great. In respect of it, David calls
   it the best member we have; because, of all the members and instruments
   of the body, it is capable of giving the greatest glory to God, and of
   doing the greatest good and benefit to men. And in respect of the vices
   of it, it may be as truly said to be the worst member that we have,
   because it is capable of doing the greatest dishonour to God, and the
   greatest mischief and harm among men. So that, upon all accounts, we
   ought to have a great care of the government of our tongue, which is
   capable of being so useful and serviceable to the best and worst
   purposes, according as we restrain it and keep it in order, or let it
   loose to sin and folly.

   And among all the vices of the tongue, as none is more common, so none
   is more misbecoming, and more contrary to the modesty of a man, and the
   gravity of a Christian, than filthy and obscene talk; of the odious
   nature, and the evil and mischievous consequences whereof, both to
   ourselves and others, I design, by God's assistance, to treat at this
   time, from the words which I have read unto you,--"Let no corrupt
   communication," &c.

   That by "corrupt (or rotten) communication," is here meant filthy and
   obscene talk, is generally agreed among interpreters. By "that which is
   good to the use of edifying," is meant such discourse as is apt to
   build us up in knowledge and goodness, to make the hearers wiser and
   better. "That it may minister grace unto the hearers;" that is, such
   kind of discourse as is acceptable to all; not nauseous and offensive
   to sober and virtuous persons, not apt to grate upon chaste and modest
   ears, and to put the hearers out of countenance.

   So that the apostle doth here strictly forbid all lewd and filthy
   discourse amongst Christians; and enjoins them so to converse with one
   another, that all their discourses may minister mutual benefit and
   advantage to one another, and tend to the promoting of piety and
   virtue; and may likewise be grateful to the hearers, carefully avoiding
   every thing that might put them to the blush, or any way trespass upon
   modesty and good manners, as all filthy communication does.

   This sort of argument, though it be frequently mentioned in Scripture,
   yet it is very seldom treated of in the pulpit, because it is a hard
   matter to be handled in a cleanly manner, and the preacher must always
   take good heed to himself, that his discourse be free from the
   contagion of that vice which he reproves and designs to correct and
   cure. And, therefore, to dissuade and deter men from this evil
   practice, so rife and common in the world, and that not only amongst
   the profane and dissolute sort of persons, but those likewise who would
   seem to be more strict and religious, I hope it may be sufficient to
   all considerate persons plainly to represent to them the heinous nature
   of the thing itself, together with the evil and dangerous consequences
   of it, both to ourselves and to others. And this I shall endeavour to
   do in the most general and wary terms, keeping all along, as much as
   possible, aloof and at distance from any thing that might either offend
   the chaste and modest, or infect lewd and dissolute minds, which, like
   tinder, are always ready to take fire at the least spark.

   Having premised this in general, my work at this time shall be to offer
   such particular considerations as may fully convince men of the great
   evil and danger of this practice; and I hope may effectually prevail
   with them to leave it, and break it off. And they shall be these
   following:--

   I. That all filthy and corrupt communication is evidently contrary to
   nature, which is careful to hide and suppress whatever, in the general
   esteem of the sober part of mankind, hath any thing of turpitude and
   uncomeliness in it; and wherever nature hath thought fit to draw a
   veil, we should neither by words nor actions expose such things to open
   view. Quæ natura occultavit, (says Tully, de Offic. lib. 1.) eadem
   omne, qui sana sunt mente, removent ab oculis: "Those things which
   nature hath thought fit to hide, all men that are in their wits
   endeavour to keep out of sight." Nos autem naturam sequamur, (says the
   same excellent moralist, ibid.) et ab omni quod abhorret ab oculorum
   auriumque approbatione fugiamus: "Let us (says he) follow nature, and
   flee every thing that is offensive either to the eye or ear of men."
   And this is so plain a lesson of nature, that an actor in a play will
   never fall into that absurdity, as to represent a grave and virtuous
   person offering any obscene or immodest word: and, as the same author
   reasons, Histrio hoc videbit in scena, quod non videbit sapiens in
   vita? "Shall an actor see this to be improper upon the stage, and a
   wise man not discern the absurdity and indecency of it in his life and
   conversation?"

   II. All corrupt and filthy communication is a notorious abuse of one of
   the greatest and best gifts which God hath given us, and does directly
   contradict the natural end and use of speech. Our tongue is our glory,
   as the holy Psalmist often calls it, who hath duly considered the
   excellency and use of this noble faculty, and took great care to employ
   it to the purposes to which God gave it, and is herein an admirable
   pattern to us.

   And, next to our reason and understanding, our speech doth most
   remarkably distinguish us from the beasts, and sets us above them. Hoc
   uno præstamus, vel maxime feris, quod colloquimur inter nos, et quod
   exprimere dicendo sensa possumus: (says the great Roman orator, Cicero,
   de Orat. lib. 1.) "By this one thing we excel the beasts in a very high
   degree, that we can talk together, and by speech declare our minds to
   one another." By our understanding we know God, and by our tongues we
   confess and praise him: but to use our tongues to lewd and filthy
   discourse, is to pervert and abuse one of the best and noblest
   faculties which God hath given us; it is to affront him with his own
   gifts, and to fight against him with his own weapons. "Do we thus
   requite the Lord? foolish creatures and unthankful!"

   The two great ends for which this faculty of speech is given us are, to
   glorify God our maker, and to edify man our neighbour: but all corrupt
   communication contradicts both these ends; be cause, instead of
   praising God with pure hearts and lips, we do greatly dishonour him, by
   polluting our tongues with lewd and filthy talk: for hereby we offer a
   direct affront to his holy nature and laws. This renders us altogether
   unfit for the worship and service of Almighty God, who is "of purer
   eyes than to behold iniquity" and impurity of any kind. For how can we
   think that he will accept those prayers and praises which are offered
   to him by such impure and unhallowed lips; when we dishonour God with
   the same mouth that we pretend to glorify him; and commit sin with the
   same tongue that we confess it? How can we hope that he will accept the
   sacrifice of such polluted lips, out of which proceed things so
   contrary and so inconsistent?"

   Those who thus pervert the use of speech, and, instead of glorifying
   him who gave them this excellent gift, and setting forth his praise,
   defile their tongues with filthy and impure language, give just
   occasion to complain of them, as Elihu does of the wicked in his time;
   (Job xxxv. 10, 11.) "None saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth
   songs in the night; who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,
   and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?" His meaning is, that
   they did not glorify God their maker, by singing his praises; which, by
   being endued with this noble faculty of speech (which he had denied to
   the creatures below man, the beasts and birds), they only were capable
   of performing. The consideration of this high privilege, by which we do
   so much excel the creatures below us, ought to be a mighty obligation
   upon us to employ this gift of God in the service, and to the glory of
   the Giver, and make us very careful not to offend him by it, or by any
   defilement of it, to render it unfit for one of the principal uses for
   which God bestowed it upon us.

   Another great end of speech is to edify our neighbour. So the apostle
   here tells us in the text, that nothing should proceed out of our
   mouths, but what is "good for the use of edifying, that it may minister
   grace to the hearers." But, instead of that, corrupt communication
   offends the chaste and virtuous, and corrupts them who have vicious
   inclinations, by exciting and cherishing lewd imaginations in them, and
   making them that are filthy more filthy still.

   III. Corrupt communication is an evidence of a corrupt and impure
   heart, as polluted streams are a sign that the fountain is impure from
   whence they came. An impure mind may be covered and disguised by
   natural shame and outward reverence, in regard to the company, or from
   some other particular design; but when it breaks out at any time in
   lewd talk, our speech betrays us, and discovers the inward thoughts of
   our hearts, and makes them visible to every eye. For, as our Saviour
   says, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh:" (Matt.
   xii. 34, 35.) "How can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of
   the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man, out of the
   good treasure of the heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil
   man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil things."

   "There is not (says an excellent divine of our own, Dr. Barrow) a more
   certain sign of a mind utterly debauched from piety and virtue, than
   affecting such talk. A vain mind naturally venteth itself in frothy
   discourse; and lust boiling within, foams out in filthy talk." It is
   St. Jude's metaphor, when he describes that impure sect of the
   gnostics, he says of them, that "they were continually foaming out
   their own shame;" (ver. 13.) that is, by their lewd words and deeds
   they discovered the inward filthiness of their hearts. And, therefore,
   it is Tully's advice to him that would be perfectly virtuous, and not
   defective in any part of his duty, Imprimis provideat, ne sermo vitium
   aliquod indicet inesse moribus: (de Offic. lib. i.) "Let him in the
   first place (says he) take great care that his speech betray not some
   vice or fault in his manners." Andro`s charakte`r ek lo'gou gnorizetai:
   "A man's character is commonly taken from his talk." Oi'os o tro'pos
   toioutos kai` o lo'gos (says Aristides); "Such as are the manners of a
   man, such is his discourse:" and Quintilian, (lib. xi. c. 1.) Profert
   enim mores plerumque oratio, et animi secreta detegit, nec sine causa
   Græci prodiderunt, ut vivit, quenquam etiam dicere: "Our speech, for
   the most part, declares our manners, and discovers the secrets of our
   hearts;" so that not without cause was it become a proverbial saying
   among the Greeks, that, "As the man lives, so also he speaks." And to
   the same purpose, the wise son of Sirach: (Ecclus. xxvii. 6, 7.) "The
   fruit declareth if the tree hath been dressed; so is the utterance of a
   conceit in the heart of man. Praise no man before thou nearest him
   speak: for this is the trial of men." And, (ver. 13.) "The discourse of
   fools is irksome, and their sport is in the wantonness of sin."

   Immodest speech is not only an indication of an unchaste mind; but
   draws, likewise, a great suspicion upon a man's life. So strict a
   connexion commonly is there between a man's thoughts and words, and
   between his words and actions, that they are generally presumed to be
   all of a piece, and agreeable to one another.

   IV. Corrupt communication doth debauch and defile the minds of men, and
   that not only of the speaker, but likewise of the hearer of such
   discourse; because it gratifies and feeds a corrupt humour and a
   vitiated appetite, besides that it disposeth and inclines to lewd and
   filthy actions: a smutty tongue and unchaste deeds are seldom far
   asunder, and do very often go together; for filthy talk and lewd
   practices seem to differ only in the occasion and opportunity; and he
   that makes no conscience of the one, will hardly stick at the other,
   when it can be done with secrecy and safety. The law of God forbids
   both alike, and his eye be holds both; "For there is not a word in my
   tongue (says David, Psal. cxxxix. 4.) but thou, O Lord, knowest it
   altogether." So that whatever may deter us from lewd practice (the
   authority of God forbidding it, or the awe of his presence, who
   continually stands by us, and hears and sees all that we say and do),
   is of equal force to restrain us from lewd and filthy words: for they
   both proceed from the same ill disposition of mind, and are done in
   equal contempt of the Divine presence and authority.

   V. It is uncivil and unmannerly, very disagreeable, and highly
   displeasing to all sober and modest persons. It is a clownish and rude
   thing, says Tully, (de Offic. lib. i.) Si rerum turpitudini adhibetur
   verborum obscænitas: "If to things which are immodest in themselves, we
   add the obscenity of words."

   Nothing that trespasses upon the modesty of the company, and the
   decency of conversation, can be come the mouth of a wise and virtuous
   person. This kind of conversation would fain pass for wit among some
   sort of persons, to whom it is acceptable; but whatever savours of
   rudeness, and immodesty, and ill manners, is very far from deserving
   that name; and they that are sober and virtuous, cannot entertain any
   discourse of this kind with approbation and acceptance: a well-bred
   person will never offend in this way; and therefore it cannot but be
   esteemed as an affront to modest company, and a rude presuming upon
   their approbation, impudently taking it for granted that all others are
   as lewd and dissolute as themselves.

   This sort of conversation was not only offensive to righteous Lot, but
   was a perpetual vexation to him, and grieved him at his very heart. So
   St. Peter tells us, (2 Pet. ii. 7, 8.) that Lot was "vexed with the
   filthy conversation of the wicked. For that righteous man dwelling
   among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to
   day with their unlawful deeds." "In seeing and hearing;" that is, in
   seeing their lewd actions, and hearing their filthy talk, his life
   became a burden to him; and, therefore, God singled him out, and
   delivered him both from that wicked company, and from that dreadful
   judgment of fire and brimstone, which came down from heaven upon them,
   and consumed them with an utter destruction, for an example to all
   ages, and an admonition to all good men, that they ought to be in like
   manner affected, as righteous Lot was, with "the filthy conversation of
   the wicked."

   VI. As by this practice we offend against nature and reason and true
   morality; so it is likewise a direct contempt and defiance of the
   Christian religion, which does so strictly forbid, and so severely
   condemn it in Christians. Our blessed Saviour seems more particularly
   to censure and condemn this vice, when he says, (Matt. xii. 36.) "That
   every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give an account
   thereof in the day of judgment." "Every idle word," rema argo`n, "every
   vain and unprofitable word," that no way tends to edification; that is
   the very lowest sense the words can bear. But then how much more shall
   we give an account in that day of every lewd word, which tends to
   corrupt and debauch the minds and manners of men! Some copies have it,
   rema ponero`n, "every naughty and wicked word," every false, and
   malicious, and calumniating word: "An idle word (says St. Basil) is
   that which is not for edification, and such words shall come under
   examination in that great assembly of the whole world; and what then
   (says he) shall be done to words of scurrility, and calumny, and
   obscenity?"

   But that which will best direct us to the meaning of this phrase, is
   what the Jewish masters observed, that, by an idle word, the Jews did
   commonly understand immodest and unchaste speech, scurrilous and
   obscene words. And then it follows, "For by thy words thou shalt be
   justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."

   Men are commonly apt to make a very light matter of such words; but
   because they shew the mind and manners of the man, his inward temper
   and disposition, therefore men shall be called to a strict account for
   them in the day of judgment, and be condemned for lewd and dissolute
   words, as well as for acts of filthiness and uncleanness; because
   "these come from the heart, and defile the man," they proceed from an
   impure spring and fountain; and though we only perceive them to come
   out of the mouth, yet they proceed "out of the abundance of the heart,"
   from an evil disposition of mind.

   So that our Judge hath expressly warned us of this fault, and declared
   to us the danger of it. And, therefore, whosoever believes this
   declaration of our Saviour, and dreads the judgment of the great day,
   ought to take heed that he offend not with his tongue, in this or any
   other kind. Men make but little account of such words now, but they
   shall all be strictly accounted for another day; and what we utter now
   so freely and without blushing, will then strike us dumb, and be matter
   of the greatest shame and confusion to us, in the presence of God and
   his holy angels.

   And so St. Paul, likewise, not only here in the text, does forbid and
   reprove this practice, when he says, "Let no corrupt communication
   proceed out of your mouth: but that which is good to the use of
   edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers:" but in several
   other places of his Epistles he most severely condemns it, as utterly
   misbecoming Christians, and most directly contrary to our most holy
   profession. (Eph. v. 3, 4.) "But fornication, and all uncleanness, or
   covetousness, let it not once be named among you, as becometh saints;
   neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not
   convenient." Here he forbids all lewd and filthy talk, as utterly
   misbecoming the conversation of Christians, who should give no occasion
   to have the vices of this nature so much as once mentioned, much less
   practised among Christians; let not these things, says he, "be once
   named among you, as be cometh saints; but rather giving of thanks."
   Here he directs us to that which is the proper employment of the
   tongue, and one of the chief ends of speech; which is to praise and
   glorify God, and not to dishonour him by lewd and filthy talk. And this
   he urgeth again, as the proper fruit of our lips: (ver. 20.) "Giving
   thanks always for all things unto God and the Father, in the name of
   our Lord Jesus Christ."

   And at the 5th verse of this chapter he appeals to Christians, whether
   they had not been constantly taught and instructed, that all lewdness
   and filthiness, not only in act but in word, will certainly shut men
   out of the kingdom of heaven. "For this (says he,) ye know, that no
   whoremonger, nor unclean person, (referring to those several sorts of
   uncleanness he had mentioned before; among which is filthy and foolish
   talk) hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God." The
   apostle here speaks to the gentile Christians, who were newly converted
   from heathenism, and had been accustomed to make slight of these kinds
   of sin, which were so common among the idolatrous heathen, and part of
   the worship of their obscene deities: but he tells them that the
   Christian religion which they had embraced, required another sort of
   conversation, and did strictly enjoin all manner of purity, both of
   heart and life, in all our words and actions; and that "as he that hath
   called us is holy, so we should be holy in all manner of conversation."
   And whatever false teachers might insinuate, as if the Christian
   religion did allow a greater liberty in these things, and made that "a
   cloak for licentiousness," hereby "turning the grace of God," that is,
   the doctrine of the gospel, "into lasciviousness," as St. Jude speaks,
   (ver. 4.) yet they would certainly find things quite otherwise in the
   issue, and that God, who punished the heathen for these vices, and sent
   such terrible judgments upon them, would much less let Christians go
   unpunished, that should be found guilty of them: (Ephes. v. 6.) "Let.no
   man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the
   wrath of God upon the children of disobedience;" that is, the heathen
   world, who continued still in their infidelity, and lived in the
   practice of those sins; and would fall much more heavily upon
   Christians, if, after they had embraced this holy religion, they should
   allow themselves in any of those vile and impure practices, which they
   had been guilty of before, and which they had so solemnly promised to
   renounce and put off in their baptism.

   And so likewise, (Coloss. iii. 5-7.) "Mortify therefore your members
   which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate
   affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: for
   which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
   disobedience," or unbelief; "in the which ye also walked sometime, when
   ye lived in them;" that is, whilst ye were heathens, and conversed
   among them, ye practised these vices; "but now," that is, now that you
   are become Christians, "put off all these, anger, wrath, malice,
   evil-speaking, filthy communication." Ye see that "filthy
   communication" is reckoned among those sins of the gentiles, which
   Christians were utterly to quit and forsake, as contrary to the purity
   of the Christian profession. And so St. Paul tells the Thessalonians;
   (1 Thess. iv. 7.) "God hath not called us unto uncleanness; but unto
   holiness." And he gives the same precept to the Colossians: (chap. iv.
   6.) "Let your speech be always with grace," that is, acceptable and
   useful, something that is worthy the hearing, "seasoned with salt,"
   that is with prudence and discretion, which should always govern our
   speech, and keep it within the bounds of sobriety and modesty. As our
   talk should not be insipid and foolish, so much less rotten and
   unsavoury, immodest and lewd.

   And in his Epistle to the Philippians, (chap. iv. 8.) he earnestly
   recommends the virtues that are directly contrary to this vice:
   "Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things are honest, hosa semna`,
   whatsoever things are grave or venerable, hosa hagna`, whatsoever
   things are pure or chaste, think on these things;" that is, have great
   regard to them in your conversation and behaviour, there being no sort
   of virtue which the Christian religion does not strictly enjoin and
   exact from us; and consequently, whatsoever is light and frothy, and
   much more whatever is lewd and filthy, ought to be banished from the
   conversation of Christians, as utterly inconsistent with the gravity
   and purity of that holy profession.

   And the same apostle tells us, that all the promises of the gospel are
   so many arguments and obligations to purity and holiness: (2 Cor. vii.
   1.) "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting," or
   practising, "holiness in the fear of God." And on the contrary, St.
   John tells us, that all impurity will be an effectual bar to our
   entrance into heaven; (Rev. xxi. 27.) speaking of the new Jerusalem, he
   says, "There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth,
   neither whatsoever worketh abomination." So that, if either the
   promises or threatenings of the gospel have any influence upon us, they
   will effectually restrain this vicious practice.

   VII. And lastly, All impure and filthy communication grieves the Holy
   Spirit, and drives him away from us. And therefore, after he had
   forbidden this vice here in the text, that "no corrupt communication
   proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of
   edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers;" he immediately
   adds, "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed to
   the day of redemption;" hereby intimating, that all corrupt and filthy
   communication "grieves the Holy Spirit of God," that blessed Spirit
   which is "the seal and earnest of our redemption;" that is, as the
   apostle himself explains it, of "the redemption of our bodies, from the
   bondage of corruption," by the resurrection of them to eternal life.
   For it is the Spirit of God dwelling in us, which shall raise our
   bodies at the last day, and make them partakers of a blessed
   immortality. So the apostle says expressly: (Rom. viii. 11.) "But if
   the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he
   that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal
   bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." If we defile our bodies,
   or any members of them by uncleanness, we "grieve the Spirit of God
   which dwells in us," and force him out of his habitation; that blessed
   Spirit, which should "quicken our mortal bodies," and is both the earn
   est and the cause of their resurrection to eternal life. For our
   bodies, as well as our souls, are "the temples of the Holy Ghost, and
   the Spirit of God dwells in them;" and we banish him out of his temple
   whenever we profane it by lewd and filthy speech.

   And the apostle useth this argument more than once, to deter Christians
   more especially from the sins of uncleanness. (1 Cor. iii. 16, 17.)
   "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God
   dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God
   destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are." The Holy
   Spirit of God sanctifieth the place where he more especially resides,
   and makes it his temple; and so are our bodies as well as our souls; as
   the same apostle expressly tells us; (chap. vi. ver. 18-20.) where he
   argues against the sins of uncleanness, which are committed in the
   body, and by the members and instruments of it, from this
   consideration, that our bodies are the temples of the Holy Ghost. "Flee
   fornication," says he. "Every sin a man doeth, is without the body: but
   he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body;" that is,
   the body is not the immediate instrument of other sins, as it is of
   those of uncleanness; and then it follows, "What! know ye not that your
   body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of
   God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore
   glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's." Under
   the name of fornication the apostle comprehends all the sins of
   uncleanness, of which any member of the body is an instrument: so that
   the lasciviousness of the eye, or ear, or tongue, is a polluting and
   profaning this temple of God, and drives the Holy Spirit of God out of
   his possession.

   And whenever the Spirit of God departs from us, we cease to be the
   children of God, and forfeit the earnest of our eternal inheritance.
   "Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ," says the same apostle,
   (Rom. viii. 8, 9.) "he is none of his;" that is, he does not belong to
   him; in plain English, he is no Christian. So that, as we would not
   forfeit the title of Christians, and the blessed hope of a glorious
   resurrection, we must be very careful that "no corrupt communication
   proceed out of our mouth," lest hereby we "grieve the Holy Spirit of
   God, by which we are sealed unto the day of redemption."

   I have now done with this argument, and what I have said concerning
   immodest and unchaste words, is of equal force against lascivious
   books, and pictures, and plays; all which do alike intrench upon
   natural modesty, and for that reason are equally forbidden and
   condemned by the Christian religion; and therefore it may suffice to
   have named them. I shall only speak a few words concerning plays,
   which, as they are now ordered among us, are a mighty reproach to the
   age and nation.

   To speak against them in general, may be thought too severe, and that
   which the present age cannot so well brook, and would not perhaps be so
   just and reasonable; because it is very possible, they might be so
   framed, and governed by such rules, as not only to be innocently
   diverting, but instructing and useful, to put some vices and follies
   out of countenance, which cannot perhaps be so decently reproved, nor
   so effectually exposed and corrected any other way. But as the stage
   now is, they are intolerable, and not fit to be permitted in a
   civilized, much less in a Christian nation. They do most notoriously
   minister both to infidelity and vice. By the profaneness of them, they
   are apt to instil bad principles into the minds of men, and to lessen
   the awe and reverence which all men ought to have for God and religion:
   and by their lewdness they teach vice, and are apt to infect the minds
   of men, and dispose them to lewd and dissolute practices.

   And therefore I do not see, how any person, pretending to sobriety and
   virtue, and especially to the pure and holy religion of our blessed
   Saviour, can, without great guilt, and open contradiction to his holy
   profession, be present at such lewd and immodest plays, much less
   frequent them, as too many do, who yet would take it very ill to be
   shut out of the communion of Christians, as they would most certainly
   have been in the first and purest ages of Christianity.

   To conclude this whole discourse: Let us always remember, that gravity
   and modesty in all our behaviour and conversation, in all our words and
   actions, are duties indispensably required by the Christian religion,
   and the great fences of piety and virtue, and therefore ought with
   great conscience and care to be preserved and kept inviolable: and when
   these fences are once broken down, there is a wide gap made for almost
   any sin and vice to enter in. Immodest words do naturally tend to
   "corrupt good manners," both in ourselves and others.

   There is none of us, but would reckon it a very great infelicity to be
   deprived of that noble and useful faculty of speech, which is so
   peculiar to man, and which, next to our reason and understanding, doth
   most remarkably distinguish us from the brute beasts: but it is a much
   greater unhappiness to have this faculty, and to abuse it to vile and
   lewd purposes. The first may be only our misfortune: but this can never
   be without great fault, and gross neglect of ourselves; and much better
   had it been for us to have been born dumb, than thus "to turn our glory
   into shame" and guilt, by perverting this excellent gift of God, to the
   corrupting ourselves and others.

   This I hope may be sufficient to restrain men from this vice, which I
   have all this while been speaking against; at least to preserve those
   which are not yet infected from the contagion of it; and I hope to
   reclaim many from so bad a practice. And if any be so hardened in their
   lewd course, that no counsel of this kind can make impression on them,
   what remains, but to conclude in the words of the angel to St. John,
   (Rev. xxii. 11.) "He that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he
   that is holy, let him be holy still!"

SERMON CCXIV.

  THE TRUE REMEDY AGAINST THE TROUBLES OF LIFE.

   Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in
   me.--John xiv. 1.

   IN which words our blessed Saviour does, upon a particular occasion,
   prescribe an universal remedy against trouble. And the particular
   occasion of this consolatory discourse which our Saviour here makes to
   his disciples, was this: he had often told them of his sufferings; but
   the conceit which they had entertained of his temporal reign, would not
   suffer them to admit any thought of such a thing as the sufferings or
   death of the Messias; and therefore it is said, that "these things did
   not sink into them," and that "they understood them not;" men being
   generally very slow to understand what they do not like, and have no
   mind to. At last our Saviour tells them plainly, that how backward
   soever they were to believe it, the time of his sufferings and death
   was now approaching, and that he should shortly be "betrayed into the
   hands of men," and be "crucified and slain." At this his disciples were
   struck with great fear, and exceedingly troubled, both in contemplation
   of his sufferings, and of their own invaluable loss. To comfort them
   upon this occasion, our Saviour directs his disciples to that course,
   which was not only proper in their present case, but is an universal
   antidote and remedy against all trouble whatsoever, and will not only
   serve to mitigate our trouble, and support our spirits under the fear
   and apprehension of future evils, but under present afflictions and
   sufferings; and to quiet and comfort our minds under the saddest
   condition, and sorest calamities, that can befal us: "Let not your
   hearts be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me."

   He does not only forbid them to be troubled, and counsel them against
   it, such advice is easily given, but not so easily to be followed: but
   he prescribes the proper remedy against trouble, which is trust and
   confidence in God, the great Creator and wise Governor of the world;
   and likewise in himself, the blessed Son of God, and Saviour of
   mankind, "Ye believe in God, believe also in me."

   The words are variously translated: by some indicatively, "Ye do
   believe in God, and ye do believe in me," therefore "be not troubled;"
   by others imperatively, "Believe in God, and believe likewise in me;"
   and then you can have no cause of trouble. Or else the first clause may
   be rendered indicatively, and the latter imperatively; and so our
   translation renders the words, "Ye do believe in God, believe also in
   me;" as you believe in God, the Creator and Governor of the world, so
   "believe also in, me," the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world.
   But which way soever the words be rendered, the sense comes all to one;
   that faith in God, and in our blessed Saviour, are here prescribed as
   the proper and most powerful remedies against trouble: "Let not your
   heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me."

   In the handling of these words I shall do these two things:--

   First, I shall consider what sort of trouble is here forbidden, or with
   what reasonable limitations this general prohibition of our Saviour is
   to be under stood, "Let not your heart be troubled."

   Secondly, I shall endeavour to shew what virtue and force there are in
   the remedy here prescribed by our Saviour, to mitigate and allay our
   trouble, and to support and quiet our minds under it.

   First, We will consider what sort of trouble is here forbidden, and
   with what due and reasonable limitations we are to understand this
   general prohibition of our Saviour to his disciples, "Let not your
   heart be troubled." And this we shall best find out by considering the
   various objects of trouble, together with the several causes or grounds
   of them. And these may all be ranged under these three heads; evils
   past, present, or to come. For the ground of all trouble is some evil,
   either really and in itself so, or what is apprehended by us under that
   notion: and the several kinds of trouble, are either the reflection
   upon evils past, or the sense of an evil that is present, or the fear
   and apprehension of some future evil which threatens us and hangs over
   us.

   I. For the first, The trouble caused by reflection upon evils past,
   this must either be the evil of affliction or sin. The former of these,
   when it is past, is seldom any cause of trouble, the remembrance of
   past sufferings, and the evils which we got over, being rather
   delightful than grievous; so that it is only the evil of sin, the
   reflection whereof is trouble some. And this is that which we call
   guilt, which is an inward vexation, and discontent, and grief of mind,
   arising from the consciousness that we have done amiss, and a fearful
   apprehension of some vengeance and punishment that will follow it; and
   there is no trouble that is comparable to this, when the conscience of
   a sinner is thoroughly awakened.

   Now upon this account our hearts ought to be troubled, and we can
   hardly exceed in it, provided our trouble do not drive us to despair,
   but to repentance: but there can be no suspicion that this comes within
   the compass of our Saviour's prohibition.

   II. As for the troubles caused by the sense of present evils, either of
   loss or suffering, though this do properly enough fall within the
   compass of our Saviour's prohibition, "Let not your heart be troubled,"
   yet it admits of several limitations: therefore, in order to the fixing
   of its due and proper bounds, I shall briefly shew, what trouble for
   present evils and afflictions which are upon us is not forbidden, and
   what is.

   1. We are not here forbidden to have a just and due sense of any evil
   or calamity that is upon us; because this is natural, and we cannot
   help it; for there is a real difference of things in themselves; some
   things are in their nature good and convenient for us, and agreeable
   and delightful to our senses; and other things are in themselves evil,
   that is, naturally displeasing and grievous; and we must not only be
   stoics, but even stocks and stones, if we have not a just sense and
   resentment of this difference. Our blessed Saviour had so; and as he
   was afflicted more than any man, and suffered more than any of the sons
   of men, so was he likewise very sensible of his sufferings, and had a
   natural dread and horror of them; insomuch, that he himself tells us,
   that "his soul was exceeding sorrowful, even to death," upon the
   apprehension of what he was to undergo; which made him pray so
   earnestly, and to repeat that petition so often; "Father, if it be
   possible, let this cup pass from me." Nay, the very anguish of his
   mind, caused by the dread and horror of his sufferings, was so great,
   as to force blood through the pores of his body, so that "he sweat as
   it were thick drops of blood falling upon the ground." And this is not
   to be wondered at, because our blessed Saviour, as he had the greatest
   endowments of human nature in their greatest perfection, so he had a
   perfect sense of the evils and pains and sufferings of it. And all
   philosophy that will not acknowledge loss, and pain, and suffering, to
   be evils, and troublesome and terrible, is either obstinate sullenness,
   or gross hypocrisy.

   2. Nor doth this prohibition of our Saviour exclude natural affection.
   This is a plant which God himself hath planted in human nature, and
   that for very excellent ends and purposes; and having made us men, and
   endowed us with such passions, he does not expect that we should put
   off our nature, and transform ourselves into another sort of creatures
   than what we were when we came out of his own hands. To be without
   natural affection, and to have no affective sense of the loss of the
   nearest relations, is condemned in Scripture, as a mark of the greatest
   degeneracy and depravation of human nature. And therefore we cannot
   imagine that our Saviour did intend to forbid such a moderate and well
   regulated degree of trouble upon these occasions, as is the proper and
   genuine issue of those natural affections, which God himself hath
   implanted in us.

   3. When our Saviour forbids us to be troubled, he doth not forbid us to
   have a just sense of God's judgments, or of his hand, in procuring or
   permitting the evils which befal us; much less of our own sins, which
   are the meritorious cause of them; nay, on the contrary, he expects
   that we should acknowledge his providence, and the justness of it, in
   his severest dealings with us; that we should be "humbled under his
   mighty hand, and turn to him that smites us," and "bear the indignation
   of the Lord patiently, because we have sinned against him." What ever
   is a sign of God's displeasure against us, is a just and reasonable
   cause of trouble to us.

   But when our Saviour here forbids ns to be troubled, he plainly intends
   to prohibit these three things:

   1. Immoderate grief and sorrow for any present affliction or loss,
   without any restraint upon ourselves, so as to let grief loose, and to
   give full scope to it, to let the reins fall out of our hands, so that
   the considerations of reason and religion have no manner of power and
   command over us; to sorrow, as Rachel did for her children, "refusing
   to be comforted." This is unreasonable, and usually of pernicious
   consequence: for no man knows, when he once abandons himself to
   melancholy, and gives way to grief, and lets it pierce his heart, and
   enter into his soul, how it may overwhelm his spirit, and sink it past
   recovery. And to this pitch the trouble of some men for worldly losses
   and disappointments, because it was not restrained and governed at
   first, hath brought them; and it often happens, as St. Paul hath
   observed, the "trouble of the world worketh death."

   I think hardly any man did ever die of grief for his sins, and killed
   himself by laying them to heart. It is well if our sorrow for sin
   proceed to that degree, as to work real repentance and amendment. And
   the reason why our sorrow for sin is commonly moderate and within
   bounds, is because the sorrow and trouble of repentance is always
   reasonable, and reason keeps our grief within bounds; but "the sorrow
   of the world," that is, of covetous and worldly-minded men, who have
   unreasonably set their affections upon this world, hath nothing to set
   bounds and give limits to it. And therefore, by the just judgment of
   God, it sometimes proceeds so far as to work death. Many men's hearts
   have been broken for the loss of an estate, or some great cross and
   disappointment in their worldly affairs and designs. Thus Nabal, upon
   the very apprehension of the danger that he and his estate were in, and
   had so narrowly escaped, was struck with grief to the degree of
   stupidity, so that "his heart died within him, and he became as a
   stone;" and in a few days he died of that grief.

   2. We are not to be troubled for present afflictions and sufferings to
   the degree of impatience and discontent, so as to fret and murmur in
   our hearts against God, and "to charge him foolishly," as if he dealt
   hardly with us, and had not a due regard for us, and an equal
   consideration of our case. For we are all sinners, and always deserve
   to suffer; and therefore whatever temporal evils befal the best men in
   this world, they are always "less than their iniquities have deserved:"
   and yet men are very prone to censure and find fault with God, for the
   evils and calamities which they draw down upon themselves. So Solomon
   observes, (Prov. xix. 3.) "The foolishness of man perverteth his way;
   and his heart fretteth against the Lord." We suffer for our own sins
   and follies, and then are angry with God because we suffer. God is
   angry with us for our sins, and when he is angry with us, and "lifts up
   his hand against us," it becomes us "to humble ourselves under his
   mighty hand;" for "who can stand before him when once he is angry?" But
   we have no cause to fret against him, for the evils which we bring upon
   ourselves: besides that, fretting is not the way to relieve and ease
   us, but to vex and gall us the more.

   3. As to the fear and apprehension of future evils, though we ought to
   have a just sense of them, yet we ought not to be dejected and troubled
   for them to the degree of despondency, so as to conclude ourselves
   miserable and forsaken, utterly lost and undone, and that our case is
   past all help and remedy: we should not be so dejected, as if we were
   destitute of all comfort, and utterly without hope. Hope lies at the
   bottom of the worst condition; for while we are not without God, we can
   never be without hope; so long as the government of the world is in so
   good hands, our case can never be desperate; and therefore we ought to
   rebuke the despondency of our spirits, as David did, (Psal. xliii. 5.)
   "Why art thou so cast down, O my soul? and why art thou so disquieted
   within me? hope in God." And we should support ourselves in the
   greatest dangers and fears as he did, (Psal. iii. 1-3.) "Lord, how are
   they increased that trouble me! how many are they that rise up against
   me! Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in
   God. But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me, my glory, and the lifter up
   of my head."

   And this cause of trouble upon the fear and apprehension of future
   evils, was the case of the disciples, who were mightily dejected and
   disturbed, upon the apprehension of the destitute condition they should
   be in upon our Saviour's departure from them; that they should be
   exposed to a malicious world, without all manner of protection from
   those innumerable evils and dangers which threatened them. And this I
   shall have most particular respect to in my following discourse, as
   being more particularly intended by our Saviour, and being one of the
   most common causes of trouble in this world. I proceed, therefore, in
   the

   Second place, To consider, what force there is in the remedy here
   prescribed by our Saviour, to mitigate and allay our troubles, both in
   respect of our present evils and sufferings, and the danger and
   apprehension of future evils, and to support and comfort our minds
   under them. "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
   also in me."

   In which words our Saviour prescribes a double remedy against trouble.

   First, Faith in God, the great Creator and wise Governor of the world.
   "Ye believe in God," or, "Believe ye in God," to which he adds, in the

   Second place, Faith likewise in himself, the Son of God, and the
   Saviour of men. "Ye believe in God, believe also in me." Not as if
   faith in God were not a sufficient ground of consolation and sup port
   to our minds, but to acquaint us, that a firm faith in him who is the
   Son of God and Saviour of the world, would very much tend to confirm
   and strengthen our trust and confidence in God; as will clearly appear,
   when I come to shew what peculiar consideration of comfort and support
   the Christian religion offers to us, beyond what the common light and
   reason of mankind, from the considerations of the Divine nature and
   perfections, do suggest to us. And to explain the full strength and
   force of these two considerations, I shall do these two things:

   First, I shall endeavour to shew, What considerations of comfort and
   support the belief of a God, and the natural notions and
   acknowledgments of mankind concerning him, do afford to good men, for
   the allaying and mitigating of their fears and troubles. And,

   Secondly, What farther considerations faith in Christ, and the firm
   belief of the Christian religion, do afford to this purpose. "Ye
   believe in God, believe also in me."

   First, To shew, what considerations of comfort and support the belief
   of a God, and the natural notions and acknowledgments of mankind
   concerning him, do afford to good men, for the allaying and mitigating
   of their fears and troubles; which I shall briefly deduce thus:

   The firm belief and persuasion of a God, does necessarily infer the
   belief of his infinite power, and wisdom, and holiness, and goodness;
   for these are necessary and essential perfections of the Divine nature,
   without which we cannot conceive such a being as God is. Now from these
   essential perfections of the Divine nature, these two principles do
   naturally result:

   I. That his providence governs the world, and administers the affairs
   of it, particularly of mankind, with great goodness and wisdom.

   II. That his providence is more peculiarly concerned for good men, and
   that he hath a very tender and particular care of them, and regard to
   them.

   Now these two principles, concerning which I have discoursed at large
   upon another occasion, [2] afford us this fourfold ground of comfort,
   under all the evils that we labour under, and are afraid of.

   1. If God govern the world, then we and all our interests and
   concernments are certainly in the best and safest hands; and where, if
   we knew how to wish well and wisely for ourselves, we should desire to
   have them; and therefore, why should our hearts be troubled at any
   thing that doth or can befal us? [3]

   2. Another ground of comfort is, that if the providence of God have a
   particular regard to good men, and favour for them, then we may be
   assured, that if we be careful of our duty to God, and rely upon his
   goodness, and refer ourselves to his plea sure, in the final issue and
   result of things, all shall turn to our good, and conspire in our
   happiness; nay, if we make the best use of the evils and afflictions
   which befal us, and bear them as we ought, we ourselves may do a great
   deal to turn them to our benefit and advantage; to the bettering of our
   minds, and the improvement of our virtues, and the increase of our
   reward. And why should we be troubled so much at things which may prove
   so many ways beneficial to us, if it be not our own fault? which tend
   to our good, and will end in it, if we will but "let patience have its
   perfect work," as St. James shews, (chap. v. 11.) in the instance of
   Job, whose admirable patience had a glorious end and reward, even in
   this world; "You have heard (says he) of the patience of Job, and of
   the end God made with him; that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender
   mercy." Job, upon a dunghill, is no whit inferior to the most glorious
   prince that ever sat upon a throne. Some men have been more
   illustrious, and, according to the true rate and value of things, more
   considerable for their patience, and courage, and constancy of mind, in
   great afflictions and sufferings, than the greatest pomp and prosperity
   in the world could possibly have made them. Some have borne poverty,
   and sickness, and reproach, and persecution, and exquisite pain and
   torments, with so much decency, with such greatness of mind, and
   firmness of resolution, as might justly provoke the envy of the
   greatest and wealthiest, and, to all outward appearance, the happiest
   persons that ever were in the world. M. Antoninus was an excellent good
   man, and perhaps the greatest emperor that ever was, for in his time
   the Roman empire was at its greatest extent; and yet it is hard to say,
   whether Epictetus, whose example I proposed before, and who lived about
   the same time with this great and good emperor: I say, it is not easy
   to say, whether this poor man, Epictetus, who was depressed into the
   lowest and most afflicted condition that human nature is almost capable
   of, were not, by reason of those admirable virtues which shined so
   brightly in that dark and dismal condition, his invincible patience,
   his perfect submission to the providence of God, the perpetual
   cheerfulness and serenity, the unmoveable constancy and equality of his
   mind, according to a right estimation of things, the greater and more
   glorious person of the two.

   So that good men are always secure, as to the main and the essentials
   of happiness; under all out ward afflictions and sufferings of the
   body, they may still retain a wise and virtuous mind, which is "that
   good part which cannot be taken from them;" and if they retain that,
   they are sure of the favour of God, and the countenance of Heaven,
   which alone are sufficient to make any condition happy.

   3. Another ground of comfort is, that if God govern the world, he can
   either prevent or divert the greatest evils that threaten us; or if
   they come upon us, he can support us under them, and deliver us out of
   them: and if we be good, and it be for our good, he will do one of
   these for us; either he will prevent the evil, that it shall not come,
   if that be best for us; or if the affliction fall heavy upon us, he
   will support us under it: and if our strength be increased in
   proportion to the weight of our burthen, it is as well as if we had
   escaped it, nay, perhaps, much better, considering the benefit and
   reward of it. But how grievous soever it be, he can, when he pleaseth,
   deliver us from it; and he will do it presently if it be for our good;
   and if it be not, it is not really desirable to us to be so soon freed
   from it.

   4. And lastly, which is consequent upon the former particulars, it is
   certain, upon the whole matter, and upon the balancing of all accounts,
   that in every condition good men have much more cause of comfort and
   joy, than of dejection and trouble. Let our fears be as great, and our
   present sufferings as heavy as they can, there are considerations of so
   great moment to be put into the other scale, as will infinitely
   outweigh them, and make them seem light. The considerations of our
   immortal duration in a future state, and of the endless and unspeakable
   happiness of another world, are of that solidity and weight, that
   "these light afflictions," as the apostle calls them, "which are but
   for a moment, are in no wise worthy to be compared with them."

   What though our passage through this world be never so stormy and
   tempestuous, we shall at last arrive at a safe port. Heaven is a sure
   sanctuary and retreat from all the evils and afflictions which we are
   liable to, and which many times pursue us so close in this mortal
   state. It is but exercising our faith and patience for a very little
   while, and all will be well with us; much better than if we had never
   been afflicted, and had been wholly exempted from all sorts of
   sufferings in this world. We have no pretence to "the crown of life,"
   if we do not overcome; and there can be no conquest without some
   conflict.

   But because the Christian religion does give us the greatest, if not
   the only firm assurance of the happiness of another life, which, when
   all is done, is the great support and cordial of our fainting spirits,
   under the troubles and afflictions of this life, therefore I shall not
   now enlarge farther upon it, but refer it to the second head of my
   discourse, which I proposed to speak to in the next place, viz. What
   farther considerations of comfort and support, faith in Christ, and the
   firm belief of the Christian religion, do afford to good men for the
   allaying and mitigating of their fears and troubles. "Let not your
   heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me." But this I
   shall refer to some other opportunity.

SERMON CCXV.

  THE TRUE REMEDY AGAINST THE TROUBLES OF LIFE.

   Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in
   me.--John xiv. 1.

   I HAVE considered these words as an universal remedy against trouble:
   and in shewing what virtue and force there are in this remedy, I have
   considered,

   First, That faith in God is a proper and most powerful means to
   mitigate and allay our trouble, and to support and quiet our minds
   under it.

   I now proceed, in the second place, to shew what farther considerations
   of comfort and support, faith in Christ, and the firm belief of the
   Christian religion, do afford good men, for the allaying and mitigating
   of their greatest fears and troubles. "Let not your heart be troubled:
   ye believe in God, believe also in me." I shall mention these five:

   I. Faith in Christ, or the belief of the Christian religion, gives us
   full and perfect assurance of immortality, and of the glorious and
   eternal rewards of another world.

   II. It promiseth to every sincere Christian the inward assistance, and
   support, and comfort, of God's Holy Spirit, to bear up the weakness of
   human nature under its heaviest pressures of fear, or grief, or pain.

   III. It assures us of the special efficacy of our prayers with God,
   either for our deliverance from trouble, or for the aids and supports
   of his grace under it.

   IV. It propounds to us the best and most admirable pattern that ever
   was, of patience and constancy of mind under the apprehension of
   approaching evils, or the sense of present sufferings; and of a
   contented and cheerful submission to the will of God, in the saddest
   condition to which human nature is incident.

   V. It assures us of a most compassionate, and prevalent, and perpetual
   patron, and advocate, and intercessor with God for us.

   I. Faith in Christ, or the doctrine of the Christian religion, gives a
   full and perfect assurance of immortality, and of the glorious and
   eternal rewards of another world. Of this the world was very doubtful
   and uncertain before, and had but obscure and wavering apprehensions
   about it. And though the generality of mankind had naturally some
   glimmering apprehensions of another life after this, and secret hopes
   and expectations of a future reward for good men that were hardly used
   in this world; yet the philosophers had wrangled and disputed the
   matter into so much uncertainty, that mankind were very much staggered
   about it, and the doubts and difficulties that were raised about it did
   very much break the force and weaken the influence of so weighty a
   consideration.

   Thus it was among the gentiles. And under the law of Moses, though the
   Jews had such apprehensions of their own immortality, and of a future
   state of rewards and punishments, as natural light suggested to them;
   yet that covenant and dispensation added but very little to the
   clearing of those notions, and the strengthening of this persuasion in
   the minds of men; it did rather suppose it, than add any new strength
   and force to it: for, under that dispensation, the eyes of men were
   generally fixed upon temporal promises and threatenings: though, as the
   times of the Messias grew nearer, and the sufferings of that people
   sharper, they began to have clearer apprehensions of a resurrection to
   another and better life; it being natural to men when they are
   destitute of present comfort, to cherish and make much of the future
   hopes of a better condition.

   And, therefore, we find that the people of the Jews, when they had been
   long exercised with great afflictions, began to comfort and support
   themselves with the hopes of a blessed resurrection to a better life;
   as is evident from the history of the seven brethren in the Maccabees,
   who, with great patience and courage, bore up under the most exquisite
   torments, in confidence of being raised again to a blessed state in
   another world. And of these it is the apostle certainly speaks, (Heb.
   xi. 35.) when he says, that "some were tortured, not accepting
   deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection."

   But the apostle tells us expressly, (2 Tim. i. 10.) that the clear and
   certain discovery of a future state is owing to the Christian religion,
   and "made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who
   hath abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light by the
   gospel." Not only natural light, but all the revelations which God had
   made to the world before, had this weakness and imperfection in them,
   that they did not give men the clear discovery and full assurance of
   another life; and consequently, had but little efficacy in comparison
   to engage men to their duty, or to sup port and comfort them under
   their sufferings: and therefore the apostle to the Hebrews calls the
   gospel, in opposition to the law, "the power of an end less life,"
   (Heb. vii. 16.) intimating to us, how great a force and influence the
   clear apprehensions of another life are apt to have upon the minds of
   men. For which reason, the same apostle tells us, (ver. 18, 19.) that
   the law was too weak to raise men to the perfection of virtue and
   goodness, because it did not work strongly enough upon the hopes of
   men, by the greatness and clearness of its promises; and that for this
   weakness it was removed, and a more powerful and awakening dispensation
   brought in the place of it: "For verily (says he), there is an
   annulling of the commandment going before," meaning the law of Moses,
   which by the gospel was abrogated and made void, "for the weakness and
   unprofitableness of it; for the law made nothing perfect, but the
   bringing in of a better hope did." For which reason, (chap. viii. 6.)
   he calls the covenant of the gospel, "a better covenant," because it
   "was established upon better promises," viz. "the promise of an eternal
   inheritance," as the same apostle speaks, (chap. ix. 15.) All the
   express promises of the law were only of temporal good things, but the
   promises of the gospel are of eternal life and happiness: "This is the
   promise which he hath promised us, even eternal life," says St. John,
   (1 John ii. 25.)

   Now the firm persuasion of another life, does not only answer that
   great difficulty and objection against the providence of God, from the
   seeming in justice and inequality of his dealings with good and bad men
   in this world, because the eternal rewards and punishments of another
   world will set all things straight, and make abundant amends to good
   men, for all their sufferings and afflictions here; and will render the
   past prosperity of bad men one of the greatest aggravations of their
   misery: as it is said of Babylon, (Rev. xviii. 7.) "How much she hath
   glorified herself and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow
   give her." In like manner God will deal with wicked men in another
   world; their torments shall rise in proportion to the pleasure and
   prosperity they have enjoyed and abused in this world. This remarkable
   change of condition which shall befal good and bad men in another
   world, is set forth to us in a very lively and affecting manner in the
   parable of the rich man and Lazarus; (Luke xvi. 25.) where Abraham is
   represented speaking thus to the rich man; "Son, remember that thou in
   thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil
   things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented." "He is
   comforted" in proportion to his sufferings in this world: "and thou art
   tormented" in proportion to the sensual pleasures and luxuries of thy
   former life. Men under great want and sufferings, are apt to think
   their lot in this world very hard, and yet upon the whole matter, and
   taking all things into consideration, who would not much rather choose
   to be Lazarus with his hard fortune in this world, and everlasting
   consolation in the other; than the rich man drowned in pleasure in this
   world, and tormented in flames in the other?--I say, the firm belief of
   another life, does not only answer this objection against the Divine
   providence; but does likewise minister abundant comfort and matter of
   joy to good men, under all their fears and troubles in this world. Nay,
   this consideration alone, of a blessed immortality in another world, of
   which only the Christian religion hath given us full and undoubted
   assurance, is of that weight and moment, as to contribute more to the
   support of our spirits under the evils and calamities of this life,
   than all the considerations of philosophy put together. They are many
   of them pleasant and pretty, and fit enough to entertain and divert a
   man's mind under a slight trouble; but they are too speculative and
   refined for common capacities, too thin and weak to bear any great
   stress, and to support and relieve a man's mind under a sore and heavy
   affliction: but this is a consideration which hath strength and
   substance in it, that all things will end in our unspeakable happiness,
   and that this happiness shall have no end. This the apostle St. Paul
   speaks of as a proper consideration of comfort, of which we are assured
   by the Christian religion, that all the evils of this life shall, in
   the last issue and result of things, co-operate to our happiness: (Rom.
   viii. 28.) "We know (says he) that all things work together for good to
   them that love God." And, (2 Cor. iv. 16-18.) "For which cause we faint
   not," &c. The apostle gives us an account how they were afflicted and
   persecuted, and what it was that supported them under all their
   sufferings: (ver. 8-11.) "We are troubled on every side, yet not
   distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not
   forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed. Al ways bearing about in the
   body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be
   made manifest in our body. For we which live are alway delivered unto
   death for Jesus sake." And then he tells us what it was kept up the
   spirits of Christians under these sharp sufferings, viz. the assurance
   which the Christian religion gives us of a resurrection to a better and
   happier life: (ver. 14.) "Knowing that he which raised up the Lord
   Jesus, shall raise us up also by Jesus." And then it follows, (ver.
   16.) "For which cause we faint not: but though our outward man perish,
   yet the inward man is renewed day by day;" that is, though our bodies
   be wasted and weakened, yet every day we grow stronger in the
   resolution of our minds, be cause "our light affliction, which is but
   for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of
   glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
   things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal;
   but the things which are not seen are eternal." And then at the
   beginning of the next chapter, he still urgeth the same consideration
   of comfort, that so soon as we pass out of the troubles of this life,
   we shall enter upon the happiness of the other. "For we know," that is,
   we Christians are assured, "that if our earthly house of this
   tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made
   with hands, eternal in the heavens." Here you see is the great ground
   of their confidence and comfort in the worst condition, and under the
   most grievous persecutions which they were continually exposed to.

   And therefore our Saviour and his apostles make no scruple to pronounce
   those persons blessed, who in respect of their sufferings seemed to be
   of all men in the world the most miserable; and they pronounce them
   happy, upon this very account of their sufferings. (Matt. v. 10-12.)
   "Blessed are they (says our Saviour) which are persecuted for
   righteousness' sake; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are
   ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all
   manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice, and be
   exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven." Great sufferings
   for God in this world, do entitle us, by virtue of this gracious
   promise of our Lord, to a glorious reward in the other. So likewise St.
   James exhorts Christians to rejoice in their sufferings: (James i. 2.)
   "My brethren, account it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations."
   And, (chap. v. 11.) "Behold, (says he)! we count them happy which
   endure." And St. Peter to the same purpose, (1 Pet. iv. 14.) "If ye be
   persecuted for righteousness sake, happy are ye." So solid a comfort to
   men under all the troubles and afflictions of this world, is that firm
   assurance which the Christian religion gives us of a future happiness,
   as to bring even the greatest miseries which in this life we are liable
   to, in some sense, under the notion of blessedness.

   And this was not only fine talk, like the glorious brags of the stoics;
   but the primitive Christians, in infinite examples, gave the real proof
   and evidence of it, in their constant and cheerful behaviour under the
   most cruel and intolerable torments. Non magna loquimur, sed vivimus,
   says Tertullian, in the name of the Christians: "We do not talk great
   things, but do them; and demonstrate the real effect of our words and
   profession in our lives and actions." Never did the arguments fetched
   from another world, and the assurance of a blessed immortality, display
   their force and virtue more, than in the joyful sufferings of the first
   Christians, and their generous contempt of all that was dear to them in
   this world, "in hope of that eternal life; which God, that cannot lie,
   hath promised;" and which the Son of God hath insured to them, by his
   resurrection from the dead.

   II. The Christian religion promiseth to every sincere Christian, the
   inward assistance and support and comfort of God's Holy Spirit, to bear
   up the weakness of human nature under its heaviest pressures of fear or
   sufferings. And this is peculiar to the Christian religion: for though
   the providence of God did take particular care of good men in all ages,
   and he did always in some good measure assist them to do their duty,
   and afford comfort and support to them under great trials and
   sufferings; yet God never made so express and general a promise of this
   to all good men, as he hath done by the Christian religion. Never was
   so constant a presence and influence of the Divine Spirit vouchsafed
   and assured to men under any dispensation, as that of the gospel;
   wherein the Spirit of God is promised to all that sincerely embrace the
   Christian religion, to reside and dwell in them, not only to all the
   purposes of sanctification and holiness, but of support and comfort
   under all troubles and sufferings; for which reason the gospel is
   called "the ministration of the Spirit," and is upon this account said
   to be "more glorious" than any other revelation which God had ever made
   to mankind. And therefore this is said to be essential to every
   Christian, to have the Spirit of God dwell in him. (Rom. viii. 9, 10.)
   Speaking of all true Christians, "Ye are (saith St, Paul) not in the
   flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
   Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his." So
   that every sincere Christian "is made partaker of the promise of the
   Spirit through faith;" that is, by his belief of the Christian
   religion, he is under the immediate conduct and influence of God's Holy
   Spirit, and hath this blessed Guide and Comforter always present with
   him, nay, continually dwelling and residing in him, if we do not grieve
   and quench and drive him away from us by our ill treatment of him, and
   resistance of his blessed motions.

   And this promise of the Spirit, our Saviour had a very particular
   respect to, when he prescribes faith in himself as a special remedy
   against that trouble which possessed their minds, upon the apprehension
   of his departure from them; and therefore he tells them so often, that
   when he was gone from them, he would send them another Comforter or
   Advocate, who should undertake their cause, and would stand by them in
   their greatest troubles and temptations. He tells them, that he himself
   would be an advocate for them in heaven: but be cause that was at a
   great distance, and might not be so sensible a comfort to them, he
   promiseth to send them another Advocate, that should be present with
   them here on earth, and upon all occasions undertake their patronage
   and defence. So that, all things considered, he assures them there was
   so little reason to be troubled at his departure from them, that they
   had cause rather to be glad of it, because it would turn to their great
   advantage; and instead of the benefit of his outward teaching and
   presence, they should have the inward presence and teaching of his
   Spirit, and the continual aids and supports of his grace. "I go my way,
   (says he, John xvi. 5-7.)--I go my way to him that sent me, and none of
   you asketh me, Whither goest thou? but because I have said these things
   unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless, I tell you the
   truth; it is expedient for you, that I go away: for if I go not away,
   the Comforter will not come unto you: but if I depart, I will send him
   unto you." And so the evangelist tells us before, (chap. vii. 39.) that
   the Spirit was not to be given, till Jesus was first glorified. "This
   (says he) spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him
   should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given, be cause Jesus
   was not yet glorified;" plainly declaring, that according to the wise
   dispensation of God, it was so ordered, that the sending of the Holy
   Ghost for the propagating of the gospel, by those miraculous powers
   which were to be conferred upon the first publishers of it, and for the
   supporting and comforting of Christians under the sharp trials and
   sufferings to which they were to be exposed, was the fruit of "Christ's
   ascension into heaven," and "his sitting at the right hand of the
   Majesty on high," and the first boon which he should obtain of his
   Father, by the virtue and power of his intercession. "I will pray the
   Father," says he, (ver. 16. of this chapter) "and he shall send you
   another Advocate, the Spirit of truth, and he shall abide with you for
   ever." "He shall send you an other Comforter;" so our translation
   renders the word para'kletos, but it most properly signifies "an
   Advocate, or Patron," that undertakes our defence and pleads our cause
   for us. And this the Holy Ghost in a most eminent and remarkable manner
   was to the apostles and first Christians, when they were called to
   answer for themselves before kings and governors. They were generally
   men of low condition and mean breeding, easily dashed out of
   countenance before great men; and therefore our Saviour promised that
   the Holy Ghost should be their Advocate, and should prompt and assist
   them in the pleading of their cause. (Matt. x. 18, 19.) "Ye shall be
   brought before governors and kings for my sake; but when they deliver
   you up, take no thought how, or what you shall speak, for it shall be
   given you in that same hour what ye shall speak: for it is not you that
   speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you." Or, as it
   is in St. Luke, (chap. xii. ver. 12.) "The Holy Ghost shall teach you
   in the same hour what ye ought to say." And yet more fully, (chap. xxi.
   ver. 12-15.) where, speaking again of their being brought before kings
   and rulers for his name's sake, he gives them this charge, "Settle it
   therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer;
   for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries
   shall not be able to gain say or resist."

   And this promise we find remarkably made good to St. Stephen, (Acts vi.
   10.) of whom it is there said, that "his enemies were not able to
   resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake." And to St. Paul
   likewise, when he was first called to answer for himself at Rome, as he
   himself tells Timothy; (2 Tim. iv. 16, 17.) "At my first answer, no man
   stood with me; but all men forsook me: notwithstanding the Lord stood
   with me, and strengthened me."

   And though this was extraordinary, yet all Christians have, by virtue
   of this promise, the ordinary assistance and comfort of God's Holy
   Spirit in all their troubles and afflictions. By this Spirit we may in
   all our distresses with confidence make our addresses to God, "having
   access by one Spirit to the Father," as St. Paul speaks, (Ephes. ii.
   18.) By the same Spirit we are assisted in our prayers, and directed
   many times what to ask of God, suitable to the condition which his
   providence designs to bring us into; which seems to be the apostle's
   meaning: (Rom. viii. 26.) "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our
   infirmities: for we know not what to pray for as we ought; but the
   Spirit itself maketh intercession for us;" that is, suggests to us such
   requests, as are fit for us to put up to God. By the same Spirit is
   secretly infused into our souls "peace and joy in believing, great
   consolation and good hope through grace." Hence are those expressions
   in Scripture of "the consolation of the Spirit," and of "joy in the
   Holy Ghost," the best cordial in the world in all cases of trouble.

   And in extraordinary cases, good men, by virtue of this promise of the
   Spirit, may expect to be borne up and comforted in a very extraordinary
   and supernatural manner, under the greatest tribulations and sufferings
   "for righteousness sake." This was very signal and remarkable in the
   primitive Christians, who were exposed to the most fierce and cruel
   persecutions; and may still be expected in like cases of extraordinary
   suffering for the testimony of God's truth. "If ye be reproached (saith
   St. Peter, 1 Pet. iv. 14.) for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for
   the Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you." The Spirit of God is
   there promised, to strengthen and support all that suffer for the name
   of Christ, in a very conspicuous and glorious manner; according to that
   prayer of St. Paul, (Col. i. 11.) that Christians might be
   "strengthened with all might, according to God's glorious power, unto
   all long-suffering with joyfulness." For when God exerciseth good men
   with trials more than human, and sufferings which are beyond the
   ordinary rate of human strength and patience to bear, he hath engaged
   himself to assist and endow them with more than human courage and
   resolution. So St. Paul tells the Corinthians, who had not yet felt the
   utmost rage of persecution, (1 Cor. x. 13.) "No temptation (or trial)
   hath yet befallen you, but what is common to men;" nothing but what is
   frequently incident to human nature, and what, by an ordinary
   assistance of God's grace, men may grapple with; but in case God calls
   men to extraordinary sufferings, "He is faithful that hath promised,
   who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will
   with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to
   bear it." And why should we be daunted at the weight of an affliction,
   if we be well assured that our strength shall be in creased in
   proportion to our burden?

   And wherever this promise is not made good there is some defect on our
   part; either men are not sincere in the profession of the truth, and
   then no wonder if they fall for fear of suffering; or they have been
   too confident of themselves, and have not, with that earnestness and
   importunity they ought, prayed to God for his grace and assistance, and
   thereupon God hath justly left them to try their strength against a
   violent and powerful temptation: as he did Peter, who, for all his
   confidence, did upon no very great temptation deny his Saviour; but
   even in this case, where there is truth and sincerity at the bottom,
   God gives to such persons, as he did to Peter, the opportunity of
   recovering themselves by repentance.

   There are three particulars more remain; but I shall proceed no farther
   at this time.

SERMON CCXVI.

  THE TRUE REMEDY AGAINST THE TROUBLES OF LIFE.

   Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in
   me.--John xiv. 1.

   FROM these words I proposed to shew, what force and virtue there are in
   the remedy proposed by our Saviour, to mitigate and allay our troubles;
   and I told you, that our Saviour here prescribes a double remedy.

   First, Faith in God, the great Creator and Governor of the world.

   Secondly, Faith in himself, the Son of God and Saviour of men. I have
   spoken to the first, and have likewise entered upon the

   Second, And here I propounded to shew, what farther considerations of
   comfort and support, faith in Christ, and the firm belief of the
   Christian religion, do afford to good men, for the allaying and
   mitigating of their greatest fears and troubles.

   And I mentioned five:

   I. Faith in Christ gives us full assurance of immortality, and the
   rewards of another world.

   II. It promiseth to every sincere Christian the in ward assistance and
   support of God's Holy Spirit. Thus far I have gone. I now proceed:

   III. It assures us of the special efficacy of our prayers with God,
   either for our deliverance from trouble, or for the aids and supports
   of his grace under it.

   Now concerning the great efficacy of our prayers with God, there are
   several very particular and remarkable promises and declarations in the
   New Testament: (Matt. vii. 7.) "Ask, and it shall be given you: seek,
   and ye shall find: knock, and it shall be opened unto you." (Matt. xxi.
   22.) "And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
   shall receive." (John xv. 7.) "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in
   you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you." But
   then he directs us to put up our petitions to God in his name, as the
   way to make them prevalent: (John xiv. 13, 14.) "And whatsoever ye
   shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified
   in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it." And
   (chap. xvi. 23, 24.) he repeats this promise again for their support
   and comfort under the tribulations which they should endure. "And in
   that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
   Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask and ye shall receive,
   that your joy may be full." And, again, (ver. 26, 27.) "At that day ye
   shall ask in my name: and I say unto you, that I will pray the Father
   for you: for the Father himself loveth you." Reassures them of God's
   merciful inclination towards them; and if it would add any thing to
   their comfortable assurance of having their prayers heard, he could
   have told them, "that he would pray the Father for them." St. James
   particularly comforts the Christians under their trials upon this
   consideration, that God is ready to give wisdom and strength to demean
   ourselves as we ought under sufferings, if we heartily beg it of him:
   (James i. 2-5.) "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
   temptations, knowing this, that the trial of your faith worketh
   patience: but let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be
   perfect and entire, wanting nothing." And since this requires great
   wisdom, to bear great afflictions with patience, therefore he adds,
   that God is always ready to grant this wisdom and grace to those that
   heartily beg it of him. "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,
   that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be
   given him." (1 John iii. 22.) "And whatsoever we ask, we receive of
   him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are
   pleasing in his sight." And, (chap. v. 14, 15.) "And this is the
   confidence that we have in him," that is, we Christians: for he had
   said before, "These things have I written unto you, that believe on the
   name of the Son of God;" and then it follows, "And this is the
   confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to
   his will, he heareth us: and if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever
   we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him;"
   that is, though we have not presently the thing we prayed for, yet we
   are as sure of it as if we had it. The earnest prayer of every sincere
   Christian, is very powerful and available with God. So St. James
   assures us: (chap. v. 16.) "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
   man availeth much:" much more the united prayers of the faithful. So
   our Saviour declares, (Matt. xviii. 19.) "Again I say unto you, That if
   two of you shall agree on earth, as touching the thing that they shall
   ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven."

   All these promises and declarations do certainly signify a more special
   efficacy and prevalency of the prayers of Christians. And though there
   was a miraculous power of prayer in the primitive times, which is now
   ceased, and of which St. James plainly speaks, (chap. v. 14, 15.) "Is
   any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church, and let
   them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and
   the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him
   up:" yet it is certain that these promises extend farther, to the
   efficacy of the prayers of the faithful in such cases. And so our
   Saviour extends this promise; (Matt. xxi. 22.) for after he had said in
   the verse before, "Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt
   not, ye shall not only do this which is done unto the fig-tree; but
   also, if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou
   cast into the sea, it shall be done:" after this he immediately
   subjoins, "And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
   ye shall receive." Hereby declaring, that the efficacy of the prayers
   of Christians was not limited only to those miraculous effects which
   were but to continue for a time, but that this promise was to be
   extended to the prayers of the faithful in all cases, and all times.

   And, indeed, all the grounds and reasons of the efficacy and prevalency
   of our prayers, which are mentioned in the New Testament, do equally
   concern Christians in all times; as that we pray to God in the name and
   mediation of Jesus Christ, upon which our Saviour very frequently, when
   he makes this promise, lays great stress, and seems to render it as the
   reason of the special efficacy of our prayers. (John xiv. 13, 14.) "And
   whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do, that the Father may
   be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will
   do it." And, (chap. xvi. 23, 24.) "Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
   Heretofore ye have asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall
   receive."

   Another reason of the acceptance and prevalency of our prayers, is,
   that the Spirit of God which dwells in all true Christians does help
   our weakness, and secretly directs us to ask of God those things which
   are according to his will, and does, as it were, intercede for us.
   (Rom. viii. 26.) "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities. For
   we know not what we shall pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
   maketh intercession for us." And, (ver. 27.) "And he that searcheth the
   hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh
   intercession for the saints, according to the will of God." And no
   wonder if those petitions are very prevalent, which we are assisted and
   directed to put up to God, according to his will.

   And this certainly is a great comfort under any trouble, that we can
   have free access to God by prayer, in confidence that he will grant us
   those requests which we put up to him according to his will. And this
   the apostle to the Hebrews mentions more than once, as an argument to
   them to continue steadfast in the profession of their religion,
   notwithstanding the persecution that attended it, because we may at all
   times address ourselves to God in confidence of his gracious help and
   assistance, (Heb. iv. 16.) After he had exhorted them "to hold fast
   their profession," as an encouragement thereto, he adds the free access
   we may have to God for his help and support: "Let us, therefore, (says
   he) come boldly (or with great freedom and confidence) to the throne of
   grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find favour with him for our
   seasonable help and succour." And to the same purpose, (chap. x. 19,
   20.) "Having, therefore, freedom to enter into the holiest, by the
   blood of Jesus, (that is, having access to God in prayer, by Jesus
   Christ;) let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of
   faith;" that is, in perfect confidence that our prayers will be
   graciously heard and answered; upon which he adds, "Let us hold fast
   the profession of our faith without wavering, for he is faithful that
   hath promised:" if we continue steadfast to God, and the profession of
   his truth, he will make good all that he hath promised, both of present
   support under our sufferings, and of the glorious reward of them in
   another life: he will hear our prayers, and grant us the aids and
   supplies of his grace as we stand in need of them.

   IV. The Christian religion propounds to us the best and most admirable
   pattern that ever was of patience and constancy of mind, under the
   apprehension of approaching evils, or the sense of our present
   sufferings, and of a contented and cheerful submission to the will of
   God, in the saddest condition to which human nature is incident; and
   that is the pattern of our blessed Saviour, who, for this reason among
   others, was so great a sufferer in so many kinds, that he might go
   before us in this rough and difficult way, and "leave us an example,
   that we should follow his steps;" that we might learn from him how to
   calm and quiet our spirits, to appease and hush the tumults of our
   passions, under the severest dispensations of God's providence to wards
   us, and to bend our wills to a patient submission to the will of our
   heavenly Father, under the sorest afflictions and sharpest sufferings.
   For though our blessed Saviour prayed so earnestly to his Father, that
   "that bitter cup might pass from him," yet how quietly and cheerfully
   did he resign and yield up himself to the will of God, saying, "Yet not
   my will, but thine be done!" Human nature shrunk and gave back at the
   sight of his dreadful sufferings: but his reason overruled the
   inclinations of nature, and kept him to a steady resolution of
   submitting to the will of God. And therefore, when Peter at tempted his
   rescue, he commanded him to desist, saying, "Put up thy sword into the
   sheath: the cup which my Father hath given, shall I not drink it?"
   (John xviii. 11.) And though he had as quick a sense of suffering as
   any man, yet with what patience did he possess his soul! with what
   meekness and humility of spirit did he bear and yield to it! "He was
   led as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before the shearers is
   dumb, so he opened not his mouth. When he was reviled, he reviled not
   again; when he suffered, he threatened not: but committed himself to
   him that judgeth righteously." And thus "it became the Captain of our
   salvation," that he might be a perfect pattern to us of patience and
   submission to the will of God, of a meek and undisturbed mind, under
   the greatest bodily pains, and the extreme anguish of his soul, "to be
   made perfect by sufferings."

   So that under the greatest present evils, or the most fearful
   apprehension of future evil and suffering, we should fix our eye
   steadfastly upon this great and glorious example of patience and
   constancy and meekness, of a due sense, and yet of a most decent
   behaviour under the heaviest load of affliction, that ever was laid
   upon any of the sons of men; looking, as the apostle exhorts, (Heb.
   xii. 2, 3.) "Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith;
   who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, and
   despised the shame; and considering him, who endured such contradiction
   of sinners against himself, lest we be weary and faint in our minds."

   And surely if we would but let our minds dwell awhile upon this
   consideration of the sufferings of the Son of God, and his great
   meekness and patience, and submission to the will of God under them, it
   would mightily conduce to the mitigating of our trouble, and bringing
   us to "possess our souls in patience," in the saddest condition that
   can befal us.

   And what consideration more proper for us than this, when we are going
   to receive the blessed sacrament, wherein the sufferings of the Son of
   God are represented to us, in the symbols of his body broken, and his
   blood shed for the remission of our sins; and there are many
   considerations which this sight is apt to suggest to us, which are so
   many powerful arguments to quiet and comfort our minds under the
   greatest troubles and sufferings which we are liable to; such as these.

   1. The grievous sufferings which the Son of God was exposed to, do
   clearly shew us, that the good things of this life are not so valuable,
   nor the evils and sufferings of it so considerable, as we are apt to
   fancy and imagine; when the best man that ever lived was so destitute
   of the common comforts and conveniences of human life, and had so large
   a share of the calamities and sufferings of it. If we could but rectify
   our opinion of things, it would go a great way in making any of the
   evils and afflictions of this life tolerable. If God see good to reduce
   us to poverty and want, let us think of him, who, "being Lord of all,
   had not where to lay his head;" who "being rich, for our sakes became
   poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich." To be destitute
   of worldly accommodations cannot seem so dismal and despicable a sight,
   when we consider whose lot it was to live in a low and indigent
   condition; the very consideration whereof doth not only make poverty
   tolerable, but even glorious.

   So likewise when we are "persecuted for righteousness sake," and
   exercised with sufferings and reproaches; when we are ready to be
   discouraged in well-doing by the opposition we meet withal from the
   ingratitude of men, and the malicious interpretation of our good
   actions, perverting the best things, done with the best mind and to the
   best end, to some ill purpose and design; let us "look to Jesus," and
   "consider him who endured such contradiction of sinners against
   himself," and this will help to abate the hideous apprehension of these
   things.

   2. The sufferings of the Son of God are a demonstration to us, that the
   love and favour of God, wherein the chief happiness of man consists,
   are not to be estimated and measured by outward prosperity in this
   world; much less can it be concluded from temporal afflictions and
   sufferings, that God hath no favour and kindness for those whom he
   thinks fit to exercise with them. For we see plainly by this instance
   of the grievous sufferings of his Son, that God may most deeply wound
   and afflict those whom he most dearly loves; and if we can be secure of
   the favour of God, and his loving-kindness, why should our hearts be
   troubled and dismayed at the apprehension of any evil that can befal
   us?

   God may love his children, and yet chasten them very severely: nay,
   that he does so, is rather an argument that they are his children, and
   that he loves them, and is concerned for them. So I am sure the apostle
   teacheth us to argue, (Heb. xii. 6 8.) "For whom the Lord loveth, he
   chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If ye endure
   chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons: for what son is he whom
   the Father chasteneth not? But if you be without chastisement, whereof
   all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons." The heaviest and
   most grievous load of sufferings that was ever laid on any man, God
   permitted to be laid "on his only-begotten Son, the dearly beloved of
   his soul, in whom he was well-pleased." The greater our afflictions
   are, and the more we suffer for "righteousness sake," so much the liker
   are we to the Son of God, and so much the more likely to be the sons
   and children of God. It is true, as the apostle tells us, that "no
   affliction for the present is joyous, but grievous:" but surely it is a
   great mitigation of it, to consider what a glorious example and
   argument of patience our religion proposeth to us, for our
   encouragement under sufferings: that the best man that ever was lived
   in the most afflicted condition; and the greatest sufferer that ever
   was, or can be, was "the dearly-beloved Son of God."

   3. In the victorious sufferings of the Son of God, we see the world
   conquered to our hands, all the terrors and temptations of it disarmed,
   and all its force baffled and broken. This consideration our Saviour
   makes use of to support the faint spirits of his disciples, under the
   melancholy apprehensions which they had of sufferings: (John xvi. 33.)
   "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have
   overcome the world." The great work is done to our hands; affliction
   and death are vanquished and overcome by him. That conquest which "the
   Captain of our salvation" hath already made of all "the powers of
   darkness," renders our victory over them cheap and easy.

   4. The temptations and sufferings of our Lord were greater than ours
   are or can be; for he bore the heavy and insupportable load of ail the
   sins of all mankind, and of the wrath and vengeance due to them. "The
   Lord hath laid on him," saith the prophet, (Isa. liii. 6, 7.) "The Lord
   hath laid on him the iniquity of us all; he was oppressed and
   afflicted." And well might he be oppressed with affliction, who had
   such an intolerable burden as the sins of all mankind to press him
   down. That pas sage is commonly applied to him, and well might he cry
   out in that manner, "Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold
   and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith the Lord
   hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger." Such were the
   sufferings of our Lord, so great and so grievous, as none of us are in
   any degree able to undergo. That weight under which he crouched, would
   crush us; that which he was hardly able to sustain, would certainly
   sink us; and do we complain and "faint in our minds," when but a very
   little part of the punishment due to us only for our own sins is
   inflicted upon us? The consideration of the heavy and "unknown
   sufferings of the Son of God," should make all our afflictions not only
   tolerable, but light.

   5. And yet we have in effect the same support that he had. We are apt
   to be very much disheartened and discouraged at the apprehension of
   sufferings, from the consideration of our own weakness and frailty;
   "but the Spirit of Christ dwells in us," and the same "glorious power
   that raised up Jesus from the dead, works mightily on them that
   believe." St. Paul useth very high expressions in this matter: (Ephes.
   i. 29, 30.) "That ye may know," says he, speaking in general of all
   Christians, "what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward
   who believe according to the working of his mighty power, which he
   wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him on his
   own right hand." So that every sincere Christian is endowed with a kind
   of omnipotency, being able, as St. Paul says of himself, "to do all
   things through Christ strengthening him." We are of ourselves very
   weak, and the temptations and terrors of the world are very powerful;
   but there is a principle residing in every true Christian, that is able
   to bear us up against the world and the power of all its temptations.
   "Whatsoever is born of God (says St. John), overcometh the world: for
   greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world." The Holy
   Spirit of God which dwells in all true Christians, is a more powerful
   principle of resolution and courage and patience, under the sharpest
   trials and sufferings, than that evil spirit which rules in the world
   is to stir up and set on the malice and rage of the world against us.
   "Ye are of God, and have overcome the world: for greater is he that is
   in you, than he that is in the world."

   6. Let us consider farther, for whom and for what our blessed Lord
   suffered. Not for himself; but for our sake: not for any fault of his
   own; for "he had no sin;" but for our sins. He was perfectly innocent:
   but we are great and grievous offenders. We suffer upon our own
   account: but he only for our sakes, and for our salvation. So that the
   example of our Lord's sufferings hath an irresistible force and virtue
   in it, to argue ns into patience and submission. Did he bear the load
   of our sins so willingly? did he "who had no sin" suffer so patiently,
   to free us from eternal sufferings? And shall we who are guilty think
   much to bear a small part of that burden, which he so cheer fully
   underwent for us, and which falls so much short of the due punishment
   of our faults? The penitent thief upon the cross urged the equity and
   force of this argument to patience, to his fellow-criminal, that they
   who had been guilty of such great crimes, and were justly condemned for
   them, ought to be patient under their sufferings. "We indeed, (says he)
   are justly condemned; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but
   this man hath done nothing amiss."

   7. And lastly, If we consider the transcendent excellency and dignity
   of the person, who under went so great sufferings with so much meekness
   and patience, and with so even and undisturbed a mind, this will calm
   and allay our passions, and mitigate the troubles which befal us
   pitiful and inconsiderable creatures, in comparison of this "Prince of
   glory" and "heir of everlasting bliss." When we consider the meekness
   of this excellent person, the eternal Son of God, and with what
   submission and serenity of mind he demeaned himself under so great and
   continual provocations from his own creatures and beneficiaries, those
   whom he had made, and whom he came to save; shall we think much to bear
   the indignities and affronts of our fellow-creatures? When we behold
   how contented this great person was in the meanest condition, how he
   welcomed all events, and was so perfectly resigned to the will of his
   heavenly Father, that whatsoever pleased God, pleased him; shall we
   murmur at any condition which the providence of God allots to us, and
   repine at any event whatsoever?

   Shall we resent injuries and affronts and calumnies so heinously as to
   be out of all temper and patience, when we consider with what meekness
   of temper, and how little emotion of mind, the Son of God bore all
   these? how "he gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them
   that plucked off the hair; and withheld not his face from shame and
   spitting;" how "he was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep
   before the shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth; being reviled,
   he reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not?"

   To conclude, can we entertain thoughts of revenge towards the
   instruments of our sufferings, when we have such a pattern of forgiving
   before us, who poured out his blood for the expiation of the guilt of
   them that shed it, and spent his last breath in a most fervent and
   charitable prayer for his betrayers and murderers?

   Thus we should propose to ourselves the pattern of our Lord's spirit
   and demeanour under sufferings, in whom meekness and submission and
   patience had their perfect work; that the same mind may be in us that
   was in Christ Jesus, and that as we have him for an example, we may
   follow his steps.

   The last consideration of comfort and support under trouble, which the
   Christian religion gives us, remains yet to be spoken to, namely, that
   we are assured of a most compassionate and prevalent and perpetual
   patron and advocate and intercessor with God for us.

   But this, together with the application of this whole discourse, I
   shall refer to the next opportunity.

SERMON CCXVII.

  THE TRUE REMEDY AGAINST THE TROUBLES OF LIFE.

   Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in
   me.--Johnxiv. 1.

   I COME now to the fifth and last ground of comfort, which the Christian
   religion affords to good men, for their support under trouble, namely,
   That it assures us of a most compassionate and prevalent and perpetual
   patron and advocate and intercessor with God in heaven for us, namely,
   our blessed Saviour, "who for the suffering of death was crowned with
   glory and honour," advanced "at the right hand of God," where "he sits
   in great majesty and glory," having "all power in heaven and earth
   committed to him," and where "he lives continually to make intercession
   for us."

   And this is another consideration mentioned by our Saviour for the
   comfort of his disciples, who were so sorrowful at the thoughts of his
   departure from them, that though he should leave the world, yet he
   should be highly advanced in heaven, where he would certainly employ
   all his favour and power and interest for their benefit and advantage,
   and be an everlasting patron and advocate for those whose salvation he
   had purchased with so much sweat and blood, presenting our requests and
   prayers to God, in virtue of his most meritorious sacrifice and
   sufferings continually presented to his Father, perpetually soliciting
   our cause, and procuring for us all those blessings by his intercession
   in heaven, which he had purchased for us by his blood upon earth. "For
   which reason," saith the apostle, (Heb. vii. 25.) "he is able to save
   to the utmost all those that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth
   to make intercession for us;" that is, he is able to perfect the work
   of our salvation, which he began here upon earth; and to procure for
   all those who address their prayers to God in his name, whatever is
   needful and convenient for us, because he is always at the right hand
   of God to second our prayers by his powerful intercession for us.

   And this is a ground of comfort, though not greater and more
   substantial in itself than the other; yet more accommodated to our
   apprehensions, who are naturally apt to dread the majesty of God, and
   to seek out for some in favour with him, to be mediators and
   intercessors with God for us, and to present our prayers and requests
   to him. And this was the original of the addresses of the heathens to
   the angels and souls departed, as a kind of intermediate and inferior
   deities, to present their prayers, and intercede with the great God in
   their behalf. And as in compliance with the general apprehension of
   mankind concerning the appeasing of the Deity by all sorts of
   sacrifices, God was pleased to provide "one sacrifice," which "by being
   once offered" should "obtain eternal redemption for us, and perfect for
   ever them that are sanctified;" and by this means to put an end both to
   the carnal sacrifices of the law, and the barbarous and inhuman
   sacrifices of the pagan worship: so, in like condescension to the
   general inclinations of mankind to address themselves to God by several
   mediators and intercessors, God hath appointed "one only mediator
   between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom
   for all;" thereby to put an end to that infinite superstition, which
   had obtained in the world for so many ages, of addressing their prayers
   to God by the mediation of good angels, and the departed souls of their
   heroes and great men, who were, as I may so call them, the pagan
   saints.

   So that, as under the gospel, God hath appointed but "one sacrifice for
   sin," that should be of eternal efficacy: so but one mediator in heaven
   for sinners to offer up our prayers to God, and to intercede
   continually for us, in the power and virtue of that one sacrifice, once
   offered for the redemption of mankind. And therefore, it is every whit
   as contrary to the genius and design of the Christian religion, to
   apply ourselves to other intercessors with God in heaven for us,
   whether saints or angels, or even the blessed Virgin herself, as it
   would be to continue still the Jewish sacrifices, not to say the
   heathen. For, it is not clearer that there is but one proper sacrifice
   under the gospel, viz. that of Christ upon the cross; than that there
   is but "one mediator and intercessor with God in heaven for us." Nay,
   St. Paul speaks as if the Christian religion did no more admit of more
   mediators than one, than of more Gods than one: (1 Tim. ii. 5.) "There
   is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
   who gave himself a ransom for all." Nor is the force of this plain text
   to be avoided, by saying that the apostle here speaks of "a mediator of
   redemption," as appears from the following words, "who gave himself a
   ransom for all." For it is plain likewise, that he speaks also of "a
   mediator of intercession," and affirms him to be "but one," as is
   evident from what goes before. The apostle directs "prayers and
   supplications to be made for all men," and then at the fifth verse, to
   whom Christians should address these prayers, and by whose mediation,
   viz. to God, in the name and mediation of Jesus Christ. "For (says he)
   there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
   Jesus." So that the apostle's discourse does as plainly infer, that
   there is but "one mediator of intercession," as that there is but "one
   mediator of redemption."

   And, indeed, whosoever considers that quite throughout the New
   Testament, our Saviour and his apostles do constantly direct Christians
   to make their prayers to God in the name and mediation of Jesus Christ,
   and no where give so much as the least intimation of applying ourselves
   to any other intercessors with God in heaven for us, may justly wonder
   how this superstition of praying to angels and saints departed, which
   hath no manner of countenance, and is by necessary consequence so
   clearly forbidden, should ever prevail among Christians; especially
   since it is a plain diminution of the virtue and efficacy of our
   Saviour's intercession, or if it add nothing to it, it is perfectly
   vain and endless, and to no purpose. For what need of any other
   intercessors with God in heaven for us, if that be true which the
   apostle to the Hebrews most expressly affirms, that "Christ is able to
   save them to the utmost that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth
   to make intercession for them."

   The prevalency and efficacy whereof may justly minister to us, in all
   our distresses and troubles, some peculiar ground of comfort above what
   springs from the bare contemplation of the Divine nature, that we have
   so powerful a friend to intercede with God for us, one so dearly
   beloved of him, and so highly in his favour; one that is advanced "far
   above all principalities and powers, and every name that is named, not
   only in this world, but in that which is to come;" and consequently
   able to do more for us, than all the blessed saints and angels in
   heaven, and more than all the powers of darkness can do against us.

   And this is matter of great comfort to us upon these three
   considerations:

   1. That our advocate is nearly related to us, having condescended, by
   assuming our nature, to be allied to us, to become "bone of our bone,
   and flesh of our flesh," so that we may address ourselves to him with
   great freedom and confidence; and, as the apostle expresseth it, (Heb.
   iv. 16.) "We may come with boldness to this throne of grace, for
   seasonable mercy and help in time of need." For we may most assuredly
   believe, that he who stooped to be made man, and to become one of us,
   will upon all occasions most heartily be concerned for us, and ready to
   help us.

   2. Considering that he hath already given the greatest demonstration of
   his kindness and compassion to us; we may be sure that he, who hath
   done and suffered such things for our sakes, hath a very tender love
   and affection for us; he who was contented to die for us, will do for
   us any thing else that may do us good.

   3. And that we might have no doubt of his forwardness and inclination
   to pity and relieve us, he suffered the most grievous things himself
   that any man could suffer, that from the experience and remembrance of
   his own sufferings, he might learn to compassionate us. And this the
   apostle particularly insists upon, as a very comfortable consideration
   to us in all our trials and sufferings. (Heb. iv. 15, 16.) "For we have
   not a high-priest which cannot be touched, with the feeling of our
   infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are; yet without
   sin. Let us, therefore, come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
   may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need:" and, (chap.
   ii. 17, 18.) "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like
   unto brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-priest:
   for in that he himself suffered being tempted, he is able to succour
   them that are tempted." So that we may rest assured of his pity and
   support in all our afflictions and trials, who knows both the infirmity
   of our nature, and hath himself had experience of greater sufferings
   than any of us either shall or can ever be exercised withal.

   And as for the general concernment of his truth, and religion, and
   church upon earth, that which all good men are with so much reason
   solicitous about, this is his proper care, and the great business that
   he is intent upon, now that he is in heaven, to protect and defend his
   truth and religion, and the church which professeth it, so that "the
   gates of hell shall not prevail against it." This is his kingdom, for
   the effectual administration whereof "all power in heaven and in earth
   is committed to him." And, as he interceded! with his Father for every
   particular Christian, so much more for his church, which is his body;
   to preserve her from all dangers that threaten her ruin, and to guard
   her against the power and malice of all her enemies. For to this end
   was he advanced to the right hand of God, that he might continue there,
   "till he had made his enemies his footstool." And this kingdom of his
   shall continue in his hands, "till he have put down all rule, and all
   authority and power," that sets itself against him; "for he must reign
   till he have put all things under his feet."

   So that, though truth may be obscured and clouded for a time, and the
   professors of it grievously harased and oppressed, yet it shall not
   finally be borne down, but shall at length prevail against all
   opposition; because, he who hath undertaken the protection of it is
   mighty, the King of kings, and Lord of lords, the chief favourite of
   heaven, who is continually "at the right hand of God," and "lives for
   to make intercession for us."

   And thus I have, as briefly as I well could, represented to you, what
   force and virtue there are in the two remedies here prescribed by our
   Saviour, for the mitigating and allaying of our troubles: viz. faith in
   God, the great Creator and Governor of the world; and faith likewise in
   himself, the Son of God and Saviour of men. "Let not your heart be
   troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me."

   And now to apply this discourse to ourselves; the inferences I shall
   make from it shall be these three:

   I. That in all our troubles and adversities, of what kind soever, we
   should support and comfort ourselves with the firm belief of the
   providence of Almighty God, and of his tender and compassionate care of
   mankind, especially of those that fear him, and put their trust in his
   mercy.

   II. We should put a high value upon the Christian religion, and "hold
   fast the profession of it without wavering;" which affords us such firm
   and solid grounds of comfort and support under all troubles and
   afflictions, as are no where else to be found; such as neither the
   light of nature, nor any other revelation that God ever made of him
   self to mankind, do give us the notice and knowledge of.

   III. Since the prayers of Christ are so effectual and prevalent with
   God, let us, by frequent and fervent prayers, make our requests known
   to God; and let us, "with confidence and full assurance of faith,
   address ourselves to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and
   find favour with him for our seasonable help and support in the time of
   need." I shall speak briefly to these, and so conclude this discourse.

   I. In all troubles and adversities, of what kind soever, under all
   afflictions and sufferings that may befal us, of loss or pain, of
   poverty and sickness, of reproach and persecution for righteousness
   sake, and under the most fearful apprehensions of danger and distress,
   to all human appearance inevitably threatening us in our persons and
   private concernments, or with relation to the public peace and
   tranquillity, or to that which ought to be infinitely dearer to us than
   all these, our religion, which is the great concernment of our souls,
   and of all eternity, when we have no hope any where else, no visible
   means of help and redress, when we are almost in despair of avoiding
   the danger, and warding off the blow that is made at us, when ruin and
   destruction seem just to have overtaken us, and are ready to devour us
   with open mouth, and "to swallow us up quick;" in a word, when we are
   reduced to the greatest extremity and distress that can be
   imagined--even in this case, if ever it should happen, we should
   support our minds with a firm belief of the providence of Almighty God,
   and of his tender and compassionate care of mankind, especially of
   "those that fear him, and put their trust in his mercy;" and comfort
   ourselves, as the holy and divine Psalmist does, in all our fears and
   troubles; "What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee;" (Psal. lvi.
   3.) And he tells us that every good man hath ground and reason for this
   confidence; (Psal. cxii. 7, 8.) speaking of the righteous and good man,
   "He shall not (says he) be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed,
   trusting in the Lord. His heart is established, he shall not be
   afraid." And, (Psal. xxvii. 1.) "The Lord is my light and my salvation;
   whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I
   be afraid?" (Psal. lxii. 5-8.) "My soul, wait thou only upon God: for
   my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is
   my defence, I shall not be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory:
   the rock of my strength, and my refuge is in God. Trust in him at all
   times, ye people, pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for
   us." And, (Psal. xlvi. 1, 2, 7.) "God is our refuge and strength; and a
   very present help in trouble. Therefore will we not fear, though the
   earth be removed; and though the mountains be carried into the midst of
   the sea. The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge."
   To which I will add that comfortable promise, (Isa. xxvi. 3.) "Thou
   wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because
   he trusteth in thee."

   Thus we may, in all conditions that may befal us, in our greatest fears
   and troubles, ease our hearts, by reposing ourselves upon God, in
   confidence of his support and deliverance, of his care and providence,
   to prevent and divert the evils we fear; or of his gracious help to
   bear us up under them, and of his mercy and goodness to deliver us out
   of them, when he sees it best; provided always that we be careful of
   our duty to him, and do what becomes us, and nothing else.

   For our more particular direction herein,

   1. Let us depend upon God, and entirely confide in his goodness and
   care, and trust in his wisdom and power for our protection and
   deliverance: for here is our great security. In all our difficulties
   and troubles, the providence of God is infinitely more to us, than any
   prudence and conduct of our own. He hath a thousand ways to divert and
   put by the evils which are levelled against us, "to turn the counsels
   of men backward, and make their devices of none effect." When we can do
   nothing to help and save ourselves, "his right hand, and his arm, and
   the light of his countenance," can do it, if "he have a favour for us."

   2. Let us so trust God, as to neglect no prudent and lawful means for
   our security and preservation from evil. Let us not, by our rashness
   and folly, provoke trouble and danger, and bring them upon ourselves.
   Let us, according to our Saviour's counsel, "be wise as serpents," and
   "innocent as doves." Let us use all that care and prudence which are
   consistent with innocence and a good conscience; and when we have done
   that, let us be no farther solicitous, but resign up ourselves, and all
   our concernments, to the good pleasure of God, and the disposal of his
   wise providence; and leave it to him, who made the world, to govern it,
   because he certainly understands it best.

   3. Let us be sure to keep within the bounds of our duty, trying no
   unlawful ways for our ease and preservation, and rescue from the evils
   which we fear and lie under; by loosening the bonds of subjection and
   obedience to authority, or by any other sinister and indirect means.
   For let us assure ourselves, that God is never more concerned to appear
   for us, than when out of conscience of our duty to him, we are
   contented rather to suffer, than work our deliverance by undue means.
   Let us "commit ourselves to him in well-doing," and do nothing, no, not
   for the cause of religion, which is contrary to the plain rules and
   precepts of it.

   II. We should put a high value upon the Christian religion, and "hold
   fast the profession of it with out wavering," which affords to us such
   firm and solid grounds of comfort and support under all troubles and
   afflictions, as are no where else to be found; such as neither the
   light of nature, nor any other revelation that God ever made of himself
   to mankind, do give us notice and knowledge of.

   We should highly value the Christian religion, which hath "brought life
   and immortality to light," and hath made so clear a discovery to us of
   the glorious and eternal rewards of another world, for the
   encouragement of our faith, and support of our patience under the evils
   and pressures of this life; and which promiseth, and is ready to afford
   every sincere Christian, the precious aids and comforts of God's Holy
   Spirit, to sustain the weakness of human nature under the greatest
   tribulations and sufferings; and does likewise assure us of the special
   efficacy of our prayers with God; and sets before us the best and most
   admirable pattern that ever was, of a contented and cheerful submission
   to the will of God in the saddest condition incident to human nature,
   and of perfect patience and composure of mind under the apprehension of
   approaching evils, and the sense of present sufferings; and, lastly,
   which assures us of a most compassionate and prevalent and perpetual
   patron and advocate and intercessor with God in heaven for us. All
   these are peculiar advantages of the Christian religion, and ought to
   be so many endearments of it to us, and engagements to u hold fast the
   profession of it." This builds our comfort and hope upon a rock, which
   will abide firm against all rains and winds and storms. And if we
   suffer ourselves to be removed from it, we quit the only foundation of
   all our comfort in this life, and happiness in the next. So that, if we
   would "hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of hope," firm unto
   the end, we must take heed, as the apostle to the Hebrews (chap. iii.
   12.) cautions the Christians in his time; we must (I say) "take heed,
   lest there be in any of us an evil spirit of infidelity, to apostatize
   from the living God;" that is, to fall off from the profession of his
   truth and religion. A religion worthy of all men to be received and
   adhered to; because, as it calls us to sufferings, so it affords the
   greatest comforts and supports under them, as is evident from the
   cheerful and joyful behaviour of the primitive Christians and martyrs,
   under the greatest extremities of sufferings and torments, the like
   instances whereto of patience and constancy under so long and repeated
   persecutions, no other religion that ever was in the world is able to
   produce.

   III. And lastly, Since the prayers of Christians are so effectual and
   prevalent with God, let us, by frequent and fervent prayer "in every
   thing make our requests known to God; and let us with confidence and
   full assurance of faith address ourselves to the throne of grace, that
   we may obtain mercy, and find favour with him for our seasonable help
   and support in time of need." Let us, as our Saviour exhorts his
   disciples, "watch and pray, lest we enter into temptation." And, as the
   apostle like wise exhorts, let us "be sober and vigilant, and watch
   unto prayer," taking all opportunities for it, and spending much time
   in this duty, than which none of all the duties enjoined by the
   Christian religion will turn to a better and more comfortable account,
   if our hearts and lives be but answerable to our prayers.

   Let us earnestly beg of God, that his watchful and merciful providence
   would undertake the care of us; that he would fit and prepare us for
   every condition which he hath designed to bring us into; that he would
   teach us to demean ourselves in it as we ought; that he would consider
   our frailties, and "lay no greater load of affliction upon us, than he
   will give us grace and strength to bear;" that if he sees it good to
   exercise any of us with afflictions and sufferings in any kind, he
   would make us "able to stand in that evil day, and when we have done
   all to stand."

   And if, instead of vain murmurings, and complaints, and terrifying
   ourselves with fears of what may never happen, we would, after the
   example of holy David, "betake ourselves to prayer," and by this means
   engage the providence of God for our protection from evil, or for our
   support under it; we should certainly do much better for ourselves, and
   contribute much more, than we can do any other way, to the prevention
   of any evil that we can fear, or to the mitigating or shortening of it,
   as to God's infinite wisdom and goodness shall seem best.

   And let us always be mindful of that caution which our Saviour gives to
   his disciples, that they might always be in a due preparation for the
   coming of our Lord to judgment; (Luke xxi. 34-36.) "Take heed to
   yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting
   and drunkenness, and the cares of this life, and so that day come upon
   you unawares. For as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell on
   the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore and pray always, that
   ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come
   to pass, and to stand before the Son of man." This caution and counsel
   do proportionably hold, as to our preparation for any other evil day of
   affliction and suffering in this world; that we should beware of
   sensuality, and an inordinate love to the things of this world, and
   care about them; because these soften and effeminate our spirits, and
   render them unfit for the day of adversity: and that we should watch
   and pray; because these are the best preparations against an evil day,
   and perhaps may prevent it, at least as to ourselves, if God think it
   fit for us, and "count us worthy to escape it."

   To conclude then this whole discourse. In all our fears and troubles,
   in all afflictions and adversities that may happen to us in this world,
   let us "encourage ourselves in the Lord our God, the Father of mercy,
   and the God of all consolation;" and in his blessed Son Jesus Christ
   our Lord, "the high priest of our profession," and "the author and
   finisher of our faith; whom God hath exalted far above all
   principalities and powers, and every name that is named, not only in
   this world, but in that which is to come, and hath given him to be head
   over all things to his church;" remembering that we and all our
   concernments are in the hands of his providence, where we are
   infinitely safer than in any counsel and wisdom of our own. And if,
   after all, it be the will of God to exercise any of us with more than
   ordinary trials, "to lay affliction upon our loins," and "to suffer men
   to ride over our heads/ as the Psalmist expresseth it, let us, as St.
   Peter exhorts, "commit the keeping of our souls to him in well-doing,
   as to a faithful Creator, who is able to keep that which is committed
   to him, and to preserve us to his heavenly kingdom;" which let us all
   humbly and earnestly beg, for the sake of Jesus Christ; "To whom, with
   the Father and the Holy Ghost, be all honour and glory, might, majesty,
   and dominion, now and for ever."

SERMON CCXVIII.

  OF THE NATURE OF FAITH IN GENERAL.

   But without faith it is impossible to please God.--Heb. xi. 6.

   BEFORE I come to the words themselves, in order to our better
   understanding of them, we will take into consideration the design of
   this Epistle, that so we may see more clearly the relation that these
   words have to the foregoing discourse. Who the penman of this Epistle
   was, I shall not tell you, be cause I do not know, nor is it much
   material to know it; but whoever wrote it, he had this very good design
   in the writing of it, to persuade the Jews to hold fast the profession
   of the gospel, not withstanding all the sufferings and persecutions it
   exposed them to. And to this purpose he shews, at large, what
   prerogatives the gospel had above the legal administration. "The law
   was given by the disposition of the angels, in the hand of a mediator,"
   that is, Moses: but the gospel is revealed to us by the Son of God; a
   person, not only above Moses, who was a mere man; but above angels. The
   gospel is the substance and reality of the types and ceremonies, and
   the very good things themselves, that were obscurely represented by
   those shadows. It is "a testament established upon better promises,"
   the clear promises of eternal life, which were but darkly revealed in
   the Old Testament, that being established either solely or principally
   upon temporal promises; and it is a perfect and complete dispensation,
   that hath in it all things requisite to attain its end, and therefore
   shall never stand in need of any farther change or alteration. These
   are the heads of those arguments which the author of this Epistle does
   largely discourse upon.

   Now the gospel having in these respects the advantage of the legal
   dispensation, the apostle doth all along in this Epistle earnestly
   exhort the Jews to a constant profession and steadfast belief of the
   gospel, and not to return back from Christianity to Judaism, which was
   a fur less perfect institution: (chap. ii. 1.) "Therefore we ought to
   give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at
   any time we should let them slip;" pararruomen, "lest we should fall
   away," so the word may be rendered. And, (chap. iii. 12.) "Take heed,
   brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in
   departing from the living God." And, (chap. iv. 1.) "Let us therefore
   fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of
   you should seem to come short of it." And, (chap. x. 23.) "Let us hold
   fast the profession of our faith without wavering.

   After which he declares the danger of apostacy, or falling off from the
   belief and profession of the gospel which they had entertained; (ver.
   26.) "For if we sin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of
   the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin." He tells them
   they would be shrewdly tempted to apostacy by the reproaches,
   afflictions, and persecutions, that they would meet withal: but the
   promises of the gospel were sufficient to sup port and bear up good men
   under these, if they were but firmly persuaded of the truth of them;
   and though they did not for the present receive the things promised,
   yet a firm belief of them would carry them through all sufferings, and
   make them hold out under them. "The just shall live by faith," (ver.
   38.)

   And having mentioned the power of faith; that is, of a confident
   persuasion of the truth and reality of the promises of the gospel to
   support men under sufferings, he gives an account how faith uses to
   have this influence; (ver. 1.) "Faith is the substance of things hoped
   for;" so we render the word hupostasis: but it might be much better
   rendered, both according to the frequent use of it in the Septuagint,
   and in the New Testament, "a confidence of things hoped for;" that is,
   a confident expectation of things hoped for, or a firm persuasion that
   our hopes will not be frustrated. And as this is more agreeable to the
   scope and design of the apostle, so likewise to the common acceptation
   of this word in the New Testament, for which I will appeal to two
   places: (2 Cor. ix. 4.) "that we be not put to shame in this confidence
   of boasting," en te hupostasei taute. The other text is in this
   Epistle, (chap. iii. 14.) "That we hold fast the beginning of our
   confidence," te`n arche`n te`s uposta'seos, which is of the very same
   sense with parresi'a, at the sixth verse. "If we hold fast the
   confidence," parresi'an, "and rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.
   And the evidence of things not seen," e'lenchos, "the conviction," as
   being convinced, or persuaded of the truth of those things, for which
   we have no ocular or sensible demonstration. Now if faith in the
   promises of the gospel do persuade us and give us satisfaction that we
   shall receive a reward, which will outweigh and countervail our present
   sufferings, then faith is likely to support us under sufferings.

   And, that this is no strange thing which the apostle speaks of faith,
   he shews that, in all ages, faith hath been the principle of all holy
   and heroic actions. "By it the elders obtained a good report;" it is
   that which made the holy men of the Old Testament so famous; and this
   he proves throughout this chapter, by a large induction of particular
   instances, in which we see the power of faith, the wonderful effects of
   it, and the mighty works it hath done in the world.

   But because he had said before, that "faith is the evidence (or
   conviction) of things not seen," as well as a confident expectation of
   things hoped for, before he comes to instance in the effects of faith,
   upon particular persons in the Old Testament, he proves it to be "the
   evidence of things not seen," that is, being convinced and persuaded of
   things of which we have no sensible and ocular demonstration: (ver. 3.)
   "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of
   God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do
   appear;" that is, though we were not present at the making of the
   world, nor did see it framed; yet we are satisfied, and do believe that
   it was made by the powerful word of God, and that all those things
   which we see, were not produced out of things which do now appear, but
   either immediately out of nothing, or a dark confused chaos.

   And having thus proved that we may be persuaded of things we do not
   see, of things past or future, he comes to the particular instances of
   the holy men of the Old Testament, in whom the power of faith did
   appear. He begins with Abel, who being persuaded of the being of God,
   and the perfection and excellency of the Divine nature, and
   consequently that he was worthy to be served with the best, by virtue
   of this faith "offered up to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain."
   The second instance is in Enoch, who being persuaded of the being of
   God, and of his goodness to reward them that serve him, was a righteous
   man, and studious to please God; and as a reward of this faith and
   obedience, "God translated him, that he should not see death;" upon
   which the apostle assumes, (ver. 6.) "but without faith it is
   impossible to please God." As if he had said, Unless a man do believe,
   and be persuaded of some principles, it is impossible any man should be
   religious, or endeavour to do any thing that is pleasing or acceptable
   to God: for religion, and the service of God, and an endeavour to
   please him, do suppose at least that I believe and am persuaded of
   these two things--of the being, and of the goodness of God; that there
   is such a being as I serve and seek to please, and that his goodness is
   such, that it will not be in vain to serve him, he will not let me be a
   loser by it.

   And that here, by pleasing, we are to understand in general, the
   performing any action of religion, is evident from the equivalent terms
   which are used in the next words; "For he that cometh to God, must
   believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek him;"
   where coming to God, and seeking of him, are of the same importance
   with pleasing him. Now, to come to God, and seek him, in Scripture
   phrase, signify the sum of religion, it being usual in the language of
   the Scripture, to express the whole of religion by any eminent
   principle, or part, or effect of it, as by the knowledge, remembrance,
   or fear of God, in the Old Testament; by the love of him, and faith in
   him, in the New, by coming to him, seeking him, calling upon his name,
   and pleasing of him.

   Now, that coming to God, and seeking him, are of the same importance
   here with pleasing him, will be clear to any that consider the
   apostle's reasoning here in the text, which supposeth those to be the
   same, otherwise there would be no force in his argument. For the
   proposition which he proves, is, that "Without faith it is impossible
   to please God." The argument he useth is this, "If every one that comes
   to God must believe that he is," &c. then "without faith it is
   impossible to please him;" but "every one that comes to God must
   believe that he is." Now, unless coming to God, and seeking him, be the
   same thing with pleasing him, this would be no good argument; for there
   would be four terms in it; but if these phrases be made equivalent,
   then the argument is good. Thus, if "every one that comes to God," that
   is, that will please him, "must believe that he is," &c. then "without
   faith it is impossible to please him:" but "every one that comes to
   God," that is, that will please him, "must believe that he is, and that
   he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him," or that endeavour
   to please him; therefore "without faith it is impossible to please
   him."

   Which proposition doth not only signify that faith is necessary to
   religion, and a condition with out which it cannot be; but implies
   likewise, that it is a cause or principle of it; not only the
   foundation upon which all religion must be built; but the fountain from
   whence it springs. For this I take to be implied in the words--not only
   that there can be no religion unless we believe a God; but supposing
   this truth firmly believed, that there is a God, it will have a great
   influence upon men to make them religious. For the apostle having
   before spoken of the power of faith upon Abel and Enoch, that it put
   them upon pleasing God, he assumes in the next words, "but without
   faith," &c. As if he had said, That ye may know what was the principle
   of their religion, of their holiness and obedience, let us imagine that
   a man should believe nothing concerning the being of a God, or the
   blessedness of those that serve him; what would be the issue? Why this,
   certainly--there would be no religion, no such thing as serving of God,
   or endeavouring to please him; for unless we believe that he is, and
   that he will reward those that seek to please him, it is impossible,
   that is, it is unreasonable to think men should attempt to please him.
   So that faith is the cause and principle of religion; it is the thing,
   quo posito, ponitur effectus; et quo sublato, tollitur. Do but suppose
   and admit that a man truly believes there is a God, and he will seek to
   please him: but if you suppose a man believes no such thing, he will
   cast off all religion. This is the plain meaning of the words; not, as
   some have thought, that with out faith a man may perform religious
   actions, but then they would not be accepted, or pleasing to God: but
   that which the apostle means is, Without faith it is impossible there
   should be any religion: not that religious acts should be performed in
   an acceptable manner; as if Cain had offered as good a sacrifice as
   Abel, only faith made the difference; but Cain did not believe, was not
   persuaded of the being of God and his excellency, therefore thought to
   put God off with any thing; Abel believed, and did offer a more
   excellent sacrifice, not more excellent because it was mixed with
   faith, but it was more excellent in itself.

   The observation therefore from these words is this: that faith is one
   great principle of all religious actions.

   In the handling of this, I shall endeavour,

   First, To fix and settle the true notion of faith, whereby we may come
   to understand the general nature of it.

   Secondly, To confirm the truth of the proposition.

   Thirdly, Draw some inferences from hence.

   First, To settle and fix the true notion of faith, whereby we may come
   to understand the general nature of it. I find that most who write upon
   this subject have marvellously puzzled themselves with the various
   acceptations of this word pi'stos, and the verb pisteu'ein, insomuch
   that some have undertaken to enumerate above twenty distinct
   significations of this word. I cannot find so many, it may be others
   may; but hereby, instead of clearing the notion of faith, they have
   involved it, and made it more intricate, and have made men believe,
   that it is a notion very remote from common understanding: whereas
   there is not any word that is in common use that is more plain and
   easy, and which any one may understand better than this of faith and
   believing.

   Therefore, in the explication of it, I shall attend to the use of it in
   common speech, and in all authors, as well profane as sacred: and I
   shall not guide myself by terms of art, which have been received in the
   schools, and have confounded the meaning of words, by distorting them
   from the common and received use of them; but shall govern myself by
   the nature of the things to which this word in common use is applied.

   I shall remove two acceptations of it which are less usual, and then
   fix the common and general notion of it, to which all the other more
   particular significations may be referred. The two less usual
   acceptations are these:

   First, It is sometimes put for the particular grace or virtue which is
   called fidelity, or faithfulness in our promises and contracts; and in
   this sense it is sometimes used in common discourse, and in all sorts
   of writers. I shall only mention a text or two where it is so taken:
   (Matt. xxiii. 23.) "And have omitted the weightier things of the law,
   judgment, and mercy, and faith/ that is, fidelity. And (Rom. iii. 3.)
   with relation to God, "Shall their unbelief make the faith of God of
   none effect?" that is, his faithfulness in his promises. (Tit. ii. 10.)
   "Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity," pi'stin pasan, "all
   faith."

   Secondly, It is sometimes put for spiritual gifts, and particularly the
   gift of miracles, which were wrought by the power of faith. (Rom. xii.
   3.) "According as God hath dealt to every man the mea sure of faith;"
   that is, of spiritual gifts of prophesying, or ministry, or
   exhortation, as it is explained afterward. (1 Cor. xii. 2.) "To another
   is given faith by the same Spirit;" that is, a power of miracles in
   general, as learned interpreters think. Nor doth that which is added
   afterwards, that "to an other is given the working of miracles,"
   prejudice this interpretation; for energe'mata duna'meon, "the
   operation of powers," which we render "of miracles," seems to signify
   some special sort of miracles, not the power of miracles in general.
   And this seems to be favoured by the acceptation of it in the next
   chapter, ver. 2. "And though I had all faith, so that I could remove
   mountains;" where faith is undoubtedly taken for the power of miracles.

   These being removed, as very alien and remote from the common and usual
   acceptation of the word, I come now to fix the general notion of faith,
   to which all other acceptations of it may easily be reduced; and it is
   this:

   Faith is a persuasion of the mind concerning any thing; concerning the
   truth of any proposition; concerning the existence, or futurition, or
   lawfulness, or convenience, or possibility, or goodness, of any thing,
   or the contrary; or concerning the credit of a person, or the contrary.
   And this notion is not only agreeable to the proper notion of the word
   pi'stis, which comes from pe'itho, to persuade, but is war ranted from
   the common use of it in this latitude. It is ordinary for men to say,
   they believe, or are persuaded, such a proposition is true or false,
   such a thing is or is not, such an event will be or will not be; that
   such an action is lawful or unlawful, such a thing is good or bad,
   convenient or inconvenient, possible or impossible to be done; or that
   they believe such a person, or do not believe him. And I could shew
   from Scripture, that believing is applied to all these matters, and
   many more; I will only instance in one or two.

   That faith is frequently used for the persuasion of the truth of a
   doctrine, or of the veracity of God or Christ, I shall not need to
   produce any texts, there are so many.

   That faith is used for a persuasion of the lawfulness of an action, the
   14th chapter to the Romans doth abundantly testify. (Ver. 2.) "One
   believeth that he may eat all things;" that is, is persuaded in his
   mind that all sorts of meat are lawful without distinction. (Ver. 22.)
   "Hast thou faith?" that is, art thou persuaded or satisfied in thy mind
   of the lawfulness of those indifferent things he had been speaking of?
   (Ver. 23.) "He that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not
   of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin;" that is, what ever
   is not done with the persuasion and satisfaction of our minds that we
   may lawfully do it, "is sin." I shall trouble you with no more
   instances.

   Now this being the general notion of faith, that it is a persuasion of
   the mind concerning any thing, from hence by a metonymy it comes to be
   put for the argument whereby this persuasion is wrought in us. Hence it
   is, that among the rhetoricians pi'steis are any kind of argument or
   proof which orators make use of to persuade men; and there is one place
   in the New Testament, where in pi'stis seems to be used in this sense,
   or very near it, (Acts xvii. 31.) "Because he hath appointed a day in
   which he will judge the world," &c. "whereof he hath given assurance
   unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead," pistin
   paraschon pasin, "having offered faith to all men;" that is, having
   given ns this argument for the proof of it, that "he raised Christ from
   the dead."

   Sometimes it is put for the object of this persuasion, or the matter or
   thing whereof we are persuaded. And thus frequently in the New
   Testament, the gospel, which is the object of our faith, the thing
   which we believe, is called faith. And thus you find it used in that
   phrase of "obedience to the faith," that is, to the gospel, (Acts vi.
   7. Rom. i. 5; xvi. 26.) And in this sense faith, that is the gospel, is
   frequently opposed to the dispensation of the law, (Rom. iii. 27, 31,
   and x. 16, Gal. i. 23.) "He that persecuted us in times past, now
   preacheth the faith which he once destroyed." (Gal. iii. 2.) The
   hearing of the gospel is called the "hearing of faith;" (ver. 23.)
   "Before faith came;" (and ver. 25.) "But after that faith is come."
   (Eph. iv. 5.) "There is one faith," that is, one gospel which we
   believe. (1 Tim. iv. 6.) "Nourished up in the words of faith and of
   good doctrine."

   The opposites to faith, are unbelief and credulity. Unbelief, which is
   a not being persuaded of a thing, is the deficient extreme: or
   doubting, if it prevail to a degree of unbelief: and credulity, which
   is an easiness to believe things without any probable argument to
   induce our persuasion, is the redundant extreme.

   The seat or subject of faith is the mind, or the heart, as the
   Scripture usually calls it. "With the heart man believes," that is,
   with the soul: for I do not understand any real distinction of
   faculties; but if you will distinguish them, the proper seat of this
   persuasion is the understanding; the immediate effect of it is upon the
   will; by which it works upon the affections and the life.

   And faith in this general notion is not opposed to error, and
   knowledge, and opinion: but comprehends all these under it. For if a
   man be persuaded of that which is false, he "believes a lie," as the
   Scripture expresseth it; a man may be certainly persuaded of a thing,
   that is, firmly believe it, which is knowledge; a man may be probably
   persuaded of a thing, that is, believe it with some diffidence and
   uncertainty, and that is opinion.

   But for our better understanding of this general notion of faith, we
   will take into consideration these four things:

   I. The cause of it, or the argument whereby it is wrought.

   II. The degrees of it, and the difference of them.

   III. The natural efficacy and operation of it.

   IV. The several kinds of it.

   I. We will consider the cause of faith, or the argument whereby it is
   wrought. Now all the arguments whereby faith may be wrought in us, that
   is, a persuasion of any thing, will I think fall under one of these
   four heads; sense, experience, reason drawn from the thing, or the
   authority and testimony of some person.

   1. Sense. Hence it is commonly said, that "seeing is believing," that
   is, one of the best arguments to persuade us of any thing. That faith
   may be wrought by this argument, appears both from the nature of the
   thing, nothing being more apt to persuade us of any thing than our
   senses; and from several expressions in Scripture. I will instance in
   one for all. (John xx. 8.) "Then went in also the other disciple into
   the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed." And whereas Scripture
   opposeth faith to sight, as, (2 Cor. v. 7.) "We walk by faith, and not
   by sight;" (Heb. xi. 1.) "It is the evidence of things not seen;" we
   are to understand that only concerning a belief of the things. of
   another world, which are futurities, and invisible, which the apostle
   is there speaking of; or of things which are of the same nature with
   these, as things past: not but that a man may very well be induced to
   believe a thing by his senses.

   2. Experience; which, though it may be sensible, and then it is the
   same argument with sense; yet sometimes it is not, and then it is an
   argument distinct from it. As for example: a man may by experience be
   persuaded or induced to believe this proposition--that his will is
   free, that he can do this, or not do it; which is a better argument
   than a demonstration to the contrary, if there could be one.

   3. Reasons drawn from the thing; which may either be necessary and
   concluding, or else only probable and plausible.

   4. The authority and testimony of some credible person. Now two things
   give authority and credit to the relation, or testimony, or assertion
   of a person concerning any thing; ability and integrity. Ability, if he
   can be presumed to have a competent knowledge of what he relates, or
   asserts, or testifies; and integrity, if he may be presumed to be
   honest in his relation, and free from any design, or will to deceive.
   And to these heads, I think all arguments of belief may be reduced.

   II. The second thing to be considered is the degrees of faith, and the
   difference of them. And that there are degrees, I take for granted,
   though I shall afterwards have occasion to prove it in a Divine faith;
   and these depend perfectly upon the capacity of the person that
   believes, or is persuaded. Now the capacity, or incapacity of persons
   are infinitely various, and not to be reduced to theory; but sup posing
   a competent capacity in the person, then the degrees of faith or
   persuasion take their difference from the arguments, or motives, or
   inducements which are used to persuade. Where sense is the argument,
   there is the highest and firmest degree of faith, or persuasion. Next
   to that is experience, which is beyond any argument or reason from the
   thing. The faith or persuasion which is wrought in us by reasons from
   the thing, the degrees of it are as the reasons are: if they be
   necessary and concluding, it is firm and certain in its kind; if only
   probable, according to the degrees of probability, it hath more or less
   of doubting mixed with it. Lastly, the faith which is wrought in us by
   testimony or authority of a person, takes its degrees from the credit
   of a person, that is, his ability and integrity. Now because "all men
   are liars," that is, either may deceive, or be deceived, their
   testimony partakes of their infirmity, and so doth the degree of
   persuasion wrought by it: but God being both infallible and true, and
   consequently it being impossible that he should either deceive, or be
   deceived, his testimony begets the firmest persuasion, and the highest
   degree of faith in its kind. But then it is to be considered, that
   there not being a revelation of a revelation in infinitum; that this is
   a Divine testimony and revelation, we can only have rational assurance;
   and the degree of the faith or persuasion which is wrought by a Divine
   testimony will be according to the strength of the arguments which we
   have to persuade us that such a testimony is Divine.

   III. For the efficacy or operation of faith we are to consider, that
   the things we may believe or be persuaded of are of two sorts. Either,
   1. They are such as do not concern me; and then the mind rests in a
   naked and simple belief of them, and a faith or persuasion of such
   things has no effect upon me; but is apt to have, if ever it happen
   that the matter do concern me: or else, 2. The thing I believe or am
   persuaded of doth concern me; and then it hath several effects
   according to the nature of the thing I am persuaded of, or the degree
   of the persuasion, or the capacity of the person that believes or is
   persuaded. If the thing believed be of great moment, the effect of the
   faith is proportionable, cæteris paribus; and so according to the
   degree of the persuasion: but if the person be indisposed to the proper
   effects of such a persuasion by the power of contrary habits, as it
   often happens, the effect will be obtained with more difficulty, and
   may possibly be totally defeated, by casting off the persuasion: for
   while it remains, it will operate, and endeavour and strive to work its
   proper effect. For example: a man may believe that wine is very
   pernicious to him; and yet a strong inclination to it may render it
   very difficult for this persuasion to work its proper effect upon him,
   which is to leave off wine, and may at length wholly defeat it, by
   furnishing him with some colour of argument that may persuade him
   otherwise.

   IV. For the kinds of faith, they are several, according to the variety
   of objects or things believed. I shall reduce them all under these two
   general heads:

   1. Faith is either civil or human, under which I comprehend the
   persuasion of things moral, and natural, and political, and the like:
   or,

   2. Divine and religious; that is, a persuasion of things that concern
   religion. I know not whether these terms be proper, nor am I very
   solicitous, be cause I know none fitter, and tell you what I mean by
   them.

   The first kind of faith, concerning things human and civil, I shall not
   speak of, it being besides my design.

   The second, which I call a religious and Divine faith, comprehends
   three things under it, which are distinctly to be considered.

   1. A persuasion of the principles of natural religion, which are known
   by the light of nature; as, the existence of a God, the immortality of
   the soul, and a future state.

   2. A persuasion of things supernatural and revealed.

   3. A persuasion of supernatural revelation.--These I design fully to
   handle. Thus I have prepared materials for a large discourse; which,
   though it be necessary, is, I am sensible, but too tedious, and yet
   possibly more tedious to me than you.

SERMON CCX1X.

  OF A RELIGIOUS AND DIVINE FAITH.

   But without faith it is impossible to please God.--Heb. xi. 6.

   IN my last discourse I came to treat of a religious and Divine faith,
   which, I told you, comprehends under it three things, which I now
   proceed to consider distinctly.

   First, A persuasion of the principles of natural religion which are
   known by the light of nature.

   Secondly, A persuasion of things supernatural and revealed.

   Thirdly, A persuasion of supernatural revelation.

   First, A persuasion of the principles of natural religion, such as the
   light of nature could discover; such are the existence of God, the
   immortality of the soul, and a future state. The things to be inquired
   concerning this kind of faith are these:

   I. Whether this be truly and properly called faith.

   II. What are the arguments whereby it is wrought.

   III. Whether it admit of degrees or not, and what differences are
   observable in them.

   IV. What are the proper and genuine effects of it.

   V. In what sense it may be said to be Divine faith.

   I. Whether it may truly and properly be called faith, or not? If the
   general notion of faith which I have fixed before, viz. That it is a
   persuasion of the mind concerning any thing, be a true notion of faith,
   then there is no doubt but this may as properly be called faith, as any
   thing can be; because a man may be persuaded in his mind concerning
   these things, that there is a God, that our souls are immortal, that
   there is another state after this life.

   But besides this, if the Scripture speaks properly, as we have reason
   to believe it does, especially when it treats professedly of any thing,
   as the apostle here does, then this question is fully decided: for it
   is evident to any one that will but read this verse, out of which I
   have taken my text, that the apostle doth here in this place speak of
   this kind of faith; that is, a belief or persuasion of the principles
   of natural religion. For after the apostle had said, that "without
   faith it is impossible to please God," he immediately instanceth in the
   belief of the principles of natural religion, as necessary to the
   pleasing of God, that is, to make a man religious. "He that cometh to
   God must believe that he is;" there is the existence of God, the first
   principle of natural religion; "and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him;" which implies the other two, the immortality of
   the soul, and a future state; for if good men shall be rewarded, there
   must be a subject capable of such rewards, which brings in the
   immortality of the soul; and there must be a season for these rewards,
   which because they are seldom bestowed in this world, there must be a
   season when they shall, which brings in a future state after this life.
   So that whoever denies that a persuasion of these principles of natural
   religion may properly be called faith, he quarrels with the apostle,
   and does not correct me, but the Scriptures.

   II. What are the arguments whereby this faith, or the persuasion of
   these principles of natural religion, is wrought? You may remember that
   I reduced all those arguments, whereby any kind of faith or persuasion
   is wrought in us, to these four heads; sense, experience, reasons drawn
   from the thing, and the testimony or authority of some person. Now a
   faith or persuasion of these principles cannot be wrought in us by
   sense; for "no man hath seen God at any time," and being a pure spirit,
   he cannot be the object of any corporeal sense. Nor can the soul, or
   any mode of its existence, fall under any of our senses; nor a future
   state; because sense is only of things present. Nor can it be wrought
   in us merely by experience: for no man can conclude from any thing he
   experienceth in himself that there is a God, unless he be first
   persuaded of it by other arguments: and the immortality of the soul,
   and a future state, are things which none in this life can experience.
   Nor can the authority or testimony of any person be the argument that
   induceth that persuasion. Not any human authority: for these things are
   of such consequence, and so much depends upon them, that is, the belief
   of them puts us upon so many things which men would not do if they did
   not believe them; as particularly the venturing of our lives upon the
   account of religion, and all our worldly interests, if occasion call
   for it; that it were a fond thing to take matters of such moment and
   importance upon any man's bare word, without other assurance of them.
   Nor can the testimony or authority of God be the argument that
   persuades me of the existence of a God. I grant that for the other two,
   the immortality of the soul, and a future state, it is an excellent,
   and may be a sufficient argument. Though that these may be proved like
   wise by other arguments without a revelation, is evident in the
   heathens, who by the light of nature did assent to them without a
   revelation. But a Di vine revelation cannot possibly be an argument
   inducing me to believe the existence of a God, for this plain reason;
   because a Divine revelation can be no argument to any that is not
   persuaded that it is a Divine revelation: but before I can be persuaded
   that any revelation is from God, I must be persuaded there is a God;
   and if so, there is no need of this argument to prove to me that there
   is one: and therefore, you do not find it any where revealed in all the
   Scripture, that there is a God. The Scripture often declares that
   Jehovah is the true and living God, and that "besides him there is no
   other:" but it doth not reveal, but every where suppose, that there is
   one.

   It remains, then, that it must be another kind of argument whereby we
   must be persuaded of the existence of a God, and that is, by such
   reasons as may be drawn from things themselves to persuade us hereof;
   as, either from the notion and idea which we have of a God; that he is
   a being that hath all perfections, whereof necessary existence is one,
   and consequently that he must be; or else from the universal consent of
   all nations, and the generality of persons agreeing in this
   apprehension, which cannot be attributed reasonably to any other cause,
   than to impressions stamped upon our understandings by God himself; or
   (which is most plain of all) from this visible frame of the world,
   which we cannot, without great violence to our understandings, impute
   to any other cause than a Being endowed with infinite goodness, and
   power, and wisdom, which is that we call God.

   As for the other two principles of natural religion, the immortality of
   the soul, and a future state, after we believe a God, we may be
   persuaded of these from Divine revelation; and that doth give us the
   highest and firmest assurance of them in the resurrection of Christ
   from the dead. Yet I do not find but that these also are rather
   supposed, than expressly revealed, in the Bible. Indeed, the
   immortality of the soul may be inferred from several places of
   Scripture, and the tenor of the whole Bible: and so a future state,
   which, as for the thing itself, seems to be supposed as a thing
   acknowledged by natural light; only the Scripture hath revealed the
   circumstances of it more particularly to us, and given us higher
   assurance of the thing: but if there were no revelation, men might be
   persuaded of these; and so the heathens were by arguments drawn partly
   from the operations of the soul, which would almost persuade any man
   that the soul is immortal; it being altogether unimaginable how a
   principle that is nothing else but matter, can either understand, or
   determine itself by its own will; all the motions of matter that we
   know of, or can imagine, being necessary; and partly from the justice
   and goodness of God. The consideration of God's goodness would persuade
   a man, that as he made all things very good, so he made them of the
   longest duration they were capable of; and the justice of God would
   easily induce a man to believe, seeing the providence of God doth
   generally in this life deal promiscuously with good and bad men, that
   there shall be a day which make a difference, and every man shall
   receive according to his works.

   But J do not intend to insist upon these arguments; all that I design
   is, to shew what kind of arguments do work a faith and persuasion in
   men concerning these principles of natural religion; and they are
   reasons drawn from the thing.

   And it is not always necessary to the working of this faith or
   persuasion, that these reasons should necessarily, yea, or truly
   conclude the principle to be believed; if they do it probably, and it
   appear so to me, it is enough to beget a persuasion in me of such a
   thing. There are many men entertain the greatest truths, and are firmly
   persuaded of them, upon an incompetent argument, and such as might
   persuade them of any thing else as well; and such persons, if they have
   capacity and understanding, they are rather happy than wise in their
   religion. It falls out well that they happen to be in the right; for
   they might have been in the wrong upon the same terms. But if the
   persons who believe the principles of religion on insufficient
   arguments, and their belief have a real effect upon them, as it will if
   it be true and permanent, if they be ignorant, and such as want the
   ordinary advantage of improving their knowledge, they are wise enough;
   that is, they are as wise as God's providence hath made them, and the
   circumstances of their education, and the condition of their life, will
   let them be.

   The third thing to be inquired is, Whether this faith or persuasion of
   the principles of natural religion admit degrees or not? And what
   differences are observable in them? That it does admit degrees, that
   is, that a man may be more or less persuaded of the truth of those
   principles, is evident from the heathens; some of whom did yield a more
   firm and unshaken assent to them; others entertained them with a more
   faint persuasion of them, especially of the immortality of the soul,
   and a future state, about which most of them had many qualms and
   doubts. Of all the heathens, Socrates seems to have had the truest and
   firmest persuasion of these things; which he did not only testify in
   words, but by the constancy, and calmness, and sedate courage which he
   manifested at his death. Indeed in his discourse before his death, he
   says, "He did not know whether his soul shall remain after his body,
   and whether there be a happiness reserved for good men in another
   world: but he thought so, and had such hopes of it, that he was very
   willing to venture his life upon these hopes." Which words, though they
   seem to be spoke doubtingly, as the manner of the Academy was; yet,
   considering his manner of speaking, which was modest, and not
   peremptory and dogmatical, they signify as great a confidence as he had
   of any thing, and they are high expressions of assurance. For we may
   believe that the man who dies for any thing, how modestly soever he may
   express himself, is very well assured of the truth of it. So that this
   faith and persuasion admits of degrees, the difference whereof is to be
   resolved partly into the capacity of the persons who believe, and
   partly into the strength, or at least appearance of strength, in the
   arguments whereby it is wrought.

   The fourth thing to be inquired is, What are the proper and genuine
   effects of this faith or persuasion? Now that, in a word, is natural
   religion, which consists in apprehensions of God suitable to his
   nature, and affections towards him suitable to these apprehensions, and
   actions suitable to both. He that believes there is such a being in the
   world as God, that is, one infinitely good, and wise, and powerful, and
   just, and holy, and (in a word) clothed with all excellency, will have
   a great esteem and reverence for him, and love to him, which he will
   testify in those outward expressions of respect which we call worship.
   He that believes that this being is the original of all good, that he
   made the world, and all the creatures in it, and preserves and governs
   them, he will depend upon him, and seek to him for every good thing,
   and acknowledge him for the author of them; which brings in prayer and
   thanks giving. He that believes that he owes his being to God, and all
   the blessings of his life, will think it reasonable that he should be
   at his disposal, will be willing to be governed by his laws, and ready
   to submit to his pleasure; which brings in obedience and submission to
   the will of God. He that believes there is another life after this,
   wherein men shall be rewarded or punished, according as they have
   demeaned themselves well or ill in this world, he will be encouraged to
   piety and virtue, and afraid to do any thing which his own reason tells
   him is displeasing to the Deity, as he cannot but believe every thing
   is, that is contrary to the nature of God, or the perfection of his own
   nature, or the good order and happiness of the world; which brings in
   temperance and justice, and all other real virtues. And that the belief
   of these principles had this effect upon several of the heathens, to
   make them in a good degree religious and virtuous, I doubt not; the
   moral and honest lives of many of them, give real testimony of this;
   which natural religion and morality of theirs, how far it may avail
   them for their good, we are not concerned to determine. This we are
   sure of, that it will make their condition more tolerable in another
   world; and if they fall under condemnation, it will mitigate and allay
   their misery.

   V. In what sense this faith or persuasion of the principles of natural
   religion may be said to be Divine? In these two respects:

   1. In respect of the object of it, or matters to be believed, which are
   Divine, and do immediately concern religion, in opposition to that
   which I call a civil and human faith, which is of such things as do not
   immediately concern God and religion.

   2. In respect of the Divine effect of it, which are to make men
   religious, and like God. And a faith may as properly be said to be
   Divine in respect of the object of it, as in respect of the argument
   whereby it is wrought; so that a faith of the principles of natural
   religion is as truly Divine, though it be not wrought in us by the
   arguments of Divine testimony and authority, as a faith of the matters
   of Divine revelation contained in the Holy Scriptures: for why a faith
   may not as well be said to be Divine for its relation to God as the
   object of it, as for its relation to the testimony of God, as the cause
   of it, I cannot understand.

   Secondly, The second sort of faith, which I call Divine or religious,
   is a persuasion of things supernaturally revealed, of things which are
   not known by natural light, but by some more immediate manifestation
   and discovery from God. Thus we find our Saviour (Matt. xvi. 15-17.)
   opposeth Divine revelation to the discovery of natural reason and
   light. He asks his disciples whom they believed him to be, "Whom say ye
   that I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ,
   (that is, the Messias) the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered
   and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona; for flesh and
   blood hath not revealed this unto thee; but my Father which is in
   heaven;" where a revelation or discovery from flesh and blood, is
   opposed to a revelation from God; "flesh and blood" being a Hebrew
   phrase or manner of speaking, signifying a mere man, or some thing
   merely human; so we mid the phrase used, Eph. vi. 12. "We wrestle not
   against flesh and blood; but against principalities, and powers, and
   spiritual wickedness;" that is, the enemies we are to contend with, are
   not only men, but devils; and which is nearer to our purpose, (Gal. i.
   16.) where the apostle would express to us, that he received not his
   commission from men, but immediately from the Lord Jesus Christ, he
   tells us, that "when it pleased God, who separated him from his
   mother's womb, and called him by his grace, to reveal his Son in him,
   that he might preach him among the heathen, immediately he conferred
   not with flesh and blood;" the word is prosanethe'men, "I did not apply
   myself to flesh and blood;" that is, I did not go to men to receive my
   commission from them: for so he explains it in the next words, "neither
   went I up to Jerusalem, to them that were apostles before me:" that is,
   I did not apply myself to the apostles, to derive any authority from
   them to preach the gospel, because he had no need of that, being called
   immediately by Christ to this work; which words are nothing else but a
   farther explication of what he had said before, (ver. 11, 12.) "I
   certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me, is not
   after men: for I neither received it of man, neither was taught it, but
   by the revelation of Jesus Christ." So accordingly here our Saviour
   tells Peter, that this truth, that Christ was the Messias, the Son of
   the living God, was not revealed to him by man, nor by any mere human
   principle or testimony, "but by his Father which was in heaven;" that
   is, by the testimony which God himself gave of him in the holy and
   Divine gospel which he taught, and those miracles which he wrought in
   confirmation of it.

   So that this kind of faith is a persuasion of such things, as are not
   known by natural light, nor discovered to us by men; but some way or
   other revealed by God: I say, some way or other, for the ways of God's
   revealing and manifesting himself to us, are various and arbitrary. God
   may choose what ways he pleaseth to discover himself to us by. So the
   apostle tells us, (Heb. i. 1.) "God who at sundry times and in divers
   manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets." God
   revealed himself, as at several times, by several steps and degrees, so
   in various manners; sometimes by visions, sometimes by dreams,
   sometimes by oracles, sometimes by a spirit of prophecy, sometimes by a
   voice from heaven, and sometimes by a secret and gentle inspiration.
   Now it matters not which of these ways God chooseth to reveal himself
   to us, provided we have sufficient evidence and grounds of assurance
   that the thing is revealed by God.

   As to us, these extraordinary ways of revelation are now ceased, and we
   have a fixed and a standing revelation, that is, the records of those
   revelations which God formerly made to holy men; and this is the Holy
   Scriptures, or the Bible, which is a system or collection of things
   supernaturally revealed.

   Now if this faith be considered as restrained to a part of Divine
   revelation, viz. the doctrine of the gospel, revealed to the world by
   Jesus Christ, then it is properly Christian faith, which frequently, in
   the New Testament, is called faith, kat' exoche'n, by way of excellency
   and eminency, this being the most eminent and perfect revelation which
   God hath made of himself to the world, which the apostle, at the
   beginning of this Epistle, advanceth above all those former revelations
   which God had made of himself to the fathers, those being by his
   servants and ministers, prophets and angels: "But in these last days
   God hath revealed himself to us by his Son, whom he hath made heir of
   all things," and advanced to a dignity above that of men or angels.

   And with relation to this faith of the gospel, Christians are
   peculiarly and eminently called believers: (I Thess. ii. 10.) "You know
   how unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe," that is,
   among you Christians. (2 Thess. i. 10.) "When he shall come to be
   glorified in his saints, and admired in all them that believe," meaning
   the Christians that entertain the gospel. And upon the same account,
   the apostle calls the whole society, or body of Christians, "the
   household of faith," (Gal. vi. 10.)

   But now I am considering faith, not in this more narrow and restrained
   sense, for a belief or persuasion of the doctrine of the gospel; but in
   a more large and comprehensive sense, for a persuasion of all things
   that are supernaturally revealed, that is, of all things contained in
   the Holy Scriptures.

   Now, all the matters of Divine revelation, which are contained in the
   book of Holy Scripture, may, I think, be reduced to one of these six
   heads:

   1. They are either a history or relation of some person, or matter of
   fact; and a faith of the historical part of Scripture, is nothing else
   but a persuasion that those narrations, or relations, are true. Or,

   2. A prophecy, or prediction of some event. Now a faith of the
   prophetical part of Scripture, is a persuasion that the event foretold
   will certainly come to pass. Or,

   3. A doctrine: such as are all those propositions in Scripture, which
   declare to us the nature or properties of God, the nature and office of
   Christ, that he is the eternal Son of God, that is, true God, the
   Messias, or Saviour of the world, the king, priest, and prophet of his
   church, and the like. Now a faith of the doctrinal part of Scripture,
   is a persuasion, that those propositions which contain these doctrines
   are true. Or,

   4. Laws for the ordering and governing of our spirits and lives, under
   which I comprehend all the precepts and prohibitions of Scripture,
   which are the matter of our duty. Now a faith of these, is a
   persuasion, that God hath commanded, and forbid den such things; and
   consequently that they are necessary to be observed by us. Or,

   5. Promises of good things, either with relation to this life or the
   other. Now a faith of the promises, is a persuasion or confident
   expectation that they will be accomplished. And thus the apostle
   describes the faith of the promises of another world, at the first
   verse of this chapter, that it is "the substance of things hoped for."
   upo'stasis, that is, a "confident expectation" that the promises of the
   gospel, which are the matter of our hope, shall be accomplished; "and
   the evidence of things not seen," a being convinced of the certainty
   and reality of future and invisible things. And thus likewise, the
   apostle explains to us the faith of Abraham, in reference to the
   promises of God, to give him a son: (Rom. iv. 21.) "He was fully
   persuaded, that what he had promised he was able to perform." Or,

   6. Threatenings. Now a faith of the threatenings, is a persuasion of
   the danger we incur, if we neglect our duty; that is, a belief that God
   justly may, and will (having confirmed his threatenings with an oath,
   which is a sign of the immutable determination of the Divine will)
   inflict those punishments upon us, which he hath threatened, in case we
   disobey his laws. These six heads do, I think, contain all, I am sure
   the most principal matters of Divine revelation, which I have the more
   care fully distinguished, because some of them are of a distinct and
   peculiar consideration from the rest, as will afterwards appear.

   Having thus, as plainly and briefly as I could, opened to you, what I
   mean by this second sort of Divine faith, which is a persuasion of
   things supernaturally revealed, I come now to satisfy such inquiries
   about this as may be most material. And here I shall proceed upon those
   heads of inquiry which I handled when I spake of the first sort of
   Divine faith.

   I. Whether this may truly and properly be called faith?

   II. What is the argument whereby this faith is wrought?

   III. Whether it admit of degrees, and what are the differences of them?

   IV. What are the proper and genuine effects of this faith?

   V. In what respects it may be said to be Divine?

   I. Whether this may truly and properly be called faith? And that it
   may, is evident, because the general definition of faith agrees to it;
   for a man may be persuaded in his mind concerning things supernaturally
   revealed; and the Scripture every where calls a persuasion of these
   matters by the name of faith. But besides this, it seems this is the
   adequate and only notion of faith, as it hath been fixed by the
   schools, and is become a term of art. For the definition that the
   schools give of faith is this; that it is an assent to a thing
   credible, as credible. Now, say they, that is credible which relies
   upon the testimony of a credible person; and consequently, a human
   faith is that which relies upon human testimony; and a Divine faith,
   that which relies upon the testimony or authority of God; which
   definition, though it be short and imperfect, (being, indeed, not a
   definition of faith in general, but of a particular kind of faith, viz.
   that which is wrought by the argument which we call testimony or
   authority, and consequently excludes a belief of the principles of
   natural religion, and a belief that the Scriptures are the word of God,
   from being faith), yet this shews thus much, that all agree in this,
   that a persuasion of things supernaturally revealed is truly and
   properly faith.

   II. What is the argument whereby this faith or persuasion of things
   supernaturally revealed is wrought in us? And this, by the general
   consent of all, is the testimony or authority of God, some way or other
   revealing these things to us; whose infallible and unerring knowledge,
   together with his goodness and authority, gives us the highest
   assurance, that he neither can be deceived himself, nor will deceive us
   in any thing that he reveals to ns. I say, the testimony or authority
   of God some way or other revealing things to us, is the argument
   whereby a faith of any supernatural revelation is wrought in us: but if
   we restrain all supernatural revelations to the Bible, as I told you we
   know of no other, then the particular kind of testimony whereby this
   faith is wrought in us, is the written word of God.

   III. As to the degrees of this faith. Supposing men sufficiently
   satisfied that the Scriptures are the word of God, that is, a Divine
   revelation; then all those who are sufficiently satisfied of this, do
   equally believe the things contained in the Scriptures. For if men be
   once fully satisfied that God hath spoken any thing, I think no man
   makes the least doubt but what God says is true. Now, there can be no
   degrees of faith where there is no doubt of the contrary; all the
   degrees that are in faith arising from a greater or less mixture of
   doubting. So that those who do not at all doubt but that the Scriptures
   are the word of God, have the same degree of persuasion concerning the
   matters contained in them; and that no man doubts whether what God says
   is true, ariseth from the fixed and constant notion which men
   universally have of God, that he is infallible and true. Therefore, we
   find, (Matt. xxi. 25.) when our Saviour puts the dilemma to the
   pharisees concerning the baptism of John, "whether it were from heaven,
   or of men?" that "they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall
   say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe
   him?" Which kind of reasoning imports thus much: that it is universally
   acknowledged, that no man can in reason make the least doubt of that
   which he believes to be from God. Therefore, a man would wonder what
   Becanus, the Jesuit, meant, unless it were to abuse the prophets and
   apostles, when he says, (tom. iii.) of his school divinity, that the
   prophets and apostles had evidentiam revelationis, non autem evidentiam
   primæ veritatis: tametsi enim evidenter cognoscerent Deum esse, qui
   ipsis revelabat mysteria fidei, non tamen evidenter cognoscebant Deum
   esse summe veracem, qui nec falii potuit, nec fallere: that is, "Though
   it was sufficiently evident to the prophets and apostles, that those
   revelations which they had were from God, yet it was not evident to
   them, that Divine revelations are true; for though they did evidently
   know, that there was a God, who revealed to them the mysteries of
   faith, yet they did not evidently know that God was in fallible and
   true, who could neither deceive nor be deceived." By which he doth not
   only make the prophets and apostles idiots, and destitute of one of the
   most common notions of human nature, which is, that God is infallible
   and true; but he doth likewise make all Divine revelation useless, and
   to no purpose. For, to what purpose is it for a man to be satisfied,
   that God reveals such a thing to him; if he be in the mean time
   unsatisfied, whether what God reveals is true? for no man that is
   unsatisfied, whether what God reveals be true, can, upon any tolerable
   ground of reason, yield a firm assent to Divine revelation. But it is
   pity to spend time in confuting any thing which confutes itself by its
   own absurdity, and its direct contradiction to the common notions of
   human nature. I proceed, therefore.

   Supposing any man be unsatisfied, and do make any doubt whether these
   books called the Holy Scriptures, or any of them, be the word of God,
   that is, a Divine revelation; proportionably to the degree of his
   doubting concerning the Divine authority of the Scriptures, there will
   be an abatement of his faith, as to the things contained in them: for
   he that believes a thing merely upon the credit or testimony of such a
   person; so much reason as he hath to doubt, whether such a person did
   speak, or testify such a thing, so much reason he hath to doubt whether
   the thing be true.

   And upon this account I think it is, that the Scripture speaks of
   degrees of faith; of growing and increasing in faith; of a strong
   faith, that is, such a faith as was either wholly, or in a great
   measure, free from doubting; and of a weak faith, that is, such a faith
   as had a great mixture of doubting; by which we are not to understand,
   that they doubted of the truth of any thing of which they were
   satisfied by a Divine revelation; but that they doubted whether such
   things were Divine revelations or not. So that the great doubt of the
   disciples was, whether Christ were the true Messias, and really the Son
   of God; for so far as they were satisfied of that, they could not doubt
   of any thing he said.

   IV. What are the proper and genuine effects of this faith? The proper
   and genuine effects of the belief of the Scriptures in general, is the
   conformity of our hearts and lives to what we believe; that is, to be
   such persons, and to live such lives, as it becomes those who do
   heartily believe, and are really persuaded of the truth of the
   Scriptures. And if this be a constant and abiding persuasion, it will
   produce this effect; but with more or less difficulty, according to the
   disposition of the subject, and the weakness or strength of contrary
   habits and inclinations. More particularly the effects of this faith
   are according to the nature of the matter believed. If it be a history
   or relation of things past, or prophecy of things to come; it hath an
   effect upon men so far as the history or prophecy doth concern them. If
   it be a doctrine; it hath the effect which the particular nature and
   tendency of such a doctrine requires. For instance: the doctrine of
   God's goodness is apt to inflame us with love to him; of his power and
   justice, with a fear and awe of him. This doctrine, that Christ is the
   Saviour of the world, the proper effect of it is to make men rely upon
   him for salvation; and so of the rest. If it be a precept, the proper
   effect of it is obedience: and hence it is that unbelief and
   disobedience are frequently put for one another in Scripture; and
   disobedience is opposed to faith; (1 Pet. ii. 7.) "Unto you therefore
   which believe, he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient," &c.
   where the disobedient are opposed to them that believe. And so likewise
   those who neglect any duty of religion, and do any thing notoriously
   unworthy of their profession, are said to deny the faith. (1 Tim. v.
   8.) "But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of
   his own house, he hath denied the faith." How does he deny the faith?
   In disobeying the precepts of the Christian religion, which chargeth us
   with such natural and moral duties. If it be a promise, the proper
   effect of it is encouragement to obedience by hopes of the thing
   promised: if a threatening, the proper effect of it is to restrain men
   from sin and disobedience.

   V. In what sense this faith of things supernaturally revealed, may be
   said to be a Divine faith? Answer.--Not only in respect of the matter
   and object of it, which are Divine things, such as concern God and
   religion and in respect of the Divine effects it hath upon those who
   believe these things; (for in these two respects a persuasion of the
   principles of natural religion, may be said to be a Divine faith;) but
   likewise in respect of the argument whereby it is wrought, which is a
   Divine testimony. As for the efficient cause, the Spirit of God, that
   does not immediately belong to this: for the Spirit of God doth not,
   speaking properly, persuade us immediately of the truth of things
   supernaturally revealed; but mediately, by persuading us of the truth
   of the revelation: for to believe a thing to be true, which we are
   persuaded is revealed by God, is so natural and consequent upon such a
   persuasion, that it doth not seem to require any new work of the
   Spirit. And if this be all the work of the Spirit, to persuade men that
   such a revelation is Divine; it will be most proper to speak of this
   when I come to the third sort of faith, which is, a persuasion of a
   Divine revelation that it is such: which because it hath many
   difficulties in it, deserves a more large and particular consideration.

SERMON CCXX.

  OF THE FAITH OR PERSUASION OF A DIVINE REVELATION.

   But without faith it is impossible to please God.--Heb. xi. 6.

   I HAVE observed, that a religious and Divine faith comprehends under it
   three things:

   First, A persuasion of the principles of natural religion, which are
   known by the light of nature.

   Secondly, A persuasion of things supernatural and revealed.

   Thirdly, A persuasion of supernatural revelation.

   The two former of these I have considered, and now proceed to the

   Third sort of faith, which I call Divine or religious; viz. a
   persuasion concerning a Divine revelation, that it is such: which I
   distinguish from the former thus. The former is a persuasion concerning
   the things which are revealed from God, that they are true: this is a
   persuasion concerning the revelation itself, that it is Divine and from
   God.

   For the opening of this there are many things to be taken into
   consideration.

   I. What we understand by a Divine revelation.

   II. The several kinds of it.

   III. Whether a persuasion concerning a Divine revelation be properly
   faith.

   IV. How we may come to be assured of a Divine revelation, or by what
   arguments a faith or persuasion of a Divine revelation is wrought in
   us.

   V. The degrees of this persuasion or assurance.

   VI. The effects of it.

   VII. In what sense it may be said to be a Divine faith; under which I
   shall speak something concerning the testimony of the Spirit.

   I. What we are to understand by a Divine revelation.--Answer. A
   supernatural discovery or manifestation of things to us. I say
   supernatural, because it may either be immediately by God, or by the
   mediation of angels: as most, if not all the revelations of the Old
   Testament were; a super natural discovery, or manifestation, either
   immediately to our minds, and inward faculties; (for I do not so well
   understand the distinction between understanding and imagination, as to
   be careful to take notice of it;) or else mediately to our
   understandings, by the mediation of our outward censes; as, by an
   external appearance to our bodily eyes, or by a voice and sound to the
   sense of hearing. But of this I have discoursed in a former sermon, [4]
   and therefore shall add no more here.

   II. For the several kinds of Divine revelation; of this also I have
   formerly [5] discoursed at large.

   III. Whether a persuasion of a Divine revelation may properly be called
   faith? To this I answer, that, according to the strait and narrow
   notion of faith which the schools have fixed, which is an as sent to
   any thing grounded upon the testimony and authority of God revealing
   it, a persuasion of a Divine revelation cannot properly be called
   faith; because it is irrational to expect that a man should have
   another Divine revelation to assure him that this is a Divine
   revelation: for then, for the same reason, I must expect another Divine
   revelation to assure me of that, and so without end. But I have
   sufficiently shewn, that this is not the true notion of faith in
   general, but only of a particular kind of faith; viz. that which is
   wrought by the argument, which we call testimony or authority. But
   according to the true and general notion of faith, which is a
   persuasion of the mind concerning any thing, a persuasion of the mind
   concerning a Divine revelation, may as properly be called faith, as any
   thing else, if men will but grant, that a man may be so satisfied,
   Concerning a Divine revelation, as verily to believe and be persuaded
   that it is so.

   IV. How we may come to be persuaded of a Divine revelation, that it is
   such; or by what arguments this persuasion is wrought in us? For answer
   to this, it will be requisite distinctly to consider,

   First, The persons to whom a Divine revelation is immediately made,
   what assurance they can have of it. And,

   Secondly, What assurance other persons can have of it. I say these are
   distinctly to be considered, because there is a very different account
   to be given of them.

   First, As to those persons to whom the revelation is immediately made,
   the question is, by what arguments or means they may come to be
   assured, that any revelation which they have, is really and truly such,
   and not a delusion or imposture. The Jewish doctors tell us, that some
   kind of Divine revelations do not carry full assurance along with them
   that they are Divine; such are dreams and visions, as they are
   distinguished from prophecy: and as to that kind of revelation, which
   they strictly call prophecy, they give several characteristical notes
   to distinguish true Divine revelation from delusion; such as these that
   the spirit of delusion only works upon the imagination, and the lower
   faculties; the Divine spirit of prophecy upon the understanding and
   reasonable part of the soul: that delusive inspirations were
   accompanied with alienation of mind, which did discover itself either
   in rage and fury, or melancholy; but the true prophetical spirit is
   always consistent with the use of reason and understanding. They
   distinguish them likewise by the manner of their seizing upon them;
   that in the beginning of inspirations the prophets use to have some
   apparition, or to hear some voice, either articulate in words, or
   inarticulate by thunder, or the sound of a trumpet, which in the
   Revelations doth frequently precede St. John's visions; and by these
   they were assured that they were Divine. And, lastly, that a Divine
   inspiration did always carry along with it a strong evidence of its
   original, and that by the vigour and strength of its impression, they
   were fully assured and satisfied beyond all doubt and hesitation: thus
   they. But all that I shall say by way of answer to this question, shall
   be in these two propositions:

   1. If we believe any such thing as Divine revelation, we cannot doubt
   but those who have it are some way or other fully satisfied of it. The
   reason is evident; because otherwise it would be in vain, and to no
   purpose, and could not possibly attain its end. A Divine revelation
   cannot possibly signify any thing, or in reason have any effect upon a
   man, unless he be satisfied it is such: for so long as he does not know
   but that it is a delusion, he will not attend to it, or regard it. So
   that the distinction of the Jewish doctors between dreams and visions,
   and prophecy, that this carries always full assurance with it, the
   other not, is vain and unreasonable.

   2. The means whereby this assurance of a Divine revelation is wrought,
   is most probably the evidence it carries along with it, whereby it did
   fully satisfy the person that had it of its Divine original. That God
   can accompany his own revelations with such a clear and overpowering
   light as shall discover to us the divinity of them, and satisfy us be
   yond all doubt and scruple, I think no man can doubt, that considers
   the vast power and influence which he must needs have over our
   understandings who made them, and knows the frame of them: and if this
   be granted, it is not necessary to explain the particular way how it is
   done, it being a thing not to be expressed in words, but to be felt and
   experienced. So that the argument, whereby this persuasion of a Divine
   revelation is wrought in those that have it, is inward experience of
   the full satisfaction and assurance, which they find to be
   supernaturally wrought in them; that is, of which they can give no
   account from themselves. And this is not a stubborn belief, and an
   obstinate conceit of a thing: but a good man, who is inspired, when he
   reflects upon himself, and this assurance which he finds in himself, he
   can give a rational account of it to himself. Thus he finds that it is
   a foreign impression, and doth not spring from himself, nor hath its
   rise from thence; therefore he ascribes it to some spirit without
   himself; and he believes that there is a God that can communicate
   himself to the minds and spirits of men: and that his goodness is such,
   that he will not suffer them to be under a necessity of delusion, which
   they must be, if, when they have the highest assurance and
   satisfaction, that such a thing is a Divine revelation, they maybe
   deceived. And then likewise he considers the matter of the revelation,
   which if it do not contradict any essential and necessary fundamental
   notion of his understanding, he thinks himself bound to entertain it
   upon this assurance.

   I say, good men may give themselves this rational satisfaction: for I
   grant a wicked man, that rejects and disobeys the truth of God, may so
   provoke him, as "to give him up to strong delusions, to believe lies;"
   and he may be as confident of a lie, as a good man is of truth. But as
   this is not unjust from God in reference to the persons, so it is no
   prejudice to the assurance which good men may have of Divine
   revelation.

   And this assurance is such, as it is not in the power of any evil
   spirit to convey to us, concerning a delusion; or if it be in his
   power, he is not permitted to do it to any who have not highly provoked
   God, by rejecting the truth, "to give them up to strong delusions, to
   believe lies:" and that such persons should be obnoxious to such
   delusions, as it is not unjust in reference to them, so neither is it
   any prejudice to the assurance which good men may have of such
   revelations which are truly and really Divine.

   But for the other ways of discerning true revelation from false, which
   the Jews mention; as, that the Spirit of God always works upon the
   under standing, as well as the imagination, and in consequence with the
   use of reason and understanding, and gives some sensible notice of its
   seizing upon men, I think all these to be uncertain if they be
   examined. And if the last which they mention, viz. this that I have
   insisted upon, be true, all the other are superfluous. For what need of
   any other sign to assure a man that that is a Divine revelation, which
   carries along with it a clear satisfaction and full assurance that it
   is such?

   So that it remains now, that we fix upon some particular ways where by
   the person that hath a Di vine revelation may be assured of it; and
   this I shall do by these propositions.

   First, That God can work in the mind of man a firm persuasion of a
   thing, by giving him a clear and vigorous perception of it; and if so,
   then God can accompany his own revelations with such a clear and
   overpowering light, as shall discover to us the divinity of them, and
   satisfy us thereof be yond all doubt and scruple. And this no man can
   doubt of, that considers the vast power and influence which God, who
   made the soul of man, and perfectly knows the frame of it, must needs
   have upon the mind and understanding of man.

   Secondly, God never persuades a man of any thing that contradicts the
   natural and essential notions of his mind and understanding. For this
   would be to destroy his own workmanship, and to impose that upon the
   understanding of a man, which, whilst it retains its own nature, and
   remains what it is, it cannot possibly admit. For instance: we cannot
   imagine that God can persuade any man that there is no God; for he that
   believes any thing as from God, must necessarily believe there is a
   God; therefore it is impossible that he can be persuaded of this as
   from God, that there is no God; and that he is not wise and just, and
   good and powerful; and that he is not to be honoured and loved by all
   reasonable creatures: because these do clearly and immediately
   contradict the most essential and fundamental notions of our minds
   concerning God, and the respect which is due to him: not only because
   it is unworthy of God to go about to persuade a man of a falsehood; but
   be cause it is impossible in the nature of the thing, that the mind of
   man, which is naturally prepossessed with contrary notions, should,
   whilst it retains its own nature, admit of such as do clearly and
   immediately contradict them. For if these be natural notions, that
   there is a God, that he must be wise and just and good and powerful,
   and ought to be honoured and loved by his creatures; the mind of man
   cannot possibly admit of any contrary persuasions and impressions: for
   the former persuasions being natural to us, will always remain while
   our nature remains, and if any persuasions contrary to these could be
   wrought upon our minds, they would signify nothing, but would mutually
   destroy one another. For if any man that is persuaded that God is good,
   (as every man is, that is persuaded he is at all) could, during the
   persuasion, be likewise of a contrary persuasion, that he is not good;
   this latter persuasion would signify nothing: for he is not persuaded
   that God is not good, whilst he retains this persuasion that he is
   good.

   Thirdly, Supposing the thing revealed do not contradict the essential
   notions of our minds, no good and holy man hath reason to doubt of any
   thing, whether it be a revelation from God or not, of which he hath a
   clear and vigorous perception, and full satisfaction in his own mind
   that it is such. For if a man may have reason to doubt of any thing,
   whereof he hath a clear perception, then no man can be certain of any
   thing. Now that there is such a thing as certainty, is now supposed and
   not to be proved. I say, a good and holy man can have no reason to
   doubt: for a wicked man (I grant) may, by a sinful rejection of, and
   disobedience to, the truth, so far provoke God, as "to give him up to
   strong delusions to believe lies;" and he may be as confident of a lie,
   as any good man is of the truth.

   And as this is not unjust from God in reference to wicked men, so it is
   no prejudice to the assurance which good men may have concerning a
   Divine revelation.

   Fourthly, A good and holy man reflecting upon this assurance and
   persuasion that he hath, may be able to give himself a reasonable
   account of it, and satisfy himself that it is not a stubborn belief and
   an obstinate conceit of things without any ground or reason. A good man
   is secretly and within him self persuaded, that God hath revealed to
   him such a thing; reflecting upon this persuasion, he finds that it is
   a foreign impression, and doth not spring from his own mind: how he
   believing that there is a God, who can, and probably doth communicate
   and reveal himself to the minds of good men; and being withal satisfied
   that his goodness is such, that he will not suffer good men, who do
   heartily and sincerely desire to know his will, to be under a necessity
   of delusion, (which they unavoidably are, if they may then be deceived,
   when they have the greatest assurance and clearest satisfaction that
   such a thing is revealed to them of God;) from hence he reasonably
   concludes, that he ought not to question the matter any farther. I
   might instance in the revelation made to Abraham, concerning the
   sacrificing his son, which hath the greatest difficulty in it of any
   case I know of: but of that I have else where discoursed at large. [6]
   Thus much for the first.

   Secondly, What assurance can other persons, who have not the revelation
   immediately made to them, have of a Divine revelation? To this I shall
   answer by these propositions:

   1. That there are some means whereby a man may be assured of another's
   revelation that it is Divine. For,

   (1.) Otherwise it would signify nothing, but only to the person that
   immediately had it; which would make void the chief end of most
   revelations, which are seldom made to particular persons for their own
   sakes only, but, for the most part, on purpose that they may be made
   known to others, which could not effectually be done, unless there be
   some means whereby men may be assured of revelations made to another.

   (2.) None could be guilty of unbelief but those who had immediate
   revelation made to them. For no man is guilty of unbelief that is not
   obliged to believe: but no man can be under any obligation to believe
   any thing, who hath not sufficient means whereby he may be assured that
   such a thing is true.

   2. The private assurance and satisfaction of another concerning a
   revelation made to him, can signify nothing at all to me, to assure me
   of it. For what satisfaction is it to me, that another may say, he hath
   a revelation, unless I have some means to be assured that what he saith
   is true? For if I must believe every spirit, that is, every man that
   says he is inspired, I lie open to all possible impostures and
   delusions, and must believe every one that either foolishly conceits,
   or falsely pretends, that he hath a revelation: for both the conceited
   and pretended enthusiast will say they have revelations, with as much
   confidence as those who are truly and divinely inspired: and to take
   every man's word in matters of such huge consequence and importance as
   revelation from God ought to be presumed to be, would not be faith, but
   credulity, that is, an ungrounded persuasion; which how severely God
   punished, you may see in that famous instance, (1 Kings xiii.) where
   the prophet that was sent to Bethel, is upon his return torn in pieces
   by a lion, because of his credulity and easy belief of a pretended
   revelation. I confess this case is somewhat different from theirs who
   simply believe a pretended revelation, as being complicated with some
   other aggravating circumstances. For he had an immediate revelation
   from God, "not to eat, nor drink at Bethel; nor to return the same way
   that he came:" upon his return an old prophet meets him, and tells him
   that an angel had appeared to him, and had bid him to bring him back,
   and to cause him to eat and drink; he believes him, and turns in with
   him. Now this was the aggravation of his credulity that when he himself
   had had an express revelation from God, concerning which he was
   satisfied, he hearkened to the pretended revelation of another,
   concerning which he had no assurance, in contradiction to a Divine
   revelation, which he knew to be such. Not but that the command which
   God had given him was in its own nature revokable, and God might have
   countermanded it by another immediate revelation to him, or by an
   equivalent, that is, a miracle wrought by the prophet who pretended to
   countermand it from God; Unumquodque dissolvitur eo modo qui ligatur,
   the obligation which was brought upon him by an immediate revelation,
   could not be dissolved but by another immediate revelation, or evidence
   equivalent to it. However, this instance serves in the general to my
   purpose, that a man may be faulty by credulity as well as by unbelief:
   and as a man ought not to disbelieve where there is sufficient
   evidence; so neither ought he to believe any thing without sufficient
   grounds of assurance.

   3. That miracles wrought for the confirmation of any Divine testimony
   or revelation made to another, are a sufficient means, whereby those
   who have not the Divine revelation immediately made to them, may be
   assured that it is Divine; I say, these are sufficient means of
   assurance in this case. I do not say they are the only means (for it
   does not become men to limit the power and wisdom of God), but I do not
   know of any other means of assurance upon which men can securely rely;
   and it is a great presumption that this is the best and fittest, if not
   the only means, because the wisdom of God has always pitched upon it,
   and constantly made use of it, and no other. Under miracles I
   comprehend the prediction of future events, which God claims as a
   peculiar prerogative to himself, because such things are out of the
   reach of any created understanding; and therefore in the prophet Isaiah
   he challengeth the idols of the heathens to give this testimony, or
   argument of their divinity; "Shew us things that are to come, that we
   may know that ye are gods."

   But here we must distinguish between doubtful and unquestionable
   miracles. I call those doubtful miracles, which, though a man cannot
   tell how they can be done by any natural power, yet do not carry that
   full conviction with them, as to be universally owned and acknowledged
   for arguments of a Di vine power. Such were those which the magicians
   did by their enchantments. I call those unquestionable, which,
   considering their quality and number, and the public manner of doing
   them, are out of all question. Such were the miracles of Moses, and our
   Saviour. Now a doubtful, and a single, and a private wonder, or
   miracle, as I may call it, can give no confirmation to any thing, in
   opposition to a revelation, or a doctrine, confirmed by many, and
   public and unquestionable miracles.

   Upon this account Moses forbids the children of Israel to hearken to
   any prophet that should come to seduce them to idolatry; yea, though he
   should give a sign or wonder, and the "sign or wonder should come to
   pass," (Deut. xiii. 1-4.) Now here lies the strength of the reason,
   "Because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God, which
   brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house
   of bondage;" that is, because he contradicts the great revelation which
   God made of himself, and confirmed by such a succession of so many, and
   so great miracles; the credit of which revelation ought not in reason
   to be called in question upon the working of a single and a private
   wonder, which we could not distinguish from a miracle. Upon the same
   account St. Paul (Gal. i. 8.) says, "Though an angel from heaven should
   preach any other doctrine than that which had been preached unto them,
   he should be accursed;" that is, after so clear and great confirmation,
   as was given to the gospel, a contrary doctrine, though it should come
   from an angel, should be rejected as execrable.

   But you will say, Suppose such a prophet as Moses speaks of here, such
   an angel as St. Paul mentions, should work as many and as great
   miracles as Moses and Christ wrought, should we then believe them?

   I answer; This is not to be supposed: for sup posing the providence of
   God in the world, it can not be imagined that an equal attestation
   should be given to a false doctrine and a true. But that the greatest
   and most unquestionable miracles are to carry it, is evident; because
   this is all the reason why Moses was to be credited above the
   magicians, because he wrought more and greater wonders than they did.
   But if it could be supposed, that any one could work as great miracles
   for the confirmation of idolatry, as were wrought by way of attestation
   to the true worship of God, then there would be no difference, but what
   the reason of the thing makes; the belief of one God being more
   reasonable than many; and not to make an image or sensible
   representation of a spirit, being more reasonable than to make one. But
   if this could be supposed, the natural issue and consequence of it
   would be atheism; a man would believe neither that nor the other, nor
   that there is any God at all.

   But a farther account of the nature and difference of miracles, I
   reserve to some [7] particular discourses on that subject. At present,
   for the fuller opening of this matter, it will be proper to shew,--

   1. That the Divine authority both of the doctrine of Moses and Christ
   is resolved into miracles.

   2. What assurance of miracles is sufficient to persuade men to believe
   that testimony, for the confirmation of which they are wrought.

   3. What assurance they give us, that the Scriptures are a Divine
   revelation.

   But the consideration of these I refer to the next opportunity.

SERMON CCXXI.

  OF THE FAITH OR PERSUASION OF A DIVINE REVELATION.

   But without faith it is impossible to please God.--Heb. xi. 6.

   IN discoursing of the faith or persuasion of a Divine revelation, I
   proposed the considering these seven things:

   I. What we understand by a Divine revelation.

   II. The several kinds of it.

   III. Whether a persuasion concerning a Divine revelation be properly
   faith.

   IV. How we may come to be assured of a Divine revelation; or by what
   arguments a faith or persuasion of a Divine revelation is wrought in
   us.

   V. The degrees of this persuasion or assurance.

   VI. The effects of it.

   VII. In what sense it may be said to be a Divine faith.

   I was upon the fourth of these, viz. considering by what arguments a
   faith or persuasion of a Divine revelation is wrought in us; which led
   me to consider the evidence of miracles; and I proposed to shew
   particularly these three things:

   1. That the Divine authority both of the doctrine of Moses and Christ
   is resolved into miracles.

   2. What assurance of miracles is sufficient to persuade men to believe
   that testimony, for the continuation of which they are wrought.

   3. What assurance they give us that the Scriptures are a Divine
   revelation.

   I proceed to treat of these in their order.

   1. I shall shew that the Divine authority both of the doctrine of Moses
   and of Christ, is resolved into miracles. We find the Scripture lays
   the whole weight of the Divine authority, both of the law and gospel,
   of the revelation of the Old and New Testament, upon this evidence.
   (Exod. iv. 13.) When God sends Moses, he objects, "that they will not
   believe him, nor hearken to him, but will say, The Lord hath not
   appeared unto him." Thereupon God gives him a power of miracles, that
   they may believe "that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of
   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, hath appeared unto him;" and by the evidence
   of those miracles which he wrought, he prevailed over the magicians.
   And generally, throughout the story of the Old Testament, we find all
   persons yielding to the evidence of miracles, as a sufficient
   attestation to a prophet and his message. When Elijah had prevailed
   with God in a miraculous manner to confirm his own worship, and confute
   the worship of Baal, by sending fire from heaven to consume the
   sacrifice, the people yield to this evidence, and cry out, "The Lord he
   is God, the Lord he is God," (1 Kings xviii. 39.) When Elijah raised
   the woman's son, then she owned him for a prophet; (1 Kings xvii. 24.)
   "Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of
   the Lord in thy mouth is true." So like wise Naaman was convinced by
   the miraculous cure which the prophet Elisha wrought on him: (2 Kings
   v. 15.) "Behold! now I know that there is no God in all the earth but
   in Israel."

   And so likewise the divinity of our Saviour and his doctrine is
   resolved into the evidence of his miracles. This is the evidence Christ
   gives of himself, when John sent his disciples to inquire whether he
   was the Messias; (Matt. xi. 2.) "Now when John had heard in the prison
   the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, and said unto him,
   Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? Jesus answered
   and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do
   hear and see. The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the
   lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the
   poor have the gospel preached unto them. And blessed is he whosoever
   shall not be offended in me." So John v. 36. "But I have greater
   witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me
   to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the
   Father hath sent me." (Chap. x. 25.) "Jesus answered them, I told you,
   and ye believed it not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they
   bear witness of me." (Ver. 37, 38.) "If I do not the works of my
   Father, believe me not; but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe
   the works; that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I
   in him." (Chap. xiv. 11.) "Believe me that I am in the Father and the
   Father in me: or else believe me for the very works sake." (Chap. xx.
   30, 31.) "And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
   disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written,
   that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and
   that, believing, ye might have life through his name." And from hence
   our Saviour aggravates the unbelief, and the impenitency of the Jews,
   because they resisted this highest evidence: (Matt. xi. 20 24.) "Then
   began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were
   done, because they repented not: Woe unto thee, Chorazin; woe unto
   thee, Bethsaida: for if the mighty works which were done in yon, had
   been done in Tyre and Si don, they would have repented long ago in
   sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for
   Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for yon. And thou,
   Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to
   hell. For if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been
   done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto
   you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day
   of judgment than for thee." (John xv. 24.) "If I had not done among
   them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now
   have they both seen and hated both me and my Father." And so the
   apostle tells us, that miracles are the great confirmation of the
   gospel, and are so clear an evidence of the truth of it, that they
   render all unbelievers inexcusable: (Heb. ii. 2, 3.) "For if the word
   spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and
   disobedience received a just recompense of reward; how shall we escape,
   if we neglect so great salvation, which at first began to be spoken by
   the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?"

   In particular, the great weight of the gospel is laid upon the miracle
   of Christ's resurrection from the dead, which our Saviour mentions as
   the "only sign that should be given to that generation," that is, the
   clearest. And the apostle (Rom. i. 4.) saith, that "he was declared to
   be the Son of God, with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by
   the resurrection from the dead." This puts it out of all question. And
   St. Paul, in his sermon to the Athenians, (Acts xvii. 30, 31.) insists
   upon this as the great evidence; "And the times of this ignorance God
   winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: because he
   hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness,
   by that man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto
   all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead." And this was the
   proper work of the apostles, to be witnesses to the world of this great
   miracle: (Acts i. 21, 22.) "Wherefore, of these men which have
   companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out
   among us, beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that
   he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us
   of his resurrection." So St. Peter, in his sermon, (Acts ii. 32.) "Him
   hath God raised up, whereof we are all witnesses." And to mention no
   more, (Acts x. 38-41.) "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
   Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that
   were oppressed of the devil: for God was with him. And we are witnesses
   of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in
   Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree: him God raised up the
   third day, and shewed him openly; not to all the people, but unto
   witnesses chosen before of God, even to us who did eat and drink with
   him after he rose from the dead."

   2. What assurance of miracles is sufficient to persuade men to believe
   the revelation or testimony, for the confirmation of which they are
   wrought. Of this assurance there are three degrees, all which do oblige
   men to believe the Divine revelation for which they are wrought.

   (1.) If we have the evidence of our own senses for it, that is, if we
   see them wrought. This evidence the disciples of our Lord had, and the
   Jews, and therefore their unbelief was inexcusable; and the blaspheming
   the Spirit whereby they saw such miracles to be wrought, was the sin
   against the Holy Ghost.

   (2.) If we have the credible report of eye-witnesses of those miracles,
   who are credible persons, and we have no reason to doubt of their
   testimony; that is, if we have the report of them immediately from the
   mouth of those who were eye-witnesses of them. That this lays likewise
   an obligation on men to believe, appears by our Saviour's reproof of
   Thomas, who would not believe except he himself saw: but most expressly
   from that text, (Mark xvi. 14.) "He upbraided them with their unbelief
   and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen
   him after he was risen."

   (3.) If the credible report of eye-witnesses concerning such miracles
   be conveyed to us in such a manner, and with so much evidence, as we
   have no reason to doubt of it. For why should we not believe a credible
   report conveyed to us in such a manner, as we have no reason to
   question, but that it hath been faithfully conveyed and transmitted to
   us? St. John thought this to be assurance sufficient to induce belief:
   (John xx. 31.) "But these things were written that ye might believe,"
   &c. And this is that assurance which we, who live at this distance from
   the age of Christ and his apostles, have of the miracles wrought in
   confirmation of the gospel. I shall have occasion to enlarge upon these
   heads hereafter.

   3. What assurance miracles give us, that the Scriptures are a Divine
   revelation. And this contains four distinct questions in it.

   (1.) What assurance we have from hence, that the doctrine contained in
   the Scripture is from God? To which the answer is easy; because these
   miracles were wrought for the confirmation of this doctrine.

   (2.) The question is, What assurance the miracles give us, that those
   persons who are said to be the penmen of the several books of
   Scripture, were really so? To this I answer: None at all: for I do not
   know of any miracle that was wrought to prove Moses wrote the
   Pentateuch, or that St. Matthew wrote the Gospel which goes under his
   name. But if the question be, How then am I assured of this? I answer,
   by credible and uncontrolled report. It bears his name; and hath always
   been received for his: and if this will not satisfy, I cannot prove it
   farther; it is too late now to prove it by any other argument. St.
   Matthew is dead, and those who saw him write it, and those who received
   it from them; so that we cannot go to inquire of them in order to our
   satisfaction: but the best of it is, that as it cannot now be proved at
   this distance other wise than by constant and uncontrolled report; so
   no man at this distance can have any reason to doubt of it; and so long
   as no man can have reason to doubt of it, there can be no need of
   proving it; especially considering, that it is by no means necessary to
   salvation, to believe that St. Matthew wrote the history of the gospel;
   but only to believe what he wrote.

   (3.) The question is, What assurance miracles give, that those persons
   who are said to be the penmen of the books of Scripture were divinely
   inspired? The miracles (under which I comprehend the prediction of
   future events) which Moses and the prophets and the apostles wrought,
   were testimonies from heaven, that they were Divine persons, and that
   what they said was to be credited, and consequently if they gave out
   themselves for such, that they were such. That the penmen of the New
   Testament were persons endued with a miraculous power, is plain,
   because they were most of them apostles: and for the rest we have no
   reason to doubt of it; those extraordinary gifts being so common in the
   primitive times: however, so long as there is nothing in the rest, that
   is dissonant from, or contrary to, what those wrote, of whose
   inspirations we are assured, and these their writings have always been
   received in the church as of Divine inspiration, which we may well
   presume was not rashly done, and without grounds, we have no reason to
   doubt as to them: or if they were, so long as they contain nothing that
   is contrary to those who were unquestionably inspired, the matter is of
   no dangerous consequence. And as for the penmen of the Old Testament,
   we are assured that they were all inspired, by one in the New
   Testament, that was unquestionably so; St. Paul, who tells us, "That
   all Scripture is of Divine inspiration," meaning the books of the Old
   Testament which were called by that name, kat' exoche'n, or by way of
   eminency.

   But if any one inquire farther, how far the pen men of Scripture were
   inspired in the writing of those books? whether only so far as to be
   secured from mistake in the delivery of any message or doctrine from
   God, or in the relation of any history, or matter of fact; yet so, as
   they were left every man to his own style and manner of expression? or
   that every thing they wrote was immediately dictated to them, and that
   not only the sense of it, but the very words and phrases by which they
   express things, and that they were merely instruments or penmen--I
   shall not take upon me to determine; I shall only say this in general,
   that considering the end of this inspiration, which was to inform the
   world certainly of the mind and will of God, it is necessary for every
   man to believe that the inspired penmen of Scripture were so far
   assisted as was necessary to this end: and he that thinks upon good
   grounds that this end cannot be secured, unless every word and syllable
   were immediately dictated, he hath reason to believe it was so; but if
   any man upon good grounds thinks the end of writing the Scripture may
   be sufficiently secured without that, he hath no reason to conclude,
   that God, who is not wanting in what is necessary, is guilty of doing
   what is superfluous. And if any man is of opinion, that Moses might
   write the history of those actions which he himself did or was present
   at, without an immediate revelation of them; or that Solomon by his
   natural and acquired wisdom might speak those wise sayings which are in
   his Proverbs; or the evangelists might write what they heard and saw,
   or what they had good assurance of from others, as St. Luke tells he
   did; or that St. Paul might write for his cloak and parchments at
   Troas, and salute by name his friends and brethren, or that he might
   advise Timothy to drink a little wine, &c. without the immediate
   dictate of the Spirit of God--he seems to have reason on his side. For
   that men may, without an immediate revelation, write those things which
   they think without a revelation, seems very plain. And that they did
   so, there is this probable argument for it, because we find that the
   evangelists in relating the discourses of Christ, are very far from
   agreeing in the particular expressions and words, though they do agree
   in the substance of the discourses: but if the words had been dictated
   by the Spirit of God, they must have agreed in them. For when St. Luke
   differs from St. Matthew, in relating what our Saviour said, it is
   impossible that they should both relate it right as to the very words
   and form of expression; but they both relate the substance of what he
   said. And if it had been of concernment, that every thing that they
   wrote should be dictated ad apicem, to a tittle, by the Spirit of God,
   it is of the same concernment still, that the providence of God should
   have secured the Scriptures since to a tittle from the least
   alteration: which, that it is not done, appears by the various readings
   both of the Old and New Testament, concerning which, no man can
   infallibly say, that this is right, and not the other. It seems
   sufficient in this matter to assert, that the Spirit of God did reveal
   to the penmen of the Scriptures what was necessary to be revealed: and
   as to all other things, that he did superintend them in the writing of
   it, so far as to secure them from any material error or mistake in what
   they have delivered. Or,

   4. If the question be, What assurance we have from miracles, that all
   those books which we receive are canonical? To this I answer, I do not
   know of any miracle that was ever written on purpose to confirm the
   canon of the Scriptures: but as for the books of the Old Testament, we
   have sufficient assurance, that those which we now receive, are those
   which the Jews received for such in our Saviour's time; and he doth not
   any where find fault with any of them as not canonical, which we have
   no reason to doubt but he would have done, if any one of them had been
   otherwise. And that these are the same the Jews then received, appears
   sufficiently, because both Jews and Christians to this day agree in
   them. And as for the books of the New Testament, we are sufficiently
   assured, that these and no other are the books which the ancient church
   received for canonical and of Divine authority, and though some of them
   were for a time controverted, yet upon farther inquiry and examination
   they were received.

   V. Whether this faith concerning a Divine revelation made to others, do
   admit of degrees? That it doth, is evident from these expressions which
   the Scripture useth, of "increasing faith," of "growing in it," of "a
   weak and strong faith," all which plainly supposeth degrees. And that
   these degrees of faith which the Scripture speaks of, are to be
   understood of a higher and lower degree of assurance concerning a
   Divine revelation as such, and concerning the things revealed, I shewed
   before. For all the doubts which the disciples had concerning what our
   Saviour taught, did resolve itself into this whether he was the
   Messias, and sent by God to teach those things; which, had they been
   fully satisfied of, they could have made no doubt of any thing that he
   taught.

   And here it will be proper to inquire, what is the highest degree of
   assurance which we can have concerning a Divine revelation made to
   another, that it is such; whether it be an infallible assurance, or
   only an undoubted certainty. The difference between them is this: an
   infallible assurance is such as excludes all possibility of error and
   mistake; an undoubted certainty doth not exclude all possibility of
   mistake, but only all just and reasonable cause why a prudent and
   considerate man should doubt. And the reason why I make this inquiry,
   is, in order to be satisfied of a clear and firm way for the resolution
   of our faith, against the papists, who say it is impossible for us to
   give any satisfactory account of our faith, because we do finally
   resolve it into fallible grounds, and consequently our faith must be
   fallible, and consequently cannot be Di vine, because all Divine faith
   is infallible; for, say they, when we inquire why you believe the
   doctrines of Christian religion; you say, upon Divine authority, or the
   revelation of God in Scripture. This is granted to be an infallible
   ground, if we can be infallibly assured that the Scriptures are a Di
   vine revelation; therefore they inquire in the second place, Why do you
   believe the Scriptures to be a Divine revelation? We say, because the
   persons who delivered the doctrines contained in them, had the greatest
   attestation from God, that they were employed by him, to reveal and
   make known his mind; and this attestation was miracles. But then they
   ask, What assurance have you that such miracles were wrought? Have you
   an infallible assurance, or not? If not, then it cannot be a sufficient
   ground for a Divine faith, which is always infallible. In opposition
   therefore to them, I shall not now attempt to shew the insufficiency of
   their way of resolving faith; but vindicate ours as sufficient, by
   laying down and proving, if I can, these propositions:--

   1. That infallibility is not essential to Divine faith, and necessarily
   included in the notion of it: which I prove thus. Divine faith admits
   of degrees, as I have shewed before: but there can be no degree of
   infallibility. Infallibility is an impossibility of being deceived; but
   there are no degrees of impossibility, one thing is not more impossible
   than another: but all things that are impossible, are equally so.

   2. That the assurance which we have of the miracles wrought for the
   confirmation of the gospel, is not an infallible assurance. I shewed
   before, that there are three ways whereby we may be assured of matter
   of fact, such as the working of miracles is.

   First, By our own senses.

   Secondly, By the report of credible witnesses.

   Thirdly, By credible history. But none of these ways give us infallible
   assurance. That it is possible our senses may deceive us, I think
   nobody will deny; and if so, then the testimony of witnesses, and the
   report of history, which likewise depends originally upon our senses,
   may deceive us. I do not know a fourth way whereby we may be assured of
   matter of fact.

   3. That an undoubted assurance of a Divine revelation, that it is such,
   is as much as in reason can be expected. I deny not, but that a Divine
   revelation is an infallible ground of faith; because what ever God says
   is infallibly true, and a faith built upon a Divine revelation would be
   infallible, if we could be infallibly assured that it is a Divine
   revelation; but that we cannot be without another Divine revelation to
   assure us infallibly that this is one, and that other would require a
   third, and so without end; which being absurd and unreasonable, t
   remains that an infallible assurance of a Divine revelation is
   impossible; and consequently, that we can have no more than an
   undoubted assurance; and this is as much as in reason we can expect to
   have; for it is unreasonable to expect that we should have any greater
   assurance that such a revelation is from God, than we have that there
   is a God, because that there is a God, is the first and most
   fundamental principle in religion, and it is unreasonable to expect
   greater assurance of any thing in religion, than we have of that which
   is the first principle of it. And indeed it is impossible; for no man
   can be infallibly assured, that a revelation is from God, unless he be
   first infallibly assured, that there is a God, but no man hath more
   than undoubted assurance that there is a God. No man pretends to a
   Divine revelation that there is a God; but only to have rational
   satisfaction of it, such as leaves no just or reasonable cause to doubt
   of it. And why then should any desire greater assurance of a Divine
   revelation, than he hath of a God?

   4. An undoubted assurance is sufficient to constitute a Divine faith.
   Mark xvi. 14, it is said, Christ upbraided his disciples with their
   unbelief; because they believed not on them, who had seen him after he
   was risen. Suppose now the disciples had believed, which they ought to
   have done, this faith of theirs would have been a truly Divine faith;
   but by no means infallible. For that cannot be an infallible faith
   which is built but upon fallible grounds: now the ground upon which
   they ought to have believed, was the report of credible witnesses; but
   the report of credible witnesses is by no means infallible: it is
   indeed undoubted, for I have no reason to doubt of a credible report;
   for that is credible which I have just cause to believe; but I can have
   no just cause to doubt of that which I have just cause to believe.

   As an undoubted assurance i$ sufficient to constitute a Divine faith,
   so it is sufficient to all the ends and purposes of a Divine faith. To
   instance in the faith of the promises of eternal life. What is the end
   and design of this faith, but to encourage our obedience, and make us
   continue in it, notwithstanding the hazard of any thing in this world?
   Now I say, an undoubted assurance is abundantly sufficient to this end.
   Do not men venture their estates in traffic to places they never saw,
   because they have it from credible persons, that there are such places,
   and they have no reason to doubt their testimony: and why should not
   the same assurance serve in greater matters; if an undoubted assurance
   of a lesser benefit and advantage will make men venture as much? Why
   should any man desire greater assurance, of any thing than to have no
   just reason to doubt of it; why more than so much as the thing is
   capable of? I cannot possibly under stand why every man should not be
   contented with sufficient assurance, or for what reason a man should
   desire more than enough; and why a man should not be satisfied that a
   thing is so, when he hath as great assurance of it, and as good
   evidence for it, as he could have, supposing it were.

   And for men to say, Nothing less than infallible assurance can satisfy
   a man's mind, that men will always doubt so long as there is a
   possibility of the contrary; and there will be a possibility of the
   contrary, until we have infallible assurance, is as unreasonable as can
   be imagined. I ask any man whether he be infallibly assured that there
   was such a man as William the Conqueror? or that there is such a
   country as Spain? If he say he is, I ask where is his infallible
   evidence for this? He will cite several historians; but all this is
   human testimony, and that is fallible. It seems then he is not
   infallibly certain there was such a man, or there is such a country;
   and consequently there is a possibility of the contrary. It is granted
   there is: but is any sober man unsatisfied in his mind about these
   things? I would fain meet with the man that will tell me in good
   earnest, that he hath reason to doubt, whether there was such a man or
   not; and whether there be such a place as Spain or not? So that it is
   fond for any man to allege a bare possibility of the contrary, as a
   reasonable cause of doubting concerning any thing, for which we have as
   good evidence as the thing is capable of.

   Upon these grounds we can easily resolve our faith. We believe the
   doctrine of Christian religion, because it is revealed by God; we
   believe it to be revealed by God, because it was confirmed by
   unquestionable miracles: we believe such miracles were wrought, because
   we have as great assurance of this, as any matter of fact, at such a
   distance from the time it was done, is capable of. Now if the papists
   say, this doth at last amount to no more than moral assurance; I grant
   it doth not: but then I have proved this assurance to be as much as in
   reason can be expected, and as much as is sufficient to the nature and
   ends of a Divine faith, and that an infallible assurance is not
   agreeable to a human understanding; but an incommunicable attribute and
   prerogative of the Divine nature, which whoever pretends to, he hath
   not the modesty of a creature, but doth by a sacrilegious ambition
   attempt the throne of God, and equal himself to the Most High. And,
   therefore, it is no wonder that the popes of Rome, after they had once
   assumed to themselves to be infallible, did presently arrogate to
   themselves the titles of God, there being such strict connexion between
   the attribute of infallibility, and the Divine nature, that whoever
   challengeth the first, may with equal reason claim the other.

   I shall only add this: that nothing hath been more pernicious to
   Christian religion, than the vain pretences of men to greater assurance
   concerning things relating to it, than they can make good; the mischief
   of which is this that when discerning and inquisitive men find that men
   pretend to greater matters than they can prove, this makes them doubt
   of all they say, and to call in question the truth of Christianity
   itself. Whereas if men would be contented to speak justly of things,
   and pretend to no greater assurance than they can bring evidence for,
   considerate men would be apt to believe them. Every knowing man being
   more ready to listen to a modest man, whose confidence bears a
   proportion to the reason and arguments he brings for what he says, than
   to a confident pretender, who calls every weak saying a demonstration.
   And, indeed, such men are but justly dealt withal, since the experience
   of the world hath sufficiently taught us, that usually those who speak
   modestly of things, are furnished with the best arguments for their
   assertions; and that those who have made the strongest pretences to
   infallibility in any thing, have the weakest reasons for what they have
   said; of which this account may be given, that good reasons and
   arguments are requisite to beget in men a rational assurance; but a
   strong conceit is sufficient to beget in men an opinion of
   infallibility.

   VI. What is the proper and genuine effect of this faith of a Divine
   revelation? I answer, A compliance with the design and intention of it.

   VII. In what respect this may be called a Divine faith? To this I
   answer, Not only in respect of the object of it, and the argument
   whereby it is wrought, and the effect of it: but, likewise, in respect
   of the author and efficient of it, which is the Divine Spirit. And
   here, if time would permit, I should speak of the testimony of the
   Spirit; not as an argument whereby a persuasion of a Divine revelation,
   viz. that the Scriptures are the word of God, is wrought; but, also, as
   he is the author and efficient cause of it. I do most readily grant the
   great influence that the Spirit of God hath upon the minds of men in
   this work of faith, as well as in every spiritual act: but it is to be
   inquired, how the Spirit of God may be said to work this faith in us;
   whether by strengthening the faculty, or by holding the mind intent
   upon the argument, whereby this persuasion is wrought; or discovering
   the object, or removing the impediments, or furthering and helping
   forward the efficacy of it upon our hearts and lives. But of this, God
   willing, in my next discourse.

SERMON CCXXII.

  Of THE TESTIMONY OF THE SPIRIT, TO THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL.

   But without faith it is impossible to please God.--Heb. xi. 6.

   IN discoursing of the faith or persuasion of a Divine revelation, I
   came to inquire, in what respects this may be called a Divine faith. To
   which my answer was, that it is a Divine faith, not only with respect
   to the object of it, and the argument whereby it is wrought, and the
   effect of it; but likewise in respect of the author and efficient of
   it, which is the Divine Spirit. I proceed, therefore, to consider the
   testimony of the Divine Spirit, not only as an argument whereby a
   persuasion of a Divine revelation, viz. that the Scriptures are the
   word of God, is wrought; but also, as he is the author and efficient
   cause of it. The Scripture doth, in a peculiar manner, ascribe the
   belief of a Divine revelation, especially of the revelation of the
   gospel, to the Spirit of God. In this sense the Scripture saith, that
   "no man can say that Jesus is the Christ, but by the Spirit of God."
   And though every good persuasion that we have, be, in some sort or
   other, to be ascribed to God, yet I observe it to be the phrase of the
   New Testament, to attribute the belief of the gospel, in a more
   peculiar manner, to the Spirit of God. When any man believes the
   principles of natural religion, that there is a God, that the soul is
   immortal, and that there are rewards after this life, as the heathens
   did; even this is from God, who hath planted these principles in our
   nature; or, which conies to all one, hath given us such faculties, by
   the use and improvement of which, we may come to the knowledge of these
   principles: but it is not usual, in the phrase of Scripture, to
   attribute this natural knowledge, in such a peculiar manner, to the
   Spirit of God.

   When any man believes the matters of Divine revelation (for instance,
   the doctrines contained in the gospel), this faith is to be attributed
   to the Spirit of God; but not as immediately persuading us of the truth
   of these doctrines, but by persuading us, that the gospel, which
   contains these truths, is a Divine revelation; or, which is all one,
   that the Lord Jesus Christ, who delivered these doctrines to the world,
   was a Divine person, and came from God: and if we once firmly believe
   and entertain this, that Jesus was the Messias, and sent from God to
   acquaint the world with his mind and will, we can make no doubt of the
   truth of any thing which he hath delivered. So that the faith which the
   Scripture doth in a peculiar manner attribute to the Spirit of God, is
   this persuasion, "that Jesus is the Christ;" that is, that he was the
   true Messias, and sent from God.

   So that the question is--how the Spirit of God doth concur to the
   begetting of this faith or persuasion? Or, why this faith is in such a
   peculiar manner attributed to the Spirit of God?

   I answer, Upon these two accounts:

   First, In respect of the outward evidence which the Spirit of God gives
   us to persuade us to believe.

   Secondly, In respect of the inward efficacy and operation of the Spirit
   of God upon the minds of men in believing.

   First, In respect of the outward evidence which the Spirit of God gives
   us to persuade us to believe. And if this be not that which divines
   mean by the testimony of the Spirit in this matter, yet I think it is
   that which may most properly be so called. Now the Spirit of God did
   outwardly testify concerning Jesus, that he was the Messias, and came
   from God; and that the doctrine which he taught was Divine.

   1. In the voice from heaven, which accompanied the descending of the
   Spirit upon him, in the form of a dove, saying, "This is my beloved
   Son, in whom I am well pleased," (Matt. iii. 17.)

   2. In those miracles which Christ himself wrought by the Spirit of God;
   which were so eminent a testimony of the Spirit of God, that the
   resisting of the evidence of those miracles, and the attributing of
   them to the devil, is by our Saviour called a blasphemy against the
   Holy Ghost, and such a sin as shall never be pardoned: because miracles
   being the highest attestation that can be given to the divinity of any
   person or his doctrine, whoever resists this evidence, resists his last
   remedy; and such a person must needs remain in his infidelity, because
   there is nothing more that can be done for his conviction.

   .3. The third eminent testimony which the Holy Spirit gave to Christ,
   was in the great miracle of his resurrection from the dead; and hence
   it is that the great miracle of Christ's resurrection, which was the
   highest attestation to the divinity of his person, and the grand
   confirmation to his doctrine, is frequently in Scripture, in a most
   peculiar manner, ascribed to the Spirit of God. (Rom. i. 4.) "And was
   declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of
   holiness;" that is, by those miracles which he wrought by the Holy
   Ghost, and by his resurrection from the dead. And so, (Rom. viii. 11.)
   "The Spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead." (1 Pet. iii.
   18.) "Being put to death in the flesh; but quickened by the Spirit."

   4. In the effusion of the Spirit upon the apostles, who were to preach
   Christ and his doctrine to the world; and that it might carry its
   evidence along with it. God poured forth his Spirit upon those who were
   to be the publishers of it; by which Spirit they were endued with
   several miraculous powers and gifts, to convince the world of the truth
   of the doctrine which they preached. And with relation to this, I
   think, it is that the apostle saith, (1 Cor. ii. 4, 5.) "And my speech,
   and my preaching, was not with enticing words of man's wisdom: but in
   demonstration of the Spirit, and of power: that your faith should not
   stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God;" that is, they did
   not use human eloquence to persuade men, but delivered the gospel with
   all plainness: and that which made those plain discourses so powerful,
   were those powerful demonstrations of the Divine Spirit, which appeared
   in those miraculous gifts wherewith they were endowed. I am sure Origen
   understands this text so. And so likewise the apostle (1 Thess. i. 5.)
   speaks to the same purpose, that "the gospel came not unto you in word
   only: but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance;"
   that is, they did not only speak words to men, but the doctrine which
   they preached was attested in a powerful manner by the Holy Ghost, in
   those extraordinary gifts, which were bestowed upon them, which was a
   great evidence to their hearers, and gave them great assurance of the
   truth of what they delivered. I think this is the meaning of those two
   places, but I will mention two others which are more unquestionable:
   (Acts v. 32.) where Peter and the rest of the apostles tell the high
   priests and their officers, what evidence they had for what they
   preached concerning the resurrection and ascension of Christ. "We are
   his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God
   hath given to them that obey him." Not only they themselves had seen
   what they preached; but, to confirm their testimony, the Holy Ghost was
   poured forth upon, them in miraculous gifts. And, (Heb. ii. 3, 4.) "How
   shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first
   began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that
   heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders,
   and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his
   own will?" So the Holy Ghost gave testimony to the truth of the
   doctrine which the apostles preached, by those gifts which he endowed
   them withal, and those miracles which he enabled them to work.

   And I doubt not but with relation to the testimony which the Spirit of
   God gave to Christ by the miracles he wrought by Christ and his
   apostles; I say, I doubt not, but that with relation to his testimony
   it is, that the apostle saith, he was "justified in the Spirit:" (1
   Tim. iii. 16.) "Great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested
   in the flesh, justified in the Spirit." That is, the miraculous power
   of the Spirit which appeared in him, and did accompany his doctrine,
   did justify him to the world, and vindicate him from being an impostor
   and deceiver.

   From all which it appears, that the testimony which the Holy Spirit
   gives to Christ and his doctrine, was the miracles which he and his
   apostles wrought by the Spirit of God: and if we will take our forms of
   speaking from Scripture, this is that which may most properly be called
   the testimony of the Spirit to the truth of the gospel. But I deny not,
   but, besides this outward evidence, which the Spirit of God gives to
   the truth of the gospel, with respect to which the faith of the gospel
   is in a peculiar manner attributed to the Spirit of God, there is
   likewise an inward efficacy and operation of the Spirit of God upon the
   minds of men. Therefore,

   Secondly, Faith is in a peculiar manner attributed to the Spirit of
   God, in respect of the inward efficacy and operation of the Divine
   Spirit upon the hearts and minds of those who sincerely and effectually
   believe and entertain the gospel; I say, who sincerely and effectually
   believe and entertain the gospel; that is, who so believe and entertain
   the gospel, as to obey it, and comply with it in their hearts and
   lives. For I doubt not but that there is so much evidence for the truth
   and Divine authority of the gospel, as is in itself sufficient, without
   any peculiar operation of the Spirit of God, to silence all opposers,
   and to convince them so far as that they cannot have any sufficient
   reason to disbelieve it: but withal, I do not think that this faith
   doth become an abiding and effectual persuasion in any person, without
   the special operation of the Holy Ghost. Now that the Spirit of God can
   work this effectual persuasion in the mind of man, cannot be doubted by
   any man who considers the vast power and influence which the Spirit of
   God, who made our souls, and knows the frame of them, can have upon the
   mind of man: all the difficulty is about the manner of it; how this
   faith is wrought in us by the Spirit of God. Now although it were
   sufficient for us to know the thing, though we were ignorant of the
   manner how it is done, and we might very well rest satisfied in (his;
   that the Spirit of God works this faith in us, though we did not know
   how he does it; yet, be cause many have taken upon them to state and
   determine the particular manner how it is done, it will be requisite,
   in order to the rectifying some mistakes about it, to inquire more
   particularly into this matter.

   Now all the ways that have been assigned, or which, I think, we can
   easily imagine, may be reduced to one of these six heads. When we say
   the Spirit of God works faith in us, we must conceive it to be done
   some or all of these ways:

   1. By strengthening the faculty, that is, raising and enabling our
   understanding to yield assent to the gospel. Or,

   2. By enlightening and discovering the object, that is, the conclusion
   to be believed. Or,

   3. By propounding to us the arguments, or evidence, whereby we may be
   persuaded of it. Or,

   4. By holding our minds intent upon this evidence, till it have wrought
   its effect upon us. Or,

   5. By removing the impediments which hinder our assent. Or,

   6. By furthering and helping forward the efficacy of this persuasion
   upon our hearts and lives. That the Spirit can work faith in us, any,
   or all of these ways, so far as they are consistent with one another, I
   make not the least doubt. For what man, who believes the infinite power
   of the Divine Spirit, can make the least question, whether it can raise
   and heighten our faculties above their natural and ordinary pitch? or,
   whether it can Discover an object to us, with the greatest clearness
   and satisfaction? or, whether it can offer to our minds the best
   arguments, and the highest evidence, that a thing is capable of? or,
   whether it can hold our minds intent upon the consideration of any
   thing? or, whether it can remove all hinderances and impediments? or,
   whether it can make the persuasion of any truth effectual? No man, in
   reason, can doubt of the possibility of these. But the question is,
   what reason we have to assert this or that particular manner? and, what
   necessity and convenience there are from experience, or evidence of
   Scripture, so to do?

   First of all, there seems no necessity of asserting the first; though I
   will not contend with any man that shall. For if this be true, that our
   under standings are naturally endowed with a sufficient power to assent
   to any truth that is sufficiently propounded to them; then there can be
   no necessity to assert, that the Spirit of God doth, in the work of
   faith, raise and elevate our understandings above their natural pitch.
   But I think it may easily be proved, that our understandings are
   naturally endowed with a sufficient power to assent to any truth that
   is sufficiently propounded to them; and that in such a case nothing
   hinders the assent of men, but their own perverseness and obstinacy,
   which usually proceeds from opposition of their lusts, or passions, or
   interest, to the truth which is propounded to them. For if men's
   understandings be not naturally endowed with a sufficient power to
   yield assent to the gospel, when it is sufficiently propounded to them,
   how can it be men's duty to believe it? or, what justice can condemn
   them for unbelief? But though there be no necessity of asserting, that
   God doth always strengthen and elevate the understandings of those who
   believe; yet there is no reason to deny but that God may do this when
   he pleaseth, and possibly he often doth it.

   God is said, in Scripture, to "enlighten the eyes of our
   understandings," which we may, if we please, understand in this sense;
   although that may be done by propounding such truths to us as we were
   ignorant of before, and could not have discovered, unless they had been
   revealed.

   Secondly, The second way whereby the Spirit of God may be conceived to
   work faith in us, is by enlightening and discovering the object, or
   thing to be believed. In the case we are speaking of, the object or
   thing to be believed, is the gospel: now we may imagine the Spirit of
   God may work a faith or persuasion of this in us, by revealing or
   discovering to us this proposition, that the gospel is true. But this I
   need not speak much to, because I do not know any that pretend to have
   a particular and immediate revelation from God, that the gospel is
   true. So that though God may do this when he pleaseth, yet I do not
   know any who assert this to be the way whereby faith is wrought in men.

   Thirdly, The Spirit of God may be conceived to work faith in us, by
   propounding and offering to us such arguments and evidence, as are apt
   to persuade us of the truth of the gospel. And this, the Spirit of God,
   which inspired the writers of the Scripture, doth mediately by the
   Scriptures, and those characters of divinity, which are in the
   doctrines contained in them; and by those miracles, which are there
   credibly related to be wrought by the Spirit of God, for the
   confirmation of that doctrine. And besides this, the Spirit of God may,
   when he pleaseth, and probably often doth, immediately suggest those
   arguments to our minds, and bring them to our remembrance.

   Fourthly, The Spirit of God may be conceived to work faith in us, by
   holding our minds intent upon this evidence, tilt it hath wrought its
   effect upon us. And this, I do not doubt, but the Spirit of God, out of
   his abundant grace and goodness to men, often doth; and I believe many
   men have found their minds kept intent upon such considerations, as
   have mightily prevailed upon them, and been effectual to persuade them
   to entertain and obey the gospel; and must acknowledge that their minds
   were awakened by such considerations, and made attentive to them,
   beyond their own inclinations to think upon such things; and in such a
   strange and unaccountable manner, as they cannot in reason but
   attribute to some superior influence, viz. to the Holy Spirit of God.

   Fifthly, By removing the impediments which hinder our effectual assent
   to the gospel. And in this and the last particular, I conceive the work
   of the Spirit of God in the producing of faith, principally to consist:
   I say, in these principally, not absolutely excluding the former. The
   great impediment to the belief and entertainment of the gospel, is the
   prejudice which the minds of men are apt to conceive against it, either
   upon account of their education in a contrary religion, or upon account
   of their lusts, or some worldly interest to which the gospel is
   opposite. Now these are as so many bars upon the understandings of men,
   to keep out the truth from entering into them. The prejudice of a
   contrary education, is a monstrous obstacle to religion. When men have
   believed otherwise from their youth, and have had contrary principles
   implanted in them in their tender years, and have all their lives been
   possessed with contrary apprehensions of things; the clearest truths
   that can be offered to them, come upon infinite disadvantage; their
   understandings are tinctured, and put false colours upon every thing
   that is represented to them. And this was the case of the Jews, when
   the Messias came: they were possessed with prejudices against his mean
   appearance, and had fashioned to themselves another kind of Messias,
   that should be a glorious temporal prince; and had been brought up in
   this apprehension; and this made them so invincibly obstinate against
   the reception of him; though the whole nation, when he came, were in
   expectation of him. And this was also the case of the gentiles, when
   the gospel was first preached to them; they had been educated in a
   contrary religion, and were possessed with quite other apprehensions,
   which made the passage of the gospel infinitely difficult. And I doubt
   not but that in the first publishing of the gospel, the Spirit did
   remarkably work upon the minds of men, for the removing of these
   prejudices, and thereby making way for the entertainment of the gospel.
   And though this prejudice be not now upon us in these parts of the
   world, who are brought up in the Christian religion; yet the lusts and
   interests of men are now great obstacles to the effectual entertainment
   of the gospel; and the Spirit of God doth many times eminently appear
   in the restraining and conquering the lusts of men, and removing those
   other prejudices which hinder them from embracing the truth.

   Sixthly, The last way whereby the Spirit of God may be said to work in
   us an effectual belief of the gospel, is by furthering and helping
   forward the efficacy of this persuasion upon our hearts and lives, in
   the first work of conversion and regeneration, and in the progressive
   work of sanctification afterward, both which the Scripture doth every
   where attribute to the Spirit of God, as the author and efficient
   cause. The faith which purifies the heart, and conquers the world, and
   works by love, hath this effect from the Spirit of God. Hence we are
   said to be "sanctified by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and the
   belief of the truth," and to "be kept by the mighty power of God
   through faith unto salvation."

   Thus I have shewn you, as briefly and clearly as I could, how the
   Spirit of God doth concur to the begetting of this Divine faith and
   persuasion in us, and consequently in what respects faith may be said
   to be the gift of God. I shall only draw two or three inferences from
   this discourse.

   I. We may learn from hence to attribute all the good that is in us, or
   that we do in any kind, to God. Every good thing is from God; so St.
   James tells us, that "every good and perfect work comes down even from
   the Father of lights." Much more are we to ascribe to the free grace of
   God all the revelation of supernatural truth, which we cannot possibly
   come to the knowledge of, unless God of his free grace and goodness be
   pleased to discover it to us. And so likewise are we to ascribe to God,
   and the operation of his Holy Spirit upon our hearts, our belief of
   those truths, and assent to them. Considering the corruption and
   degeneracy of human nature, and the opposition of the lusts and
   prejudices of men to Divine truth, we stand in need of the grace of
   God, and the operation of his Spirit upon our hearts, to bring us to a
   firm assent to the gospel; for as flesh and blood could not reveal
   these truths to us, so neither are they very apt to assent to them when
   they are revealed.

   In the phrase of Scripture, all good is attributed to God; and all
   spiritual good to the Holy Spirit of God working in us, and assisting
   us to the doing of it. As, on the other hand, the Scripture attributes
   all those sins that are committed in the world to the influence of evil
   spirits. "He that committeth sin is of the devil." And though we do not
   know many times, how the Spirit of God worketh a good inclination in
   us, yet it is safe to follow the phrase of Scripture, and to ascribe
   all good to God, as in some way or other the author of it.

   II. This doth not excuse the infidelity of men, that "faith is the gift
   of God." For though no man doth believe without some influence of the
   Divine Spirit upon his heart, yet this does by no means excuse those
   who believe not; any more than it is an excuse to the infidelity of
   men, that the Scripture attributes it to the devil, as in some sort the
   cause of it. He is said to "blind the eyes of them that believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine unto
   them." But the unbelief of men is a fault for all this; because the
   devil can not blind our minds, unless we consent to it: he can only
   suggest false principles to us; but we may choose whether we will
   entertain them or not: he can only tempt us to reject the truth; but we
   may choose whether we will do so or not. In this we are faulty, because
   we may resist the devil, and quench or repel those fiery darts which he
   casts into our minds: but if we will consent to his temptations, and
   suffer ourselves to be blinded by him, the fault of our unbelief is our
   own, as well as his; and we are guilty of the infidelity which we
   suffer him to tempt us to.

   So, on the other hand, though "faith" be "the gift of God;" yet those
   that believe not are faulty upon this account, that they quench and
   resist the blessed motions of God's Spirit, and the influence and
   operation of the Spirit of God, which accompany the truth of the gospel
   to the minds of men, and produce their effect wherever they are not
   opposed and rejected by the prejudice and perverseness of men.

   III. Let us depend upon God for every good gift, and earnestly beg the
   assistance and influence of his Holy Spirit, which is so necessary to
   us to be get faith in us, and to preserve and make it effectual upon
   our hearts and lives. Bread is not more necessary to the support of our
   natural life, than the Holy Spirit of God to our spiritual life.

   For our encouragement to ask this gift, of God's Holy Spirit, our
   Saviour hath told us, that God is very ready to bestow it upon us. No
   father upon earth is more ready to give bread to his children that cry
   after him, than God is to give his Spirit to those that heartily and
   earnestly beg it of him. So our Saviour assures us: (Luke xi. 11-13.)
   "If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give
   him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a
   serpent? or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye
   then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how
   much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that
   ask him?"

   And now I have done with the first thing that I propounded, which was
   to open the nature of faith to you in general. I have been the longer
   upon this, because I thought it very material and important to the
   settling of right apprehensions in us concerning religion and Divine
   things; and I have all along endeavoured to make things as easy and
   plain as the nature of the subject would permit. And though probably
   many things that I have said, might not be within the full reach and
   comprehension of all capacities, yet, because I hoped they might be
   useful and beneficial to some at least, I could not think the other
   consideration a sufficient reason why I should wholly omit them, and
   pass them by; remembering what St. Paul says, that "he was a debtor to
   the wise," as well as the "unwise." And St. Peter tells us, that St.
   Paul in his Epistles wrote "many things which were hard to be
   understood" by some persons; yet, because those things might be of use
   to others, the Spirit of God did not think fit to omit the writing of
   them. What remains I shall reserve to another discourse, with which I
   shall conclude this subject.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CCXXIII.

  THE EFFICACY, USEFULNESS, AND REASONABLENESS, OF DIVINE FAITH.

   But without faith it is impossible to please God. --Heb. xi. 6.

   IN discoursing on these words, I have dispatched the first thing which
   I proposed, viz. to give an account of the notion and nature of faith
   in general; under which I have largely treated of a religious or Divine
   faith in particular.

   The second thing which I proposed, and to which I now proceed, is to
   confirm the truth of the proposition which I laid down from the words;
   viz. that faith is the great principle of religion. I told you that
   these words, "Without faith it is impossible to please God," do not
   only imply that faith is a necessary condition, without which men
   cannot be religious: but, likewise, that it is a cause and principle of
   religion. Without faith a man cannot be religious: and where there is
   true faith, it will have this effect upon men--to make them religious.
   Therefore I shall distinctly speak to these two things:

   First, That without faith there can be no religion.

   Secondly, That where there is a true faith, it will have this influence
   upon men, to make them religious.

   First, That without faith there can be no religion. And this will
   appear by inquiring into the nature of all human actions, whether civil
   or religious: and this is common to both of them, that they suppose
   some kind of faith or persuasion. All human actions have an order and
   reference to some end, and consequently suppose some knowledge of the
   end, and of the means whereby it may be attained. So that unless a man
   do believe and be persuaded that such a thing is some way or other good
   for him, and consequently desirable and fit to be propounded as an end,
   and that this end is attainable, and the means which he useth are
   probable and likely for the attaining of this end, he will sit still
   and do no thing at all about it. So that, without faith, it is
   impossible to do any thing: he that believes nothing will do nothing.

   To instance first in civil actions, in the common affairs and
   concernments of life; all these are done by virtue of some faith or
   persuasion concerning them. For example, husbandry, or merchandize; no
   man will apply himself to these, but upon some belief or persuasion of
   the possibility and necessity, or, at least, usefulness and
   convenience, of these to the ends of life. No man would plough or sow
   if he did not believe that there were such a thing as the growing of
   corn, and that it is necessary for the support of our lives, and if he
   were not persuaded of the probability of reaping some fruit and benefit
   of his pains and industry. No man would traffic to Turkey or the
   Indies, if he did not believe there were such places, and that they
   afforded such commodities, and that he might have them upon such terms
   as might recompense the adventure of his charge and pains. And so in
   all other actions of life.

   So it is in Divine and religious things; nothing is done without faith.
   No man will worship God, unless he believe there is a God; unless he be
   persuaded there is such a being, which, by reason of his excellency and
   perfection, may challenge our veneration; and unless he believe the
   goodness of this God, that "he will reward those that diligently serve
   him." For all acts of religion being reasonable, they suppose at least
   an object and an end; that there is a God to be worshipped, and that it
   is not in vain to serve him. This faith is necessary to natural
   religion. And in case God do discover and reveal his will to men, no
   man can obey the will of God, unless he be persuaded that God hath some
   way or other made known his will; and be persuaded likewise as to the
   particular instance where in his obedience is required, that this is
   God's will. For instance, no man will obey the precepts of the Bible as
   Divine laws and commands, unless he be persuaded that the doctrine
   contained in the Holy Scriptures is a Divine revelation. So likewise no
   man can entertain Christ as the Messias and Saviour of the world, and
   yield obedience to his laws, unless he believes that he was sent of
   God, and ordained by him to be a Prince and a Saviour. So that you see
   the necessity of faith to religion.

   Secondly, I shall shew the influence that a Divine faith hath upon men
   to make them religious. A true Divine faith supposeth a man satisfied
   and persuaded of the reasonableness and necessity of being religious;
   that it is reasonable for every man to be so, and that it is necessary
   to his interest. Now there needs no more to be done to put a man upon
   any thing, but to satisfy him of these two things--that the action you
   persuade him to is reasonable; that is, possible and fit to be done;
   and that it is highly his interest to do it: that is, if he do it, it
   will be eminently for his advantage; if he do not do it, it will be
   eminently to his prejudice, and he is a lost and undone man. If you can
   once possess a man, that is in any degree sober and considerate, with
   these persuasions, you may make him do any thing of which he is thus
   persuaded. Now a true Divine faith supposeth a man satisfied and
   persuaded of all this.

   1. Of the reasonableness of religion. He that verily believes there is
   a God, believes there is a being that hath all excellency and
   perfection, that is infinitely good, and wise, and just, and powerful,
   that made and preserves all things. Now he that believes such a being
   as this, cannot but think it reasonable that he should be esteemed, and
   honoured, and adored by all those creatures that are sensible and
   apprehensive of these excellences; that, seeing he is infinitely good,
   and the fountain of all being, and all the blessings we enjoy, we
   should love so great a benefactor, and thankfully acknowledge his
   goodness to us; not only by constant praise of him, but by an universal
   obedience to his will, and a cheerful submission to his pleasure. For
   what more reasonable than gratitude? that, seeing he is in finitely
   wise and powerful, as well as good, we should trust in him, and depend
   upon him in all conditions, and seek to him for what we want? For what
   more reasonable than to place our confidence in him, who is able and
   willing to do us good; and to sue to him who knows our wants, and is
   ready to supply them? And seeing he is truth itself, and hath been
   pleased to reveal his will to us; what can be more reasonable than to
   believe all those discoveries and revelations which "God, who cannot
   lie," hath made to us, and to comply with the intention of them? And
   seeing he is the original pattern of all excellency and perfection;
   what can be more reasonable than to imitate the perfections of the
   Divine nature, and to endeavour to be as like God as we can? And these
   are the sum of all religion. So that whoever firmly believes a God, and
   that he hath revealed and made known his will to the world, cannot but
   be fully satisfied and persuaded of the reasonableness and equity of
   religion, and all those duties which religion requires of us; and
   consequently, of the possibility of performing all those duties which
   religion requires of us, by the assistance of the grace and strength
   which God is ready to afford us, if we beg it of him. For no man that
   believes the goodness of God (which every man does, that believes a
   God), can think that he will make it our duty to do any thing which he
   hath left us in an utter impossibility of doing.

   2. A true Divine faith supposeth a man satisfied and persuaded of the
   necessity of religion; that is, that it is necessary to every man's
   interest to be religious; that it will be highly for our advantage to
   be so, and eminently to our prejudice to be otherwise; that if we be so
   we shall be happy, if we be not we shall be miserable and undone for
   ever. And every man that believes a God, and the revelations which he
   hath made, cannot but be fully satisfied of this.

   And this will appear upon these two accounts.

   1. From the nature and reason of the thing. And,

   2. From the promises and threatenings of God's word.

   1. From the nature and reason of the thing. Every, man that believes a
   God, must believe him to be the supreme good; and the greatest
   happiness to consist in the enjoyment of him; and a separation from him
   to be the greatest misery. Now God is not to be enjoyed, but in a way
   of religion. Holiness makes us like to God, and likeness will make us
   love him; and love will make us happy in the enjoyment of him; and
   without this it is impossible to be happy. There can be no happiness
   without pleasure and delight; and we cannot take pleasure in any thing
   we do not love; and there can be no love, without a likeness and
   suitableness of disposition. So long as God is good, and we evil; so
   long as he is pure, and we unholy; so long as he hates sin, and we love
   it; there can be no happy intercourse, no agreeable communion, and
   delightful society, between God and us. So that if we be holy,
   happiness will result from this temper: and if we be wicked, we are
   necessarily and unavoidably miserable. Sin separates between God and
   us, and hinders our happiness; and it is impossible that a wicked man
   should be near God, or enjoy him. God and a sinner are two such unequal
   matches, that it is impossible to bring them together; "for what
   fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? or what communion
   hath light with darkness?"

   2. Every man who believes the revelations which God hath made, cannot
   but be satisfied, how much religion is his interest from the promises
   and threatenings of God's word. God in his word hath, in plain and
   express terms, promised everlasting glory and happiness to them that
   obey him; and hath threatened wicked men with dreadful and eternal
   punishments; "to them that, by patient continuance in well-doing, seek
   for glory, and honour, and immortality," he hath promised "eternal
   life: but to them that obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness,"
   he hath threatened "indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish."
   Now if we believe the gospel, which assures us of another life after
   this, and a future judgment, which will determine all men to a state of
   everlasting happiness or misery, we cannot but know it to be our
   interest, by all possible means, to endeavour to attain the happiness
   which God hath promised, and to avoid the misery which he hath
   threatened. All men naturally desire happiness, and dread misery and
   destruction; and these desires and fears are intimate to our natures,
   and can never be separated from them; be cause they flow immediately
   from those principles of self-love, and self-preservation, which are
   deeply rooted in every man's heart, and are woven into the very make
   and frame of his nature, and will last as long as our beings. And so
   long as these principles remain in us, there is no man that is firmly
   persuaded of the promises and threatenings of the gospel, but must
   believe it to be his highest interest to be religious. Fear and hope
   are the two passions which govern us; hope is as it were the spur that
   quickens us to our duty, and fear is the curb that restrains us from
   sin; and the greater the good hoped for, or the evil that is feared,
   the greater power and influence these passions have upon us. Now there
   cannot be a greater good, than complete and everlasting happiness; nor
   a greater evil, than extreme and eternal misery. So that whoever
   believes the promises and threatenings of the gospel, hath his hope
   raised to the expectation of the greatest good and happiness, in case
   of obedience; and his fears extended to the expectation of the greatest
   evil and misery, in case of final impenitence and disobedience. And a
   true Divine faith doth contain in it both this hope and fear: for a
   faith in the promises of the gospel is nothing else, but the hopes of
   eternal life; and a belief of the threatenings of the gospel is nothing
   else, but the fear of hell and eternal misery. So that a firm belief of
   the promises and threatenings of the gospel, must needs have as great
   influence upon men to make them religious, as the highest hopes and
   greatest fears can have; and those men that are not moved by the hopes
   of the greatest good, nor by the fears of the greatest danger, are not
   to be wrought upon in human ways, no thing will prevail with them.

   Thus I have shewn you what influence a Divine faith hath upon religion;
   forasmuch as whoever believes there is a God, and that the Scriptures
   are the word of God, is fully satisfied and convinced how reasonable it
   is, and how much it is his interest to be religious. I come in the last
   place to the application of this discourse.

   First, This shews why there is so little of true religion in the world;
   it is for want of faith, without which it is impossible for men to be
   religions. Men are not firmly persuaded that there is a God; that there
   is a Being above them that is omniscient, and knows every thing that
   they do, and takes notice of every word, and thought, and action; that
   is so good and so powerful, as to make those happy that love and obey
   him; and so just and powerful, as to make those miserable who hate him
   and rebel against him. Men are not persuaded that their souls are
   immortal; and that there is another life after this, in which men shall
   be happy or miserable to all eternity, according as they demean
   themselves in this world. Men are not firmly persuaded that the
   Scriptures are the word of God, and that the precepts and prohibitions
   of the Bible are the laws of a great King, who will amply reward the
   observance of his laws, and severely vindicate the breach and violation
   of them. Men do not believe that the promises and threatenings of God's
   word are true, and that every jot and tittle of them shall be
   accomplished. For did men believe these things, they would be
   religious; they would not dare to live in any known sin or impiety of
   life: unless we can presume that a man can be seriously unwilling to be
   happy, and have a longing desire to be miserable, and undone for ever.
   For whoever believes the principles of religion, and the precepts, and
   promises, and threatenings that are contained in this holy book, and
   yet after all this can continue in sin, he must not only put off the
   principles of a reasonable creature, but must quit the very
   inclinations of his nature; that is, he must knowingly refuse that
   which he naturally desires, which is happiness; and must embrace that,
   which of all things that can be imagined he most abhors, and that is
   misery.

   So that if men were verily persuaded, that the great, and holy, and
   just God, looks continually upon them, and that it is impossible to
   hide from him any thing that we do, they would not dare to commit any
   sin in his sight, and under the eye of him who is their Father and
   Master, their Sovereign and their Judge, their Friend and Benefactor;
   who is invested with all these titles, and stands to us in all these
   relations, which may challenge reverence and respect. Did men believe
   the holiness and justice of God, that he hates sin, and will not let it
   go unpunished, would they venture to make him a witness of their
   wickedness, who they believe will be the avenger of it? Did men believe
   that they shall live for ever, and that after this short life is ended,
   they must enter upon eternity; that when they leave the world, there
   are but two ways which all men must go, either into life everlasting,
   or into eternal and intolerable torments; did men believe this, would
   they not with all possible care and diligence endeavour to attain the
   one, and avoid the other? Were men possessed with a belief of eternity,
   how would they despise temporal and transitory things! How would they
   neglect the concernments of this life, and overlook the little
   impertinences of time, and refer all their thoughts and cares and
   endeavours to eternity! This great and important interest would so fill
   their minds, and take up their thoughts, and employ their utmost cares,
   and endeavours, and diligence, that they would scarce regard, or speak,
   or think of any thing else; they would be restless and impatient, until
   they had secured this grand affair and concernment; they would
   subordinate all the interests of this world to that of the other, and
   make all the concernments of time to stoop to the grand concernment of
   eternity. Thus men would do, were they but firmly persuaded that there
   is another life after this, to which this bears no proportion.

   Did men believe the Scripture to be the word of God, and to contain
   matters of the highest importance to our everlasting happiness; would
   they neglect it and lay it aside, and study it no more than a man would
   do an almanack out of date, or than a man, who believes the attaining a
   philosopher's stone to be impossible, would study those books that
   treat of it? If men did believe that it contains plain and easy
   directions for the attaining of eternal happiness, and escaping eternal
   misery; they would converse much with it, make it their companion and
   their counsellor, "meditate in it day and night," read it with all
   diligence, and put in practice the directions of it.

   So that, whatever men pretend, it is plain, that those who neglect God
   and religion, and contradict the precepts of his word by their lives,
   they do not firmly believe there is a God, nor that this book is the
   word of God. If this faith and persuasion were firmly rooted in men,
   they could not live wickedly. For a man that desires happiness, can no
   more neglect those means which he is convinced are necessary for the
   obtaining of it, than a man that desires life can neglect the means
   which he knows to be necessary for the preservation of it.

   Secondly, If faith have so great an influence upon religion, then the
   next use shall be to persuade men to believe. No man can be religious
   that doth not believe these two things:

   First, The principles of natural religion--that there is a God; that
   his soul is immortal; and that there are future rewards.

   Secondly, That the Scriptures are the word of God; or, which comes all
   to one, that the doctrine contained in them is a Divine revelation.
   Therefore whoever would persuade men to be religious, he must begin
   here; and whoever would improve men in religion and holiness, he must
   labour to strengthen this principle of faith. Faith is the root of all
   other graces: and they will flourish or decay, according to the degrees
   of our faith. Now he that would persuade a man or prevail with him to
   do any thing, must do it one of these three ways; either by entreaty,
   or authority, or argument; either he must entreat him as a friend, or
   command him as subject to him and under his power, or convince him as a
   man. Now he that should go about to entreat men to believe any thing,
   or to charge them so to do, before he hath convinced them, by
   sufficient arguments, that it is reasonable to do so, would, in my
   opinion, take a preposterous course. He that en treats or chargeth a
   man to do any thing, supposeth that he can do the thing if he will: but
   a man can not believe what he will; the nature of a human understanding
   is such, that it cannot assent without evidence, nor believe any thing
   to be true, unless it see reason so to do, any more than a man can see
   a thing without light. So that if the clearest friend that I have in
   the world should beg of me with the greatest importunity; or any man
   that hath the greatest authority over me, should lay his severest
   commands upon me to believe a thing, for which I see no reason, I could
   not do it; because nothing can command assent, but evidence. So that he
   that would persuade men to believe either the principles of natural
   religion, or any Divine revelation, must convince them of the truth of
   them; for it is unreasonable to desire a man to believe any thing,
   unless I give him good reason why he should.

   And this being the proper course which is to be taken, there are two
   sorts of persons to whom I shall apply myself in this exhortation:
   those who do not believe these things, and those who are persuaded of
   them: to the former, in order to the beget ting of faith in them; to
   the latter, in order to the strengthening and confirming of their
   faith.

   Those who do not believe, are of two sorts; either such as do
   positively disbelieve these things, and make it their business to arm
   themselves against them with all the arguments they can; who are so far
   from believing a God, or any Divine revelation, that they endeavour to
   persuade themselves of the contrary, that there is no such thing; or
   else they are such as are indifferent about these matters. They have
   received the principles of religion by their education, and they have
   nothing to say against them, nor for them; they never considered them,
   nor the proper consequences of them; they neither believe nor
   disbelieve them upon any reasonable account.

   Now these are to be dealt withal in the same way: for whatever will
   convince the disbeliever, will much more persuade the indifferent, and
   confirm the weak. For faith is to be strengthened by the same arguments
   by which it is wrought. Therefore I shall apply myself to convince
   unbelievers; and every one may apply those arguments which I use to
   this purpose, for the strengthening of their own faith.

   But before I come to those arguments I intend to offer for the
   conviction of those that do not believe, I think it convenient to
   endeavour, if possible, to remove a violent, and I think unreasonable
   prejudice which men have received against all those who endeavour to
   make religion reasonable. As if Bellarmine had been in the right when
   he said, "That faith was rather to be defined by ignorance than by
   knowledge." The plain English of which is, that it is for want of
   understanding that men believe the gospel; and if the world were but a
   little more knowing and wise, nobody would be a Christian. I know not
   how it comes to pass, whether through the artifice of the popish party,
   who "hate the light, lest it should reprove them, and make them
   manifest;" or through the ignorance of too many well-meaning
   protestants; I say, I know not how it comes to pass, but so it is, that
   every one that offers to give a reasonable account of his faith, and to
   establish religion upon rational principles, is presently branded for a
   Socinian; of which we have a sad instance in that incomparable person
   Mr. Chillingworth, the glory of this age and nation, who, for no other
   cause that I know of, but his worthy and successful attempts to make
   the Christian religion reasonable, and to discover those firm and solid
   foundations upon which our faith is built, hath been requited with this
   black and odious character. But if this be Socinianism, for a man to
   inquire into the grounds and reasons of the Christian religion, and to
   endeavour to give a satisfactory account why he believes it, I know no
   way but that all considerate inquisitive men, that are above fancy and
   enthusiasm, must be either Socinians or atheists.

   T cannot imagine how men can do greater disservice to religion, than by
   taking it off from the rational and solid basis upon which it stands,
   and bearing the world in hand, that men ought to believe without
   reason; for this is to turn faith into credulity, and to level
   Christian religion with the vilest and most groundless enthusiasms that
   ever were in the world. Indeed if we had only to deal with Henry
   Nicholas and Jacob Behmen, who fight against us in the dark, not with
   reasons and arguments, but with insignificant words, and obscure
   phrases; we might make a shift to bear up against them with this
   principle, and we might charge them to believe us, as they do us to
   believe them, with out giving them any reason for it: but if we were to
   deal with Celsus, or Julian, or Porphyry, or some of our modern
   atheists, we should soon find how vain it would be to go about to
   cajole them with phrases, and to gain them over to Christianity, by
   telling them that they must deny their reason, and lay aside their
   understandings, and believe they know not why. If the great pillars of
   Christianity, the ancient fathers, had taken this course in their
   apologies for Christian religion, it had never triumphed over Judaism
   and paganism as it did; and whoever hath read over those defences and
   vindications of the Christian religion against Jews and heathens, which
   were written in the first ages of the church, especially the books of
   Origen against Celsus, and Eusebius's book De Demonst. and Præparat.
   Evangel. shall find that they did very solicitously endeavour to
   satisfy the world by all rational ways both of the truth and
   reasonableness of Christian religion. And if that was a good way then,
   it is so now; and never more necessary than in this age, which I fear
   hath as many atheists and infidels, that go under the name of
   Christians, as ever were in any age since Christian religion was first
   planted in the world.

   But my design at present is not to persuade men particularly to the
   belief of Christianity (that I intend hereafter, by God's assistance to
   speak to), but to persuade men to the belief of religion in general. So
   that all that I shall do at present shall be, as briefly as I can, to
   offer some arguments and considerations to persuade men to the belief
   of the principles of natural religion, and of the revelation which God
   hath made of his mind and will in the Holy Scriptures.

   I. To persuade men to believe the principles of natural religion, such
   as the being of a God; the immortality of the soul; and future rewards
   after this life; I shall offer these two considerations:

   First, That it is most reasonable so to do.

   Secondly, That it is infinitely most prudent.

   First, As to the being of God. Do but consider these two things, which
   are undeniable--that there is a world, however it came; and that
   mankind do generally consent in a confident persuasion that there is a
   God, whatever be the cause of it. Now these two things being certain,
   and not liable to any question, let us inquire whether a reasonable
   account can be given of these without a God.

   1. Supposing there be no God, how came this vast and orderly frame of
   the world? There are but two ways that can be imagined. Either it was
   from eternity always of itself; or it began sometime to be. That it
   should be always of itself, though it may be imagined of the heavens,
   and the earth, which as to the main are permanent, and continue the
   same: yet in things that succeed one after another, it is altogether
   unimaginable. As in the generation of men, there can be no doubt,
   whether every one of them was from another, or some of themselves. Some
   of them must be of themselves: for whatever number of causes be
   imagined in orderly succession, some of them must have no cause, but be
   of themselves. Now that which is of itself, and the cause of all
   others, is the first. So that there must be a first man; and the age of
   man being finite, this first man must have a beginning. So, that an
   infinite succession of men should have been, is impossible; and
   consequently, that men were always. But I need not insist much upon
   this, because few or none of our modern atheists pitch upon this way.
   Besides that Aristotle, who is reputed the greatest assertor of the
   eternity of the world, doth acknowledge an infinite progress and
   succession of causes to be one of the greatest absurdities.

   Suppose then the world began sometime to be; it must either be made by
   counsel and design; that is, produced by some being that knew what it
   did, that did contrive and frame it as it is; which, it is easy to
   conceive, a being that is infinitely good, and wise, and powerful,
   might do: but this is to own a God: or else the matter of it being
   supposed to have been always, and in continual motion and tumult, it at
   last happened to fall into this order, and the parts of matter, after
   various agitations, were at length entangled and knit together in this
   order, in which we see the world to be. But can any man think this
   reasonable to imagine, that in the infinite variety which is in the
   world, all things should happen by chance, as well and as orderly as
   the greatest wisdom could have contrived them? Whoever can believe
   this, must do it with his will, and not with his understanding.

   But seeing it must be granted that something is of itself; how easy is
   it to grant such a Being to be of itself, as hath other perfections
   proportionable to necessary existence; that is infinitely good, and
   wise, and powerful? And there will be no difficulty in conceiving how
   such a Being as this should make the world.

   2. This likewise is undeniable--that mankind do generally consent in a
   confident persuasion that there is a God, whatever be the cause of
   this. Now the reason of so universal a consent in all places and ages
   of the world, must be one and constant: but no one and constant reason
   of this can be given, unless it be from the frame and nature of man's
   mind and understanding, which hath the notion of a Deity stamped upon
   it, or, which is all one, hath such an understanding, as will in its
   own free use and exercise find out a God. And what more reasonable than
   to think, that if we be God's workmanship, he should set this mark of
   himself upon us, that we might know to whom we belong? And I dare say,
   that this account must needs be much more reasonable and satisfactory
   to any in different man, than to resolve this universal consent into
   tradition, or state policy, both which are liable to inexplicable
   difficulties, as [8] I have elsewhere shewn at large.

   II. As to the immortality of the soul. Supposing a God, who is an
   infinite spirit, it is easy to imagine the possibility of a finite
   spirit: and supposing the goodness of God, no man can doubt, but that
   when he made all things, he would make some best; and the same goodness
   which moved him to make things, would be a reason to continue those
   things for the longest duration they are capable of.

   III. As to future rewards. Supposing the holiness and justice of God,
   that "he loves righteousness, and hates iniquity;" and that he is the
   magistrate and governor of the world, and concerned to countenance
   goodness, and discourage sin; and considering the promiscuous
   dispensation of his providence in this world, and how "all things
   happen alike to all;" it is most reasonable to conclude, that after
   this life men shall be punished and rewarded.

   Secondly, It is infinitely most prudent. In matters of great
   concernment a prudent man will incline to the safest side of the
   question. We have considered which side of these questions is most
   reasonable: let us now think which is safest. For it is certainly most
   prudent to incline to the safest side of the question. Supposing the
   reasons for and against the principles of religion were equal, yet the
   danger and hazard is so unequal, as would sway a prudent man to the
   affirmative. Suppose a man believe there is no God, nor life after
   this; and suppose he be in the right, but not certain that he is, (for
   that I am sure in this case is impossible;) all the advantage he hath
   by this opinion, relates only to this world and this present time: for
   he cannot be the better for it when he is not. Now what advantage will
   it be to him in this life? He shall have the more liberty to do what he
   pleaseth; that is, it furnishes him with a stronger temptation to be
   intemperate, and lustful, and unjust; that is, to do those things which
   prejudice his body and his health, which cloud his reason, and darken
   his understanding; which will make him enemies in the world, and will
   bring him into danger. So that it is no advantage to any man to be
   vicious: and yet this is the greatest use that is made of atheistical
   principles; to comfort men in their vicious courses. But if thou hast a
   mind to be virtuous, and temperate, and just, the belief of the
   principles of religion will be no obstacle, but a furtherance to thee
   in this course. All the advantage a man can hope for by disbelieving
   the principles of religion, is to escape trouble and persecution in
   this world, which may happen to him upon account of religion. But
   supposing there be a God, and a life after this; then what a vast
   difference is there of the consequences of these opinions! as much as
   between finite and infinite, time and eternity!

   Secondly, To persuade men to believe the Scriptures, I only offer this
   to men's consideration. If there be a God whose providence governs the
   world, and all the creatures in it, is it not reasonable to think that
   he hath a particular care of men, the noblest part of this visible
   world? and seeing he hath made them capable of eternal duration; that
   he hath provided for their eternal happiness, and sufficiently revealed
   to them the way to it, and the terms and conditions of it: now let any
   man produce any book in the world, that pretends to be from God, and to
   do this; that, for the matter of it, is so worthy of God, the doctrines
   whereof are so useful, and the precepts so reasonable, and the
   arguments so powerful, the truth of all which was confirmed by so many
   great and unquestionable miracles, the relation of which hath been
   transmitted to posterity, in public and authentic records, written by
   those who were eye and ear-witnesses of what they wrote, and free from
   suspicion of any worldly interest and design; let any produce a book
   like this, in all these respects; and which, over and be sides, hath,
   by the power and reasonableness of the doctrines contained in it,
   prevailed so miraculously in the world, by weak and inconsiderable
   means, in opposition to all the wit and power of the world, and under
   such discouragements, as no other religion was ever assaulted with; let
   any man bring forth such a book, and he hath my leave to believe it as
   soon as the Bible. But if there be none such, as I am well assured
   there is not, then every one that thinks God hath revealed himself to
   men, ought to embrace and entertain the doctrine of the Holy
   Scriptures, as revealed by God.

   And now, having presented men with such arguments and considerations as
   are proper, and I think sufficient to induce belief, I think it not
   unreasonable to entreat and urge men diligently and impartially to
   consider these matters; and if there be weight in these considerations
   to sway reasonable men, that they would not suffer themselves to be
   biassed by prejudice, or passion, or interest, to a contrary
   persuasion. Thus much I may with reason desire of men: for though men
   cannot believe what they will, yet men may, if they will, consider
   things seriously and impartially, and yield or with hold their assent,
   as they shall see cause, after a thorough search and examination.

   If any man will offer a serious argument against any of the principles
   of religion, and will debate the matter soberly, as one that considers
   the infinite consequences of things one way or other, and would gladly
   be satisfied, he deserves to be heard what he can say: but if a man
   will turn religion into raillery, and confute it by two or three bold
   jests; he doth not make religion, but himself ridiculous, in the
   opinion of all considerate men; because he sports with his life.

   So that it concerns every man that would not trifle away his soul, and
   fool himself into irrecoverable misery, with the greatest seriousness
   to inquire into these things, whether they be so or not, and patiently
   to consider the arguments that are brought for them.

   And when you are examining these matters, do not take into
   consideration any sensual or worldly interest: but deal fairly and
   impartially with your selves, Think with yourselves that you have not
   the making of things true or false; that the principles of religion are
   either true or false, before you think of them. The truth of things is
   already fixed; either there is a God, or no God; either your souls are
   immortal, or they are not; either the Scriptures are a Divine
   revelation, or an imposture; one of these is certain and necessary, and
   they are not now to be altered. Things will not comply with your
   conceits, and bend themselves to your interests. Therefore, do not
   think what you would have to be: but consider impartially what is. [9]

   And if, upon inquiry, you be convinced that it is the greatest reason
   and prudence to believe that there is a God, and a future state, and
   that the Scriptures are the word of God, then meditate much of these
   things; attend to the proper consequences of such a persuasion; and
   resolve to live as becomes those who believe there is a God, and
   another life after this, and that it is best for you to obey the
   precepts of his word, being persuaded that whatever is there promised
   in case of obedience, or threatened in case of disobedience, will
   certainly be accomplished.

   And labour to strengthen yourselves in this belief; because faith is
   the spring of all rational actions, and the root of all other graces;
   and according to the strength and weakness of faith, your holiness, and
   obedience, and graces, will flourish and decay.

   And because the matters of faith do not fall under our senses, and the
   things of another world are in visible, and at distance, and
   consequently not so apt to affect us, as present and sensible things,
   we should take the more pains with ourselves, that by revolving
   frequently in our minds the thoughts of God, and representing to
   ourselves the happiness and misery of another world, they may have as
   great an effect upon us, as if they were present to us, and we saw them
   with our bodily eyes.

SERMON CCXXIV.

  OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, THE MEANS OF ITS CONVEYANCE, AND OUR OBLIGATION TO
  RECEIVE IT.

   But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
   the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his
   name.--John xx. 31.

   I HAVE largely discoursed concerning the general nature of faith, and
   more particularly concerning the faith which is truly Divine and
   religious: in the latitude of which is contained a persuasion
   concerning the principles of natural religion, the being of God, the
   immortality of the soul, and a future state; and a persuasion of the
   Divine revelation of the Scriptures, and the matters contained in them.
   Now among matters of Divine revelation, the doctrine of the gospel is a
   principal part; which is the last and most perfect revelation, which
   God hath made to the world, by his Son Jesus Christ; and a firm belief
   and persuasion of this, is that which is called Christian faith, or the
   faith of the gospel; and which, by way of eminency, is usually called
   faith in the New Testament.

   Now Christian faith is not opposed to a Divine faith, but is
   comprehended under it; as being a: principal and eminent part of Divine
   faith, but not all that which may be called Divine faith; Christian
   faith supposeth a belief of the principles of natural religion; and a
   belief of those revelations which God formerly made under the Old
   Testament: but it doth only formally contain in it a belief of the
   gospel, viz. that revelation which God hath in these last days made to
   the world by his Son Jesus Christ. The heathens, who were destitute of
   Divine revelation, did only believe the principles of natural religion;
   and the generality of them did not believe those but in a very
   imperfect mariner. The Jews, "to whom were committed the oracles of
   God," did superadd to the belief of the principles of natural religion,
   the belief of such revelations as God was pleased to make to them under
   that dispensation. Christian faith superadds to both the former, a
   belief of the revelation of the gospel.

   I shall now, therefore, by God's assistance, endeavour to open to you
   the nature of Christian faith from these words; in which you have these
   three things considerable:

   First, The end of committing the gospel to writing, which was, to
   persuade men to believe in Christ, to propagate and continue Christian
   faith in the world; "These things are written, that ye might believe
   that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God:" and by faith to bring men to
   a participation of those benefits, and the salvation which Christ was
   the author of: "And that believing ye might have life through his
   name." "These were written;" tauta, "these," which may either refer to
   semeia, "these signs or miracles," referring to the former verse, "and
   many other signs," &c. but these signs or miracles are written to
   confirm Jesus to be the person he pretended to be, the Messias, the Son
   of God, and consequently to confirm the truth of the doctrine which he
   delivered; that, by this confirmation, men might be induced to believe
   him to be the true Messias, and to give entertainment to his doctrine.

   Or else (which is very probable) the word tauta may refer to the whole
   history of the gospel, in which you have an account of the life of
   Christ, and the doctrine which he taught, and the miracles which were
   wrought for the confirmation of it. And so we may look upon these two
   verses as a conclusion of the whole history of the gospel written by
   the four evangelists. For as for the chapter following, it seems not to
   be written by St. John himself, but by the church, probably, as Grotius
   conjectures, by the church of Ephesus, where he had resided, and whom
   he had acquainted with the particulars which are there set down; the
   principal of which is, the prediction of our Saviour concerning his
   long life, for the sake of which the rest of the story seems to be
   brought in; which particular was not fit to be recorded till after his
   death; I say, it seems probable that St. John ended his gospel here,
   and that the last chapter was added by others, as the last chapter of
   the Pentateuch was added by some other after the death of Moses; and
   the last chapter of Joshua after his death. And this seems very evident
   from the 24th verse of the chapter; where, after a relation of our
   Saviour's prediction, concerning "the disciple whom Jesus loved," it is
   added, "This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and
   wrote these things (that is, the fore going history of the gospel), and
   we know that his testimony is true;" which seems plainly to be spoken
   by some other persons: for it were improper for him to say this of
   himself, "We know that his testimony is true."

   So that here seems to be an end of the history of Christ which St. John
   wrote; and these two verses, seem to be the conclusion of the whole
   gospel writ ten by the four evangelists; and then the sense of them
   will be this; "Many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his
   disciples, which are not written in this book;" that is, the disciples
   were witnesses of many other miracles which Christ wrought, which they
   did not think necessary to set down in this book, that is, in this
   history of Christ written by the four evangelists: "But these are
   written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
   and that believing ye might have life through his name;" that is, These
   things which are recorded in this history, this account which is here
   given of the life, and actions, and doctrine, and miracles of Christ,
   is sufficient to bring men to the faith of the gospel, to satisfy men
   that Christ was the Messias, the Son of God, and consequently that his
   doctrine is true.

   And that this conclusion doth refer to the whole history of the gospel
   written by the four evangelists, I am induced to believe upon these two
   accounts:

   1. Because St. John's gospel doth not seem to be intended for a history
   of the life and actions of Christ: but an appendix to the history which
   had been written before by the other evangelists, and to supply only
   what they had omitted. Therefore you find that he gives no account of
   the genealogy or birth of our Saviour, nor of his sermon upon the
   mount, which did contain the sum of his doctrine, nor of any of his
   miracles, or his other discourses, which are related by the other
   evangelists; nor doth he relate any more of the history of his life,
   than was just necessary to bring in and connect those things which he
   thought fit to superadd to the former history. So that, considering how
   defective this gospel, taken by itself, is, in the most essential parts
   of the history of the life, and doctrine, and actions, of Christ; no
   man can think that St. John did intend this for a full and sufficient
   account of the life, and doctrine, and miracles of Christ; or that,
   upon this imperfect relation, in which he had knowingly omitted many of
   the most material and considerable things belonging to the history of
   Christ, he could expect that men should receive full satisfaction
   concerning him. Therefore I think it is highly reasonable, and almost
   necessary to conclude, that when he says, "These things are written,
   that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;" he
   does not solely refer to the gospel which was written by himself; but
   to the whole history of the gospel, which was put together into one
   book or volume, which was completed by this appendix.

   2. Another reason I have for this, which doth much strengthen this
   conjecture, is what I find in Eusebius, in the 18th chapter of the
   third book of his history, where he tells us to this purpose, "That St.
   John, who lived the last of the apostles, did revise what they had
   written of the history of Christ, and added his Gospel as an appendix
   to the rest."

   I have insisted the longer upon this, that no man might think, when St.
   John says, "These things are written that ye might believe," that his
   gospel taken alone and by itself is a sufficient account of Christ, and
   contains all that was requisite to bring men to believe on him. This is
   the first thing in the words, the end of committing the gospel to
   writing.

   Secondly, You have here the nature of Christian faith described; it is
   a believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; that is, that he
   is the true Messias prophesied of in the Old Testament, and promised as
   the Saviour of the world; and that he is the Son of God, who came from
   the Father into the world; and took our nature upon him, that he might
   teach us and go before us in the way to eternal happiness.

   Thirdly, The blessed effect of this faith, or the benefit that redounds
   to us upon believing: "that believing, ye might have life through his
   name;" that is, that upon these terms and conditions you might be made
   partakers of all those blessings and benefits which Christ, the Saviour
   of the world, hath purchased for us, which are here set forth to us in
   the name of "life;" it being usual in the phrase of Scripture, to
   express to us those things which are most excellent and desirable by
   "life." Now the principal benefits which Christ hath purchased, and
   which in Scripture we are said to be made partakers of by believing,
   are regeneration, justification or pardon of sin, and eternal life and
   salvation; and the two first of these, as well as the last, are called
   life in Scripture. Regeneration, (in which I include the continuance
   and progress of this work, which is sanctification) that is, a new
   life, (Rom. vi. 4.) it is called "newness of life." And we are said to
   have this life by faith; (Gal. ii. 20.) "And the life which I now live
   in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God." And, (Col. ii.
   12.) "Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him;"
   that is, regenerated and born to a new life. How? "By the faith of the
   operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead;" that is, by
   believing the power of God, who raised up Christ from the dead, for the
   confirmation of the truth of the gospel; (1 John v. 1.) "Whosoever
   believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God." So likewise
   justification is called life. While we are under sentence of
   condemnation, we are dead in law; but being justified and pardoned, we
   are restored to life. So the apostle expresseth it, (Rom. v. 18.) "So
   by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men unto
   justification of life." And that we are justified by faith, the
   Scripture tells us so frequently, that I shall not cite any texts for
   it.

   And then eternal life and salvation; and this is the consummation of
   all, and I doubt not but is here principally intended in the text by
   the word life. So that the meaning of this expression, "that believing
   ye might have life through his name," is, that by faith of the gospel
   ye might be renewed, and pardoned, and saved; though J think that the
   last, viz. eternal life and salvation, is principally, though not
   solely intended, as will appear by comparing this place with these
   parallel texts: (John iii. 15.) "That whosoever believeth in him should
   not perish, but have eternal life:" and, (ver. 36.) "He that believeth
   on the Son hath everlasting life." (John v. 24.) "He that heareth my
   word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life." (1
   Pet. i. 9.) "The end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."

   Thus I have, as briefly as I well could, explained to you the meaning
   of the words, which I have done the more fully, that you may see how
   those observations which I shall raise from them are contained in them.
   The observations are these:

   First, That writing is the way which the wisdom of God hath pitched
   upon, as the standing way to convey the knowledge of the gospel to the
   world. "These things are written."

   Secondly, That all things necessary to be believed in order to
   salvation, are contained in the gospel. "These things are written that
   ye might believe, and believing might have life:" but if any thing
   necessary to be believed by Christians, in order to eternal salvation,
   were omitted, then the gospel would be written to no purpose, and would
   fail in the end for which it was written.

   Thirdly, That the miracles related in the gospel are a proper and
   sufficient means, or argument, to bring men to Christian faith. For
   this is the narrowest and most restrained sense in which we can take
   the words; "These things," that is, these miracles, "are written that
   ye might believe," &c. Now if St. John, by the Spirit of God, did
   record miracles to this end, we may conclude that they are proper and
   sufficient for this end.

   Fourthly, That a credible history does give men sufficient assurance of
   matter of fact, and such as we may safely build a Divine faith upon.
   For, if these miracles were recorded for this end, that men might
   believe, then a credible history or relation that such miracles were
   done, is sufficient to assure us that such miracles were wrought; and
   upon this assurance we may build our faith; other wise, it had been in
   vain to have recorded these miracles to this end.

   Fifthly, That we are not now-a-days destitute of a sufficient ground of
   faith; because we have these writings credibly conveyed to us, which
   contain the doctrine of the gospel, and the relation of the miracles,
   written for the confirmation of it.

   Sixthly, That men now-a-days, those to whom the gospel comes, are under
   an obligation to believe; or, which is all one, that now-a-days men may
   be guilty of such a sin as unbelief: for now-a-days we may have
   sufficient grounds of faith.

   Seventhly, That to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, is
   truly and properly Christian faith. This is the description which is
   here given, of it, that it is a believing, "that Jesus is the Christ,
   the Son of God."

   Eighthly, That to believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, is
   truly and properly sanctifying, and justifying, and saving faith; by
   this faith we have life. "These things are written, that ye might
   believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye
   might have life through his name."

   These observations are all virtually contained in these words. The
   greatest part of them I shall very lightly pass over, and speak but
   briefly to them, because I intend mainly to insist upon the two last;
   in the handling of which, I shall open to you the nature of Christian
   faith, and shew you, that the faith which is here described, is that
   which is truly and properly justifying and saving.

   First, That writing is the way which the wisdom of God hath pitched
   upon, as the standing way of conveying the knowledge of the gospel to
   the world. This is matter of fact, and for the proof of it we have the
   evidence of the thing. The gospel de facto was written, and this
   writing is conveyed down to us, and is the instrument which God hath in
   all ages since the apostles' time, that is, since the eye and
   ear-witnesses of the miracles of Christ and his doctrine ceased, made
   use of to convey to the world the knowledge of the gospel. And here it
   were proper to shew what advantage this way of conveyance of the gospel
   hath above oral tradition: but that I have already done, [10] in some
   former discourses, where I shewed at large, that this way of conveyance
   is a more universal and diffusive, a more certain, and liable to less
   imposture and falsification, a more equal and uniform, and a more human
   way of conveyance, than oral tradition; so that I shall not insist
   longer upon this.

   Secondly, That all things necessary to be believed by Christians, in
   order to salvation, are contained in the written gospel; or else, how
   could St. John, in reason, say, that "these things are written (to this
   end) that men might believe and be saved;" if these things be not
   sufficient to this end? which certainly they are not, if any thing
   necessary to be believed in order to salvation be left out. The papists
   being urged with this text, to prove the sufficiency of the written
   word, in opposition to those traditional doctrines which they pretend
   to be necessary over and besides the written word, tell us, that St.
   John doth not here speak of the doctrine of Christ, but only of his
   miracles; these are writ ten to confirm our faith of the Messias; but
   the doctrine of Christ was not all written, but left to the apostles to
   be delivered by mouth to their successors, and so down to posterity.
   But I have shewn before, that the necessary doctrines of the gospel, as
   well as the miracles, are comprehended in these things, which, St. John
   says, were written. Besides that, it will be very hard for any man to
   devise a convenient reason, why miracles, as well as doctrines, might
   not have been left to the apostles, to have been traditionally
   delivered down to posterity without writing. For doctrines may as well
   be committed to writing, as relations of miracles; and miracles may be
   with as much ease, and certainty, and convenience in all respects,
   delivered down to posterity by an oral tradition, as doctrines may.

   Thirdly, That the miracles related in the gospel, are a proper and
   sufficient means to bring men to Christian faith. That they are so, it
   is a good sign, that God did work them to this end, and after wards
   commit them to writing for this very reason, that the knowledge of them
   might be conveyed to posterity, and there might still remain in the
   world a proper and sufficient argument to persuade men to believe; and
   we may well imagine, that God would not do any thing but what is very
   proper and sufficient for its end. Now that miracles were wrought by
   the Divine power purposely to this end, and that they are in reason a
   very sufficient attestation to a person, and confirmation of the
   doctrine which he brings, I have largely shewn elsewhere; [11] and that
   all along both in the Old and New Testament, God did empower Moses and
   the prophets, Christ and his apostles, to work miracles, to bring men
   to faith, and that this was the principal argument whereby those who
   did believe were wrought upon.

   Fourthly, That credible history doth give men sufficient assurance of
   matter of fact; and such assurance, as we may safely build a Divine
   faith upon. We freely believe innumerable things, which are said to
   have been done many ages before we were born, and make not the least
   doubt of them, only upon the credit of history: so that if the relation
   of miracles be but granted to be a credible history, we may, upon the
   credit of the relation, safely believe that such miracles were wrought;
   and, if such miracles were wrought, we may safely believe the doctrine
   to be from God, for the confirmation of which they were wrought; and,
   consequently, a Divine faith may be safely built upon such an assurance
   of miracles, as we may have from a credible history and relation.

   Fifthly, That we are not now-a-days destitute of a sufficient ground of
   faith; because the doctrine of the gospel hath still the same
   confirmation that it had, viz. miracles: only we who live at this
   distance from the time when, and the place where they were wrought,
   have the knowledge of them conveyed to us, and come to be assured of
   them, in. another way. Those who lived in the age of Christ and his
   apostles, had assurance of miracles from their own senses: and we now
   are assured of them by credible history and relation. Now, though these
   ways be not equal, yet they are both sufficient to beget in us an
   undoubted assurance, and such as no prudent man hath any reason to
   doubt of. For a man may be as truly and undoubtedly certain, that is,
   as well satisfied that a thing was done, from the credit of history, as
   from his own senses. I make no more doubt whether there was such a
   person as Henry the Eighth, king of England, than I do whether I be in
   this place.

   Sixthly, That now-a-days, those to whom the gospel comes, are under an
   obligation to believe; or that now-a-days there is such a sin as
   unbelief of the gospel. And I the rather note this, because there are
   some well wishers to atheism, who, out of prudence and regard to their
   own safety, choose rather secretly to undermine religion, than openly
   to deny it. I grant, indeed, that, in our Saviour's time, when such
   great miracles were wrought, those who saw those miracles (which they
   think nobody did) were under an obligation to believe, and guilty of a
   great sin in not believing the gospel; but now-a-days, when we see no
   such miracles wrought for the confirmation of the gospel, there lies no
   obligation upon any man to believe it; and that now there is no such
   sin as unbelief. Now, any man may, with half an eye, see the
   consequence of this assertion: for being once admitted, it doth as
   certainly destroy Christian religion, as if men should deny that there
   was any such person as Jesus Christ, or that he ever wrought any
   miracles: for if to disbelieve the gospel be no sin, and consequently
   brings a man into no danger; but on the other hand, dangers and
   persecutions do attend the belief and profession of it; it were the
   greatest folly in the world for any man to believe; unless this
   possibly may be greater, for a man who does believe it, not to obey and
   live according to it. And if this were true, it were the greatest
   imprudence that can be, for any man to be a Christian. And if that were
   once admitted, there is all the reason in the world that Christianity
   should be banished and extirpated; not only as useless and impertinent,
   but as a thing dangerous and pernicious to the welfare of mankind.

   I shall therefore briefly prove to yon, that it is now one of the
   greatest sins that men are capable of (except the sin against the Holy
   Ghost), for those who have the gospel sufficiently propounded to them,
   to disbelieve it; I say, except the sin against the Holy Ghost, which
   our Saviour tells us, was "blaspheming the Spirit of God," whereby he
   wrought his miracles, and saying it was the spirit of the devil; and
   this sin, men in a lower degree and proportion may now-a-days be guilty
   of: for as the pharisees who saw the works that Christ did, and
   acknowledged them to be miracles, did commit the sin against the Holy
   Ghost, in ascribing those miracles, which were really wrought by the
   power of the Holy Ghost, to the power of the devil; so men now-a-days
   who own the history of Christ's miracles as true, may be guilty of the
   sin against the Holy Ghost, in a lower proportion, by maliciously
   imputing those miracles to the power of the devil.

   But excepting the sin against the Holy Ghost, the greatest sin that men
   are now capable of, is to disbelieve the gospel, when it is
   sufficiently propounded to them. Now the gospel is then sufficiently
   propounded, when there are sufficient grounds offered to persuade men
   to the belief of it; and I have already proved, that we now have
   sufficient ground to believe the gospel; and if so, then whosoever hath
   these grounds offered to him, is under an obligation to believe it: for
   every man is bound to believe that, for which he hath sufficient ground
   and reason; and every man sins who neglects his duty; that is, does not
   do that which he stands bound to do.

   And not only whoever disbelieves the gospel, sins in so doing, but
   farther, he commits the greatest sin that now men are capable of. I
   say, now capable of: for I doubt not but that it was a sin of a higher
   degree, for those who saw Christ's miracles to disbelieve, than it is
   for us who have only the relation of them. For by the same reason, that
   "he is more blessed that believes, and hath not seen;" a greater curse
   belongs to him, who hath seen, and yet doth not believe; and
   consequently such a person is guilty of a greater sin. But be cause we
   cannot now see the miracles of Christ, the greatest sin that men in
   this age are capable of, is to disbelieve the gospel confirmed by
   miracles, whereof we are assured by credible relation. For the sin of
   disbelieving now hath these two aggravations:

   1. It is against sufficient light and evidence; and in this it is equal
   to the sins which are committed against natural light.

   2. It is a sin against the greatest mercies and blessing that ever were
   offered to the world; and in this it exceeds the sins against natural
   light. Whoever disbelieves the gospel, he rejects the offer of eternal
   life and happiness. And these two aggravations the apostle puts
   together, (Heb. ii. 3.) "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great
   salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
   confirmed unto us by them that heard him!" And if this be thus, it
   highly concerns us to inquire into the nature of this faith; and this
   brings me to the

   Seventh observation; That to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
   of God, is truly and properly Christian faith. But the consideration of
   this I shall leave to the next opportunity.

SERMON CCXXV.

  OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH, WHICH SANCTIFIES, JUSTIFIES, AND SAVES.

   But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
   the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his
   name.--John xx. 31.

   IN my former discourse upon these words, I proposed eight observations
   from them, six of which I have already dispatched, designing to
   discourse of the remaining two more at large. I proceed therefore to
   the

   Seventh observation which I laid down, viz. That to believe that Jesus
   is the Christ, the Son of God, is truly and properly Christian faith.
   This is the description which is here given of Christian faith.

   In prosecution of this, I shall do these two things:

   First, Shew you what is included in "believing that Jesus is the
   Christ, the Son of God?"

   Secondly, Prove that this is truly and properly Christian faith.

   First, What is included in "believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
   of God?" It signifies a firm and effectual persuasion, that Jesus, that
   is, the person the history of whose life and death is related in the
   gospel, is the Christ; that is, the true Messias, promised and
   prophesied of in the Old Testament to be the Saviour of the world; and
   that he is "the Son of God, (that is,) the only-begotten of the
   Father," who was sent by him into the world, and took our nature upon
   him, that he might purchase eternal happiness for us, and instruct us,
   and go before us in the way to it. So that faith is a firm and
   effectual persuasion of, or assent to, the whole gospel. Faith
   signifies Christian religion, which comprehends an assent to the
   doctrines of the gospel, and a suitable life and conversation.

   I say, a firm persuasion of this; for in the phrase of the New
   Testament, none are accounted true believers, or said to have a true
   faith in Christ, who do not firmly continue in this persuasion; and the
   owning and profession of it, notwithstanding all the sufferings and
   persecutions it might expose them to. And an effectual persuasion; for
   none are said truly to believe in Christ, who do not shew forth the
   proper and genuine effects of this faith; who do not live as they
   believe, and conform their lives to that doctrine, to the truth whereof
   they profess an assent.

   And hence it is that true Christians, that is, those who did fashion
   their lives according to the gospel, are called believers, and the sum
   of all Christianity is usually contained in this word believing, which
   is the great principle of a Christian life; as in the Old Testament,
   all religion is expressed by the "faith of God;" so in the New, by
   "faith in Christ."

   Now whosoever doth firmly and effectually entertain this truth, that
   Jesus, whom the gospel declares to us is the true Messias, and Saviour
   of the world, and the very Son of God, sent by him into the world for
   this purpose, that he might by his doctrine instruct, and by the
   example of his life go before us in the way to eternal happiness, and
   by the merit and satisfaction of his death and sufferings, appease and
   reconcile God to men, and purchase for them the pardon of their sins
   and eternal life, upon the conditions of faith and repentance, and
   sincere obedience; I say, whosoever doth firmly and effectually
   entertain these truths, will consequently endeavour to obey the
   precepts of his doctrine, and to imitate the example of his life, and
   will expect salvation, that is, the pardon of his sins, and eternal
   life, from no other: because he is verily persuaded he is a teacher,
   and a Saviour sent from God, that his doctrine is true, and his
   satisfaction available, and that the rewards which he hath promised to
   those who believe and obey him, and the punishments which he hath
   threatened to the unbelievers and disobedient, shall all certainly be
   fulfilled and accomplished. All this is included in "believing that
   Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God." So Christian faith, or the faith
   of the gospel, contains plainly in it these particulars:

   1. An assent of the understanding to this truth, that Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God, was a person commissioned from heaven, and employed by God
   to bring men to eternal happiness. And this fundamental is necessary to
   all the subsequent acts of faith, and that upon which they depend.

   2. An assent of the understanding to the truth of all those things
   which this person delivered to the world. So that if he tells us, that
   his death hath made expiation for the sins of men, upon the conditions
   of faith and repentance and obedience, and that God by him doth command
   the world to do such and such things, and in case of obedience will
   confer such and such rewards upon men, but in case of disobedience will
   inflict such punishments upon them; we are to believe all this to be
   true; be cause the person who acquainted us with these things was sent
   by God, and employed from heaven upon this message.

   3. And consequently, a relying and depending upon him, and no other,
   for the conferring of these benefits, and making good these promises to
   us.

   4. Obedience to all his laws and commands; be cause believing them to
   be from God we cannot but assent to them as good, and as laying an
   obligation upon us to yield obedience to them: and if we do not obey
   them, we are presumed to disbelieve them; for if we did truly and
   heartily believe them to be the commands of God, we would obey them.

   Now that obedience of heart and life to the precepts and commands of
   the gospel, as well as an as sent of the understanding to the truth of
   the gospel-revelation, and a trusting and relying upon the merits of
   Christ, is included in the Scripture notion of faith, will evidently
   appear to any that will consider these texts. (Rom. i. 5.) "By whom we
   have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among
   all nations for his name;" where the belief of the gospel is called
   "the obedience of faith." (Rom. x. 10.) "But they have not all obeyed
   the gospel: for Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?" But
   if faith do not include obedience, how could he prove that there were
   some that did not obey the gospel, because Isaiah said, there were some
   that did not believe it? And so likewise by comparing 1 Tim. iv. 10.
   where he is said to be "the Saviour of them that believe," with Heb. v.
   9. where he is said to be the "author of eternal salvation unto all
   them that obey him." As also by comparing Gal. v. 6. where it is said,
   "For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
   uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love," with 1 Cor. vii. 19.
   "Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is no thing: but the
   keeping of the commandments of God." And so likewise by those texts,
   where unbelief and disobedience are equivalently used. I will but
   mention one, (Heb. iii. 12.) The apostle, from the example of the
   Israelites, cautions Christians against unbelief: "Take heed, brethren,
   lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing
   from the living God." And repeating the same caution in the next
   chapter, at the 11th verse, he varies the phrase a little, "Lest any
   man fall after the same example of disobedience;" the word is
   apeithei'as, which indeed our translators render unbelief; but that
   confirms that which I bring it for, that disobedience and unbelief are
   the same. And so likewise we find faith and disobedience opposed
   frequently in Scripture. (John iii. 36.) "He that believeth on the Son
   hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see
   life." In the Greek it is, "He that obeyeth not the Son," as you will
   see in the margin of the Bible. (1 Pet. ii. 7.) "Unto you therefore
   which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the
   stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the
   corner." And this doth likewise appear in all those texts, wherein
   repentance, and our forgiving of others, and several other acts of
   obedience, are made the conditions of our justification, or the
   omission of them, sins, as well as faith. So that we cannot be said to
   be "justified by faith alone," unless that faith include in it
   obedience. I have insisted the longer upon this, because the right
   understanding the Scripture-notion of faith in Christ, doth very much
   depend upon this: and if this one thing, that the Scripture-notion of
   faith doth include in it obedience to the precepts of the gospel, were
   but well understood and considered, it would silence and put an end to
   those infinite controversies about faith and justification, which have
   so much troubled the Christian world, to the great prejudice of
   practical religion, and holiness of life.

   Secondly, That this is truly and properly Christian faith. Which I
   shall prove by these two arguments.

   1. Because it includes a belief of the whole gospel, or of all the
   revelation which God hath made to the world by Jesus Christ. And
   certainly, there cannot be a more proper notion of Christian faith,
   than to believe the revelation which God hath made by Jesus Christ: but
   to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, doth include this.
   For who soever believes him to be the Messias, and the Son of God,
   believes him to have come from God, and to be authorized and
   commissioned by him to make known his mind to the world, and
   consequently will believe whatever he delivers. For whoever believes
   the goodness and veracity of God, as every man does that believes a
   God, cannot but assent to the truth of every thing which he is
   satisfied comes from God.

   2. That to "believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God," is truly
   and properly Christian faith, or the faith of the gospel, will appear,
   by considering how the Scriptures of the New Testament do constantly
   describe to us the faith of the gospel; and you shall find they do it,
   either by the very phrase in the text, or other phrases or metaphors
   equivalent to it, or else by a belief of that which is the great
   argument and confirmation of Christ's being the Messias, the Son of
   God. Very often the faith of the gospel is described by the very phrase
   in the text, "believing that Jesus is the Christ," and that "he is the
   Son of God." (John iv. 41, 42.) "And many more believed, because of his
   own word; and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy
   saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed
   the Christ, the Saviour of the world." (John vi. 69.) "And we believe
   and are sure that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
   (John xi. 27.) Says Martha to Christ, "Yea, Lord, I believe that thou
   art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world."
   (Acts viii. 37.) "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." (1
   John iii. 23.) "And this is his commandment, that we should believe on
   the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us
   commandment;" that is, that we should believe on him under this name
   and title of "Jesus Christ the Son of God." (I John v. 1.) "Whosoever
   believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God." And, (ver. 5.)
   "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus
   is the Son of God? And, (ver. 10.) "He that believeth on the Son of
   God;" that is, believeth Jesus to be the Son of God. And, (ver. 13.)
   "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the
   Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may
   believe on the name of the Son of God."

   Sometimes the faith of the gospel is described to us by other phrases
   that are tantamount to these; such as signify that "he came from God,"
   and was sent by him into the world, and was the Messias whom they
   expected. (John iii. 2.) Nicodemus describes his faith in Christ thus;
   "I know that thou art a teacher come from God." (John vi. 29.) "This is
   the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent;" that is,
   that ye believe me to be sent from God. (John viii. 24.) "For if ye
   believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins;" that is, if ye
   believe not that I am the Messias, whom you expect and look for. And so
   (John xiii. 19.) "That ye may believe that I am he." And, (John xi.
   42.) "That they may believe that thou hast sent me." And, (John xvi.
   30.) "By this we believe that thou earnest forth from God." And, (John
   xvii. 8.) "They have believed that thou didst send me."

   Sometimes the faith of the gospel is expressed by metaphors equivalent
   to these expressions, as by "coming to Christ," and "receiving him" as
   the true Messias, in several places, and sometimes by believing that
   which is the great argument and confirmation that Christ was the true
   Messias the Son of God, that is, believing his resurrection from the
   dead. (Rom. iv. 24.) "To whom it shall be imputed for righteousness, if
   we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead." (Rom.
   x. 9.) "If thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall
   believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
   shall be saved." (Col. ii. 12.) "Through the faith of the operation of
   God, who raised him up from the dead." Where faith is described by a
   belief of the power whereby Christ was raised from the dead. And to
   mention no more, (1 Pet. i. 21.) "Who by him do believe in God, that
   raised him up from the dead." Now the reason why the faith of the
   gospel is described by the belief of Christ's resurrection, is, because
   whoever believes that Christ was raised from the dead, can not but be
   satisfied, that this great miracle was a sufficient attestation that he
   was no impostor, but that he was what he pretended to be, viz. the Son
   of God; and consequently that he ought to be believed and obeyed in all
   things. And thus much may suffice to have been spoken to this seventh
   observation.

   Eighth observation; that to "believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son
   of God," is truly and properly sanctifying, and justifying, and saving
   faith. So the text tells us, that this faith gives us life; "But these
   are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
   God; and that believing ye might have life through his name," that is,
   as I explained this phrase in the opening of the text, that upon these
   terms and conditions ye might be made partakers of all those blessings
   and benefits, which Christ the Saviour of the world hath purchased,
   which are here set forth under the name of life; it being usual in the
   phrase of Scripture to set forth to us those things which are most
   excellent and desirable, by life, which men value above all other
   things. Now the principal benefits which Christ hath purchased, and
   which we are said to be made partakers of by believing, are,

   1. Regeneration; under which I include the continuance and progress of
   this work, which is sanctification.

   2. Justification; by which I cannot find that the Scripture means any
   more than pardon or remission of sins.

   3. Eternal life; and this I think is principally, though not solely
   intended here in the text, as I have shewn, by comparing the text with
   other parallel texts in the same evangelist. (John iii. 15.) "That
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life."
   And, (ver. 36.) "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life." I
   say, I think eternal life is here principally intended, though this
   supposes the others, regeneration and justification, before we can
   attain it, which may also very well be included here in the term of
   life. My reasons are these:

   1. Because I find in Scripture, that regeneration and justification are
   expressed by the name of life. Rom. vi. 4. our regeneration is called
   newness of life, because before we were "dead in sins and trespasses;"
   and (Rom. v. 18.) justification is called "justification of life,"
   because, while our sins are unpardoned, and we are under the sentence
   of condemnation, we are dead in law; but being justified and pardoned,
   we are, as it were, restored to life again.

   2. Because, in the phrase of Scripture, we are said to be regenerate,
   and sanctified, and justified by faith, as well as saved. (1 John v.
   I.) "He that believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God." (Gal.
   ii. 20.) "The life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of
   the Son of God;" speaking of the new life of sanctification. And (Col.
   ii.) we are said to be "risen with Christ," that is, born to anew life,
   "by the faith of the operation of God, that raised up Jesus from the
   dead;" and to "be justified by faith," in innumerable places. So that
   it is very probable upon these accounts that the evangelist here, when
   he says, "that believing, you might have life in his name," doth intend
   to take in regeneration and justification, as well as eternal life,
   which is the consummation of all the blessings of the gospel. I come
   now to the observation, viz.

   That this faith of the gospel, which I have described, is truly and
   properly a sanctifying, and justifying, and saving faith.

   I. I shall shew that it is properly a sanctifying faith.

   II. A justifying and saving faith.

   I. It is truly sanctifying. I know that this term of a sanctifying
   faith, is not much in use among divines, and therefore it may seem a
   little more strange: but they might have used it if they had pleased,
   for it is every whit as proper to call faith sanctifying, as
   justifying, or saving. It is true, in deed, this express term of a
   sanctifying faith is no where in Scripture; no more are the very terms
   of justifying and saving faith: but we are said to be justified and
   saved by faith in Scripture, which is as much as if the terms had been
   used. And we are said also to be sanctified by faith, as well as
   justified and saved. (Acts xv. 9.) Our hearts are said to be purified
   by faith. And so likewise, our "victory over the world," that is, our
   conquering and subduing of our covetous and ambitious and sensual lusts
   and desires, is in a peculiar manner ascribed to this faith which I
   have described. (1 John v. 4, 5.) "This is the victory that overcometh
   the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he
   that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"

   II. That this faith is truly and properly justifying and saving faith.
   I put these, justification and sanctification, together, partly because
   they are of the same consideration as to the influence which faith hath
   upon them; and the latter follows upon the former; for if we be
   justified by faith, that is, have our sins pardoned, by the same act of
   faith we are saved from hell, and consequently made capable of eternal
   life; I say, by the very same act of faith that we obtain the pardon of
   our sins, we are saved from hell, that is, the punishment due to sin;
   for pardon removes the guilt, and guilt is nothing else but an
   obligation to punishment: and partly, be cause I find the Scripture
   useth them promiscuously. When St. James disputes about justification
   by faith, he useth the term of being saved by faith; (James ii. 14.)
   "Can faith save him?" Some times of being justified, (ver. 24.) "So
   that a man is not justified by faith only."

   In speaking to this proposition, that the faith of the gospel, which I
   have described, is properly justifying and saving faith, I shall do
   these six things.

   1. Shew that justification in Scripture signifies no more than the
   pardon and remission of sins.

   2. That faith can in no propriety of language be said to be the
   instrument of our pardon.

   3. That the influence that the faith of the gospel, which I have
   described, hath upon the pardon of sin, is this, that it is the whole
   and entire condition required on our parts, upon the performance of
   which God hath promised to pardon our sins, and to save us.

   4. That the Scripture, where it treats of justification by faith,
   speaks of this faith which I have described, and no other.

   5. That no metaphorical descriptions of justifying faith are allowable,
   any farther than as they serve to illustrate and make clear the plain
   and simple notion of the thing. For if metaphors once come to be
   insisted on, and strained, and consequences come to be drawn from them,
   and doctrines founded, and theories built upon them, they are of very
   ill consequence, and serve to no other purpose but to blind and obscure
   the plain and simple notions of things, and to seduce and mislead the
   understandings of men, and to multiply controversies without end.

   And I the rather take notice of this abuse of metaphors upon this
   subject, because I do not know any other head of divinity which hath
   suffered so much by them as the doctrine of justifying faith; whereby
   the plain truth hath been very much obscured, and occasion ministered
   to many endless disputes.

   6. That if this plain and simple notion of justifying faith were
   admitted, it would supersede all those controversies about
   justification, which have so much troubled the church. These
   particulars I shall by God's assistance speak to, not out of a mind to
   oppose and contradict others; (what a pitiful design is that! and how
   much below one that is to speak to men in the name and fear of God!)
   but out of a hearty desire to bring the truth to light, and to
   contribute something to the clearing of that which is of so great
   importance and concernment to Christian religion.

   1. That justification of a sinner, in Scripture, signifies no more than
   the pardon of sin. That there are several acceptations of the word
   justification in the New Testament, I deny not. Sometimes it signifies
   approbation in general of a thing, or person. So the word is used, Luke
   vii. 29. "And all the people that heard him, and the publicans,
   justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John."--"Justified
   God;" how is that? that is, they approved and followed his counsel, as
   appears evidently by the opposition in the next words: "but the
   pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves,
   being not baptized of him." Those that "rejected the counsel of God,"
   are opposed to those that "justified God." And so at the 35th verse,
   "But wisdom is justified of her children." that is, approved. And so,
   very probably, it may be understood in the parable of the pharisee and
   the publican, "I tell you this man went down to his house justified
   rather than the other;" that is, of the two, God did rather approve of
   his humble carriage, than the pharisee's proud and insolent behaviour.
   Sometimes it signifies any proof or declaration of a thing. So, (Rom.
   iii. 4.) "Let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written, That
   thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when
   thou art judged;" that is, that all thy words or promises might be
   proved and declared to be true, and that thou mayest prevail whenever
   thou art impleaded by men of unfaithfulness and unrighteousness. And so
   (1 Tim. iii. 16.) Christ is said to be "justified in the Spirit," that
   is, by the testimony of the Spirit concerning him; as also by the
   miracles which he wrought by the Holy Ghost, and the miraculous gifts
   of the Spirit, which were poured forth on the apostles, he was proved
   and declared to be the true Messias, and the Son of God. And this
   phrase of Christ's "being justified by the Spirit," seems to be of the
   same sense with that expression, (Rom. i. 4.) "Declared to be the Son
   of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the
   resurrection from the dead;" that is, he was evidently proved to be the
   Son of God, by the great miracle of his resurrection, which was wrought
   by the power of the Holy Ghost. But most frequently, to justify, in
   Scripture, signifies to pardon.

   Thus the word justify, doth signify variously, according to the subject
   or matter it is applied to; but when it is applied to a sinner, it
   signifies nothing else but pardon of his sin. Nor can I possibly
   apprehend what other notion men can frame to themselves of a sinner's
   being justified, distinct from pardon and remission. Indeed, if a
   person be not really guilty, that is, unjustly accused of a crime, he
   may be said to be justified, when he is cleared from the charge and
   accusation which is brought against him: but if a man be guilty, he
   cannot otherwise be said to be justified, than by having the guilt
   removed; that is, by being pardoned. And that the Scripture understands
   the same thing by justification, and pardon, or remission of sins, is,
   I think, very evident from these two texts: (Acts xiii. 38, 39.) "That
   through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins;" that
   is, in and through Jesus Christ, the way of pardon and forgiveness is
   declared; "and by him, all that believe are justified from all things,
   from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses;" that is,
   according to this declaration, all that do believe, are by him, that
   is, by the virtue of his sacrifice, acquitted and cleared from the
   guilt of all those sins, for which there was no way of expiation
   provided by the law of Moses, that is, of presumptuous sins, for which
   there was no sacrifice, but the man was to be cut off. Now if the
   meaning of this text be this, that in and through Christ the way of
   pardon and forgiveness is declared, and accordingly all that do believe
   in him are pardoned, then to be justified and pardoned are all one in
   this place; but this is the meaning of the text, if by the phrase of
   being "justified from all things, from which we could not be justified
   by the law of Moses," be meant the pardoning of such sins and
   transgressions, for which, by the law of Moses, there was no way of
   expiation: but this must of necessity be the meaning of this phrase;
   for what are those things, from which it is said, "we could not be
   justified by the law of Moses," but sinful transgressions and
   violations of the law? and how can a man be said to be justified from
   any sin and transgression, otherwise than by the pardon and forgiveness
   of it? The other text is, (Rom. iv. 6-8.) "Even as David also
   describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth
   righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities
   are forgiven, and whose sins are covered: blessed is the man to whom
   the Lord will not impute sin." "The man unto whom God imputeth
   righteousness," is the man whom God justifies. Now, how does David
   describe the blessedness of the man whom God justifies? Thus, "Blessed
   is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered,"
   which is a metaphorical expression of the same thing, covering of sin
   being the pardoning of it. From hence I reason, if according to the
   apostle those propositions be equivalent, "Blessed is the man whose
   iniquities are forgiven," and "Blessed is the man whom God justifies,"
   then, according to the apostle, justification and forgiveness of sins
   are all one: but those propositions are equivalent, if the apostle cite
   the text out of the Psalms pertinently.

   2. That faith can, in no tolerable propriety of language, be said to be
   the instrument of our pardon, and consequently not of our
   justification. An instrument is something subordinate to the principal
   efficient cause, and made use of by it to produce the effect; and this,
   in natural and artificial causes, may be understood, but what notion to
   have of a moral instrument, I confess I am at a loss. But, to bring the
   business out of the clouds, we may thus conceive of the pardon of sin.
   God, in the gospel, hath entered into a covenant of grace and mercy
   with sinners; one of the benefits promised by God in the covenant, is
   pardon of sin. The conditions upon which we shall be made partakers of
   the benefit, are comprehended in this one word, faith, which signifies
   the whole of Christian religion, viz. such an effectual assent to the
   revelation of the gospel, as doth produce repentance, and sincere
   obedience, and a trust and confidence in Christ alone for salvation.
   The procuring or meritorious cause of this benefit, viz. the pardon of
   our sins, is the death of Christ, which is called his blood or
   sacrifice. The principal efficient cause of our pardon is God in the
   sentence of the law, or, which is all one, in the tenor of this
   covenant, declaring us pardoned upon these terms and conditions. Now
   how can faith, which is an act on our parts, and the condition to be
   performed by us, be said to be an instrument, in the hand of God, of
   our pardon; unless men will think fit to call a condition an
   instrument, which I think no propriety of language will allow?

   I shall now proceed to the third particular which I proposed, but shall
   refer that to my next discourse on this argument.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CCXXVI.

  OF JUSTIFYING FAITH.

   But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
   the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his
   name.--John xx. 31.

   THE observation lam discoursing upon is this that to believe that Jesus
   is the Christ, the Son of God, is truly and properly sanctifying, and
   justifying, and saving faith. I have entered upon the latter part of
   the observation, viz. to shew that this is truly and properly
   justifying and saving faith. In speaking to which, I proposed to shew
   six things:

   1. That justification, in Scripture, signifies no more but the pardon
   and remission of sins.

   2. That faith can in no propriety of language, be said to be the
   instrument of our pardon. Thus far I have gone, and now proceed to what
   remains, viz. to shew,

   3. That the influence which faith hath upon the pardon of sin, is this:
   that it is the whole and entire condition, required in the gospel, of
   our pardon, upon the performance of which God hath promised to pardon
   sin; which appears thus. All the conditions the gospel requires on our
   part in order to pardon, may be reduced to these four heads.

   (1.) An assent to the truth of the gospel.

   (2.) A trust and confidence in Christ as our only Saviour.

   (3.) Repentance from dead works.

   (4.) Sincere obedience and holiness of life. But I have already proved
   at large, that all these are comprehended in the New Testament notion
   of faith, which signifies the whole of Christian religion. And that
   repentance and obedience are conditions of our pardon, and consequently
   of our justification, appears from these texts, (Acts iii. 19.) "Repent
   therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out." Doth
   not this imply, that upon condition we do repent and be converted, God
   will pardon our sins? (1 John i. 9.) "If we confess our sins" (that is,
   with a resolution to leave them; as it is said elsewhere, "He that
   confesseth, and forsaketh his sins,) he is faithful and just to forgive
   us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (Matt. vi.
   14, 15.) "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
   will also forgive you; but if you forgive not men their trespasses,
   neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." And to the same
   purpose (Matt. xviii. 35.) "So likewise shall my heavenly Father do
   unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother
   their trespasses." (Luke vi. 37.) "Judge not, and ye shall not be
   judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye
   shall be forgiven." (Luke xi. 4.) "And forgive us our sins: for we also
   forgive every one that is indebted to us." Where doth the Scripture
   make any thing more plainly a condition of pardon, than it here does
   our forgiving of others? upon condition of the performance where of he
   promises to forgive us; and without which he threatens not to forgive
   us. I know not what a condition is, if it be not that which if we
   perform we shall receive the benefit promised; if we do not, we shall
   fall short of it.

   4. That the Scripture where it speaks of justification by faith, speaks
   of this faith, and no other, of such a faith as takes in the whole of
   Christian religion. The principal places where the Scripture designedly
   treats of justification by faith, are the 3d and 4th chapters of the
   Epistle to the Romans; the 2d and 3d to the Galatians; and the 2d of
   St. James. In the Romans and Galatians, St. Paul doth plainly oppose
   faith to the law, and the righteousness of it to the works of the law:
   and it will clearly appear to any one that will carefully read over
   these discourses of St. Paul's, that by faith is meant the dispensation
   of the gospel, and by the law the Mosaical administration; and the
   result of all those discourses is, that men are not justified by
   performing the works which the legal dispensation required; but by
   assenting and submitting to the revelation of the gospel. And this is
   agreeable to what he says, (Acts xiii. 38, 39.) "Through this man is
   preached unto you forgiveness of sins; and by him, all that believe are
   justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the
   law of Moses."

   It is true likewise, that the apostle, in the Epistle to the Romans,
   doth not only dispute against those who simply contended for
   justification by the legal dispensation: but were fallen also into the
   gross error and mistake, that they did merit justification and pardon
   at God's hand; which is impossible: for pardon is free, and of grace,
   or else it is not pardon. Therefore the apostle asserts, that we are so
   justified by faith, that neither our assent to the gospel, nor our
   obedience to the commands of it, do merit this at God's hands; for this
   would directly contradict justification by the faith of the gospel. For
   how can any man possibly think, that he merits pardon by his believing
   and obeying the gospel, when this is part of the gospel which we
   believe, that Christ died for our sins, and purchased our pardon at so
   dear a rate; which had been very unjust, if we ourselves could have
   done any thing to have merited it.

   And that faith is taken for the revelation of the gospel, in opposition
   to the legal administrations, will appear by considering these texts,
   (Gal. iii. 23.) "But before faith came, we were kept under the law;" by
   which the apostle plainly means this, that before the revelation of the
   gospel to the world, we were under the legal administration: for he
   adds afterwards, "We were shut up unto the faith that should afterward
   be revealed;" and what is "the faith that should afterward be revealed,
   but the gospel? which in the fulness of time was to be revealed to the
   world, till which time we were held under the dispensation of the law:
   and (ver. 24.) "Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
   Christ, that we might be justified by faith;" that is, the law was a
   discipline preparatory for the gospel, that when that came, we might
   .be justified by it: and (ver. 25.) "But after that faith is come, we
   are no longer under a schoolmaster," that is after the gospel was
   revealed, we were set free from the severe and harsh dispensation of
   the law; and our assent and submission to that revelation, is that
   whereby we are said to be justified, (Rom. iii. 22.) "Even the
   righteousness of God, which is by the faith of Jesus Christ," that is,
   by the gospel, "unto all, and upon all them that believe." And (ver.
   26.) "That he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth
   in Jesus;" ton ek pisteos Iesou, "the justifier of him" that yields
   assent and submission to the gospel of Christ. And this faith is said
   to be "imputed to us for righteousness," (chap. iv. 24.) "But for us
   also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up
   Jesus our Lord from the dead;" that is, if we assent and submit to the
   revelation of the gospel, which God hath confirmed by that eminent
   miracle of raising up Christ from the dead.

   St. James tells us most expressly, that the faith which justifies doth
   contain obedience in it: and if it do not, it is dead, and false, and
   ineffectual to all purposes of pardon and salvation: and that if any
   man pretend to faith, and that faith be destitute of the proper and
   genuine effects of true faith, it will be unprofitable to him, and not
   at all avail to his justification and salvation. The sum of his
   discourse is, that the faith which justifies and saves us, must not
   only be a bare assent of the understanding to the truths of the gospel:
   but must include in it obedience to all the commands of the gospel: and
   if it does not, it does no more deserve the name of faith, than good
   words to a man in want, deserve the name of charity: (chap. ii. ver.
   14-17. "What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath
   faith, and hath not works? can faith save him? If a brother or a sister
   be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them,
   Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them
   not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?
   Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. And to this
   purpose he instanceth in Abraham and Rahab, and shews that the faith
   which justified them, did include in it the effects of faith, viz.
   obedience and good works, (ver. 21, 22.) "Was not Abraham our father
   justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
   Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith
   made perfect?" And (ver. 23.) "And the Scripture was fulfilled, which
   saith Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
   righteousness." But if Abraham was "justified by works," viz. by
   offering up his son upon the altar, in obedience to God's command, as
   he says before, at the 21st verse, how was "the Scripture fulfilled,
   which saith, that faith was imputed to him for righteousness," that is,
   he was justified by faith; unless faith take in the works of obedience?
   From whence he concludes, "that by works a man is justified, and not by
   faith only;" not by a naked assent to the truth, but by such a faith as
   includes obedience; which he farther illustrates by a similitude at the
   last verse; "As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
   works is dead also." A living faith doth as truly contain obedience in
   it, as a living body contains a spirit.

   And those distinctions which are commonly applied to this discourse of
   St. James do not clear it, but contradict the express design of it.
   Some say that Fides quæ est viva justificat; sed non qua viva: Faith
   which is living, justifies; but not as a living faith. Others say,
   (which is much to the same purpose) Fides justificat sine operibus; sed
   fides sine operibus non justificat: "Faith justifies without works; but
   faith without works does not justify." But St. James says expressly,
   "that we are justified by works." How then is that true, that faith
   justifies without works?" And he says that works are the life of our
   faith. How then can any man say, that "though faith justifies, yet not
   as it is a living faith;" when we are justified by that which is the
   very life of our faith, and that is obedience?

   There are two other distinctions whereby men endeavour to elude this
   plain text, which I did not mention before; "that faith justifies the
   person; and works justify the faith," and that this is St. James's
   meaning. But what ground for this, when the text speaks expressly of
   the person being justified by works, as well as faith? "Was not Abraham
   our father justified by works?" (ver. 21.) "You see then that by works
   a man is justified: and not by faith only." (Ver. 24.) "Likewise also
   was not Rahab the harlot justified by works?" What colour is here for
   any man to say, that St. James doth not speak of the justification of
   the person by works; but of the faith? Or what necessity of framing
   this distinction, but only to serve an opinion? But at this rate a man
   may maintain any thing, though it be never so contrary to Scripture,
   and elude the clearest text in the Bible.

   The other distinction, which is much to the same sense, is, that the
   apostle doth not here speak of a real justification before God: but a
   declarative justification before men. But according to this, what sense
   can be made of (ver. 14.) "What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man
   say, I have faith, and have not works? Can faith save him?" That is,
   according to this explication, Can faith without works save him before
   men?

   And this doth not contradict St. Paul, who saith, (Gal. ii. 16.) that
   "a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of
   Jesus Christ." For how does this, that we are justified not by the
   legal dispensation, but by the faith of the gospel, which includes
   obedience and good works, contradict what St. James says, that we are
   not justified by a bare assent to the truth of the gospel, but by
   obedience to the commands of it? And I do not see that upon the
   contrary supposition, viz. that the faith of the gospel doth not
   include obedience in it, it is possible to reconcile these two
   apostles. Suppose this was St. Paul's meaning, that "we are justified
   by faith," as the only condition and instrument, call it what they
   will, of our justification; but not by obedience or good works, as a
   condition of our justification; by what kind of comment can St. James's
   words be brought to this sense? What man would allow that those words
   at the 21st verse, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when
   he offered Isaac his son upon the altar," should be explained by this
   sense? Was not Abraham, when in obedience to God's command he had
   offered his son upon the altar, and upon this act of obedience was
   justified, was not he justified by faith only, and not by any work or
   act of obedience? Or that those words at the 24th verse, "Ye see then
   that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only," should be
   interpreted, Ye see then that by faith only a man is justified, and not
   by works? and unless they be thus interpreted, they are not to be
   reconciled with the sense of St. Paul's words, which many fasten upon
   them: but if St. Paul's words be taken in the most plain and obvious
   sense they are capable of, viz. that "we are not justified by the works
   of the law," that is, by performing the works required by the legal
   dispensation; "but by the faith of Jesus Christ," that is, by assenting
   and submitting to the revelation of the gospel; we do not strain St.
   James's words, to reconcile him with St. Paul.

   And thus I have shewn, that where the Scripture speaks of justification
   by faith, it speaks of this faith which I have described. I add, and of
   no other; not of a bare appropriation of the grace and mercy of the
   gospel; that is, in plain English, this is not justifying faith, to
   believe that I am pardoned, and justified, nor to have a firm assurance
   of this. For if we be justified by faith, we must believe be fore we
   can be justified; but if this be justifying faith to believe, or be
   assured we are justified, we must be justified before we believe; or
   else, when we believe that we are justified, we must believe that which
   is not true. Nor is this justifying faith, to lay hold of the
   righteousness and merits of Christ for the pardon of our sins; that is,
   to trust and confide only in that, as the meritorious cause of our
   pardon. For though this be part of the notion of justifying faith, it
   is not all; though this be one of the terms or conditions upon which we
   are justified; yet it is not the whole and entire condition; which,
   besides this, takes in an assent to the whole gospel, repentance from
   dead works, and obedience to all the precepts of the gospel. And if any
   man can produce any one text which saith, that the faith which
   justifies* consists only in a trust and confidence in the merits of
   Christ, for the pardon of sin, or any thing to this effect, I will be
   most ready publicly to acknowledge my error: but if nobody can do this,
   I shall beg their pardon, if I do continue still of the same mind I
   was.

   I have now done with the fourth thing I propounded: but before I speak
   to the two heads which remain, I must remove an objection or two, that
   my former discourse may seem liable to.

   Objection first, To make obedience a condition of pardon seems to take
   away the freeness of God's grace in pardoning sinners.

   1. God's grace in pardoning a sinner is said to be free, not because it
   is not suspended upon any condition; for the Scripture tells us
   plainly, that it is upon the condition of faith, and repentance, and
   forgiving others, and the like; but it is free, be cause God was
   pleased freely to give his Son to die for our sins, and to accept of
   his sacrifice for the expiation of them, and to impose easy and
   reasonable conditions upon us, in order to our enjoying of this
   benefit; and upon such conditions, though they have nothing of virtue
   or merit, of any natural or moral efficacy, or deserve, or procure such
   a benefit as the pardon of our sins, for the sake of his Son, whom he
   gave to be a ransom for us, to receive us to grace and mercy; and I
   think this abundantly enough to make our justification very gracious
   and free, though not absolutely free from all condition.

   Our salvation is said in Scripture to be as free as our justification:
   we are said to be "saved by grace," as well as "justified freely by his
   grace." But will any man say, that we are saved without any conditions,
   who reads these texts? "He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting
   life; but he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life." "Blessed
   are the poor in heart: for they shall see God." "Except ye repent, ye
   shall all likewise perish." "If ye walk after the flesh, ye shall die:
   but if through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the flesh, ye shall
   live." "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord." So that he who can
   understand how we may be saved by grace, though our salvation be
   suspended upon the condition of faith, repentance, and holiness, and
   obedience of life, may, if he please, under stand how we may be
   justified freely by God's grace, though it be upon the same conditions.
   So that if men were not monstrously perverse, it is impossible that
   they should not see the weakness of this objection.

   Objection the second, This is the doctrine of the papists, that
   obedience and good works are a condition of our justification.

   Answ. 1. I am for the doctrine which is evidently contained in
   Scripture, whoever hold it. A man ought not to be frighted out of the
   truth by any name.

   2. But there is a wide difference between the doctrine of the papists
   about justification, and this doctrine. They say, that obedience and
   good works are not only a condition of our justification, but a
   meritorious cause of it; which I abhor as much as any one. It is the
   doctrine of merit that the protestants chiefly oppose in the matter of
   justification; and if some also oppose the papists about good works
   being a condition, I know nobody that thinks himself obliged to hold
   every opinion that any protestant hath maintained against the papists;
   and the like I say to the objection of Socinianism and Arminianism, and
   a hundred names more, if people think fit to fasten them upon it.

   And now I might compare this doctrine with the contrary. All that may
   be said against it is, that it diminisheth the grace of God: but that I
   have shewn it doth not: but then it hath these advantages. It is, so
   far as I can judge, (and mine own judgment must govern me) much more
   plainly contained in the Scripture, and it is a doctrine more
   "according to godliness;" it tends more to quicken men to obedience and
   a holy life, to believe that they cannot have their sins otherwise
   pardoned, than to believe that they may have their sins pardoned with
   out obedience and a holy life; and if obedience be not a necessary
   condition of pardon, it is plain that men may be pardoned without it.
   For example, if a man promise me a thousand pounds, only upon this
   condition, that I will believe him and trust him, but without any
   condition of doing what he shall command me, and he shall declare thus
   much to me; if I can trust this man's word, I need not doubt but I
   shall have the sum promised; though I should disobey him in every thing
   that he commanded me to do: this is just the case; and if it be, it is
   no wonder that men are so loth to disbelieve this pleasant opinion,
   which gives men comfortable hopes of the pardon of their sins, upon
   such easy terms. Not that I am so uncharitable as not to acknowledge
   that our worthy and excellent divines, who have been of this judgment,
   have always pressed the necessity of holiness and obedience; but I am
   sorry they could not do it with so good advantage, according to their
   principles, the natural consequences of them tending to licentiousness,
   and a neglect of the precepts of the gospel; to which purpose they have
   been sadly abused by several libertines in these and former times, ever
   since Luther's days, and I could never yet see how antinomianism could
   solidly be confuted upon those principles.

   5. That no metaphorical descriptions of justifying faith are allowable
   any farther than as they serve to illustrate the plain, and proper, and
   simple notion of faith. My meaning is, he that would teach men what
   faith is, he must first acquaint men with the thing, and describe it in
   as proper and simple words as can be, and not by figurative and
   metaphorical phrases. Indeed, after a man hath delivered the simple
   notion of a thing in proper words, he may afterwards illustrate it by
   metaphors: but then these are not to be insisted upon, and strained to
   the utmost extent of the metaphor, beyond what the true notion of the
   thing will bear; for if consequences once come to be drawn from
   metaphors, and doctrines founded, and theories built upon them, instead
   of illustrating the thing, they blind and obscure it, and serve to no
   other purpose, but to seduce and mislead the understandings of men, and
   to multiply controversies without end; and (as I told you before) I do
   the rather take notice of this abuse of metaphors upon this subject,
   because I do not know any other head of divinity which hath suffered so
   much by them, as the doctrine of justifying faith, whereby the plain
   truth hath been very much darkened, and occasion ministered to many
   endless disputes. But this will best appear by some particular
   instances. Justifying faith hath usually been described by these
   metaphors, resting, and relying, and leaning upon Christ, apprehending
   and laying hold, and applying of Christ, receiving of Christ, and
   coming to him. Now concerning these, I shall briefly speak these three
   or four things:

   (1.) That none of these metaphors, except the two last, receiving of
   Christ, and coming to him, are any where used in Scripture, to describe
   justifying faith by; and therefore there is no reason why they should
   be so much used and insisted on. Let any man shew me where justifying
   faith is any where in Scripture described by resting, and relying, and
   leaning upon Christ, by apprehending, and laying hold, and applying of
   him.

   (2.) If these metaphors were explained and turned into proper and plain
   words, they can signify no thing else, but that faith which I have been
   all this while describing. For what can any man understand by resting,
   and relying, and leaning upon Christ, but to trust in him, as the
   author of our eternal salvation, under which word all the benefits
   which Christ hath purchased for us are comprehended? Now can any man be
   said to trust in Christ, as the author of his salvation, otherwise than
   by assenting to the truth of the gospel, and complying with the terms
   and conditions of it? And what can any man understand by apprehending,
   and laying hold on, and applying Christ, other than this, to make use
   of him for all those ends and purposes for which God hath appointed
   him? And what those are the Scripture tells us: that "he is made unto
   us of God, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
   redemption."

   (3.) As for those Scripture metaphors of receiving Christ, and coming
   to him, the Scripture useth them but sparingly, and I dare say, for
   once that it useth these metaphors, it doth twenty times describe faith
   by plain and proper words; and where it doth make use of these
   metaphors, it doth sufficiently explain them. So you find coming to
   Christ is explained by learning of him: (Matt. xi. 28, 29.) "Come unto
   me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
   Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and lowly in
   heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls." That is, Come to me as
   scholars and disciples to be taught by me; in order to which it is
   requisite we should believe him. Oportet discentem credere, "He that
   will learn, must believe him that teacheth him," and trust his skill.
   And so for receiving him, lest the metaphor should seduce men, St. John
   had no sooner used it, but he tells what he means by it. (John i. 12.)
   "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons
   of God, even to them that believe on his name;" that is, believed him
   to be the person promised to be the Messias, and Saviour of the world;
   as appears by the opposition in the verse before: "He came to his own,
   and his own received him not;" that is, rejected him, did not own him
   to be the true Messias. But now if we will strain such a metaphor as
   this, beyond the intention of it, and be cause believing is called a
   receiving of Christ, and we receive things with the hand, and the hand
   is an instrument, will from hence infer, that faith is an instrument of
   our justification; what may not men make of the Scripture at this rate?

   (4.) I will add this concerning Scripture metaphors in general, that
   where the Scripture useth metaphors which were very familiar in those
   languages in which the Scripture was written, and well understood by
   those who spoke that language, but are very obscure and uncouth to us,
   and not at all used in our language, as most of the Scripture metaphors
   are, the proper work of a minister is not to insist in such cases upon
   Scripture metaphors, to darken his discourse by them, but to explain
   them, and make them intelligible, to translate them into English, and
   instead of them, to use such phrases as people are more familiarly
   acquainted with, and are used in our own language. For a man may be a
   barbarian that speaks to people in unknown phrases and metaphors, as
   well as "he that speaks in an unknown tongue;" and the very same reason
   that obligeth us to put the Scripture into a known language, doth
   oblige men to explain the doctrines contained in it by such phrases and
   metaphors as are known and used in that language.

   6. That if this plain and simple notion of justifying faith were
   admitted, it would supersede all those controversies about
   justification, which have so much troubled the reformed churches. Those
   who have been curious to inquire into these matters, have reckoned up
   at least twenty several opinions among the protestants concerning
   justifying faith. I do not desire to acquaint myself with those
   differences; he that would know what justification and justifying faith
   are, shall sooner come to understand the nature of them, by diligent
   reading of the Scriptures, than by reading over all the controversial
   writings of divines about them; and if men would but content themselves
   with those plain and simple descriptions, which the Scripture gives us
   of faith, there could not be any great difference about it; this would
   cut off most of those disputes which have been commenced upon
   metaphors, and figurative speeches. And here I had thought to have
   descended to a particular consideration of the controversies about
   justifying faith, but I am weary of the work; and therefore shall only
   make some brief reflections upon this whole discourse, and then apply
   it to our own use; but this, God willing, the next opportunity.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CCXXVII.

  THE CONDITION OF THE GOSPEL-COVENANT, AND THE MERIT OF CHRIST, CONSISTENT.

   But these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ
   the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his
   name.--John xx. 31.

   I HAVE in my former discourses on these words, treated largely of the
   nature of Christian faith; particularly as it sanctifies, justifies,
   and saves men. All that I farther propose is, to make some reflections
   upon this whole discourse, particularly that which relates to
   justifying faith, and then apply all to our own use.

   I have already taken notice of two objections, to which my discourse
   may seem liable; and if there yet remain any prejudice upon any man's
   spirit against this doctrine, I would desire such calmly to consider
   it, and the agreeableness of it, not to the opinions of men, but to the
   word of God, and the suitableness of it to the great design of
   Christian religion, every where expressed in the gospel, which is to
   bring men to holiness and obedience. And what argument and
   consideration can be more powerful to take men off from sin, and to
   excite them to the practice of holiness, than this, that repentance and
   obedience are an indispensable condition of our justification and
   pardon? And this is the very point in difference, whether the gospel do
   not make repentance and obedience the conditions of our pardon and
   justification, as well as an assent to the truth of the gospel, and a
   trust in Christ as the meritorious cause of our salvation. That they
   are, I have endeavoured to prove from Scripture; and, for the farther
   clearing of it, I desire that the nature of the gospel covenant may be
   well considered, which I take to be this. On God's part, there are
   certain benefits promised, justification and pardon of sin, and eternal
   life and salvation. On our part there are certain conditions required
   before we can be made partakers of those benefits; these are, to assent
   to the truth of the gospel, trusting in Christ as our only Saviour,
   repentance from dead works, and a sincere purpose and resolution of
   obedience, and a holy life; these make up the whole and entire
   condition of the gospel, and are often expressed by this one word,
   faith, which signifies the whole duty of a Christian; be cause he that
   truly believes the gospel, will do what ever the gospel requires. And
   hence it is, that to be a Christian, and to be a believer, are in the
   phrase of the New Testament all one. Now the matter in controversy is
   plainly this; whether this whole condition be required of us in order
   to our pardon and justification, as well as in order to our salvation.
   That repentance, and obedience, and holiness of life, are conditions of
   our salvation, I think, is universally agreed; I am sure it is clearly
   expressed in these two texts--"Christ is the author of eternal
   salvation to them that, obey him;" (Heb. v. 9.) "Without holiness no
   man shall see the Lord;" (Heb. xii. 14.) And that the conditions of our
   justification and salvation are the same, I think is every whit as
   clear, both from Scripture, and from the general acknowledgment of
   divines, by necessary consequence. From Scripture: St. James says, that
   the same thing that justifies us, saves us; for when he disputes,
   whether we are justified by faith only, or by faith and works, he hath
   this expression, "What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he
   hath faith, and have not works; can faith save him?" From whence the
   inference is plain, that upon the very same condition that we are
   justified, we are saved. And it is evident, by necessary consequence,
   from the general acknowledgment of divines; for I think this is
   universally agreed by divines, that whatever puts a man into a state of
   justification and pardon, puts a man into a state of salvation; and if
   this be true, it necessarily follows, that the conditions of our
   justification and salvation are the same: and if assent to the truth of
   the gospel, and trust in Christ as our only Saviour, be the only
   conditions of our justification, then they are the only conditions of
   our salvation; and repentance and obedience are not conditions of our
   salvation: but if they be conditions of our salvation, then they are of
   our justification. And I will be bold to say, that this hath as much of
   demonstration in it, as any thing in divinity is capable of; and I
   wonder extremely how any man that considers the nature of the gospel
   covenant, can imagine that we should be made partakers of any blessing
   or benefit promised in the covenant, without performing the whole
   condition of the covenant.

   And now, if any man ask, Cui bono? To what end is all this? Suppose it
   be true, to what purpose is it to awaken differences, and stir up
   controversies about these matters? In order to these two ends, which I
   take to be very considerable.

   1. That we may be able to answer the papists, who charge us with
   solifidianism: as if we were of this opinion--that if a man do but
   trust in Christ, that is, be but confidently persuaded that he will
   save him and pardon him, this is sufficient; and consequently, he that
   is thus persuaded, need not take any farther care of his salvation, but
   may live as he list: and I do not see how this can be avoided;
   especially if this be true, which our divines universally assert, that
   whatever puts a man into a justified state, puts him into a state of
   salvation; I say, I do not see how this charge can be avoided, unless
   we own holiness and obedience to be conditions of our justification, as
   well as trust in Christ. I know no other middle way between popery and
   antinomianism. But,

   2. Which is more considerable, Without this we can give no satisfactory
   and reasonable account of our religion to a heathen. Suppose a heathen
   should say thus; Your religion gives a very good account of the
   corruption and sinfulness of man kind, and hath provided a very
   probable remedy for the expiation of it, by the death of the Son of
   God: but this seems to me very unreasonable, and to contradict the most
   natural notions that we have of God's justice and holiness, that he
   should pardon men, as you say he does, though they do not repent of
   their sins, nor are resolved to leave them, nay, though they be
   resolved to go on in a wicked course. Did ever any wise prince pardon a
   traitor upon these terms? But whoever says that repentance, and a
   sincere purpose and resolution of obedience are not the condition of
   our pardon, says, that God will pardon men without repentance, though
   they are not at all sorry for what they have done, nor resolved to
   change their course: for that is a condition without which a thing
   cannot be; and if repentance be not a condition of pardon, a man may be
   pardoned without it. And if this be true, Christianity is the most lewd
   and senseless doctrine in the world. For what can be a greater
   encouragement to sin than this, to tell men that they may be pardoned
   without repentance? That is, though they live in sin, and continue so
   to do. Paganism never taught any such thing. Nay, they may add farther,
   that this which you teach as the doctrine of your religion, seems
   expressly contrary to your own books, which you say contain your
   religion. Does not the Bible say, that "he that confesseth and
   forsaketh his sin shall find mercy?" And doth not this plainly imply,
   that repentance is a condition of pardon? "Let the wicked forsake his
   way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the
   Lord, and he will have mercy upon him: and to our God, for he will
   abundantly pardon." Doth it not say, that "if you forgive not men their
   trespasses, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you?" Can any
   words more plainly express a condition than these do?--How should we be
   able to defend our religion against such an assault, unless we disclaim
   this charge, and tell them plainly, and without a distinction, that our
   religion teacheth that repentance, and resolution of holiness, and
   obedience, are conditions of our pardon and justification? I would to
   God men would consult the honour of Christianity, and when they hold
   any opinion, they would not consider the interest of a party, but the
   universal concernment of the Christian religion! If we had to deal with
   subtle heathens, as the primitive fathers of the church had, we should
   see a necessity of laying aside such unreasonable opinions. I would
   fain have any man shew any one clear passage out of any of the ancient
   fathers and writers concerning Christian religion, which says, that
   trust in Christ for salvation is the only condition of our
   justification, and that repentance and obedience are not; or that
   explains justification by faith alone, in this sense. I know it is
   usually said, the ancient fathers and Christians were ignorant of the
   doctrine of justification in a great measure, and knew very little of
   the mystery of the gospel. I know not what they mean by mystery, but I
   am sure they defined Christian religion better, and gave a more
   reasonable and satisfactory account of it, than any of those do who are
   so apt to slight them.

   The use of this doctrine is as follows:

   First, To persuade men to place all their hope and confidence of
   salvation in Jesus Christ, the Son of God; that is, to believe that
   through the alone merit of his death and sufferings, God is reconciled
   to us, and that only upon the account of the satisfaction which he hath
   made to Divine justice, we are restored to the favour of God, and our
   sins are pardoned to us, and we have a title to eternal life. Not but
   that there are conditions required on our part, to make us capable of
   these benefits, faith and repentance, and sincere obedience and
   holiness of life, without which we shall never be made partakers of
   them: but that the satisfaction of Christ is the only meritorious cause
   of these blessings. And to persuade men to the belief of this, I shall
   endeavour to satisfy them of these two things:

   I. That Christ hath properly merited these blessings for us.

   II. That he only hath done it. The first of these propositions is
   directly levelled against the Socinians: the second against the
   papists. I shall speak but briefly of them.

   I. That Christ hath properly merited these blessings for us: and this
   being purely matter of revelation, we are to rely upon Scripture only
   for the proof of it. (Matt. xx. 28.) "The Son of man came not to be
   ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for
   many," lutron anti pollon, "a price of redemption, "instead of that
   which should have been paid by us. (John vi. 51.) "And the bread which
   I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
   (John x. 11.) Christ is called "the good shepherd that lays down his
   life for his sheep." (John xv. 12, 13.) "This is my commandment, that
   ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than
   this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." (Matt. xxvi. 28.)
   "For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many, for
   the remission of sins." (Rom. v. 6.) "For when we were yet without
   strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." (1 Cor. xv. 3.)
   "For I delivered unto you first of all, that which I also received, how
   that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures." (2 Cor. v.
   14, 15.) "For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus
   judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died
   for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto
   themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again." (Eph. i.
   7.) "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of
   sins according to the riches of his grace." (Col . i. 20 22.) "And
   (having made peace through the blood of his cross) by him to reconcile
   all things unto him self; by him, I say, whether they be things in
   earth, or things in heaven. And you that were sometime alienated, and
   enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in
   the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
   unblamable, and unreprovable in his sight." (1 Thess. v. 9, 10.) "For
   God hath not appointed us to wrath; but to obtain salvation by our Lord
   Jesus Christ, who died for us." (Heb. ii. 9.) "That he by the grace of
   God should taste death for every man." (Heb. ix. 11-15.) "But Christ
   being come a high-priest of good things to come, by a greater and more
   perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this
   building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own
   blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
   redemption for us. For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the
   ashes of an heifer, sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the
   purifying of the flesh; how much more shall the blood of Christ, who
   through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge
   your conscience from dead works, to serve the living God? And for this
   cause he is the Mediator of the new testament, that by means of death,
   for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first
   testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal
   inheritance." And, (ver. 25-28.) "Nor yet that he should offer himself
   often, as the high-priest entereth into the holy place every year with
   blood of others: for then must he often have suffered since the
   foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world, hath he
   appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is
   appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: so Christ
   was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for
   him, shall he appear the second time, without sin, unto salvation."
   (Heb. x. 11, 12.) "And every priest standeth daily ministering and
   offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away
   sins: but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins, for
   ever sat down on the right hand of God." (1 Pet. i. 18, 19.) "Forasmuch
   as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver
   and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your
   fathers: but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot." (1 Pet. ii. 21. 24.) "Because Christ also
   suffered for ns; who his own self bare our sins, in his own body, on
   the tree." (1 Pet. iii. 18.) "For Christ also hath once suffered for
   sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God." (1 John
   ii. 1, 2.) "My little children, these things write I unto you, that you
   sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not
   for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." (1 John iii.
   16.) "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life
   for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren." (1 John
   iv. 10.) "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
   and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins." (Rev. i. 5.)
   "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins by his own blood."
   (Rev. v. 9.) "Thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood,
   out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation." From these
   and many other texts, it seems to be very plain and evident, that
   Christ died for our sins, and suffered in our stead, and by the
   sacrifice of himself has made an atonement for us, and reconciled us to
   God, and hath paid a price and ransom for us, and by the merit of his
   death hath purchased for us forgiveness of sins, and "inheritance among
   them that are sanctified." And I do not know any doctrine of our
   religion, that is founded and established upon more and plainer texts,
   which cannot be understood in any other sense, without offering great
   violence to the first and most obvious meaning of them.

   I know the Socinians have framed evasions to all these texts, which I
   have not time now to produce and examine; nor would it be worth the
   while. I shall only say this to them in general; that there is no
   principle of religion so plainly laid down in the whole Scripture, but
   may be overthrown by the same or the like evasions. Suppose Christ had
   died in our stead, and made satisfaction for sin, and God had intended
   to declare so much to us; in what plainer and more express and proper
   words could he have done it, than the Scripture hath already done? If
   God had said in the Scripture expressly that "Christ had died in our
   place and stead, and had satisfied for our sins;" these very
   expressions, by the same arts of interpretation, might have been
   strained and wrested to some other sense. So that if God did not intend
   to express to us by these texts, that "Christ satisfied for the sins of
   men;" yet they are so obvious to be interpreted to that sense, and so
   hardly, if at all, capable of any other, that we cannot imagine,
   without a great reflection upon the wisdom of God, that he should
   deliver his mind to men in words and expressions so exceedingly liable
   to a quite different sense from what he intended. Besides that there is
   nothing more unreasonable than to deny that to be the meaning of
   Scripture, which if it had been the meaning could not have been
   expressed in plainer and more advantageous words; especially when this
   is done, not in one or two texts, but very many; and not by one form of
   expression, but several, and all inclining to the same sense; and,
   which is worst of all, this violence is offered to Scripture in a
   matter which does neither contradict other texts, nor the reason of
   mankind, viz. that one man should suffer in another's stead, and make
   satisfaction for the crimes and faults which another hath committed;
   sup posing the party offended be willing to accept of the commutation,
   and the party that suffers in another's stead do voluntarily do it.

   II. That Christ only hath merited these blessings for us, and that he
   had no partner with him in this; or there is no other hath merited
   these blessings for us, nor can we ourselves merit them.

   1. No other hath merited these blessings for us. Not to take notice of
   what the papists say, of the meritoriousness of our works of
   supererogation, which go into the treasury of the church, and make up a
   public stock of merit, to be disposed and dealt out by the pope at his
   discretion; they have by a most unparalleled blasphemy joined the
   Virgin Mary with Christ in the work of our redemption; and some of them
   have been so impiously bold, as to parallel the virtue of her milk with
   the efficacy of Christ's blood. And though Christ say, "that he trod
   the wine-press of his Father's wrath alone, and of the people there was
   none with him;" yet Bonaventure in his meditations ventures to corrupt
   the text by this foolish gloss, Nullus erat tecum. Recte, Domine, sed
   erat tecum femina; "Right, Lord, there was no man with thee, but there
   was a woman, viz. thy mother."

   2. Nor can we ourselves do any thing whereby we can merit these
   blessings at God's hand. Considering that we received our being, and
   all that we are and have from God, and upon account of these benefits
   are obliged to love him and serve him to the utmost; what a senseless
   piece of arrogance is it to say, that a creature can merit any thing at
   God's hand? Whatever we give God is of his own, and when we have done
   all we can, we have done no more than our duty. And can any man
   challenge a reward for doing what he ought to do? Can any man make
   satisfaction for a fault that he hath committed, by doing his duty,
   that is, by not committing an other? It is a sure rule, debitum debito
   non solvitur. We are indebted to God by the breach of his law: but we
   cannot quit this debt, and satisfy for this breach, by not breaking it
   again, because we owe to God all possible obedience.

   Besides that all our obedience is imperfect, and is so far from
   meriting, that it stands in need of pardon; and can a man demerit and
   merit by the same action! Can he who deserves to be punished for an
   action, because he did it no better, deserve to be rewarded for the
   same action, because he did it so well? And to say that Christ hath
   merited that our imperfect obedience should merit, either signifies
   only this, that Christ hath merited that our imperfect obedience should
   be accepted by God, notwithstanding its imperfection (and this is true,
   but no thing to the purpose of merit); or else it signifies, that
   Christ hath merited that that which is no wise meritorious, should be
   so; that is, that the nature of things should be altered; which is not
   only false, but senseless.

   Secondly, To persuade us to live as we believe. If we profess to
   believe the gospel to be true, then let our hearts and lives be
   suitable to those truths which we believe. If we believe Jesus to be
   the Christ, the Son of God, we believe the doctrine which he delivered
   to the world to be from God, and consequently to be true; we believe
   the precepts of it are holy, and just, and good, and that they are
   necessary to be observed by us, as being in order to our peace and
   happiness; we believe that the promises of the gospel are "all yea, and
   amen," and shall every tittle of them be made good; we believe that the
   threatenings of the gospel shall all punctually be fulfilled. Now how
   ought men to live, that believe all this? Having a law given us which
   hath the sanction of such promises and threatenings, ought we not to
   conform our lives to it; and charge ourselves with obedience to all
   those precepts of piety towards God, and purity and temperance in the
   government of ourselves, and justice and righteousness in our dealings
   with others, which are contained in this new law of the gospel? If the
   gospel hath promised eternal life and happiness to those who do
   conscientiously abstain from sin, and follow holiness; having these
   promises, ought we not "to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness both
   of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God?" If the
   gospel hath threatened, that at the end of the world, Christ will "come
   in flaming fire," &c. if we believe these things shall be, "what manner
   of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness?"

   I have formerly shewed at large, how unbecoming it is for any man that
   professeth himself a Christian, to live unsuitable to his profession,
   that it is the greatest disparagement to the gospel, and the highest
   reflection upon it that can be; and that it is infinitely dangerous to
   us; and though these be very proper considerations, yet, because I have
   formerly urged them, I shall not now enforce my exhortation with these
   arguments; but shall mention two other considerations, and so conclude.

   First, If our lives be not answerable to our belief, our faith will be
   ineffectual to all intents and purposes.

   Secondly, A life unsuitable to our belief, is the high way to
   infidelity and atheism.

   First, If our lives be not answerable to our belief, our faith will be
   ineffectual to all real intents and purposes.

   1. It will be ineffectual to give us the reputation of Christians among
   wise and discerning persons. We profess to believe the gospel; but if
   we live contrary to it, our profession is protestatio contra factum,
   and therefore not credible; because our actions contradict it. The
   constant tenor of a man's actions is a more credible and emphatical
   declaration of the inward sense of his heart, and shews better what the
   man believes, than the most solemn profession in words. When our words
   are not confirmed by our actions, they are but an empty sound, and
   signify nothing. I may allude to that of St. Paul, (1 Cor. xiii. 2.)
   "Though a man have all faith," yet, if he be destitute of the true
   effect of faith, "charity, he is but as a sounding brass, and a
   tinkling cymbal." St. James doth very well set forth the inefficacy of
   such a faith, by this similitude, (James ii. 15-17.) "If a brother or
   sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto
   them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye
   give them not those things which are needful to the body, what doth it
   profit? even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead." Men are not so
   easily cozened as we think they are. Discerning men will not be imposed
   upon, and put off with a formal and empty profession of faith, when
   there is nothing in our lives to answer it. It is not standing up in
   the church, and professing that we believe in God, and in Jesus Christ,
   that he was born, and died, and rose again, and at the end of the world
   will come to judge the quick and the dead, that will persuade men that
   we are Christians. Men will look into our lives, and examine our
   actions, and inquire into our conversations: by these they will judge
   of the truth and reality of our profession. Let us not delude
   ourselves, and think to pass for Christians upon these terms, among any
   that know how to make a true judgment of things. We may cozen
   ourselves; but we cannot cheat others, who are not so partial to us as
   we are apt to be to ourselves. It is not our winking that hinders
   others from seeing us.

   Nay, I go farther, it is not an earnest contending for fundamental
   articles of our Christian faith, if we live contrary to them, that will
   satisfy any wise man that we believe them; much less an intemperate
   zeal for indifferent opinions in religion. Such were the doctrines
   concerning the necessity on the one hand, and the unlawfulness of
   circumcision on the other; but the assent to the one opinion or the
   other in these matters, "neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor
   uncircumcision, but faith that worketh by love, the new creature, the
   keeping of the commandments of God," as the apostle in several places
   expresseth it. Men stand much upon the title of orthodox, by which is
   usually understood, not believing the doctrine of Christ or his
   apostles, but such opinions as are in vogue among such a party, such
   systems of divinity as have been compiled in haste by those whom we
   have in admiration; and whatever is not consonant to these little
   bodies of divinity, though possibly it agree well enough with the word
   of God, is error and heresy; and whoever maintains it, can hardly pass
   for a Christian among some angry and perverse people. I do not intend
   to plead for any error; but I would not have Christianity chiefly
   measured by matters of opinion. I know no such error and heresy as a
   wicked life. That man believes the gospel best, who lives most
   according to it. Though no man can have a worse opinion of the Socinian
   doctrine than I have, yet I had rather a man should deny the
   satisfaction of Christ, than believe it, and abuse it to the
   encouragement of sin. Of the two I have more hopes of him that denies
   the divinity of Christ, and lives otherwise soberly, and righteously,
   and godly in the world, than of the man who owns Christ to be the Son
   of God, and lives like a child of the devil.

   2. Such a faith as hath not an answerable life, will be ineffectual to
   the purpose of justification and salvation. St. James tells us, it is u
   a dead faith, and profits nothing," that no man is justified by it, nor
   will it save any man. Christ is the author of eternal salvation to them
   who so believe his doctrine as to obey it. He will come in flaming
   fire, to render vengeance not only to them that do not believe, but to
   them that do not obey the gospel. It will not be sufficient at the day
   of judgment, to plead our profession of faith in Christ, and to say,
   "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have
   cast out devils, and in thy name have done many wondrous works?" Doing
   all this in Christ's name, implies that they profess to believe in him:
   but notwithstanding all this, if they be "workers of iniquity/ Christ
   will say to such, "Depart from me, I know you not." If our Saviour
   makes a true and proper representation of the day of judgment, and the
   proceedings of it, (Matt. xxv.) men's faith shall then be tried by the
   real fruits and effects of it; then the inquiry shall be, how men have
   lived; what good they have done, or omitted and neglected? and
   accordingly sentence will be passed upon them. Nay, such a faith is so
   far from saving, that it will be an aggravation of our condemnation,
   and sink us the deeper into hell. "There is one that condemneth you,
   even Jesus in whom ye trust."

   Secondly, A life unsuitable to our belief is the high way to infidelity
   and atheism, to bring others and ourselves to it.

   1. To bring others to infidelity and atheism, and to confirm them in
   it. What can be a more effectual bar to keep heathens, and Jews, and
   Turks, from entertaining the gospel? What can be a greater confirmation
   of them in their infidelity, than so to misrepresent Christian religion
   to them, as we do by our unsuitable lives? What can be a stronger
   prejudice against it, to men who do not look narrowly into it, but only
   see it at a distance, than to see what fruit it produces in the lives
   of Christians? May they not invert that proverbial speech of our
   Saviour's, "Does a vine send forth thorns?" If Christianity were such a
   holy institution, how conies it to pass that Christians are so wicked?
   If Jesus Christ were so excellent a master, we should see it in his
   scholars; Si Christus sancta docuisset. Christiani sancte vixissent, as
   Salvian speaks. And it is the way to bring men to atheism. What more
   likely to take a man off from all religion, than to see the religion
   which pretends to be the best in the world, represented by the lives of
   Christians at such a disadvantage, as if it were a barren and fruitless
   and ineffectual thing, and as if they who profess it, did believe it to
   be a lie, and gave no credit at all to the doctrines of it?

   2. It is the way to bring ourselves to infidelity and atheism. As an
   erroneous judgment and understanding hath usually an evil influence
   upon men's lives, so much more a vicious and corrupt life hath a bad
   influence upon men's understandings. It is so uneasy a thing for men to
   act contrary to their reason, and against the dictates of their under
   standings, that men for their own quiet, and in their own defence, will
   bend their judgments, and make them comply with the interest of their
   lusts. Men's affections, which way soever they incline, set a bias upon
   their understandings; and this doth not only proceed from the nature of
   the thing, but from the just judgment of God: (2 Thess. ii. 10-12.) the
   apostle tells us, "that those who receive not the truth in the love of
   it, that they may be saved; God will send them strong delusions, to
   believe lies; that they all may be damned, who believe not the truth,
   but have pleasure in unrighteousness." If men once "have pleasure in
   unrighteousness," it will not be long before they give over "believing
   the truth," because God by his just judgment will give them over to
   themselves, to follow the bias of their own corrupt hearts, which
   incline them to believe lies. Of all persons in the world, a wicked and
   unholy Christian is most likely to turn a speculative infidel and
   atheist; and none so likely to fall into this gross darkness, as those
   who resist and quench so great a light as that of the gospel is, which
   they profess to believe.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CCXXVIII.

  OF THE MIRACLES WROUGHT IN CONFIRMATION OF CHRISTIANITY.

   God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders and with
   divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own
   will.--Heb. ii. 4.

   WHOEVER impartially considers the Christian religion, cannot but
   acknowledge the laws and precepts of it to be so reasonable; and the
   practice of them so evidently to tend not only to the happiness of
   particular persons, but to the peace and welfare of the world; and the
   promises and threatenings of the gospel, which are the great motives to
   persuade men to the obedience of those laws, to be so agreeable to the
   natural hopes and fears which mankind were always possessed withal;
   that upon this consideration, it might justly be expected, that the
   doctrine of Christianity, upon the first publication of it, should have
   been entertained with a readiness of mind proportionable to the
   reasonableness of it.

   Or if the bare reasonableness of it be not thought inducement enough,
   we may easily imagine, how God, if he had pleased, could, upon the
   first appearance of this religion in the world, have given it such
   advantages, as would mightily have contributed to the more easy
   reception and entertainment of it. He could have ordered things so,
   that our blessed Saviour, the author of this doctrine, should have
   been, as the Jews expected, a great temporal monarch; he could have
   raised him to that dignity, and have armed him with that authority, as
   must have given him a mighty power and influence over mankind, and
   would have gained the great, and the wise, and the learned, to have
   been active instruments in the propagating of this religion, and in
   persuading men to the embracing of it.

   But he, "whose ways are above our ways, and whose thoughts are above
   our thoughts, as the heavens are above the earth," did not think fit to
   have it promoted and carried on this way; nay, he seems on purpose to
   have stripped it of all secular advantages, that it might be perfectly
   free from all suspicion of a worldly interest and design, and that it
   might be evident to all the world, that it was "a plant which his own
   right hand had planted;" and that it did not owe its establishment to
   the authority, and wisdom, and contrivance of men, but to the power of
   God, and to the immediate favour and contrivance of Heaven.

   And now, being thus destitute of all worldly assistance, though never
   so reasonable in itself, it was not likely that it should be able with
   success to grapple with the lusts and corruptions of men, to which it
   was so directly opposite; nor with the strong prejudices of their
   education in a contrary religion, which are always hard to be overcome;
   nor with the temporal interests of men, which were all at that time to
   be renounced and quitted for its sake; unless it had some other
   advantages to make way for it, and to recommend it to the minds of men.
   For, having no secular baits and allurements to tempt men to the
   profession of it; no earthly contrivance and assistance to support it
   and bear it out, but, on the contrary, the most violent and powerful
   opposition raised against it; it was necessary that those who offered
   it to the world, should be able to give credit to it some other way,
   and to produce very sensible and convincing arguments of another kind:
   other wise they might have despaired of ever conquering the prejudices
   of men against it, and of persuading them to embrace that religion,
   which was so apparently contrary both to their inclinations and
   interests.

   So that in these circumstances, in order to the full conviction of men,
   that those who published this doctrine to them came from God, and were
   commissioned and sent by him to teach the world, it was very fitting,
   that God himself should give some remarkable testimony to the first
   preachers of it; and this the text tells us he did, by "bearing witness
   to them, with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of
   the Holy Ghost."

   For the better understanding of these words, we shall do well to
   reflect upon the design of this Epistle, which was to establish the
   Jews, who had but newly embraced Christianity, in the steadfast belief
   and profession of it, notwithstanding the troubles and persecutions
   which attended it; and to this end the apostle represents to them that
   the gospel was delivered with more authority, and had a greater
   confirmation given to it, than the law. The law was delivered by
   angels; but the gospel by the Son of God: and if the contempt of the
   law was so severely punished, what might they expect would be the fate
   of those who should slight and reject the gospel? "If the word spoken
   by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience
   received a just recompence of reward; how shall we escape, if we
   neglect so great salvation, which at first began to be spoken by the
   Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also
   bearing them witness with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles,
   and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his Own will?"
   Sunepimarturountos tou theou, "God adjoining this farther testimony of
   signs and wonders." The apostles testified what they had heard from our
   Lord; and to give credit and confirmation to their testimony, God was
   pleased to endow them with miraculous gifts; "he bare them witness with
   signs, and wonders, and miracles." So likewise Acts xiv. 3. it is said,
   that "God gave testimony to the word of his grace, granting signs and
   wonders to be done by the apostles." Sometimes there are more words put
   together, to express the giving of this miraculous power: (Acts ii.
   22.) "Jesus of Nazareth, approved of God by miracles, and wonders, and
   signs." (2 Cor. xii. 12.) St. Paul speaking of himself says, "The signs
   of an apostle were wrought among you, in all patience, in signs, and
   wonders, and miracles." These were the marks of an extraordinary and
   immediate commission, such as was that of the apostles.

   It is to no purpose nicely to inquire into the difference of these
   words, semeia te'rata duna'meis; "signs, wonders, and miracles,"
   because in all probability there is no difference intended, it being
   the manner of the Hebrews, when they would express a great thing, or a
   great degree of any thing, to heap several words together, signifying
   the same thing. So we find, (Deut. vi. 5.) "Thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
   might;" that is, greatly, with a very ardent and intense degree of
   affection. So likewise in the text, God is said to "bear witness to the
   apostles, with signs, and wonders, and miracles;" that is, in a very
   eminent and extraordinary manner, by great and wonderful miracles.

   From these words three things offer themselves to our consideration.

   First, That miracles are a Divine testimony given to a person or
   doctrine; "God bearing them testimony, by signs, and wonders, and
   miracles."

   Secondly, That God gave this testimony to the apostles and first
   preachers of Christianity, in a very eminent manner: for so the phrase
   signifies, so many words being multiplied to express the greatness of
   the thing.

   Thirdly, We will consider the reason why miracles are now ceased in the
   church, and have been for several ages, so that there have been no foot
   steps of them for a long time.

   First, That miracles are a Divine testimony given to a person or
   doctrine. God is here said "to bear witness to the apostles, with
   signs, and wonders, and divers miracles;" that is, the miracles which
   God enabled them to work, were an evidence that their doctrine was from
   God.

   And because there is some difficulty in this argument, therefore, that
   we may the more distinctly understand of what force this argument or
   testimony of miracles is, to prove the divinity of any person or
   doctrine, it will be requisite clearly to state these two things:

   I. What a miracle is.

   II. In what circumstances, and with what limitations, miracles are a
   sufficient testimony to the truth and divinity of any doctrine. The
   clearing of these two things shall be my work at this time.

   I. What a miracle is. The shortest and plainest description I can give
   of it, is this: that it is a supernatural effect, evident and wonderful
   to sense. So that there are two things necessary to a miracle.

   1. That it be a supernatural effect.

   2. That it be evident and wonderful to sense.

   1. That it be a supernatural effect. By a supernatural effect, I mean
   such an effect, as either in itself, and in its own nature, or in the
   manner and circumstances of it, exceeds any natural power that we know
   of to produce it. For there are some things that are miraculous in
   themselves; others that are only miraculous in the manner and
   circumstances of their operation. For instance: the resurrection of one
   from the dead, is a thing which in itself is supernatural, and an
   effect above any power that we know of in nature to produce; but the
   healing of several diseases, and the speaking of languages, are not
   things which are in themselves and in their nature supernatural: for we
   see that they may be acquired by natural skill and industry: but to
   heal all sorts of diseases, in an instant, and by a word, and without
   the application of natural means; and on a sudden to speak languages
   which a man never learned; these are things which, though they be not
   in their nature, yet in such circumstances as these, they are
   supernatural.

   I say, that a supernatural effect, is that which is above any natural
   power that we know of to produce; by which I do not mean, that miracles
   are always an immediate effect of the Divine power, and consequently
   that God alone can work them. For angels, good or bad, may do such
   things as exceed any natural power known to us, and such as we cannot
   distinguish by any certain marks and characters from those effects
   which are wrought by the immediate power of God; and if we cannot
   distinguish them they are equally miracles to us. When the angel slew a
   hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians in one
   night, this ought in all reason to be reckoned a miracle; and yet this,
   though done by the command of God, an angel might do by his own power
   and strength; for "they excel in strength:" but what limitations to set
   to their power, we cannot tell, only it is finite; so that excepting
   those things, which the Scripture hath peculiarly appropriated to God,
   we cannot say what it is that an angel cannot do.

   The same may be said concerning evil angels, The devil may work
   wonders, or assist his instruments to work them. So Pharaoh's magicians
   wrought several miracles by the power of the devil, and did some of the
   very same things that Moses and Aaron did, either really or in
   appearance, and it is all one whether. For he who to men's senses turns
   a rod into a serpent, works as great a miracle to me, as he who really
   does it; and if I am not to believe a thing to be a miracle, when to my
   senses it appears to be wrought, I am never to believe any, unless I
   could make some difference between those miracles which are real, and
   those that only appear to be wrought; for if we know not how to
   distinguish them, they are to us all one as if they were real: but if
   they may be distinguished, then there will be need of another miracle,
   to shew which are real and which not: and the same question and doubt
   will arise about that miracle, and so without end.

   So that I do not see what is gained by saying, that Pharaoh's magicians
   did only delude men's senses, but did not turn their rods really into
   serpents, as Aaron did his; because this may be said on one side, as
   well as on the other: for to the standers-by there was no difference,
   but the one seemed to the senses of the beholders to be as real as the
   other; and the text makes no difference, but says, "the magicians did
   in like manner; for they cast down every man his rod, and they became
   serpents, "only Aaron's had this advantage, that "his rod swallowed up
   their rods:" but the main difference was here, Moses and Aaron wrought
   such miracles, as the magicians could not work, neither really, nor in
   appearance: for when Aaron by smiting the dust with his rod, had turned
   it into lice, it is said that the magicians attempted to do so with
   their enchantments, but could not, and then they yielded and
   acknowledged that it was "the finger of God." And if they had not been
   thus plainly overcome, but could to all appearance of sense, have done
   all those things which Moses and Aaron did, it might justly have been
   disputed which had been the true prophets.

   So that the devil and his instruments may work miracles. Moses plainly
   supposeth that a false prophet, who comes to seduce the people to
   idolatry, may work a true sign or wonder. (Deut. xiii. 1, 2.) "If there
   arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a
   sign or a wonder; and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he
   spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods." And our blessed
   Saviour expressly foretells, (Matt. xxiv.) that false Christs and false
   prophets shall arise after his death, and shew great signs and wonders.

   From all which it is evident, that it is not of the essence of a
   miracle (as many have thought), that it be an immediate effect of the
   Divine power. It is sufficient, that it exceed any natural power that
   we know of to produce it. And if such effects be not to be esteemed
   miracles, a miracle would signify nothing; because no man could know
   when it is wrought, nor distinguish it from those effects which appear
   to be miraculous, but are not. This is the first property or condition
   of a miracle, that it be supernatural; that is, such an effect as
   exceeds any natural power that we know of to produce it. But then,

   2. There is another condition also required to a miracle, that it be an
   effect evident and wonderful to sense: for if we do not see it, it is
   to us as if it were not, and can be no testimony or proof of any thing,
   because itself stands in need of an other miracle to give testimony to
   it, and to prove that it was wrought; and neither in Scripture, nor
   profane authors, nor in common use of speech, is any thing called a
   miracle, but what falls under the notice of our senses; a miracle being
   nothing else but a thing wonderful to sense; and the very end and
   design of it is to be a sensible proof and conviction to us of
   something which we do not see.

   And for want of this condition, transubstantiation, if it were true,
   would be no miracle; it would indeed be very supernatural; but for all
   that, it would not be a sign or wonder; for a sign or wonder is always
   a sensible thing, something that is wonderful and astonishing to sense,
   otherwise it is no sign or wonder. That such a change us is pretended
   in transubstantiation should really be wrought, and yet there should be
   no sign and appearance of it, is a thing very wonderful; but not to
   sense: for our senses perceive no change; the bread and wine to all our
   senses remaining just as they were before. Now that a thing should
   remain to all appearance just as it was, hath nothing at all of wonder
   in it. We wonder indeed when we see a strange thing done: but no man
   wonders when he sees nothing done.

   So that to speak the truth, transubstantiation, if they will have it a
   miracle, is such a miracle as any man may work that hath but confidence
   to face men down that he works it, and the fortune to be believed. And
   however they of the church of Home are wont to magnify their priests,
   chiefly upon the account of this miracle, which they say they can work
   every day, and every hour if they please; yet I cannot understand, how
   it magnifies them so much; for when this great work (as they call it)
   is done, there is nothing more appears to be done, than if there were
   no miracle. Now such a miracle as to all appearance is no miracle, I
   see no reason why a protestant minister may not work as often as he
   pleaseth, as well as they: or if he can but have the patience to let it
   alone, it will work itself: for certainly nothing in the world is
   easier than to let a thing be as it is, and by speaking a few words
   over it, to make it just what it was be fore. In short, a miracle is a
   wonder to sense, and where a man sees nothing that is strange done,
   there is no miracle; for if he will call it a miracle, when things
   remain just as they were, and no sensible change is made in them, every
   man may every day work a thousand such miracles. I come now, in the

   II, Second place, to consider in what circumstances, and with what
   cautions and limitations miracles do give testimony to the truth and
   divinity of any doctrine; for instance, of the Christian doctrine: and
   for the clearing of this matter, I shall lay down these propositions:

   1. That the entire proof of the Christian doctrine or religion,
   consisting of many considerations, when taken together, make up a full
   demonstration of the truth of it, when perhaps no one of them, taken
   singly and by itself, is a convincing and undeniable proof.

   The Christian religion hath all the characters of divinity upon it
   which any religion can be expected to have; whether we consider the
   doctrine of it, in which there is nothing unworthy of God; for it makes
   such a representation of God, and gives such directions concerning his
   worship, as are most agreeable to those apprehensions which the wisest
   men always had of God, and of that service which is most proper to be
   given to him. Indeed it declares something concerning God, which is
   very mysterious and past our comprehensions; but this ought not to
   offend us, since natural light always did acknowledge the Divine nature
   to be incomprehensible.

   The precepts likewise of this religion are highly reasonable, and such
   as plainly tend to the perfection and happiness of human nature; and
   the arguments to enforce these precepts, are not only very powerful in
   themselves, but very suitable to the natural hopes and fears of men.

   Or if we consider the author of this doctrine, our blessed Saviour, he
   will appear to be a Divine person, "and a teacher sent from God," by
   (he clear predictions concerning him long before he came, which, when
   he came, were exactly fulfilled in him j by the miracles he wrought to
   give testimony of him; by the eminent holiness and virtue of his life;
   and by innumerable things which he foretold concerning himself, the
   destruction of Jerusalem, and the dispersion of the Jewish nation, and
   the success of his doctrine in the world, which were all afterwards
   punctually accomplished. All these proved him to be an extraordinary
   person. But he was likewise declared to be "the Son of God," by a voice
   from heaven, and by his resurrection from the dead.

   Or if we consider the first publishers of this doctrine, to whom "God
   bare witness, with signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of
   the Holy Ghost," and the wonderful success they met withal,
   notwithstanding the outward meanness of their persons, insomuch that
   their doctrine very suddenly prevailed, and passed like lightning
   through the world; and in the space of a few years, spread itself
   beyond the utmost bounds of the vast Roman empire, and this in despite
   of the most powerful opposition and fiercest persecutions that ever
   were raised against any religion: so that, like the children of Israel
   in Egypt, it did thrive under affliction, and the more it was
   oppressed, the more it grew and multiplied; because there was a Divine
   power that did visibly accompany the first publishers of it, and men
   "were not able to resist the Spirit whereby they spake."

   All these together make up a full and convincing demonstration of the
   truth and divinity of the Christian doctrine: and yet perhaps no one of
   these alone is a sufficient proof of it. For though a doctrine be never
   so reasonable in itself, this is no certain argument that it is from
   God, if no testimony from heaven be given to it; because it may be the
   result and issue of human reason and discourse: and though a doctrine
   attested by miracles, yet the matter of it may be so unreasonable and
   absurd, so unworthy of God, and so contrary to the natural notions
   which men have of him, that no miracles can be sufficient to give
   confirmation to it; and therefore in some cases the Scripture forbids
   men to hearken to a prophet, though he work a miracle. (Deut. xiii.
   1-3.) "If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and
   giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to
   pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods
   (which thou hast not known), and let us serve them: thou shalt not
   hearken unto the words of that prophet." And the reason is given, (ver.
   5.) "Because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God."
   From whence it is plain, that a miracle is not sufficient to establish
   the worship of a false god.

   The sum of what I have said is this: that we do not found our belief of
   Christianity upon any one argument taken by itself; but upon the whole
   evidence which we are able to produce for it, in which there is nothing
   wanting that is proper and reasonable to prove any religion to be from
   God.

   2. But yet miracles are the principal external proof and confirmation
   of the divinity of a doctrine. I told you before, that some doctrines
   are so absurd, that a miracle is not a sufficient proof of them: but if
   a doctrine be such as is no ways unworthy of God, nor contrary to those
   notions which we have of him, miracles are the highest testimony that
   can be given to it, and have always been owned by mankind for an
   evidence of inspiration. And therefore Nicodemus takes it for an
   acknowledged principle, that miracles are "a sign of a teacher sent
   from God." (John iii. 2.) "We know that thou art a teacher come from
   God: for none can do these miracles which thou doest, except God be
   with him." And the Scripture constantly resolves the divinity of any
   person or doctrine into miracles as the chief external evidence that
   they are from God. This was the testimony which God gave to Moses, to
   satisfy the people of Israel that he had sent him, (Exod. iv. 1.) "And
   Moses answered, and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor
   hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared
   unto thee." Upon this God tells Moses, that he would give him a power
   of miracles, to be an evidence to them that "they may believe, that the
   God of their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, hath appeared unto
   thee." And all along in the Old Testament, when God sent his prophets
   to make any new revelation, or upon any extraordinary message, he
   always gave credit to them, by some sign or wonder. And when he sent
   his Son into the world, he bare witness to him, by more and greater
   miracles than Moses, or any of the prophets had wrought. And to this
   testimony both our Saviour himself and the apostles appeal, as the
   great evidence of the divinity of their doctrine. When John the Baptist
   sent his disciples to our Saviour, to be satisfied whether he were the
   Messias, he refers them to his miracles, (Matt. xi. 4, 5.) "Go and shew
   John again those things which you do hear and see. The blind receive
   their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf
   hear, the dead are raised up." And, (John v. 36.) "But I have greater
   witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me
   to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the
   Father hath sent me." And, (Acts ii. 22.) "Jesus of Nazareth, a man
   approved of God among you (apo tou theou apodedeigmenon eis humas, a
   man demonstrated by God to you), by miracles, and wonders, and signs,
   which he did in the midst of you." And (Acts xiv. 3.) it is said, that
   when the apostles preached the gospel, "God gave testimony unto the
   word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their
   hands." From all which it is plain, that our religion appeals to
   miracles, as the great external confirmation of it.

   3. Especially if miracles have all the circumstances of advantage given
   to them which they are capable of; if they be many and great, public
   and unquestionable, and universal and of long continuance. And such
   were the miracles wrought by Moses, and by our Saviour and his
   apostles, which, for their nature and quality, for the number and
   continuance of them, and for all other circumstances that may give
   credit to them, and argue them to be from God, are in no degree to be
   equalled by those which any other religion hath pretended to.

   And in these circumstances, miracles alone in most cases are a
   sufficient proof of the divinity of a doctrine; for there is a great
   deal of difference in reason to be made between one or two strange and
   miraculous effects, and those not of the highest and most
   unquestionable rank of miracles neither, privately wrought, and before
   few witnesses; and a long-continued series of miracles of all kinds,
   and such as are universally acknowledged to be above the power of
   nature, and those publicly wrought in the face and view of the world,
   in every city and country, by a great many persons for many years, yea,
   for many ages together. The former may be doubted of, but the latter
   carry so sensible a conviction with them, that it is not credible, that
   the Divine goodness should permit so great and over powering a
   testimony to be given to a falsehood.

   4. It cannot be denied, but that God doth some times permit miracles to
   be wrought for the countenancing of a false doctrine. This the heathens
   pretended to at their temples and oracles; and it is not incredible,
   that God should permit the devil to do several strange and
   extraordinary things; though it be certain that there was a great deal
   of cheat and imposture mingled with them. To be sure the Scripture owns
   the working of miracles by false prophets. Moses takes notice of it in
   his law, and provides against it as a case that might happen; and our
   Saviour expressly foretells it, (Matt. xxiv.) and so does St. Paul, (2
   Thess. ii. 9.) that "the man of sin should come after the working of
   Satan, with power, and signs, and wonders of lies;" that is, should
   work miracles to countenance his false and impious doctrines. And the
   Scripture likewise tells us, for what reason God does sometimes permit
   this to be done. For the trial of the good: (Deut. xiii. 3.) "For the
   Lord your God proveth you to know whether you love the Lord your God
   with all your hearts." And for the hardening of the wicked, by the just
   judgment of God: (2 Thess. ii. 10-12.) "Because they received not the
   love of truth, that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall
   send them ene'rgoian pla'nes (the efficacy of imposture,) that they
   should believe a lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not
   the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."

   5. And lastly, God never permits miracles to be wrought for the
   confirmation of a false doctrine, but he affords sufficient marks,
   whereby those who are free and impartial inquirers after truth, and
   sincere lovers of it, may distinguish truth from imposture. So our
   Saviour tells us, that the elect, that is, the true and sincere
   Christians, should not be deceived by the "signs and wonders of the
   false Christs and false prophets." And therefore he was not afraid of
   having the credit of his doctrine weakened by foretelling that false
   prophets should work miracles; because he knew when the devil had done
   his utmost, the difference would be apparent enough between the
   confirmation which he had given to the Christian doctrine, and what the
   devil should be able to give to his instruments. As,

   1. Either the doctrine would be absurd in itself, and such as no
   miracles can confirm. As in the case which Moses instanceth in, of a
   miracle wrought to seduce them from the worship of the one true God,
   who is naturally known, to the worship of idols. Or else,

   2. It would be contrary to that doctrine which had already had a far
   greater and more Divine confirmation. And this, likewise, is another
   reason intimated by Moses, why the people should not hearken to a
   prophet that would seduce them to idolatry, though he should work a
   miracle; "because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your
   God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt;" that is, from that
   God who hath demonstrated himself to them by such a series of great and
   unquestionable miracles as ought in all reason to bear down any single
   sign and wonder.

   And the case is the same, if miracles should now be pretended for the
   confirmation of any thing plainly contrary to the Christian doctrine,
   which, being established by such miracles as never were wrought in the
   world upon any other occasion, it cannot be thought reasonable, that
   any evidence inferior to this should be able to control it, or to give
   credit to any thing that contradicted it. And in this case the apostle
   has expressly forbidden Christians to hearken to a contrary doctrine,
   "though they themselves, or an angel from heaven, should preach it."
   (Gal. i. 8.) Therefore St. Paul expressly lays down this rule, whereby
   we may judge what miraculous powers are from the Spirit of God, and
   what not. (1 Cor. xii. 1.) "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
   would not have you ignorant," that is, what miraculous gifts are from
   the Spirit of God, and what not; and then (ver. 3.) he gives this rule:
   "Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the
   Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed; and that no man can say, that
   Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost;" that is, if any man pretend
   to be inspired, and to be endowed with a miraculous power, and yet
   blasphemeth Christ, this spirit is not from God; but if any man be
   endowed with this power, and acknowledge Christ, we may safely conclude
   this power to be from the Holy Ghost. The very same rule St. John lays
   down yet more plainly: (1 John iv. 1-3.) "Believe not every spirit,"
   that is, not every one that pretends to the gifts and inspirations of
   the Spirit; "but try the spirits, whether they are of God: because many
   false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit
   of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the
   flesh, is of God, and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
   Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God." And, (ver. 6.) "We are of
   God; he that knoweth God, heareth us: he that is not of God, heareth
   not us: hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error."
   This seems at first sight to be a very odd rule, and what every false
   teacher, and every sect may lay down in favour of themselves, "he that
   knoweth God, heareth us: he that knoweth not God, heareth not us;" and
   no thing can make it reasonable, but the consideration that the
   Christian religion being already so abundantly confirmed beyond
   contradiction, is itself be come a rule to try spirits or miracles by.
   Or,

   3. The miracles which false prophets work are presently confuted, and
   upon the spot. Thus Moses confuted and conquered Pharaoh's magicians,
   by working miracles which they could not work, which forced them to
   yield the cause, and acknowledge that it was "the finger of God." And
   so likewise Simon Magus, who had gained so great a reputation among the
   people by his sorceries, as to be called "the mighty power of God," was
   confuted by the apostles, who, by the laying on of hands, conferred a
   miraculous power on men, which he not being able to do, would have
   purchased it with money. And so Elymas the sorcerer was struck blind by
   St. Paul. And the miracles of the heathen temples and oracles, upon the
   preaching of the gospel, ceased, as being ashamed of themselves; as
   Porphyry, one of the bitterest enemies of Christianity, does expressly
   acknowledge. Or else,

   Lastly, The miracles wrought, or pretended to be wrought, to confirm
   false doctrines, are such as do, some way or other, confute themselves;
   or if they be real, are sufficiently detected to be the pranks of the
   devil, and not the great and glorious works of God. Such were the
   miracles of the heathen deities, wrought so privately and obscurely,
   and confessedly mixed with so much of imposture, as to bring a just
   suspicion upon them, that, when they were real, the devil was the
   author of them. And such were the miracles which are attributed to
   Mahomet; either grossly absurd and ridiculous, as that of part of the
   moon coming down into his sleeve, and his remanding it to its place
   again; or else destitute of all proof and witness, as that of a camel's
   speaking to him by night; and his pigeon whispering to him in the ear;
   which, if it had been intended for a miracle, the pigeon should not
   have whispered, but have spoken out, that others might have heard it.
   But Mahomet was so conscious to himself of his own defect in point of
   miracles, that he laid no weight upon them, being, as he said, "not
   sent to convert the world by miracles, but to conquer them by force of
   arms."

   And now I am sorry I have occasion to say it, but it is too true, that
   the miracles pretended to by the church of Rome, for the confirmation
   of their erroneous doctrines, are of the same stamp with these, taxed
   by several of their best writers of imposture and forgery, of fable and
   romance, so extravagant, and freakish, and fantastical, wrought without
   any necessity, and serving to no wise end, that they are so far from
   giving credit to their doctrines, that they are a mighty scandal to
   them, and to our common Christianity: whereas the truly Divine
   miracles, reported to us in Scripture, how unlike are they to these?
   How venerable in themselves, and in all the circumstances with which
   they are related? never wrought but upon great necessity, and for
   excellent ends, full of benefit and advantage, of mercy and compassion
   to mankind; and, in a word, such as are every way worthy of their
   author, having plain characters of the Divine wisdom and goodness
   stamped upon them.

   And thus I have done with the first thing I propounded to speak to,
   namely, that miracles are a Divine testimony; and in what
   circumstances, and with what cautions and limitations they are so. I
   shall at present only draw some inferences from what hath been
   discoursed upon this argument.

   1. What hath been said may satisfy us of the truth and divinity of the
   Christian doctrine, which had so eminent a testimony given to it from
   heaven, and did at first so strangely prevail in the world, contrary to
   all human probability, "not by might nor by power, but by the Spirit of
   the Lord." No man can suppose a religion in circumstances of greater
   disadvantage, and upon all human accounts more unlikely to sustain and
   bear up itself, than Christianity was. The first appearance of it was
   so weak, its beginnings so small, and the instruments employed in the
   propagation of it so mean and despicable, that no man but would have
   concluded it must have presently sunk and come to nought; and no other
   reason can be given of the strange success and prevalency of it, but
   that "it was of God," and therefore "it could not be over thrown."

   2. From hence we may judge how groundless the pretences are, which men
   now-a-days make to inspiration and infallibility; because this is not
   to be proved and made out any other way but by miracles. For either we
   must believe every pretence of this kind; and then we are at the mercy
   of every crafty and confident man, to be led by him into what delusions
   he pleases; or we must only believe those who give some testimony of
   their inspiration: but the evidence of inspiration was always miracles.
   This is the testimony which God hath always given to those whom he hath
   sent upon an extraordinary message to mankind. And this is that which
   we reasonably demand of our modern enthusiasts, and of the great
   pretender to infallibility, the bishop of Rome; because nothing can be
   more vain, than for men to pretend to inspiration, and an infallible
   spirit, without miracles. And yet I cannot learn that the popes
   themselves, among all their bound less privileges and powers, do so
   much as pretend to a power of miracles, which yet is the only thing
   that can in reason support their pretences to infallibility.

   3. You see what an immediate testimony from heaven, God was pleased to
   give to the first preachers of the Christian doctrine, to qualify them
   with any probability of success, to contest with violent and almost
   invincible prejudices of men educated in a contrary religion, and which
   had the secular authority and laws on its side. For having this Divine
   seal given to their commission, they did as it were carry the
   letters-patents of heaven in their hands, and an authority paramount to
   that of human laws. And therefore the wisdom of God, which does no
   thing which is superfluous and unnecessary, did not think the apostles
   sufficiently armed and appointed for this design, by a commission from
   the mouth of the Son of God, without this Divine seal and testimony of
   miracles, as a visible evidence of their Divine commission. And,
   therefore, our Saviour, after he had commissioned them to preach the
   gospel to all nations, commanded them not to enter upon this work, nor
   "to depart from Jerusalem, till they had received the promise of the
   Father;" that is, the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost, (Acts i. 4.)
   And so our Saviour explains it, (Luke xxiv. 47.) where, after he had
   commanded, "That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
   his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem," he adds, (ver.
   49.) "And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry
   ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on
   high." And to the same purpose, (Acts i. 8.) "But ye shall receive
   power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you;" by which he tells
   us, they were qualified to be "witnesses unto him, both in Jerusalem,
   and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the
   earth."

   4. And lastly, The consideration of what has been said, doth justly
   upbraid us, that our religion, which hath such evident marks of
   divinity upon it, and comes down to us confirmed by so many miracles,
   should yet have so little efficacy upon the lives of the greatest part
   of those who call themselves Christians. It is true, miracles are now
   ceased among Christians, our religion being sufficiently established by
   those that were wrought at first; and now the greatest miracle in these
   latter ages, is a good man, a true and sincere Christian: but the laws
   of Christianity are still the same: and the motives and arguments to a
   good life, are still the same; and though the miraculous gifts of the
   Spirit have left the world, yet the sealing and sanctifying gifts of
   the Holy Ghost do still remain. We cannot now speak all languages, as
   the apostles did: but we may do that which is much better, and more
   pleasing to God; we may live holy and virtuous lives. We have not that
   faith which works by miracles: but we may have that which is far more
   excellent, the faith which works by charity: which, if we believe St.
   Paul, is more than to speak with the tongues of men and angels, more
   than to prophesy, and to understand all mysteries and all knowledge.

   The admirable piety and virtue of the first Christians are still upon
   record for our imitation: but I know not how it comes to pass, we
   choose rather lazily to admire those patterns, than vigorously to
   imitate them; as if the holiness of those times were also miraculous,
   and not intended for the imitation of succeeding ages; as if it were
   impossible for us now to lead such lives as they did; as if heaven and
   earth, God and men, and all things, were altered since that time; as if
   the Christian religion was now quite dispirited, and had lost all its
   vigour and force; and as if the Holy Spirit of God had to all intents
   and purposes forsaken the world, and were retired to the Father.

   But our religion is still the same it was: the precepts of it as
   reasonable, and the promises of it as powerful as ever: God is still
   the same he was; and Christ still at the right hand of God, making
   intercession for us; and the Holy Spirit of God still ready to assist
   us, to every good word and work.

   To conclude: we have, beyond comparison, the best and most reasonable
   religion in the world; a religion which carries along with it the
   greatest evidence of its truth, which contains the best rules and
   directions for a good life, which offers the most powerful assistance
   to the obedience of its laws, and gives the greatest encouragements
   thereto, by the assurance of a blessed immortality in another world.
   Now the better our religion is, our case is so much the worse, if we be
   not made good by it. Philosophy had some effect upon the world to make
   some men temperate and chaste, just and honest in their lives. And the
   Jewish religion (as weak and imperfect as it was, and though it was but
   "the shadow of good things to come") hath yet left us many eminent
   examples of good and holy men. What then shall become of us, if the
   best institution in the world, the blessed gospel of the Son of God,
   have less effect upon us than the doctrine of Pythagoras, and the law
   of Moses had upon them? "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great
   salvation, which at first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
   confirmed unto us by them that heard him! God also bearing them witness
   with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy
   Ghost, according to his own will.--To which blessed and glorious
   Trinity, be all honour and glory, now and for ever."

SERMON CCXXIX.

  OF THE MIRACLES WROUGHT IN CONFIRMATION OF CHRISTIANITY.

   God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with
   divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own
   will.--Heb. ii. 4.

   I HAVE begun to discourse upon these words, from which I told you three
   things offer themselves to our consideration.

   First, That miracles are a Divine testimony to a person or doctrine.
   God is here said to "bear witness to the apostles, by signs, and
   wonders, and miracles."

   Secondly, That God gave this testimony to the apostles and first
   publishers of the gospel, in a very eminent manner; for so the phrase
   signifies, "God bearing them witness, with signs, and wonders, and
   miracles;" so many words to the same sense being purposely used to
   signify the greatness of the thing.

   Thirdly, The reasons why miracles are now ceased in the church, and
   have been for several ages; so that there have been no footsteps of
   this miraculous power for several ages past. The first I have spoken
   to, and proceed now to the

   Second thing which I proposed to consider, viz. That God gave testimony
   to the apostles and first publishers of Christianity, in a very eminent
   manner; for so the expression in the text signifies, where so many
   words are used for the same thing, to express, according to the manner
   of the Hebrew phrase, the greatness of the thing; "God bearing them
   witness, both with signs, and wonders, and with divers miracles, and
   gifts of the Holy Ghost," that is, with many and great miracles, kai`
   merismois, "and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own
   will;" that is, God distributed these several miraculous powers and
   gifts among the apostles and first preachers of the gospel; not all to
   every one of them, but some to one, and some to another, as to him
   seemed best, and was most for the benefit and edification of the
   church.

   The history of it, in short, is this. When our blessed Saviour ascended
   into heaven, he promised to send down his Spirit in miraculous gifts
   upon his apostles, to give credit to his doctrine, and to qualify them
   for the more speedy planting and propagating of it in the world; and
   accordingly, not many days after he was ascended into heaven, as an
   evidence of the power and glory he was invested withal, he, according
   to his promise immediately before his ascension, sent down the Holy
   Ghost upon the apostles in a visible manner, that is, in the form of
   fiery cloven tongues, as an emblem of one of the principal gifts they
   were endowed withal, viz. the knowledge and ability of speaking several
   languages, which they had never learned. And this happened upon the day
   of Pentecost, that so the gospel might exactly correspond to the
   dispensation of the law, which was the type and figure of it. And,
   therefore, as our Saviour died at the time of the Jewish passover,
   which was the type of his sufferings; so the gospel, which was the
   perfection and fulfilling of the law, began to be published at the very
   same time that the law was given from Mount Sinai, viz. at the end of
   the seven weeks after the passover. For, at this time the Holy Ghost
   descended upon the apostles in miraculous powers and gifts; when this
   new law was "to come forth out of Sion, and the word of the Lord from
   Jerusalem."

   And among these gifts, the first we find mentioned was the gift of
   tongues; without which the gospel must of necessity have been very
   slowly propagated in the world: for had the apostles been first to
   learn the several languages of the nations they were to preach to, how
   tedious a work would that have been! it requiring the industry of some
   years, to gain so perfect a mastery of a strange language, as to be
   able to use it with that freedom and readiness which are necessary for
   such a work.

   And this gift all the apostles had, because they all had occasion for
   it, being designed by our Saviour to be the chief publishers of his
   gospel to the world. And this gift did also continually reside upon
   them, and not only at some times, as some other gifts did, because they
   had constant use of this gift of tongues.

   The interpreting of things spoken in a strange tongue, was also a gift
   distinct from the gift of tongues, though attending it; insomuch that
   some persons had one, and some the other. So the apostle tells us, (1
   Cor. xii. 10.) "To one is given divers kinds of tongues, and to another
   the interpretation of tongues." The occasion of which was plainly this;
   it might happen, and often did, that the auditory might consist of
   people of several nations; now because no man could speak more than one
   language at once, it was convenient others should have the gift of
   interpreting what was spoken, to those who understood not the language
   in which it was spoken, that so all might receive the benefit of what
   was delivered, and be edified thereby. So that here were two several
   gifts serving the same end, viz. the conveying of the knowledge of the
   gospel to mankind, in a more speedy way than it could have been done by
   ordinary means; and these were very plain and sensible miracles,
   unquestionably supernatural, and evident to the senses of all men. So
   that the gospel, wherever it was preached, carried its own testimony
   along with it, and was confirmed by the very manner of its conveyance
   and delivery: and well might men entertain it as a Divine doctrine,
   when the very manner, and the means whereby it was published, was a
   miracle.

   And here I cannot but take notice, how contrary the arts and the ways
   of the church of Rome are to the methods of God, and that when he was
   at the expense of so many miracles to publish this doctrine to the
   world, they should use so much industry and violence to conceal it. God
   was pleased to endow the first preachers of it with the gift of
   tongues, that "their sound might go into all the earth, and their word
   to the end of the world," that there might be no nation nor language
   where this saving knowledge might not come, that the sermons which they
   preached, and the prayers which they put up to God in public, for
   themselves and the people, and all the offices of religion which they
   performed, might be fully understood by all, and that all might join in
   them, and have the benefit and comfort of them; that their
   understandings might be informed and enlightened by what was spoken,
   and their affections raised and warmed by their understandings, and
   their wills excited by their affections, and that the effect of all
   this might appear in their lives and practice. Thus it was in the
   primitive Christian church; but in the church of Rome, things are
   managed in a quite contrary way, and have been for several ages. The
   doctrine of salvation, as it is contained and delivered in the Holy
   Scripture, is "a sealed book," which the people are not thought "worthy
   to open or look into." This "bread of life which came down from
   heaven," is like the show-bread among the Jews, "which none may eat but
   the priest only," unless it be by extraordinary favour, and particular
   licence from the bishop. The people indeed come together, and are
   present at the prayers and devotion of the priest; but the priest "that
   prays is a barbarian to them," and all the while the understanding of
   the people is unfruitful, and "they cannot say Amen, because they
   understand not what he says."

   But let any man shew me the least intimation in Scripture or antiquity,
   that our Saviour or his apostles, or the primitive church, ever used
   this way; and yet the danger of error and heresy was as great then as
   it is now. So that the church of Rome must pretend themselves wiser
   than our Saviour and his apostles; and to be more careful to prevent
   heresy in the church, than they were. This they are loath to say; and
   yet they must say it, if they will justify their own doings. But the
   plain truth is, there is another and truer reason for it, though they
   are not willing to own it, and that is this; if the Scriptures were
   permitted to the people in a language which they understood, the errors
   of their church would be discovered and laid open, and men would
   plainly discern how contrary many of their doctrines and practices are,
   to those of our Saviour and his apostles: for "every one that doeth
   evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds
   should be discovered."

   Secondly, The next miraculous gift I shall mention after the gift of
   tongues, is the gift of prophecy, or foretelling things future, which
   was always looked upon as an evidence of inspiration. And this we find
   mentioned 1 Cor. xii. 10. "To another prophecy," and in several other
   places; and to this gift the apostle gives a great pre-eminence. (1
   Cor. xiv. 1.) "Covet spiritual gifts: but rather that ye may prophesy;"
   because foretelling of things to come, was always esteemed by mankind
   an evidence of a person divinely inspired, and consequently was one of
   the greatest testimonies of the truth of Christianity; and this the
   angel that appeared to St. John particularly takes notice of, (Rev.
   xix. 10.) "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." The
   prophecies of that book were to be a standing testimony of the truth of
   Christianity in all ages of the church.

   Thirdly, The next gift is that of healing all manner of diseases. And
   this the apostles seem gene rally to have had, and the elders of the
   church also, whose peculiar office it was to pray over the sick, and to
   anoint them with oil; and upon their prayers, God was pleased to grant
   miraculous recoveries, as we find expressly promised, (James v. 14,
   15.) "Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church,
   and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the
   Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall
   raise him up."

   This miraculous power we find likewise mentioned to be conferred on the
   apostles in our Saviour's life-time, when he first gave them commission
   to preach the gospel to the Jews; (Mark vi. 12, 13.) where it is said,
   that "they went out, and preached that men should repent. And they cast
   out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed
   them."

   And now that this miraculous gift is ceased, there is no reason why the
   mere ceremony of anointing with oil should continue; which yet is still
   used in the church of Rome, and made a sacrament; though it signify
   nothing: for they do not pretend to heal men by it; nay, they pretend
   the contrary, because they never use it, but in extremity, and where
   they look upon the person as past recovery; and if they did not think
   so, they would not use it.

   But besides the healing, with this solemnity of anointing with oil, and
   with prayer, which seems to have been used by the elders of the church
   only upon those who were members of the church, there was likewise a
   general gift of healing, which the apostles exercised upon all
   occasions wherever they came; and this was performed only by laying
   their hands on the sick. And this we find promised by our Saviour to
   his apostles when he gave them commission to preach the gospel to all
   the world, immediately before his ascension; and not only to the
   apostles, but to those who should believe upon their preaching: (Mark
   xvi. 17, 18.) "These signs shall follow them that believe: in my name
   shall they cast out devils," &c. And then it follows, "they shall lay
   hands on the sick, and they shall recover."

   Fourthly, The power of raising the dead, which hath always been
   esteemed one of the greatest and most unquestionable miracles of all
   other. A principal part of the apostles' office was to "be witnesses of
   our Saviour's resurrection from the dead," whereby he was so
   "powerfully demonstrated to be the Son of God." But because this was a
   strange relation, and not easy to be credited, by those who were
   strangers to the apostles, and had never known them before; therefore,
   that they might witness this with more authority, God was pleased to
   endow them with a miraculous power of all kinds; and particularly with
   a power of raising the dead; and then there was no difficulty in
   receiving their testimony concerning our Saviour's resurrection, when
   men saw them in his name raise others from the dead. And of this we
   have two instances in the Acts of the Apostles; of St. Peter's raising
   Dorcas, (Acts ix.) and St. Paul's raising Eutychus, (Acts xx.) And
   Irenæus, who lived in the age after the apostles, tells us, that in his
   time this power continued among Christians.

   Fifthly, Another miraculous gift was that of discerning spirits; the
   principal use of which was, to try and judge who were true prophets.
   And of this the apostle speaks: (1 Cor. xiv. 29.) "Let the prophets
   speak two or three, and let the other judge." And, (ver. 32.) "The
   spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets." And this is
   likewise called by the same apostle, "the gift of discerning spirits,"
   (1 Cor. xii. 10.) "To another is given the discerning of spirits."
   Those who pretended to this gift, were tried by the bishops and elders
   of the church, as the prophets were tried among the Jews by the
   Sanhedrin. And of these kinds of assemblies among the Christians, for
   the trial of prophets, Eusebius speaks particularly in his fifth book.

   And it should seem, likewise, that this gift of discerning spirits,
   extended also to the discovery of the secrets of men's hearts; by the
   revealing where of, unbelievers were many times struck and convinced;
   as may very probably be collected from 1 Cor. xiv. 24, 25. "But if all
   prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned;
   he is convinced of all, he is judged of all. And thus are the secrets
   of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will
   worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth."

   And upon this miraculous gift of knowing the secrets of men's hearts,
   it seems to be very probable, that that which is commonly called the
   power of the keys did depend; I mean the power of remit ting or
   retaining sins: for they who had the privilege of knowing men's hearts,
   might do this upon certain grounds, and were secured from mistake in
   the exercise of their power upon particular persons; which the priests
   and ministers of the church now are not, nor can be; because they
   cannot see into men's hearts, whether they be truly penitent and
   qualified for forgiveness or not. For I cannot easily believe but that
   those words of our Saviour, "Whose sins ye remit, they are remitted;
   and whose sins ye retain, they are retained;" were intended to signify
   something more than a mere declaration of the promises and threatenings
   of the gospel, which any man might make as well as the apostles and
   ministers of the church. For that God will forgive the penitent, and
   that he will not pardon the sinner, except he repent, is as true from
   any man's mouth, as from an apostle s: and as to the absolution of this
   or that particular person, though a minister by the skill and knowledge
   of his profession, is ordinarily and reasonably presumed, by virtue of
   his office, to be a better judge of a man's repentance, than other
   persons are, and therefore may, with more authority and satisfaction to
   the penitent, declare his judgment and opinion concerning him; yet, not
   being able to see into his heart, he may be mistaken concerning him:
   and if he be, his declaring his sins to be forgiven, that is, his
   absolution of him, will do him no good: and, on the other hand, his
   refusal to absolve him, if he be truly penitent, will do him no harm.
   As the judgment of a skilful lawyer is of greater authority, and more
   satisfactory to us, concerning our title to an estate, than the opinion
   of another man who is not of the profession, nor presumed to have the
   like skill; but yet for all this, his judgment does not alter the case,
   and if in truth the law be otherwise, our title is bad for all this
   skilful man's opinion of the goodness of it.

   And thus much is granted by the church of Rome, that if the priest be
   mistaken in the use of the keys, and gives absolution to one that is
   not truly penitent, his sins are not remitted; or if a person be
   excommunicated that is not truly guilty, his sins are not retained;
   what "he binds on earth, is" not "bound in heaven; and he whom he
   looseth and absolves on earth, is" not "absolved in heaven." But the
   protestants go farther, and do not only make a mistaken absolution or
   excommunication void in itself; but they do not make the absolution of
   the priest at all necessary to the forgiveness of sins, but only
   convenient for the satisfaction and comfort of the penitent. For which
   reason, our church does not require a formal absolution to be given to
   the dying penitent, unless he himself desire it; which is a certain
   argument, that, in the judgment of our church, the absolution of the
   priest is not necessary to the forgiveness and salvation of the
   penitent. For had they thought it necessary, they would have enjoined
   the priest to give it to every one whom he judged penitent, whether he
   desired it or not.

   So that the absolution of the priest, having only the authority of a
   man, presumed to be skilful in the office, but no certain effect, in
   case he be mistaken (as he very easily may be, and if he be, as he
   ought to be, a charitable man, no doubt often is) I cannot think but
   that this power of remitting and retaining sins, so solemnly conferred
   on the apostles by our Saviour, had something in it that was
   miraculous, and extraordinary, and did suppose the knowledge of men's
   hearts, and that they were not mistaken in the application of this
   power to particular persons; and consequently, that in that miraculous
   and extraordinary degree, it was peculiar to the apostles and their
   times. For I cannot easily be brought to believe, that the meaning of
   this great promise to the apostles should be only this, "Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth (if ye be not
   mistaken, as in many cases ye will be, and in any case ye may be) shall
   be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be
   loosed in heaven." And if more be meant than this, it must suppose a
   miraculous power of discerning the sincerity of men's hearts.

   And, therefore, when the power of the keys is conferred on the
   ministers of the gospel, in our form of ordination, I suppose that only
   one or both of these two things is intended by it, viz. a power to
   admit persons into the Christian church by baptism, in which is sealed
   to them the remission of sins and to cast persons out of the communion
   of the Christian church, by excommunication and the censures of it; and
   an authority, by virtue of their office, to declare to men the terms of
   pardon and forgiveness, which cannot be that infallible power of
   absolving which the apostles had.

   And I am the rather induced to think so, because I find it promised to
   the apostles, together with the miraculous power and efficacy of
   prayer, which St. Chrysostom reckons among the miraculous gifts, which
   he says were ceased in his time. That it was thus promised, you may see
   Matt. xviii. 18, 19. "Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind
   on earth, shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on
   earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Again, I say unto you, that if two of
   you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it
   shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven." But surely, no
   man will pretend that any two Christians or ministers have now this
   power, that whatever they shall agree together to ask of God, which is
   fit and lawful in behalf of any person, God will certainly grant it
   upon their request. In the same sense I understand several other texts
   concerning the efficacy of the prayers of the apostles and first
   Christians, as in a great mea sure miraculous, and peculiar to the
   first times of Christianity. And, I think, any man that attentively
   considers them, will think that they cannot well be understood
   otherwise. Such as these: (Matt. xxi. 22.) "And all things whatsoever
   ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive." (Mark xi. 24.) "I
   say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that
   ye receive them, and ye shall have them." (John xiv. 14.) "If ye shall
   ask any thing in my name, I will do it:" and (chap. xv. 7.) "If ye
   abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and
   it shall be done unto you." (1 John iii. 22.) "And whatsoever we ask we
   receive of him;" and, (chap. v. 14, 15.) "And this is the confidence
   which we have in him, that if we ask any thing, according to his will,
   he heareth us. And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we
   know that we have the petitions that we desired of him." These promises
   I take to contain something extraordinary, and peculiar to the first
   times of Christianity. And this will appear exceeding probable, if we
   consider the occasion and circumstances of these promises which are so
   often joined with the promise of a miraculous power, as in the place I
   mentioned before, (Matt. xviii. 18, 19.) where, after the power of
   binding and loosing, it immediately follows, that "if two of you shall
   agree on earth, touching any thing they shall ask, it shall be done for
   them of my Father which is in heaven." Matt. xxi. 22. and Mark xi. 23.
   says our Saviour there to his disciples; "Have faith in God; for verily
   I say unto you, Whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed,
   and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but
   shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he
   shall have whatsoever he saith." And then immediately it follows:
   "Therefore, I say unto yon, Whatsoever things you desire, when you
   pray, believe that you receive them, and ye shall have them;" that is,
   Whatever ye desire of God to do, he shall miraculously do it, upon your
   prayers. So likewise, (John xiv. 12-14.) "Verily, verily, I say unto
   you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and
   greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father. And
   whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may
   be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will
   do it." Still you see this extraordinary efficacy of prayer is joined
   with the power of miracles, as one part and branch of it. More
   particularly, we find the forgiveness of the sins of those whom they
   prayed for, expressly promised: (1 John v. 15.) "And if we know that he
   heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions we
   desired of him." And then it follows: "If any man see his brother sin a
   sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life
   for the sin that is not unto death." Where forgiveness of sins, upon
   the prayers of Christians for one another, is promised, except in the
   case of "a sin unto death," by which is meant apostacy from
   Christianity to the heathen idolatry, which is the reason of the
   caution which follows: "Little children, keep yourselves from idols."
   And this extraordinary efficacy of prayer, we find promised in a more
   special manner to the elders of the church: (James v. 14, 15.) "Is any
   sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them
   pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
   prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up:
   and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him."

   In comparing of all these texts, it seems plain, that both the power of
   remitting and retaining sins, and the strange efficacy of prayer, which
   were promised to the apostles and first Christians, had something
   miraculous and extraordinary in them, and were peculiar to the first
   ages of the church. I will not be peremptory in these things; but this
   seems to be the most genuine and reasonable interpretation of these
   texts.

   Sixthly, And, besides these which I have mentioned, there was likewise
   a power of inflicting corporal punishments and diseases upon scandalous
   and obstinate Christians; which in Scripture is called, "a delivering
   men up to Satan, for the destroying or tormenting of their bodies, that
   their souls might be saved at last." And of this kind were those
   diseases which befel the Christians, for their disorderly and irregular
   carriage at the sacrament, of which the apostle speaks; (1 Cor. xi.
   30.) "For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
   sleep:" that is, to some of them these distempers proved mortal. And we
   find that this power did in some cases extend to the inflicting of
   sudden and present death, as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira. And,
   indeed, considering that Christianity was at first destitute of any
   countenance from the civil power, some such power as this was necessary
   to maintain the authority of the apostles against the contumacious and
   disobedient.

   And then, lastly, there was the power of casting out devils in the name
   of Christ, which was common to the meanest Christian, and continued in
   the church a long time after most of the other gifts were ceased, as
   Tertullian, Minucius Felix, and Arnobius, do most expressly testify
   concerning their times.

   Thus you see that there were almost all imaginable kinds of miraculous
   powers conferred upon the apostles and first Christians, to give the
   greater establishment and confirmation to the Christian doctrine.

   All the reflection I shall make upon what has been said, shall be this;
   since our religion comes down to us confirmed by such miraculous
   powers, we ought to take the more earnest heed to it, to believe it
   more steadfastly, and to practise it more carefully in our lives. "For
   if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and
   disobedience received a just recompence of reward; how shall we escape,
   if we neglect so great salvation?"

SERMON CCXXX.

  OF THE MIRACLES WROUGHT IN CONFIRMATION OF CHRISTIANITY.

   God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with
   divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own
   will.--Heb. ii. 4.

   IN these words, three things offer themselves to our consideration.

   First, That miracles are a Divine testimony given to a person or
   doctrine.

   Secondly, That God gave this testimony to the apostles and first
   publishers of the gospel in a very eminent manner. Of these two I have
   discoursed at large, and now proceed to the

   Third and last thing which I proposed, viz. the reason why these
   miracles are now ceased in the Christian church, and have been for a
   long time, so that there have been no footsteps of this miraculous
   power for many ages. And in the handling of this argument, I shall do
   these three things:

   I. Shew that these miraculous gifts and powers have ceased in the
   Christian church for several ages.

   II. I shall assign a plain reason of the ceasing of miracles after such
   a time.

   III. Answer the objection from the innumerable miracles which have been
   and are still pretended to be wrought in the church of Rome.

   I. I shall shew, that these miraculous powers and gifts have ceased in
   the church for several ages.

   That they are now ceased we find by certain experience; nor are they
   pretended to at this day by any part of the Christian church, except
   the church of Rome, where yet they are nothing so plentiful now-a-days,
   as they were in those ignorant ages, from the time of the degeneracy
   and corruption of the western church down to the Reformation; and now
   chiefly pretended to in those parts of the Roman communion, where their
   religion reigns without any contradiction, and the people are under the
   awe and lash of the Inquisition, so that they dare neither gainsay, nor
   offer to detect the forgery and imposture of them; and yet here is less
   need of them, be cause the people are all of a mind, and believe as the
   church would have them, and dare not for their lives do otherwise. For
   where the Inquisition rules, and ignorance, the mother, not of true
   devotion, but of credulity and superstition, is carefully preserved,
   there is no need of miracles to make people believe what they have a
   mind to: but in other places, where their religion is opposed, and
   there is great occasion for them, both to confirm those of their own
   religion, and to reduce heretics and unbelievers, there is little or no
   pretence to them, as I shall shew by and by.

   So that all over the Christian church, except in the church of Rome,
   all pretence to these miraculous powers and gifts is now ceased, and
   hath been for many ages. St. Chrysostom, speaking of his time, which
   was about four hundred years after Christ, says that these miraculous
   powers were then ceased, and speaks as if no footsteps of them were
   left in the pastors and governors of the church, much less among
   private Christians; for which he gives us this substantial reason
   (which I shall speak to afterwards) that Christianity being now already
   established by miracles, there was no reason to expect the continuance
   of them. St. Augustine indeed, sometime after, speaks of many
   miraculous things done at sepulchres of the martyrs. But this doth not
   contradict what St. Chrysostom had said, be cause he speaks of the
   living teachers and members of the church, in whom those miraculous
   gifts and powers were ceased: but that the same miraculous cures were
   wrought upon the prayers of Christians, at the tombs of the martyrs, is
   a confirmation of the thing, that God designed to honour the primitive
   Christians and martyrs with these gifts, and not to continue them to
   the succeeding ages of the church; and therefore God was pleased that
   so many wonderful things should be done at their sepulchres, to shew
   that he did intend, that these miraculous powers and gifts should die
   with them, and continue no longer in the living members of the church.

   II. I shall now assign a plain reason of the ceasing of these
   miraculous gifts after such a time; namely, because there was not the
   like necessity and occasion for them, that there was before. They were
   at first in a great degree necessary to introduce the gospel into the
   world, which was destitute of all other helps and advantages, to
   recommend it to the esteem and liking of mankind; to give credit to a
   new doctrine and religion, so contrary to the inveterate prejudices of
   men, bred up in another religion very different from this, and so
   opposite to the lusts and interests of men; to make way for the more
   speedy and effectual planting of this religion in the world; to
   strengthen the hands of the first publishers of it, and to give credit
   to their testimony, concerning that strange relation of theirs, of the
   resurrection of Christ from the dead; to be a sensible evidence and
   conviction to men, of the divinity of that new doctrine which was
   preached unto them, and to support and confirm them in the belief and
   profession of it, against those terrible sufferings and persecutions,
   which for the sake of it they were exposed to. For these reasons God
   was pleased to shed abroad so plentifully these miraculous gifts, among
   the first preachers of Christianity; and as these reasons ceased or
   abated, so did these miraculous powers and gifts; and therefore, as
   soon as the gospel was planted, which it was in a great part of the
   then known world, during the lives of the apostles, the gift of tongues
   ceased, and we hear no more of it, because there was no farther use and
   occasion for it. Other gifts did continue longer, but abated by
   degrees, according as Christianity gained ground and establishment, and
   they grew less frequent, as there was less need of them. The power of
   casting out devils, which was most common (for every Christian had it)
   continued longest; and there was reason it should continue so long as
   the devil reigned, and the pagan idolatry was kept up, to shew that the
   Spirit of Christ was superior to the devil, and would finally overcome
   him, and over throw his kingdom, according to that of St. John, (1 John
   iv. 4.) "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them:
   because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
   And this appeared in that they were able in the name of Christ to cast
   him out, wherever he had taken possession, which God permitted to be
   very frequent in those times, for the more glorious manifestation of
   his power, "in casting out the prince of this world." But when the
   powers of the world became Christian, and the heathen idolatry was
   every where over thrown, and Satan's kingdom every where destroyed,
   then this miraculous gift also ceased, there being no farther occasion
   for it. And now that "the kingdoms of the world were become the
   kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ," and that the gospel was
   planted, and had taken firm root and was fully settled and established,
   these miraculous powers, which were at first necessary to balance the
   mighty difficulties and oppositions which Christianity met withal, and
   to supply the want of all manner of countenance from the civil
   authority, were with drawn and did cease, because there was no need of
   their longer continuance.

   Besides that it is to be considered, that those miraculous powers which
   manifested themselves in the first ages of Christianity, were intended
   by God to give a standing confirmation to it in after ages; as the
   miracles that were wrought at the giving of the law, and the bringing
   of the children of Israel into Canaan, were designed for a standing
   confirmation of the Jewish religion, the memory whereof was so
   carefully preserved and transmitted to after ages, that they needed not
   to be repeated.

   I come now in the

   Third and last place to answer that objection from the innumerable
   miracles which have been, and still are pretended to be, wrought in the
   church of Rome. And so indeed we find that the Arians and other
   heretics in former times pretended to miracles, for the confirmation of
   their errors, a good while after miracles were generally ceased in the
   Christian church, which shews that this is no new or strange thing.

   In answer to this objection, I desire these following particulars may
   be considered:

   First, That the most learned and judicious writers of the Roman church
   do acknowledge that there is no necessity of miracles now, and that
   Christianity is sufficiently established by the miracles which were
   wrought at first to give testimony to it; and therefore, not being
   necessary, without manifest evidence of fact, it is not necessary to
   believe that they are continued.

   Secondly, The miracles pretended to by the church of Rome are of very
   doubtful and suspected credit, even among the wisest persons of their
   own communion; and therefore, I hope they do not expect we should give
   much credit to those miracles, of the truth of which they themselves
   are in so much doubt, that they are generally looked upon by the more
   prudent and learned among them as pious frauds, to raise and entertain
   the devotion of the weak and ignorant. Several of them have been
   convicted of fraud and imposture, not only here in England, in times of
   popery, and at the beginning of the Reformation, but in other
   countries, where that religion bears sway.

   And it is observable, that the greatest part of the history of these
   miracles (which they call legends) was written in the romance age, and
   much in the same style, with the like wantonness and extravagance of
   fancy, and fulsome absurdity of invention, and, it is to be feared,
   with the like regard to truth. And I know not whether romances had not
   their name, as well as their original, from these Roman legends, of
   which they are exact copies and imitations; and as these were sacred,
   so those were a sort of civil legends, in which they represented their
   heroes doing the like absurd feats and miracles in chivalry, as their
   saints in their legends are said to do in religion; and they were both
   written by the lazy and unlearned monks, and by them dressed up and
   fitted to the gust of those ignorant and superstitious ages.

   And yet these legends of "lying wonders" have not only been put into
   the hands of the people, but lessons out of them have been taken, as
   out of the Scriptures, and distributed into the public offices of their
   church, to be read there, as the Scriptures are, and instead of them;
   only with this difference--that the people are permitted to have the
   Scriptures only in an unknown tongue, but the legends, out of which
   these lessons are taken, they are permitted to have at home, in their
   own tongue; as if there was no danger of error or heresy from false
   stories, but only from the word of truth. And herein is remarkably
   fulfilled that prophecy concerning the followers of antichrist, (2
   Thess. ii. 11.) that "be cause they received not the truth in the love
   of it, God would send them strong delusions, (ene'rgeian pla'nes, the
   efficacy of imposture,) that they should believe a lie." And how could
   they more solemnly declare the belief and love of lies, than by putting
   these ridiculous fables into the public offices of the church, in place
   of the Holy Scriptures; and at the same time that they deny to the
   people the use of the Scriptures in a known tongue, to permit them the
   use, and to recommend to them the reading, of these lying legends, out
   of which these ridiculous lessons are taken?

   Thirdly, The miracles of the church of Rome, supposing several of them
   to be true, have such marks and characters upon them, as render it very
   suspicious that they are not operations of God, or good spirits, but
   the working of Satan. If any man have but the patience to rake into
   these dung hills, and to read over these legends, even as they have by
   the latter collectors and compilers been purged and reformed, he shall
   find the miracles recited in them, to be generally of one stamp, very
   foolish and absurd, frivolous and trifling, wrought without any
   necessity, upon no good occasion, to no wise end and purpose; so that
   one may know them by their very countenances to be the tricks and
   pranks of the devil, and not the great and glorious works of God, such
   as are the miracles recorded in the Holy Scriptures.

   Fourthly, The miracles of the church of Rome, taking them for true, are
   very impertinently and unreasonably wrought. When and where there is no
   need and occasion for them, they are very rife and frequent; but where
   there is greatest occasion for them, and most reason to expect them,
   they are either not at all, or very rarely so much as pretended to. In
   times and places where their religion did most absolutely bear sway,
   and few or none durst oppose it, and where the doctrines which they
   pretended to confirm by these miracles were most generally believed, as
   in those long, dark, and ignorant times before the Reformation, and now
   in Italy and Spain, where the Inquisition forceth them all to be of one
   belief, or to profess to be so; in these times and places, where there
   was least need and occasion for miracles, then and there did they most
   abound, even more, (if we may believe their histories) for several ages
   before the Reformation, than in the times of our Saviour and his
   apostles. But since the Reformation, and that many of their doctrines
   are called in question and disbelieved, miracles are grown rare, and
   almost ceased, even in popish countries; and they have had but very ill
   success with those few they have pretended to; witness the miracle at
   Angiers in France, of a child appearing over the altar at the time of
   mass, to convince all people of the doctrine of transubstantiation,
   with which the papists made such a noise here in England about fourteen
   or fifteen years ago, and which at last was discovered to be an
   artificial juggle and contrivance of some cunning priest, and published
   to the world for a cheat, by the honest and worthy bishop of that
   place.

   But where there seems to be the most need of them, they are most
   wanting: as for the conversion of heathens, and the conviction of
   heretic infidels. For the conversion of heathens: in which case, if men
   did sincerely design the propagation of the true and uncorrupted
   Christianity, I do not see why miracles might not yet reasonably be
   expected; but yet for all this, we hear of very few miracles, not so
   much as the gift of tongues, even upon this occasion. In the first
   planting of the West Indies, we hear of no miracles, except the most
   prodigious cruelties that ever were in the world, to the infinite
   scandal of the Christian name. And in the East Indies, and China,
   Xaverius and the first missionaries speak with no assurance of any
   miracles wrought by them; and since that time, they have so depraved
   the Christian religion there, by concealing a most essential part of
   it, the death and sufferings of our Saviour, as if they were "ashamed
   of the cross of Christ/ that it is not credible, that God should
   vouchsafe the countenance of miracles to those who "preach another
   gospel."

   And then for the conviction of heretics (as they are pleased to call us
   protestants) one would think miracles (since they have that power)
   would be very proper for that purpose to be wrought among them; as now
   here in England, where they are continually endeavouring (but
   especially of late with more than usual vigour and hopes) to restore
   their religion, and yet for all this, we cannot prevail with them to
   favour us with the sight of one miracle, in order to our conviction;
   but if they have any, they keep them private among themselves, though
   both reason and Scripture tell us, that miracles were not intended for
   them that believe, but to convince them that believe not.

   Fifthly, He from whom of all persons in that church we might expect the
   most and greatest miracles, does not, so far as I can learn, pretend at
   all to that gift; I mean the head of their church, the pope, who, both
   as he is vicar of Christ, and successor of St. Peter in his full power
   and office, or if he be not his successor, yet as he is his shadow, and
   pretends to be his successor, might fairly pretend to a power of
   miracles above any in that church; and I have often wondered why he
   does not: but it seems he contents himself with infallibility, which is
   privilege and power enough for one man; and indeed, if he had it, and
   could satisfy others that he hath it, that would serve his turn without
   miracles: but the mischief of it is, there is no other external
   evidence which can reasonably satisfy others of any man's inspiration
   or infallibility, but miracles; and therefore, the pope hath done very
   unadvisedly, in pretending to one without the other, when he hath the
   same right and title to both; that is, none at all.

   Sixthly, Most of the doctrines in difference between us and the church
   of Rome, which they chiefly pretend to confirm by these miracles, are
   not capable of being confirmed by them. There are three sorts of
   doctrines, two of which are in their own nature incapable of being
   confirmed by a miracle, and a third upon supposition of its contrariety
   to the Christian doctrine, which hath already had an unquestionable
   Divine confirmation.

   1. No doctrine which is contrary to sense, is capable of being
   confirmed by a miracle, as transubstantiation; which, because it
   necessarily requires the renouncing of our senses, in order to the
   belief of it, for that very reason miracles can give no credit to it.
   For that which depends on the certainty of sense, as miracles certainly
   do, can be no competent argument to prove that which is contrary to
   sense, as transubstantiation is.

   2. No doctrine that does countenance or enjoin idolatry is capable of
   being confirmed by a miracle. This is evident from Deut. xiii. where
   Moses supposeth that a prophet might work a sign or a wonder; but if it
   was to seduce them from the worship of the true God, who is naturally
   known, to the worship of idols, in that case they were not. to hearken
   to him, notwithstanding he wrought a miracle; but the church of Rome
   teacheth idolatry in their worship of images, and of the host, and in
   the invocation of saints and angels.

   3. No doctrine contrary to any part of the Christian doctrine, which
   hath already received an unquestionable Divine confirmation, is capable
   of being confirmed by the miracles pretended to in the church of Rome,
   if they were real. For I hope they have not the face to pretend their
   miracles to be equal to those of our Saviour and his apostles, either
   for the certainty or greatness of them; and I have already shewn, that
   they notoriously want both the credit and certainty of our Saviour's
   miracles, and the marks of their divinity.

   Now several of the doctrines of that church are directly contrary to,
   or inconsistent with, the doctrines of Christianity. Their endeavour to
   conceal from people the doctrine of the gospel, contained in the Holy
   Scriptures, is a notorious contradiction to the design of the gospel,
   and to that particular miracle whereby the knowledge of it was conveyed
   to the world, the gift of tongues; and then the ser vice of God in an
   unknown tongue, which is inconsistent with true devotion, contrary to
   edification, and to the plain scope and design of a whole chapter of
   St. Paul to the Corinthians. And so likewise is the communion in one
   kind, to our Saviour's express institution; and the repetition of
   Christ's sacrifice, to as express a declaration of the apostle to the
   Hebrews to the contrary, as it is possible for words to make.

   Seventhly and lastly, which falls heaviest upon them of all, the chief
   prophecies of the New Testament, which are concerning false prophets,
   and concerning antichrist, have marked him out by this character, that
   he should be a great worker of miracles, and magnify himself upon this
   pretence. (Matt. xxiv. 24.) "For there shall arise false Christs, and
   false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders, insomuch that
   (if it were possible) they shall deceive the very elect." And (2 Thess.
   ii. 9, 10.) St. Paul foretells there, that in the great degeneracy and
   falling away of the Christian church, "the man of sin shall come after
   the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and wonders of lies,"
   that is, either false miracles, or miracles wrought to confirm false
   doctrines, "and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness," all the
   legerdemain and juggling tricks of falsehood and imposture; and
   certainly nothing was ever more visible than these are in the church of
   Rome; whether we consider their impudent forgeries of writings (which
   they have not the face now to deny), or the nature and character of
   their miracles. So that though Bellarmine is pleased to make miracles
   one of the marks of the true church, yet the miracles of the church of
   Rome, if we consider all the circumstances of them, are one of the
   plainest marks of antichrist, and the very brand of the beast, as we
   find him described, (Rev. xiii. 13, 14.) "And he doth great wonders,
   and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth, by means of those miracles
   which he had power to do."

   And now the church of Rome may be allowed to work miracles; and yet
   Divine miracles, such as were wrought for the first confirmation of
   Christianity, may be ceased in the church; which is a sufficient answer
   to the objection, and upon the whole matter shews, that the miracles
   pretended to in the church of Rome, are so far from giving any
   confirmation to her doctrines, that they are rather an evident proof
   that she is the apostate and antichristian church.

   I might now draw two or three inferences from this whole discourse. As,

   I. We have great reason to admire the wisdom and goodness of God in the
   dispensation of the gospel, that, by the sending down of his Holy
   Spirit to endow the first publishers of this heavenly doctrine with
   such miraculous gifts and powers, he hath given such abundant testimony
   to the truth of our religion, and such firm grounds for our faith to
   rely upon.

   II. The consideration of what hath been said convinceth men of the
   great sin of infidelity, and the unreasonableness of it, after so clear
   conviction and demonstration as God hath given to the world of the
   truth of Christianity.

   III. And lastly, They who believe the gospel, are utterly inexcusable,
   if they do not obey it, and live according to it. For this is the great
   end of all the miracles which God hath wrought for the confirmation of
   Christianity, that by the belief of the gospel men might be brought to
   "the obedience of faith," and live conformably to the precepts of that
   holy religion, which the Son of God by so many miracles hath planted
   and preserved in the world. But these I have [12] discoursed of on
   another occasion, and therefore shall insist upon them no farther at
   this time.

SERMON CCXXXI.

  THE ADVANTAGES OF TRUTH, IN OPPOSITION TO ERROR.

   Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater
   is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. They are of the
   world; therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth
   them.--1 John iv. 4, 5.

   IN the beginning of this chapter, the apostle cautions Christians
   against the false teachers, and false prophets, intending more
   especially those of the gnostic sect, as is plain from the scope of the
   whole Epistle, who were so busy to seduce Christians to their impious
   ways, and to tempt them to apostatize from the Christian religion to
   the heathen idolatry, for fear of persecution.

   And to encourage them who had hitherto continued in the truth, and
   resisted the seducing arts of those false prophets, still to persevere
   in their holy profession and practice, he tells them what advantages
   they, who have embraced the truth and lived according to it, have above
   those who seduce men to errors, or are seduced by them. "Ye are of God,
   little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is
   in you, than he that is in the world." That which gives truth and the
   professors of it the advantage over error and seducers, is, that truth
   is from God, and the Spirit of God dwells in those who sincerely
   embrace and obey it.

   "Ye are of God," that is, ye are taught by him, and instructed in the
   doctrine which is from God, and relish Divine truth, which our Saviour
   calls savouring the things which are of God, in opposition to the
   things of the world, the lusts and interests of the world which sway
   and rule in those false prophets and seducing spirits. For so it
   follows in the next verse, "they are of the world;" they are acted by
   worldly lusts and interests: "therefore speak they of the world;" they
   teach things suitable to their worldly affections and interests: "and
   the world heareth them," they who are of the same temper are seduced
   and led away by them.

   So that the apostle's design in these words, is plainly to shew the
   great advantage which truth and the sincere professors of it have above
   error, and the teachers and disciples of it.

   "Ye are of God." This phrase is very frequently , and very peculiarly
   used by St. John; it signifies to belong to God in a special and
   peculiar manner, and is the same with "being born of God," and "being
   the children of God," (chap. iii. 10.) "In this the children of God are
   manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever cloth not
   righteousness, is not of God." Where you see to be "of God, "and to be
   "the children of God," are the same thing: and so to be the children of
   the devil, and to be of the devil, are by this apostle used in the same
   sense, (chap. iii. 8.) "He that committeth sin is of the devil." And,
   (ver. 12.) "Cain was of that wicked one," that is, a child of the
   devil, as he had called such before, (ver. 10.) And because children do
   resemble their parents in nature and disposition, therefore those who
   are of a Divine temper and disposition, who relish the things of God,
   and are apt to embrace the truths of God when they are duly propounded
   to them, are ready to be taught of God, are said likewise to be of God:
   (John viii. 47.) "He that is of God, heareth God's words: ye therefore
   hear them not, because ye are not of God." So here in the text, "Ye are
   of God;" ye are of a temper and disposition apt to relish Divine
   things, ready to embrace the truths of God, and ye have entertained
   them, and are his children, and are led by his Spirit, and have the
   Spirit of God dwelling in you; and this makes you victorious. "Ye have
   overcome them." He had spoken immediately before of false prophets and
   antichrist, by which he doth point out not one particular person, but
   the whole number and faction of false teachers, as he tells us, (chap.
   ii. 18.) that "now there are many antichrists. Ye are of God, and have
   overcome them/ This hath enabled you to resist those seducing spirits,
   and made you too hard for them, that "ye are of God; because greater is
   he that is in you, than he that is in the world." The force of the
   reasoning is this: "Ye are of God," that is, ye are taught of God, and
   have received his doctrine, and are born again by the word of God, and
   are his children, and being his children, ye have his Spirit; and the
   Spirit of truth and of God is a stronger principle, than that spirit of
   error and seduction which is in the world, that is, the devil. Greater
   is he that is in yon, than he that is in the world." The Spirit of
   truth is more powerful than the spirit of error and seduction; and
   consequently they that are of God, who sincerely embrace and obey the
   truth, are able to over come all the temptations of the world to
   apostacy from the truth.

   My work at this time shall be to shew, what advantage good men, and
   those who sincerely embrace and obey truth, have to secure them in the
   ways of truth and holiness, against all the temptations of the devil
   and the world. I say, in the ways of truth and holiness, because there
   is a strict connexion between a hearty embracing of the truth of God,
   and a sincere obedience to it. And the apostle speaks of both, in
   opposition to the gnostics, who did not only endeavour to seduce men to
   apostacy from Christian faith, but likewise from the practice of a holy
   life. Now to secure men against temptations to both these, they who are
   of God, who sincerely embrace and obey the truth, have a great
   advantage, because that spirit and principle, which rules and sways in
   them, is more powerful than that spirit which rules in the world and in
   the children of disobedience. "Greater is he that is in you, than he
   that is in the world;" and that in these three respects:

   First, Divine truth carries greater evidence along with it.

   Secondly, The motives to persuade men to adhere to truth and holiness,
   are more operative and powerful.

   Thirdly, There is a greater and more immediate assistance accompanies
   the truth of God, and they who entertain it are acted by a more
   powerful principle than that which is in the world.

   First, Divine truth carries greater evidence along with it. As will
   appear if we consider three things:

   I. The doctrines that are from God have more intrinsic goodness in
   them, and teach such things as are more worthy of God, and more likely
   to proceed from him.

   II. The external confirmation of these doctrines is greater and hath
   more conviction in it.

   III. The Spirit of God doth illuminate the minds of good men, and is
   concerned to lead them into the truth, and to secure them from
   dangerous and damnable errors.

   I. The doctrines which are from God, have a more intrinsical goodness
   in them, and teach such things as are most worthy of God, and more
   likely to proceed from him. Whoever supposeth God to make a revelation
   of himself to men whereby to conduct them to happiness, must in all
   reason suppose such a Divine doctrine to contain plain rules and
   directions to that end, and powerful helps, motives, and
   encouragements, to enable and excite men to the observation of those
   rules. For a man would naturally reason, that God, who is so infinitely
   good, would, in revealing his will to men, aim at no other end, but the
   happiness of his creatures: and that he being infinitely wise as well
   as good, the means would be proportionable, and consequently that the
   laws and precepts which he gives would apparently tend to the happiness
   of mankind: and because, if men have immortal souls, and are designed
   to live for ever, their greatest happiness is that of another world;
   therefore it is reasonable to conclude, that those rules and directions
   should principally regard the eternal happiness of men in another life,
   and in subserviency to that, should respect likewise the temporal
   happiness of men in this world.

   And such laws and rules being supposed, the next thing to be expected
   is, that God should consider the condition and circumstances of persons
   to whom these laws are given; and if they be averse to them, that they
   should be awakened and quickened to the observance of them, by such
   motives and encouragements as are proper and powerful to that end; and
   if they be weak and impotent to the performance of what God's laws
   require, that they should be enabled and assisted by a proportionable
   strength.

   Now the doctrine of the Christian religion, which our blessed Saviour
   revealed to the world, and (as we Christians say,) by Divine commission
   and authority, hath all these marks and characters of divinity upon it.
   The laws of it are plain and obvious to the common understanding of
   mankind; all men know what the precepts of piety, and goodness, and
   mercy, and righteousness, and integrity, and truth, and faithfulness,
   of meekness, and humility, and patience, and forgiveness, and
   forbearance, and charity, mean; and so I might instance in temperance
   and chastity, and all those other virtues and graces which the
   Christian religion requires of us, and recommends to us. These all tend
   to the advancement and perfection of our natures, and make us like to
   God, and capable of the enjoyment of him in the next life; and besides
   this, they do apparently conduce in all respects to our temporal
   happiness in this world. And excepting the case of persecution (to
   which God hath promised abundant recompence in another world,) the
   practice of these virtues is evidently to the advantage of particular
   persons in this world, and to the peace and happiness of human society.

   And, because of the great corruption of human nature, and the strong
   inclinations of it to vice, the gospel offers proportionable arguments
   and encouragements to men to persuade them to their duty; an act of
   oblivion and pardon for what is past; perfect reconciliation to God in
   and through the merits and mediation of our blessed Saviour, and the
   eternal rewards and punishments of another world; which to men that
   believe the immortality of their souls, and are not stupidly insensible
   of their interest, are the most powerful considerations in the world to
   take men off from sin, and to bring them to goodness.

   And because the corruption of human nature hath brought a great
   weakness and impotency upon mankind, God is pleased in the gospel to
   offer to men the powerful assistance of his grace and Holy Spirit, to
   enable them to perform all this which he requires of them. And beyond
   this, what can we expect God should discover to men, in order to their
   happiness in this world, or the other? And in all these respects the
   doctrine of the gospel, revealed from heaven by the Son of God, hath,
   to any impartial considerer, infinitely the advantage of paganism or
   Mahometanism, or any other doctrine or institution that ever the world
   was acquainted withal.

   But now, if we bring the doctrines of false prophets and seducing
   spirits, whom St. John calls antichrists, to this trial, we shall find
   that they are quite of another stamp, destitute of goodness, and
   calculated not for the happiness and benefit of men, but for base and
   unworthy ends; whereby it is evident, that the teachers of them are not
   "of God, but of the world," and "therefore they speak of the world, and
   the world heareth them." And of this I will give two instances; one in
   those false teachers the gnostics, intended by the apostle in this
   Epistle; and the other in a sort of seducers nearer to us in our own
   times.

   As for the gnostics, besides their contradicting and virtual renouncing
   the main principles of Christianity, by denying that Christ was really
   come in the flesh, or that he really died, or rose, affirming all this
   to be only in appearance; the sum of their doctrine was either a heap
   of unintelligible words and phrases, under a pretence of a high
   mystery; or a doctrine of liberty, as to all manner of vice and
   wickedness, under a pretence of perfection, and that whatever they did,
   they could not sin; both which at the first sight are as plain evidence
   as any reasonable man can desire, that such a doctrine could not be
   from God; nothing being more unlikely to be a Divine revelation, than
   such absurd and confused stuff as no man can understand, and which hath
   no tendency to make men better. But above all, nothing can be more
   unworthy of God, nor more unlikely to proceed from him, than such a
   doctrine as gives encouragement to vice and wickedness of life, under
   what pretence soever it be. For what can be more contrary to God, and a
   greater affront to the reason of mankind, than to let men loose to do
   the vilest and lewdest things, under pretence of perfection in
   goodness?

   The other instance I intend is nearer at hand, and concerns us more,
   and that is in the church of Rome, and those false teachers which she
   sends abroad into the world, and which at this day swarm among us; and
   never did any character more unluckily agree to any sort of men than
   this of the apostle does to that church and the teachers of it, that
   "they are of the world, and therefore they speak of the world, and the
   world heareth them."

   In which words there are three remarkable characters given of the false
   prophets and teachers.

   1. That they are acted by a worldly spirit, and carry on a secular
   interest and design; "they are of the world."

   2. That they teach things suitable to their worldly interest and
   design, and therefore they speak ek tou ko'smou, "from the world,"
   according to that worldly spirit that acts them, and rules in them.

   .3. Those that hearken to them are a sort of people like themselves, of
   worldly affections and interests; "the world heareth them."

   1. They are acted by a worldly spirit, and carry on a secular interest
   and design of greatness and ambition, of dominion and tyranny, of
   riches and wealth. Any man that considers the church of Rome at this
   day, and by what steps and degrees, by what worldly ways and unworthy
   means, she hath attained to that power and wealth and greatness, to
   that dominion and tyranny, which now for several hundreds of years she
   hath exercised, not only over the consciences of men in the most cruel
   manner, but even over temporal princes and states, in commanding their
   treasures and armies, in deposing kings, and disposing of their
   kingdoms, and in all imaginable instances of secular dominion and
   tyranny, cannot but be satisfied by what spirit they are acted, and
   that they as visibly carry on a worldly interest and design, as the
   most ambitious secular prince ever did.

   2. They teach things suitable to their worldly designs and interests.
   Let but any man impartially survey those which are the proper doctrines
   of the Romish church, and which we challenge for innovation and
   corruption of the truly ancient catholic and Christian doctrine, and it
   will at first sight be evident to him, whither these doctrines tend,
   and that they do not serve the ends of religion, but of worldly
   greatness and dominion. What greater instance of ambition, than the
   claim of the universal supremacy of the bishop of Rome over all
   Christians and churches in the world, without the least ground, or
   indeed colour of ground, either from Scripture or antiquity; and not
   only of an universal spiritual power over Christians, but of an
   indirect temporal power over princes in order to spiritual ends, which
   may be extended to any thing, and hath been, upon occasion, to the
   donation of kingdoms, and the deposing of princes, and the transferring
   of temporal dominion from lawful and hereditary princes, to those who
   had no manner of right or title? What more arrogant and directly
   tending to the enslaving of mankind, than their pretence to
   infallibility, which yet they could never agree among themselves where
   to place? What greater tyranny can be exercised over mankind, than to
   oblige them to an implicit faith, and blind obedience to believe what
   the church believes, though they do not know what it is; and to do what
   the church commands, though they doubt never so much of the lawfulness
   of it? Than to hide the word of God from them, and to lock it up in an
   unknown tongue, and to deter them from the free use of that which was
   designed by God to be the great instrument of the salvation of mankind?
   Than not to let men exercise their understandings in the service of
   God; nor, when they join in public prayers, to suffer them to know what
   it is they ask of God; as if the priests lips were so to preserve
   knowledge, as to keep it all to themselves, and not to make use of it
   for the benefit and edification of the people? And lastly, to impose
   upon men, under pain of damnation, the belief of doctrines, not only
   contrary to the true sense of Scripture, but to all the sense and
   reason of mankind, as is the doctrine of transubstantiation? How is it
   possible to bring people into a greater subjection to the priests, and
   dependance upon them, than by auricular confession, and that
   unreasonable doctrine of making the efficacy of the sacraments to
   depend upon the intention of the priest; and consequently, to put it
   into the power of a malicious and bad man to damn all his parish? And
   to mention but one thing more, what better contrivance could be thought
   of to enrich the church, and drain the purses of the people, than their
   doctrines of purgatory and prayers for the dead, of indulgences and
   satisfaction, and their forms of sins and vices of all kinds, called
   the tax of the apostolic chamber? Can any man think that these and
   such-like doctrines are "of God," which do so directly serve the ends
   of covetousness and ambition? Any one that does not wilfully shut his
   eyes, may plainly see that such doctrines, and such teachers, are "of
   the world," and that they speak and teach these things out of a worldly
   interest and design.

   And here I might take notice likewise, that "they speak from the
   world," also, in another sense, by shewing what worldly and indirect
   means (not to say wicked and sinful arts) they commonly make use of to
   make disciples and gain proselytes, by flattery and falsehood, by
   concealing and misrepresenting their own doctrines and practices, by
   defaming their adversaries with known fictions and calumnies, tempting
   men from their religion by promises of temporal advantages, which, when
   they have gained them, they do not always perform and make good. Can
   any thing be more opposite to the genius of true religion, than to
   promote it by means so plainly contrary to the very nature and design
   of it?

   3. Those who hearken to them and are seduced by them, are generally
   like themselves; "they speak from the world, and the world heareth
   them." Not but that men of very honest and sincere minds may be seduced
   into great errors, through prejudice or weakness, or a melancholy
   superstition: but gene rally such a religion as is calculated for the
   promoting of secular interest, and is carried on by secular arts, does
   gain upon carnal and worldly minds; and it is usually some worldly
   consideration or other that prevails with men to embrace and profess
   it. A religion that can find out ways to save men without sincere
   repentance and a good life, is very fit to make proselytes in the
   world; they that teach such doctrines speak from the world, and the
   world is very apt to hear them.

   And thus I have done with the first thing, where by it appears, that
   Divine truth carries great evidence along with it, namely, that the
   doctrines which are from God, have more intrinsical goodness in them,
   and teach such things as are more worthy of God, and more likely to
   proceed from him. I will be briefer in the rest.

   II. The external confirmation of Divine doctrines is greater, and
   carries more conviction along with it. By external confirmation, I mean
   chiefly that of miracles. And though the pagan religion pretended to
   some, and our Saviour plainly foretold, that antichrists and false
   prophets should arise, and should "shew signs and wonders;" and St.
   Paul hath told us, that "the man of sin" should "come with signs, and
   wonders, and mighty power;" yet none of these are of any great
   consideration, in comparison of the many, and great, and unquestionable
   miracles, which were so universally wrought for the establishment of
   the Christian religion, and continued for some ages; they bear no
   manner of proportion to them, neither for the nature, nor number, nor
   circumstances of them, so as to shake or weaken any man's belief of the
   Christian religion, which had so much a greater confirmation given to
   it; especially when our Saviour did foretell, that false prophets
   should do some things of this kind. For after a religion is established
   by plain and unquestionable miracles, such as for their number, nature,
   publickness, and continuance, and all imaginable circumstances of
   advantage, were never upon any occasion wrought in the world; I say,
   after this, it is not reasonable, that one or two single miracles or
   wonders pretended to, or really wrought by a false prophet, should
   bring in question the truth of a religion confirmed by a long series of
   the greatest and most unquestionable miracles.

   Besides that the doctrine of it is such as is worthy of God, and most
   likely to proceed from him. [13]

   As for the miracles pretended to by the church of Rome, they are
   generally so fantastical and ridiculous, and so unlike the works of
   God, and wrought to no end and purpose, not among unbelievers for their
   conviction, which was always the great end of miracles, but among
   themselves, and so destitute of credit, that the wisest among
   themselves are so far from believing them, that they are heartily
   ashamed of them, so that we need not trouble ourselves about them, for
   they are not likely to give any great confirmation to any doctrine,
   which stand in so much need of confirmation themselves.

   III. Besides the goodness of the doctrines which are from God, and the
   external confirmation of them by miracles, which is a great advantage
   to the reception of them, the Spirit of God doth likewise illuminate
   good men, and those who are desirous to know the truth, and hath
   promised to lead them into it, and to assist them in discerning between
   truth and falsehood. So our Saviour hath assured us, (John vii. 17.)
   "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it
   be of God, or whether I speak of myself." Besides that the doctrines
   which are from God do commonly carry the marks and characters of their
   own divinity upon them; the providence of God is likewise particularly
   concerned, that good men, and those who are of honest minds, and
   sincerely desirous to know the truth, should not be deceived in matters
   of so great consequence to the happiness and salvation of mankind. To
   the same purpose is that promise, (John xiv. 21.) "He that hath my
   commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that
   loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him; and will
   manifest myself to him."

   God is always ready to reveal his will to those who are sincerely
   desirous to do it, and will not suffer men of honest minds to err
   dangerously in matters wherein their eternal salvation is concerned.

   Thus you see what advantage the Spirit of truth hath above the spirit
   of error and seduction; that Divine truth carries greater evidence
   along with it, both in respect of the goodness of the doctrines which
   are from God, and the great confirmation that is given to them, and the
   extraordinary illuminations of God's Spirit, which is wont to accompany
   the truths of God to the minds of good men, who are ready and disposed
   to give entertainment to Divine truth.

   I should now have proceeded to the second advantage which the Spirit of
   truth hath above the spirit of seduction, namely, that the motives to
   persuade men to adhere to truth and holiness, are more powerful and
   operative upon the minds of men, than the motives to the contrary.

   And then, Thirdly, That those who embrace and obey the truth of God,
   have a greater assistance, and are acted by a more powerful spirit and
   principle, than any is in the world: and this seems to be more
   especially the meaning of that in the text, "Ye are of God, little
   children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you,
   than he that is in the world." But these I shall not now enter upon.

SERMON CCXXXII.

  THE ADVANTAGES OF TRUTH, IN OPPOSITION TO ERROR.

   Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater
   is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. They are of the
   world; therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth
   them.--1 John iv. 4, 5.

   I PROCEED to the second advantage which the Spirit of truth hath above
   the spirit of error and seduction, namely, that the motives which good
   men have to persuade them to adhere to truth and holiness, are more
   powerful than the motives to the contrary. They who embraced the
   Christian religion, did firmly believe the eternal rewards and
   punishments of an other world; and this principle of faith being fixed
   and rooted in them, made them victorious over all the temptations of
   the world, over all the allurements and terrors of it; because they
   were fully persuaded of the happiness and misery of an other world; the
   happiness of those who continued steadfast in the faith and obedience
   of the gospel, and the dreadful misery and punishment of those who
   disobeyed the gospel of Christ, or apostatized from the profession of
   it. Hence it was that they were not to be moved by any temporal
   considerations, either of ease or advantage, or of trouble and
   persecution in this world. Their eternal interest lay so near their
   hearts, and they were so fully possessed with the belief of the
   everlasting rewards and punishments of another life, that they
   overlooked the goods and evils of this life; and all temporal
   considerations, put into the scales against their everlasting interest,
   were of no weight and moment with them.

   And this our apostle very particularly insists upon in this Epistle,
   (ch. v. 4, 5.) "Whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world;" the
   children of God are victorious over the temptations of the world; and
   then he tells us what it is that makes them so, "And this is the
   victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that
   overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
   God?" The believing that "Jesus is the Son of God," infers the belief
   of his doctrine, and consequently of that eminent part of it, the
   eternal recompence of another world, which, whosoever firmly believes,
   will be able to resist and overcome all the temptations of this world.
   For by the belief of the Christian religion, and faith in the Son of
   God, we are fully assured of the reality and certainty of the mighty
   rewards and punishments of another world, though they be future and at
   a distance; and a firm persuasion of these things, makes them in some
   sort present to us, as to their efficacy and operation; for to a wise
   and considerate man, a great good, or a great evil, which he believes
   will certainly befal him, according as he manageth his affairs well or
   ill, though it be at some distance, is of greater force than a far
   lesser good or evil which is present and nearer at hand. And of this we
   see many in stances in the temporal concerns of men. A prudent man will
   forego his present ease and pleasure, and part with a present
   advantage, lay down ready money, upon the certain prospect of a far
   greater benefit that will come to him some years hence; and will
   undergo present pain and trouble, to prevent a far greater mischief and
   inconvenience; and upon this principle of the belief of future good and
   evil, all the great affairs of the world are managed. Upon this
   principle men plough and sow, and venture their estates in traffic to
   foreign parts, and trust out their present stock, and purchase
   reversions, and take physic, and cut off a limb, and run all those
   hazards of estate and life, which we see men every day do; and all this
   for the securing of some great advantage, or the preventing of some
   great mischief, which, though it be future and at a distance, yet they
   probably or certainly foresee will happen to them.

   And this principle is so much the stronger, and of greater force and
   efficacy, in matters of greater moment and importance, where the good
   hoped for, or the evil feared, is infinitely great, and concerns us for
   ever. If we firmly believe the reality and certainty of it, no temporal
   advantage or affliction can come in competition with them, in the
   calculation and account of a wise man; because there is no proportion
   between finite and infinite, between the goods and evils which are
   temporal, and those which are eternal; though the one be seen, and the
   other not seen; though the one be present and near to us, and the other
   future and at a great distance.

   Upon this principle the first Christians continued firm and steadfast
   in the belief and obedience of the gospel, and were bold and open in
   the profession of it, notwithstanding all the cruel assaults of
   persecution, though they hazarded the loss of all that was dear to them
   in this world, and exposed themselves to the suffering of whatever is
   grievous and terrible to flesh and blood. They "gloried in
   tribulation;" and did not only patiently submit to the greatest
   sufferings, but heartily praised God, who "accounted them worthy to
   suffer for his name: they took joyfully the spoiling of their goods,
   knowing that, in heaven, they had a better and more en during
   substance; they were tortured not accepting deliverance, that they
   might obtain a better resurrection;" and when they were harassed with
   all the evils and calamities of human life, yet they fainted not,
   knowing "that their light affliction, which was but for a moment, would
   work for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory," having
   their minds fixed, "not upon the things which are seen, but upon the
   things which are not seen; the things which are seen being but
   temporal, but the things which are not seen being eternal."

   Thus they overcame the world, not by the force and power of this world,
   but by the belief of an other world, and of the mighty rewards and
   punishments of it. And this "faith purified their hearts," and reformed
   their lives, and made them steadfast and unmoveable in their holy
   profession, and raised their minds above all the temptations and
   terrors of present and sensible things.

   Let us now see on the contrary what kind of motives and arguments false
   teachers use to seduce men to their pernicious ways. "They speak from
   the world," and commonly make use of base, and low, and temporal
   considerations, of little tricks and devices, and "all deceivableness
   of unrighteousness," (as the Scripture calls it) to make disciples and
   gain proselytes. They terrify them with temporal dangers and
   inconveniences, and represent to them suffering, and persecution, and
   death, in all their frightful shapes, to deter them from profession of
   the true religion: they set before them all manner of worldly baits and
   allurements, ease, and wealth, and preferment; they promise them
   liberty from the strictness of those laws and rules which religion ties
   them up to. By these arts and arguments the gnostics of old used to
   tempt men from Christianity to shake their constancy in the profession
   of it; and the same ways are still put in practice by seducers at this
   day: they tell men of a glorious church that hath great power and
   interest in the world; they amuse them with a great deal of outward
   pomp and ceremony; they promise them preferment and great worldly
   advantages, by coming over to them; they threaten them with fire and
   faggot, with persecutions and massacres, and, where they have power,
   they hold them fast when they have gained them, by the terror of an
   Inquisition; they promise them liberty, and what by the looseness of
   their casuistical divinity, and by the easiness of their penances and
   absolutions, and the cheats of their indulgences, they have devised
   ways to reconcile almost the worst life that any man can lead, with
   fair hopes of getting to heaven at last. They tell them, indeed, they
   must make some stop in purgatory: but they have so many ways to release
   men from those sufferings, as do very much abate the terror of them, to
   any man that hath but credulity enough to believe them: for, besides
   the vast treasure of merits in the common bank of the church, which the
   pope hath in his disposal, and which nobody ought to doubt but that
   they are faithfully employed by him for the ease and deliverance of
   souls in purgatory; I say, besides these, there are so many particular
   ways of effecting this business, that a man of ordinary discretion,
   with an indifferent purse, may so order the matter, that he shall only
   pass through purgatory, but need not make any stay in that place of
   torments.

   But though these be their common motives and inducements to draw men to
   their communion, yet they do not wholly omit the arguments taken from
   the eternal happiness and misery of men in another world; for, to give
   them their due, there are no people in the world more prodigal of
   eternal salvation and damnation: they promise the one upon the easiest
   terms, and threaten the other upon the least displeasure: if a man be
   in their communion, he can hardly fail of salvation; and if he be out
   of it, and differ from them in the least point of faith, though but of
   their own making, he is sure to be damned, though he had the graces and
   virtues, the sanctity and charity, of an angel: and this is the true
   reason why these arguments, which are so powerful in themselves,
   signify so little from their mouths; because every man that hath read
   the Bible and understands the Christian religion, plainly sees, that
   they have made terms of salvation and damnation quite different from
   those which God hath constituted; so that these motives, which are so
   strong and mighty in themselves, quite lose their edge and force, when
   they are managed by seducers in so undue a manner, and to ends and
   purposes so cross to the main design of Christianity. This is the
   second advantage which the Spirit of truth hath above the spirit of
   error and seduction, that the motives to persuade men to adhere to
   truth and holiness, are really in themselves more powerful than the
   motives to error and seduction.

   Thirdly, Those who sincerely embrace and obey the truth of God, have a
   greater assistance, and are acted by a more powerful spirit and
   principle, than, that which is in the world; and this seems more
   especially to be the meaning of the reason here given in the text, why
   the Spirit of truth is victorious over the spirit of error and
   seduction; "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them:
   because greater is he that is in yon, than he that is in the world;"
   that is, the Spirit which is in good men, is more powerful than the
   devil, that evil spirit which inspires and acts the "children of
   disobedience."

   For the farther explication of this, I will do these three things:

   I. Shew that there are these two principles in the world, the Spirit of
   God, and the devil, very active and powerful in good and bad men.

   II. That the Spirit of God, which is in good men, is greater than he
   that is in the world.

   III. In what ways the Spirit of God doth move and assist good men.

   I. That there are these two principles in the world, the Spirit of God,
   and the devil, very active and powerful, the one in good, the other in
   bad men. This is very credible in the general, from the universal
   tradition and consent of mankind, in the belief of good and evil
   spirits attending men, and prompting them to good and evil; but we who
   embrace the revelation of the gospel have a much firmer and surer
   ground for it, nothing being more plain and frequent in Scripture, than
   that the Holy Spirit of God guides and assists good men in doing the
   will of God; and that the devil "works in the children of
   disobedience," and is always ready to tempt men to and promote any evil
   action or design. From hence it is, that the Scripture does almost
   every where ascribe all good motions and actions to the operation and
   influence of God's grace and Holy Spirit upon the minds of men; and the
   sins of men to the temptation and suggestion of the devil; and this is
   so well known to any one conversant in the Holy Scriptures, that I need
   not cite particular texts for the proof of it.

   It is true, indeed, that the motions of God's Holy Spirit, and the
   suggestions of the devil, are very secret to us, and imperceptible by
   us, so that no man can say certainly, that this good inclination or
   action is an immediate motion of God's Holy Spirit in me, or that evil
   thought and design is an immediate suggestion of the devil; it is
   sufficient for us, that we are assured from Divine revelation in
   general, that the Spirit of God very frequently does, and is always
   ready to assist good men in the doing or suffering of God's will; as
   the evil spirit, where God permits him, is always busy to tempt and
   seduce men to evil. And this ought not to be strange to us, because our
   Saviour hath expressly told us, that the Spirit of God works in men
   after an imperceptible manner; (John iii. 8.) "The wind bloweth where
   it listeth, and thou nearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell
   whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of
   the Spirit." Though we do not know the manner of the Spirit's working,
   nor perceive the operations of it upon our minds, yet we find the
   effects of it in the renovation and sanctification of our hearts. Thus,
   by undeniable arguments, men are assured of a Divine providence
   governing the world, though men do not always see, nor can make out to
   others, the particular interpositions of it, so as to say that this or
   that was an immediate effect of Divine Providence. To know certainly
   that a thing is, it is not necessary that we should be able to give a
   particular account of all its operations, and the manner of them; these
   may be hidden from us, and yet we may be sufficiently assured by other
   arguments that there is such a thing. Men are sure they have souls,
   though they can give no account how the actions of understanding, and
   remembrance, and sensation, are produced by them: so it is in the
   present case; we are sufficiently assured from the word of God, that
   good and bad spirits have a great influence upon the minds of men,
   though we be not conscious to their operations, and the manner of them.

   II. The Spirit of God which is in good men, is greater than he that is
   in the world; he is more able and ready to assist men to good purposes,
   than the devil is to tempt and help forward that which is evil. And
   this will appear, if we consider these three things:

   1. The Spirit of God is more powerful than the devil; and this is so
   evident in itself, that it needs no proof.

   2. The Spirit of God is as forward and willing to assist men to good
   purposes, as the devil is to the contrary. That extremity of malice and
   envy, which is in evil spirits, does, no doubt, make them very forward
   and active to do all the mischief they can to mankind, by tempting and
   seducing them to sin: but, on the other hand, the utmost perfection of
   goodness which in God is more and greater than the malice of the devil,
   will incline more strongly the Holy Spirit of God to pity and aid and
   help good men, than the malice of the devil can urge him to procure the
   harm and mischief of mankind; and if we could suppose their will and
   inclinations equal, yet our comfort is, their power is not.

   3. The Spirit of God hath a more free and immediate access to the minds
   of good men, and a more intimate conjunction with, and operation upon
   them, than the devil. The Spirit of God is always present to us, and
   willing to dwell and abide in us, and ready to help and assist us, if
   we be ready to obey his dictates, and comply with his holy and blessed
   motions; if we did not resist, and quench, and grieve him, he would
   always take up his abode and habitation in us, and would be continually
   exciting, and guiding, and assisting us to that which is good; he knows
   our hearts, and sees all the secrets of our souls; knows all our
   inclinations, knows our weakness and our danger, what assistance we
   want, and when it will be most seasonable; and is as intimate to us,
   and as conscious to all the motions of our spirits, as we ourselves
   are.

   But now the devil is under great restraint, and can not make nearer
   approaches to any man than God permits him; he does not know our
   hearts, nor can pry into the secret of our thoughts. God knows, but the
   devil does but guess at the thoughts, and designs, and inclinations of
   men; he hath no power over us, nor any access to us, but what we give
   him, or God permits. By obedience to God's will, and resisting the
   temptations of the devil to sin and disobedience, we may not only keep
   out the devil, but keep him at a great distance, and make him flee from
   us, so that we shall have little trouble or molestation from him; for
   though he be unwearied in his malicious attempts to ruin our souls,
   yet, be cause he cannot be every where, he haunts those most where he
   hath the greatest hopes of success; and is too eager and intent upon
   mischief to employ his time and temptations where he hath been often
   foiled, and hath reason to despair of victory. So that, if all things
   be considered, it is our own fault if we want the assistance of God's
   Holy Spirit, or if the devil have any great power over us: for God does
   not usually, but upon great provocation, take away his Holy Spirit from
   men, and lay them open to the assaults and temptations of the devil, ff
   any be led captive by the devil, at his pleasure, it is those who have
   wilfully forsaken God, and "sold themselves to do wickedly."

   III. We will consider in what ways the Spirit of God doth move and
   assist good men. These two ways:

   1 . By exciting good motions in us, and enabling us to bring them to
   effect.

   2. By supporting us under persecution for religion.

   1. By exciting good motions in us, and enabling us to bring them to
   effect. These the apostle puts together. (Phil. ii. 13.) "For it is God
   that worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good plea sure." It
   is he that stirs up good inclinations in us, and carries them on to
   effect. And this he makes an argument why we should be diligent and
   industrious in the work of our salvation, because God is so ready to
   assist us: "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it
   is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good
   pleasure."

   2. By supporting us under persecution for religion. In case of
   extraordinary temptations, and violent assaults upon our constancy in
   religion, by fierce and cruel persecutions, God affords immediate and
   extraordinary supports to good men, whereby they are many times borne
   up under the greatest sufferings, not only with patience, but with
   comfort and "joy unspeakable, and full of glory." Wherever God suffers
   good men to be tempted above humanity, he affords them an immediate
   Divine assistance, to bear them up, and make them victorious. So St.
   Peter tells us, (1 Pet. iv. 14.) "That those who suffer and are
   reproached for the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory and of God
   resteth upon them." So likewise, St. Paul, (1 Cor. x. 13.) speaking of
   those who had not yet been set upon by any sharp persecution, "No
   persecution hath taken you, but such as is common to man," ei me`
   anthro'pinos, nothing but what is human, what the spirit of man may
   bear: but if such a case happen, of temptation above nature, and the
   spirit of a man be too weak to support itself under it, God will, in
   that case, afford men immediate and extraordinary supports and
   comforts: "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
   what you are able; but will, with the temptation, also make a way to
   escape, that you may be able to bear it:" and then it immediately
   follows; "wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry;" because
   God hath promised such an extraordinary assistance, in case of
   persecution for religion, therefore he encourageth them to continue
   steadfast in the profession of Christianity, and cautions them against
   apostacy to the heathen idolatry.

   The inference from all this discourse is, to en courage us to continue
   steadfast in the truth, and in the practice of our holy religion, "to
   hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering," and not to
   suffer ourselves to be shaken "with every wind of doctrine," by the
   arts and cunning of those who "lie in wait to deceive; who creep into
   houses, and lead captive silly women, laden with sins, and led away by
   divers lusts." You see what kind of persons these false teachers used
   to proselyte; women of no virtue, of a prostituted reputation, "laden
   with sins, and led away with divers lusts;" a character that
   notoriously agrees to some seducers of our times.

   Therefore, let us "continue in the things which we have heard," and not
   suffer ourselves to be "moved from our steadfastness." The more we
   consider our religion, and compare it with the unquestionable
   revelation of God in the Holy Scriptures, the greater reason we shall
   see to adhere to it. The doctrines of our religion are of God, plainly
   contained in his word, and such as are worthy of him, and likely to
   proceed from him, and tend to the good and happiness of mankind, to
   make men really better, and to qualify them for that happiness which
   God hath promised to holy souls. The doctrines of our religion are free
   from the suspicions of a worldly interest and design. But if we
   consider the doctrines and innovations of that church which pretends to
   be the only Christian catholic society in the world, we shall find that
   they are of another stamp, and of a quite contrary tendency; that they
   savour so rankly of a worldly interest, that any impartial man would,
   at first sight, judge them to be the contrivances of worldly, covetous,
   and ambitious men, and that they did not look like Divine truths, and
   doctrines that are of God, but that they are of the world; and
   therefore, they that propagate them, and would se duce men to them,
   "speak from the world, and the world heareth them."

SERMON CCXXXIII.

  THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION; WITH THE CAUSE AND
  DANGER OF INFIDELITY.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them.--2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   I SHALL explain these words, and then proceed to handle many things
   contained in them.

   "If our gospel be hid," or veiled; so by this metaphor the apostle
   alludes to what he had said in the latter part of the foregoing
   chapter, concerning the veil which was upon Moses face, and upon the
   hearts of the Jews, so that they could not see to the end of that
   dispensation. There was a great deal of obscurity in that
   administration: "But the veil is done away in Christ." The gospel is a
   clear revelation, and sufficiently conspicuous in itself: and now, if
   it be hid from any, the fault is not in the obscurity of the object,
   but in the blindness of men's minds.

   "If the gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost." To them that
   deserve to perish, because they will not see.

   "In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that
   believe not." Some of the fathers, as St. Augustine, and St.
   Chrysostom, and several of the Greek scholiasts, read these words
   otherwise; "In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the men of this world
   who believe not;" and so refer this blindness to God's permission; in
   which sense he is said elsewhere in Scripture, "to harden men's
   hearts." The reason why they choose this reading of the words rather
   than the other, was in opposition to the Marcionites and Manichees; the
   former of which sects made use of this text to countenance their
   opinion of two gods; the one of the Old Testament, whom they called the
   just God; the other of the New, whom they styled the good God: the
   former of these, say they, made the world, and is therefore, here
   called "the god of this world." The Manichees made use of this text to
   prove that the devil, whom they made the principle of all evil and
   imperfection, was the maker of this world, and is therefore called the
   god of it.

   But there is no need why for this reason we should depart from the
   usual reading of the words; for there is nothing in the true importance
   of them, that can give countenance to these errors. For the devil,
   though he did not make this world, may be said to be the god of it,
   upon a very good account, because the greatest part of the world, being
   sunk into idolatry and wickedness, were become his lot and portion, who
   worshipped him as God, and did his works, and therefore were part of
   his dominion. So St. John tells us, (1 John iii. 8.) "He that
   committeth sin is of the devil;" and, (chap. v. 19.) "We know that we
   are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness," en to ponero
   keitai, which may be rendered more agreeably to the opposition which
   the apostle intended, "is subject to the evil one," is in his power,
   and under his dominion. According to which Plutarch tells us, that
   "every unreasonable and brutish nature belongs to the lot of bad
   spirits." So that in this sense the devil may very well be said to be
   "the god of this world," as he is elsewhere called by our Saviour, "the
   prince of this world;" (John xii. 31.) "Now shall the prince of this
   world be cast out;" and, (John xiv. 30.) "The prince of this world
   cometh." And so the apostle, (Eph. vi. 12.) "The ruler of the darkness
   of this world."

   "Lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them," eis to` me` auga'sai, "lest they should
   see," or "behold the light of the glorious gospel," for so Hesychius
   tells us, that auga'zo auga'zomai, is oro kai` ble'po. It is called
   "the glorious gospel of Christ," because of the glorious confirmation
   that was given to it by his miraculous resurrection and ascension, and
   his sending the Holy Ghost into the world; and Christ is said to be
   "the image of God," because the power of the Deity did shew forth
   itself in the miracles which he wrought.

   The words being thus explained, the most material things that offer
   themselves to our consideration in them, are these three:

   First, The full and clear evidence which we have of the truth of the
   gospel, or of the Christian religion, which the apostle expresseth to
   us in these words, "the light of the glorious gospel of Christ."

   Secondly, The cause of infidelity, notwithstanding all the evidence
   which the gospel carries along with it, which the apostle expresseth in
   these words, "in whom the god of this world hath blinded the eyes of
   them that believe not."

   Thirdly, The dangerous state of those who, having the gospel propounded
   to them, do not believe it. The apostle tells them, that they are lost
   and undone. "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that perish."

   I begin with the first of these, namely, the full and clear evidence
   which we have of the truth of the gospel, or Christian religion. The
   only thing that can give us full assurance that any religion is true,
   is, if we can be satisfied, that it is from God; for being once
   satisfied of that, there can remain no doubt of the truth of any thing
   that comes from him, it being an essential part of the notion which
   every man hath of God, that he is "a God of truth." Now there are two
   things must concur to give the mind of man full satisfaction that any
   religion is from God.

   First, If the person that declares this religion give testimony of his
   Divine authority, that is, that he is sent and commissioned by God to
   that purpose.

   Secondly, If the religion which he declares contain nothing in it, that
   is plainly repugnant to the nature of God. I say, these two must
   concur; for though I could suppose a person to bring the highest
   testimony imaginable of his Divine mission and authority, suppose he
   should work a miracle for the confirmation of his doctrine; yet, if
   there were any thing in the doctrine plainly repugnant to the natural
   notions which I have of God, I could not receive it as from God; the
   reason of which is plainly this--I can have no assurance that that is
   from God, which, if it were true, I should be uncertain whether there
   was a God or not. I cannot possibly have any greater assurance that any
   thing is from God, than I have that there is a God; and I have no
   greater assurance that there is a God, than I have of his essential
   perfections; as, that he is good, and powerful, and wise, and just, &c.
   For by the very same arguments that I come to know that there is a God,
   I know likewise that he must necessarily have these perfections. So
   that, if any thing should be offered to me as a revelation from God,
   which plainly contradicts those natural notions which I have of him, I
   must necessarily reject it, yea, though it were backed with a miracle;
   because no man can at the same time believe that there is a God of such
   and such perfections, and entertain any thing as from him, which
   evidently contradicts those perfections. And as this is reasonable in
   itself, so it is clear from Scripture. (Deut. xiii. 1-3.) "If there
   arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a
   sign, or a wonder: and the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he
   spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods (which thou hast
   not known), and let us serve them: thou shalt not hearken unto the
   words of that prophet." Here is the very case put, which I am speaking
   of; a prophet comes and preacheth the worship of idols, as the sun,
   moon, stars, &c. and, for the confirmation of this he is supposed to
   work a miracle; and yet, notwithstanding this, we are forbidden to
   hearken to him, because the doctrine that he brings does evidently
   contradict the natural notions which I have of God.

   From all which it appears, that these two things must concur, to give
   us full satisfaction that any religion is from God; namely, first, That
   the person that declares this religion, gives testimony of his Divine
   authority, that he is sent and commissioned from God to that purpose.
   And,

   Secondly, That the religion which he declares contains nothing in it
   that is plainly repugnant to the nature of God.

   Now to bring this to my present purpose, I should shew these two things
   concerning the Christian religion:

   First, As to the Divine authority of the person that declares this
   religion to the world, that he was sent and commissioned by God to that
   purpose.

   Secondly, As to the religion itself, that there is nothing in it that
   is repugnant to the nature of God. I intend chiefly to speak of the
   first of these: for I dare say, any one that will freely and without
   prejudice consider the Christian religion, as it is laid down in the
   Scriptures, and not as it hath been abused by the wanton wits of some,
   and the designs of others, will find nothing in it but what is very
   suitable to the nature of God, and worthy of him: he shall find nothing
   in the propositions of faith, but what is suitable to the perfections
   of the Divine nature, and hath a proper influence upon a godly
   practice; nothing in the precepts of life, but what plainly tends to
   the perfection of human nature, and the advantage and happiness of
   mankind; no thing in the arguments and motives to obedience, as,
   namely, the love of Christ in dying for us, the assistance of God's
   Holy Spirit, and the rewards and punishments of another world, but what
   is very accommodate to our nature, and suitable to the wisdom, and
   goodness, and justice of God: and these three, the propositions of
   faith, the precepts of life, the arguments and motives to obedience, do
   constitute the Christian religion, and make up the whole gospel.
   Concerning most of these, I have elsewhere treated at large; therefore
   I shall now apply my self chiefly to the first thing, namely, to shew
   that we have abundant satisfaction of the Divine authority of the
   person that declares this religion to the world.

   Now because we live at a great distance from the age wherein this
   revelation of the gospel by Jesus Christ was made to the world, it will
   be requisite for our clearer proceeding in this matter, to consider
   distinctly these three things:

   First, What evidence those who heard this doctrine of the gospel
   immediately from our Saviour had for his Divine authority. And this
   inquiry only respects the disciples of our Saviour, and the rest of the
   Jews to whom he preached.

   Secondly, What evidence those had who received this doctrine by the
   preaching of the apostles. And this concerns those to whom the gospel
   was published by the apostles after our Saviour's death.

   Thirdly, What evidence after-ages, until the present time, have of
   this. And this properly concerns us, who live at a great distance from
   the times of the first publication of the gospel.

   And according to these three differences of time, there are likewise
   but three ways whereby we can come to the knowledge of matter of fact;
   and they are all such as are capable of giving us sufficient assurance.

   The first is by the testimony of our own senses; and this was the
   advantage of those who heard our Saviour's doctrine, and saw his
   miracles.

   The second by the report and relation of credible eye and ear
   witnesses; and this advantage those had who heard the apostles,

   The third by a constant and uncontrolled relation derived down
   successively from one age to an other, either by word or writing, or
   both; which is the way whereby the ages since the apostles to this day
   have had the Christian religion derived down to them.

   First, To consider what evidence those who heard the doctrine of the
   gospel immediately from our Saviour himself might have of his Divine
   authority. Now there are but four ways that I can at present imagine
   (setting aside an internal revelation in every man's mind) whereby men
   may be sufficiently satisfied of the Divine authority of any person.

   I. If it be prophesied of him, and foretold by persons divinely
   inspired, that God would send such an one as his messenger and prophet
   into the world, and afterward such a person comes, to whom all the
   circumstances of those prophecies do agree.

   II. By the testimony of an immediate voice from heaven.

   III. By a power of working miracles.

   IV. By the gift of prophecy, proved and made good by the accomplishment
   of his own predictions.

   Now I shall shew that those who lived in our Saviour's time, and
   conversed with him, were capable of satisfaction concerning his Divine
   authority all these four ways. I shall begin with the

   I. First, They were capable of being eye-witnesses that Christ was the
   great prophet and messenger of God, the Messias prophesied of and
   foretold in the Old Testament. And here I do reasonably take for
   granted the Divine authority of the Old Testament, and that the
   prophecies therein contained are of Divine inspiration; because those
   to whom our Saviour ordinarily preached, were only the Jews, who
   acknowledged the Divine authority of those books; and therefore the
   accomplishment of those prophecies in the person of our Saviour, must
   needs be a satisfactory argument to them, that he was the Messias
   foretold.

   Now to shew that the disciples of our Saviour, and the rest of the
   Jews, were capable of receiving full satisfaction in this, that Jesus
   Christ was the Messias prophesied of in the Old Testament, I shall
   proceed in these steps:

   1. That the prophecies of the Old Testament fix a time for the coming
   of the Messias; they give certain marks and signs whereby it may be
   known when the Messias would come; as, that he should come when the
   government should utterly be lost from Judah: (Gen. xlix. 10.) "The
   sceptre shall not depart from Judah till Shiloh come;" by whom the
   ancient Jews did understand the Messias; and nothing but plain malice
   against Christ, and the Christian religion, makes the modern Jews to
   depart herein from the sense of their ancient masters. That he should
   come before the destruction of the second temple; (Hag. ii. 6-9.) "For
   thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I
   will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.
   And I will shake all nations, and the Desire of all nations shall come,
   and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. The
   silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts. The
   glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith
   the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord
   of hosts." From whence it is plain, that this house should remain when
   "the Desire of all nations," that is, the Messias (according to the
   interpretation of the ancient Jews) should come, and his presence
   should be the glory of this second temple, and make it excel the first.
   And much to the same purpose; (Mai. iii. 1.) "Behold, I will send my
   messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom
   ye seek, (that is, the Messias) shall suddenly come to his temple, even
   the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: Behold, he shall
   come, saith the Lord of hosts." That he should come at the end of so
   many weeks of years, "from the going forth of the commandment to
   restore and build Jerusalem, "and after so many weeks of years should
   be cut off, and after that "the city of Jerusalem and sanctuary should
   be destroyed and made desolate," (Dan. ix. 24 27.) So that you see the
   prophecies of the Old Testament do fix and ascertain the time of the
   Messias coming, both by infallible marks and signs, concomitant and
   consequent, and by an exact computation of years.

   2. That the time fixed by those prophecies for the coming of the
   Messias is already past. And this appears, in that all those marks and
   signs, which it was foretold should accompany and follow the coming of
   the Messias, are come to pass, and the time limited for the coming of
   the Messias is long since expired.

   For, (1.) The sceptre is long since departed from Judah. The Jews are
   now dispersed among all nations, their government lost, their families
   confounded, insomuch that they do not at this day know those of the
   tribe of Judah from others. At the captivity, the government was not
   utterly lost, for they had a prince of the captivity; or at least it
   was interrupted but for seventy years, and then it was restored to them
   again: but now the sceptre hath been departed, and the government lost
   for sixteen hundred years.

   (2.) The second temple is destroyed, to which it was foretold, that
   "the Desire of all nations should come."

   (3.) The city is destroyed and made desolate, which was foretold should
   be "after the cutting off of the Messias."

   (4.) The "seventy weeks of years are accomplished" and expired long
   since, which were to begin from "the going forth of the commandment to
   restore and build Jerusalem," and to end at the coming of the "Messias
   the Prince." And whether we fix the beginning of these weeks in the
   first or second year of Cyrus, or in the reign of one of the Dariuses
   or Artaxerxeses (for by universal consent it must begin in some of
   them) it matters not to my present purpose: for wherever it be fixed,
   these weeks are long since expired.

   3. And consequently the Messias is already come. For if the predictions
   of the Old Testament be true, which limit his coming to a certain time,
   which is fixed both by infallible marks, and by an account of years; I
   say, if these predictions be true, that he should come at such a time,
   and that time is past, then he is already come.

   The Jews seek to evade the force of this argument by this pitiful
   shift, that the promises and predictions of the Messias were not
   absolute, but conditional; that is, he should come at such a time, if
   the sins and impenitency of men did not hinder. To this I answer,

   (1.) This grants that the time for the coming of the Messias is past.

   (2.) The reason that they give why God hath deferred the accomplishment
   of those prophecies and promises, is, because of the impenitency and
   wickedness of the people of the Jews at that time; which will agree
   very well with the history of the gospel, and give us a very good
   account how they came to reject the Messias; because they were so
   wicked, and their unbelief and impenitency were so great at that time.

   (3.) There is no such condition any where expressed in any of those
   prophecies.

   (4.) It is unreasonable that there should be such a condition; that the
   impenitency of men should hinder the coming of him, who was to bring
   the world to repentance, that is, to do that on his part which is
   sufficient to that end.

   (5.) Nothing could bring the veracity of God into question more, than
   to make such predictions conditional, as, by the concurrent testimony
   of so many prophets, have the time of their accomplishment so
   punctually defined, and have not either a condition expressly fixed to
   them, or in the nature of the thing necessarily implied: and if this
   were not so, anyone might pretend to be a true prophet, though the
   event proved never so contrary to his prediction.

   (6.) It appears out of the books of the Jews to have been a constant
   tradition among them, that the Messias should come when the state of
   the people was most degenerate, and there was the greatest corruption
   and dissolution of manners among them. And if this be so, then their
   wickedness and impenitency could be no obstacle and impediment to the
   fulfilling of the promises and predictions, concerning the Messias.

   I should have added in the next place, that the prophecies and promises
   in the Old Testament concerning the Messias, do all exactly, both as to
   the time, and all other circumstances, agree to Jesus Christ, who was
   born at Bethlehem, who gave him self out to be the Messias, and whom we
   Christians own to be so. But this I reserve for the next opportunity.

SERMON CCXXXIV.

  THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them.--2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   IN discoursing on these words, I have begun to shew, how those who
   heard the doctrine of the gospel immediately from our Saviour, might be
   satisfied concerning his Divine authority; and I mentioned four ways by
   which such persons might receive full satisfaction.

   I. By the agreement of the prophecies and promises of the Old Testament
   to our Saviour.

   II. By the testimony of an immediate voice from heaven.

   III. By the power of working miracles.

   IV. By the gift of prophecy, proved and made good by the accomplishment
   of his own predictions.

   In discoursing of the first of these, I proceeded by these steps:

   1. That the prophecies of the Old Testament did fix a time for the
   coming of the Messias, and gave certain marks and signs whereby it
   might be known when the Messias would come.

   2. That the time fixed by those prophecies for the coming of the
   Messias is already past.

   3. And consequently, that the Messias is already come. Thus far I have
   gone; and now add,

   4. The prophecies and promises of the Old Testament concerning the
   Messias, do all exactly, both as to the time and all other
   circumstances, agree to Jesus Christ, that was born at Bethlehem, who
   gave himself out to be the Messias, and whom we Christians own to be
   so.

   1 . The time specified in those predictions agree to him. When he came
   into the world, the government was departed from Judah; for they were
   then in subjection to the Romans; and Herod their king, who was put
   into the government by the Romans, was an Idumæan. He came into the
   second temple, which, notwithstanding its being re-edified by Herod,
   might justly be accounted the same, it not having been again destroyed
   by any enemy, but only pulled down in order to the beautifying and
   enlarging of it; notwithstanding which Josephus every where calls it
   the same temple; for he reckons but two temples--the one, that which
   Solomon built, which continued till the captivity of Babylon; the
   other, that which Zerubbabel built, and that he says continued till the
   Romans destroyed Jerusalem, And not long after our Saviour's death, the
   city of Jerusalem and the sanctuary were utterly demolished, and "the
   end thereof was with a flood;" there was a total devastation of them;
   which plainly shews the seventy weeks did also expire about that time,
   wherever we fix the beginning of them; because the prophecy of Daniel
   tells us plainly, that towards the expiration of them, the city and the
   sanctuary were to be destroyed; which was fulfilled with a great deal
   of severity, as if there were some extra ordinary cause of those
   fearful judgments which came upon them. And indeed we find, that after
   they had committed the great sin "of crucifying the Lord of life," they
   gave up themselves to all manner of wickedness, "filling up the measure
   of their sins, that wrath might come upon them to the uttermost;"
   insomuch, that Josephus tells us, "That he did verily believe, that if
   the Romans had not come at that time to destroy them, either the earth
   would have swallowed up their city, or a flood have overwhelmed, or
   thunder and lightning, or fire from heaven, would have consumed them,
   like Sodom and Gomorrah; for (says he) this generation was much more
   wicked than they were."

   And, which is a very considerable argument to the Jews, he came at the
   time when their whole nation were in expectation of the Messias; and,
   indeed, the whole world were about that time in expectation of a prince
   out of Judea. That the Jews did expect the Messias about this time,
   appears by the famous saying of one of their greatest rabbies, Elias,
   that there should be two thousand years be fore the law, two thousand
   years the law should last, and two thousand years should be the time of
   the Messias: and, according to the most exact chronology, it was much
   about the four thousandth year of the world that Christ was born. That
   a great part of the world besides were at that time in expectation of a
   prince to spring out of Judea, appears from those known testimonies of
   Suetonius and Tacitus: Percrebuerat toto oriente vetus et constans
   opinio, esse in fatis, ut Judea profecti rerum potirentur, saith
   Suetonius; and Tacitus to the same purpose. Both agree in the words of
   this prophecy, which seem to be taken out of the prophecy of Micah,
   speaking of Bethlehem, in the land of Judea; "Out of thee shall come a
   governor." And Suetonius tells us farther, that the belief and
   expectation of this among the Jews was so great at that time, that this
   was the cause of their rebelling against the Romans. A just judgment of
   God upon them, that those who had rejected the true Messias, should be
   deluded to their own ruin by the hopes of a false one.

   2. All other circumstances of those promises and prophecies, are
   exactly answered in the history and relation which the gospel gives of
   him. He was emphatically "the seed of the woman," according to the
   first and very obscure promise made to our first parents, (Gen. iii.
   15.) "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head:" I say, he
   was emphatically "the seed of the woman," being, as our books of the
   gospel tell us, born of a pure virgin, which never knew man. He was the
   seed of Abraham, according to the second promise of him made to
   Abraham, (Gen. xii. 3.) "In thee shall all the families of the earth be
   blessed." He was "a prophet like unto Moses," being a great worker of
   miracles above any of the prophets, as Moses also was; and by whom God
   gave a new law, as he did by Moses, according to the other famous
   promise of him, (Deut. xviii. 15.) "A prophet shall the Lord your God
   raise up unto you, like unto me."

   He was of the tribe of Judah, and of the seed of David, as it was
   foretold the Messias should be; therefore he is called in the gospel,
   "the Son of David;" and the apostle to the Hebrews (chap. vii. 14.)
   appeals to the Jews concerning this, as a thing clear and acknowledged
   among them, "It is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah," which he
   would not have affirmed to the Jews without proof, if it had not been
   granted by them.

   For the other, that he was of the seed of David, the Jews will by no
   means admit as a thing at all evident from the history of the gospel
   concerning him: for, say they, if that appear any where, we should find
   it in his genealogy; but there we find no such matter; there indeed we
   have the genealogy of Joseph very differently related by the two
   evangelists, Matthew and Luke: but what is this to the genealogy of
   Christ, when the Christians themselves avowedly declare, that Joseph
   was not his father? It is granted that Joseph was of David's line; but
   to prove that Christ was really descended from David, instead of the
   genealogy of Joseph, they should have shewn Mary's.

   This is a very malicious and spiteful objection, and the Jews insist
   very much upon it: but yet I think it is capable of a very satisfactory
   answer, in which I shall proceed by these steps.

   (1.) We will grant, that both the genealogies of our Saviour, that in
   Matthew and that in Luke, are intended to shew that Joseph was of
   Abraham's and David's line, and that neither of them is the genealogy
   of Mary. Some indeed have thought so, but it seems to me with very
   little probability: I in cline much rather to Grotius's excellent
   conjecture about it, that Matthew's genealogy gives us an account of
   the succession of the royal family down as low as Joseph, and that in
   St. Luke the direct series of Joseph's ancestors.

   (2.) The Jews grant that it hath been an ancient tradition among
   Christians, that Joseph and Mary were of the same family, and that Mary
   was Virgo, epi'kleros, one that had no brethren, an heiress, or co
   heiress, and so according to the Jewish custom she was bound to marry
   in her family; which the Jews were especially careful of in the family
   of David, to preserve the succession of the royal line, of which the
   Messias was to come.

   (3.) The Jews have nothing to object against this which shews it
   improbable.

   (4.) If so, that they were of the same family, then the genealogy of
   Joseph, though not directly and expressly, yet by consequence, was the
   genealogy of Mary; and consequently, those genealogies in the gospel do
   sufficiently shew that Christ was the Son of David.

   (5.) It cannot be imagined that the evangelists should have omitted the
   genealogy of Mary, if it had not been included in that of Joseph,
   especially St. Matthew, who in his genealogy expressly tells us, that
   he intended to shew that he was the Son of David, and also denies
   Joseph to have been his real father.

   (6.) If there had been any question, whether Mary was of the line of
   David, the Jews would certainly in that time have rejected him from
   being the Messias, upon that very account; nothing more plausible for
   them to have said than this that he pretended to have no father, al d
   to be born of a virgin, who was not of the line of David, how could he
   then be the Messias, who was to be "of the seed of David?" But that he
   was always owned by the Jews to be of that seed, appears by the title
   so frequently given to him of the Son of David.

   It was prophesied that the Messias should be born in Bethlehem of
   Judea, (Mic. v. 2.) which you find accordingly fulfilled, (Matt. ii.
   6.) the providence of God so ordering it, that Augustus should then lay
   a general tax, which occasion brought up Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem;
   not only that she might be delivered there, but that their names being
   there entered, their family might be ascertained, and there might no
   doubt afterward arise, but that they were of the line of David.

   It was foretold he should be "born of a virgin," (Isa. vii. 14.) which
   you see accordingly fulfilled, (Matt. i.) That this is not the primary,
   but the mystical sense, of that place in Isaiah, I think may without
   prejudice be granted to the Jews, who in innumerable places of the Old
   Testament, do, besides the first and literal sense, allow of a mystical
   one; and if it be objected that this is only the saying of us
   Christians, that Christ was born of a pure virgin; to them it is easily
   answered, that if this be foretold of the Messias, whoever he be, that
   he shall be born of a virgin, as the Jews generally grant, we have as
   much assurance of this, as they can have, or imagine to have of theirs,
   whenever he should come. For it is not any report or tradition that can
   give credit to so strange a thing, but the unquestionable miracles
   which he wrought, which prove him to come from God, and consequently to
   be no impostor, but to be all that he pretended he was.

   It was foretold of him that he should be a great prophet and teacher;
   (Deut. xviii, 15.) "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto
   you, like unto me." (Isa. lxi. 1.) "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
   because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor,"&c.
   (Ezek. xxxiv. 23.) "And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he
   shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he
   shall be their shepherd." And, (chap xxxvii. ver. 24.) "And David my
   servant shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd:
   they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do
   them." And this was eminently fulfilled in that he foretold several
   future contingents; as, his own crucifixion, Peter's denial of him, the
   destruction of Jerusalem, the rising of false Christs, and false
   prophets, (which I shall particularly consider hereafter,) the
   descending of the Holy Ghost, and the admirable success of the gospel
   in the world; in that he preached so pure and perfect a doctrine to the
   world, and with so much authority; a doctrine so excellent and
   reasonable, so suitable to the necessities, and agreeable to the reason
   of mankind; a doctrine which tendeth so much to the perfecting of human
   nature, and to the peace and happiness of human society, above any
   other institution in the world.

   It was foretold that he should do many and great miracles, and such as
   should be beneficial to men, (Isa. xxxv. 5, 6.) "Then the eyes of the
   blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
   Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb
   sing." And was not all this eminently accomplished in Jesus Christ?
   What greater, or more public, or more frequent and numerous, or more
   beneficial miracles, canal most be imagined, than Christ did? So that
   we may say to the Jews, as some of them did to the pharisees in our
   Saviour's time, You talk of a Messias to come; "yet when he is come,
   will he do greater works than this man hath done?"

   It was foretold of him, that the people should receive him with joy and
   triumph when "he came riding upon an ass to Jerusalem," (Zach. ix. 9.)
   which we find fulfilled, Matt. xxi.

   It was prophesied that he should suffer many things, and be rejected,
   and despised of men. (Psal. xxii. 6.) "But I am a worm, and no man; a
   reproach of men, and despised of the people." (Isa. liii. 3.) "He is
   despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with
   grief: and we hid, as it were, our faces from him; he was despised, and
   we esteemed him not." Which we find fulfilled all along in the history
   of the gospel.

   It was prophesied that he should be sold for thirty pieces of silver,
   (Zach. xi. 12.) which we find fulfilled, Matt. xxvii. 9. That when he
   who was "the shepherd was smitten, the sheep should be scattered,"
   (Zach. xiii. 7.) which was accomplished, Matt. xxvii. 56. "All the
   disciples forsook him and fled." That he should be scourged and
   buffeted, and spit upon, (Isa. l. 6.) "I gave my back to the smiters,
   and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from
   shame and spit ting;" which you find punctually accomplished, Matt.
   xxvii.

   It was foretold that he should die a violent death, (Isa. liii. 8.) "He
   was cut off out of the land of the living." (Dan. ix. 26.) "Messfas the
   Prince shall be cut off." That he should undergo all these sufferings
   with the greatest patience, (Isa. liii. 7.) "He was oppressed, and he
   was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he was brought as a lamb to
   the slaughter; and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened
   not his mouth." That he should suffer all these things not for himself,
   but for sinners, (Isa. liii. 5.) he "was wounded for our
   transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of
   our peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed." And, (ver.
   6.) "The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." And, (ver. 8.)
   "For the transgression of my people was he stricken." And, (ver. 10.)
   "His soul was made an offering for sin." And, (ver. 12.) "He bare the
   sins of many." And, (Dan. ix. 20.) it is said, "the Messias should be
   cut off, but not for himself."

   It was foretold that his hands and feet should be pierced, (Psal. xxii.
   16.) He should be "numbered with the transgressors," (Isa. liii. 12.)
   And accordingly he was condemned as a malefactor, to suffer with
   malefactors, "being crucified between two thieves."

   It was foretold that he should have "gall and vinegar given him to
   drink," (Psal. lxix. 21.) that he should be derided in the midst of his
   sufferings, (Psal. xxii. 7, 8.) "All they that see me, laugh me to
   scorn; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted
   on the Lord, that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he
   delighted in. him." And this was most punctually accomplished, (Matt.
   xxvii. 39. 43.) "And they that passed by, reviled him, wagging their
   heads, and saying, He trusted in God, let him deliver him now, if he
   will have him."

   It was foretold that he should cry out under his sufferings, (Psal.
   xxii. 1.) "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so
   far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? That he should
   pray for his wicked persecutors, (Isa. liii. 12.) that "he made
   intercession for the transgressors:" and so he did most affectionately,
   "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." That they
   should cast lots for his garment, (Psal. xxii. 18.) All, or most of
   which predictions, were by the ancient Jews, understood of the Messias,
   and were exactly fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as appears fully out of the
   history of the gospel.

   And then for the circumstances of his burial. It was foretold, that he
   should "make his grave with the rich," (Isa. liii. 9.) which was
   accomplished, in that he was put into Joseph of Arimathea's own tomb.

   His resurrection was foretold to be "after three days," (Hos. vi. 2.)
   as several of the rabbies understood that place; however, that he
   should rise again, may be plainly urged from these texts, where it is
   said "that his kingdom should have no end;" and (Isa. liii. 10.) where
   it is said, that, after his death, "He shall see his seed, and prolong
   his days; and that the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand."
   But most expressly, (Psal. xvi. 10.) "Thou wilt not leave my soul in
   hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."

   And his "sitting at the right hand of God," which supposeth his
   ascension into heaven, (Psal. ex. 1.) "Sit thou at my right hand, until
   I make thine enemies thy footstool."

   The wonderful success of the gospel, and the universal spreading of it
   through the world, was fore told, Gen. xii. 3. "In thee shall all the
   nations of the earth be blessed;" which implies, that the blessing of
   the gospel, which the Messias brought to the world, should be
   universally diffused. (Gen. xlix. 10.) "To him shall the gathering of
   the people be." (Psal. ii. 8.) God promiseth there to give Christ "the
   heathen for his inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for his
   possession." Besides several other places of the Psalms and prophets,
   too many to be reckoned up.

   Now the accomplishment of all these prophecies happened in their days
   who saw our Saviour, and conversed with him; so that they were capable
   of receiving full satisfaction concerning his Divine authority, and
   that he was a person sent of God to teach the world, and assure them
   that he was the Messias, foretold and prophesied of in the books of the
   Old Testament, which being by them received as of Divine inspiration,
   did consequently assure them that he was from God.

   If. The second way whereby we may be satisfied concerning the Divine
   authority of a person, is by the testimony of an immediate voice from
   heaven; and this testimony Christ had twice given to him: the first
   publicly before a great assembly of people at John's baptism, which was
   just before he began his public ministry, (Matt. iii. 16, 17.) "The
   Holy Ghost descending upon him like a dove, as he came out of the
   water; and there was a voice from heaven, which said, This is my
   beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased." The same voice was heard by
   Peter, James, and John, at his transfiguration on the mount, as you may
   see, Luke ix. 35. And this St. Peter mentions, as a considerable
   argument of Christ's Divine authority, (2 Pet. i. 16-18.) "For we have
   not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the
   power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of
   his majesty. For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when
   there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my
   beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased. And this voice which came from
   heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount."

   Indeed he makes this testimony to be such an argument, as, concurring
   with that which I mentioned before, is sufficient to persuade one that
   Christ was sent from God; but he does not make it to be equal to that
   which he adds at the 19th verse: "We have also a more sure word of
   prophecy, whereunto you do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that
   shineth in a dark place," &c. Intimating, the prophecies of the Old
   Testament were greater confirmation, than this single testimony of a
   voice from heaven does amount to.

   III. I proceed to the next evidence, which those who lived in our
   Saviour's time had of his Divine authority, viz. the power of working
   miracles, which he was endowed withal; and this is the highest
   testimony that can be given to any person, that he is sent from God.
   And in this respect chiefly is the gospel called "the light of the
   glorious gospel of Christ," because of those glorious miracles whereby
   the gospel was confirmed. This is, as it were, the broad seal of
   heaven, which is sufficient to give confirmation to any doctrine which
   does not evidently contradict the perfections of the Divine nature: and
   it is not credible, that the providence of God is so little tender of
   the concernments of mankind, as to communicate this power to any person
   that will abuse it to the confirmation of a lie. I deny not but the
   devil may do many strange things, and such as we cannot distinguish
   from some sort of miracles; [14] and where men, by some great precedent
   provocation, have made it just for God "to give them up to strong
   delusions to believe lies, because they would not believe the truth,
   but had pleasure in unrighteousness;" there God may permit the devil to
   work strange wonders, as it is foretold, (2 Thess. ii. 9.) that the
   coming of antichrist "shall be after the working of Satan, with all
   power and signs, and lying wonders, and all deceiveableness of
   unrighteousness." But in this case, there will remain two ways, whereby
   impartial and considerate men, and such as are not blinded by prejudice
   or their lusts, may sufficiently discover that this is not from God.

   1. By the absurdity of the doctrine which those wonders are brought to
   confirm: and such were the lewd, and filthy, and senseless doctrines of
   the gnostics, to which Simon Magus pretended to give a confirmation by
   the wonders that he wrought, and this, very probably, may be that which
   the apostle refers to in this chapter. And such, likewise, are several
   of the doctrines of popery: such as the ado ration of the Virgin Mary,
   of saints and images, and the doctrine of transubstantiation; for the
   confirmation of which, they pretend a great many wonders have been
   wrought.

   2. By the contrariety of the doctrine to that which hath had the
   confirmation of far greater miracles. Therefore, if we should grant to
   the papists, that several of those miracles which they brag of were
   really wrought, (which, considering the infinite cheats and impostures
   which have been practised by them in that kind, and have been
   discovered, we have no reason to grant;) yet, because the doctrine,
   which they pretend to confirm, is absurd and unreasonable, and contrary
   to the doctrine which they themselves own to have had a far greater
   confirmation, by miracles far greater, and more unquestionable, more
   publicly done, and in such a manner, and with such circumstances, as do
   free them from all suspicion of imposture; I say, for this reason, we
   cannot admit those doctrines to be of Divine authority; because the
   confirmation which is given to them by those wonders, is overpowered by
   a greater and more Divine testimony; as the magicians of Pharaoh,
   though they did many odd feats, yet were plainly mastered and conquered
   by the greater miracles which Moses wrought.

   The sum is this: That wherever any person is endowed with an eminent
   power of working miracles, such as are of the first rank, great and
   unquestionable, and many and publicly wrought, this is one of the
   highest evidences we can have of the Divine authority of any person or
   doctrine. Therefore Nicodemus does upon this ground very reasonably
   conclude, that our Saviour was sent from God, (John iii. 2.) "We know
   that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do those miracles
   which thou doest, except God be with him." And our Saviour himself
   insists upon this frequently, as the great proof of his Divine
   authority, (Matt. xi. 3, 4.) When John the Baptist sent two of his
   disciples to him, to be satisfied whether he was the Messias, he bids
   them report to John what the doctrine was which they heard him preach,
   and what miracles they saw him work for the confirmation of it: "Go and
   shew John those things which you do see and hear; the blind receive
   their sight, and the lame walk, and the lepers are cleansed, and the
   deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel
   preached unto them." John v. 33, 36. our Saviour there tells the Jews,
   that "John bare witness of him;" and that might satisfy them, because
   they looked upon John as a prophet: "But (saith he) I have greater
   witness than that of John; for the works which the Father hath given me
   to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the
   Father hath sent me." (John xv. 24.) "If I had not done among them the
   works which no other man did, they had not had sin." This was the great
   aggravation of their unbelief, that they resisted the evidence of so
   great miracles, such as no man in the world ever wrought. [15]

   I should now briefly run over the chief of those miracles of our
   Saviour, which we find recorded in the history of the gospel; and shew,
   that they have all the advantages that miracles can have, to give
   satisfaction to men concerning their reality. But this I reserve for my
   next discourse.

SERMON CCXXXV.

  THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them.--2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   IN my last discourse, I was considering the third evidence which those
   who lived in our Saviour's time had of his Divine authority, viz. The
   power of working miracles, with which he was endowed. And in treating
   on this, I proposed briefly to run over the chief of those miracles of
   our Saviour, which we find recorded in the gospel, and to shew that
   they have all the advantages that miracles can have, to give
   satisfaction to men concerning their reality. And that I may proceed in
   some kind of order and method, I shall reduce the miracles that concern
   our Saviour to these three heads:

   First, The miracles of his life.

   Secondly, Those that were wrought at his death.

   Thirdly, The great miracles of his resurrection from the dead, and
   those two that were consequent upon it, his ascension into heaven, and
   his sending the Holy Ghost upon the apostles and Christians in
   miraculous gifts and powers.

   I begin with the first, the miracles of his life. And, in speaking of
   these, I shall shew, that they had all the advantageous circumstances
   to convince men of the reality of them, and to free them from all
   suspicion of imposture. They were many; they were great and
   unquestionable miracles; they were frequently wrought, and for a long
   time together; publicly, and in the presence of multitudes; and they
   were beneficial, and for the good of men.

   J. They were many. There might be something of imposture suspected in a
   few instances, that might be chosen out for the purpose. But our
   Saviour gave instances of his Divine power in several kinds; so that
   there is scarce any thing that is miraculous can be instanced in,
   wherein he did not shew his power. He healed all manner of diseases,
   and that in multitudes of people, as they came accidentally, without
   any discrimination; (Matt. iv. 23, 24.) And though most of his miracles
   were healing, yet he gave instances in other kinds; as in turning of
   water into wine, commanding down the storm, and walking upon the
   waters, &c. And though the history of the gospel mentions very many
   miracles that he wrought, yet St. John tells us, that those that are
   recorded are but very few in comparison of what he did; (John xx. 30.)
   "And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples,
   which are not written in this book." And, (chap. xxi. 35.) "And there
   are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should
   be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not
   contain the books that should be written." An hyperbolical expression,
   to signify the great number of his miracles and actions, besides what
   are recorded by the evangelists.

   2. As they were many, so they were great and unquestionable, both as to
   the manner of doing them, and as to the things that he did.

   (1.) Many things which were not miraculous in themselves, yet were so
   as to the manner of doing them, which was not by any magical words, and
   figures, and charms, and superstitious rites, according to the manner
   of those who pretended to work miracles among the heathens. It is true,
   he healed many diseases which were curable by physic and art: yet then
   the manner was such as was above the ordinary course of nature; many he
   cured by a word only, or by a touch, and the cure was wrought
   immediately, and in the same instant when he spake the word, though
   they were at a great distance. Many were cured without his taking any
   notice of them, by touching the very hem of his garment, of all which I
   might give several instances, but that they are so well known to those
   who are acquainted with the history of the gospel . Sometimes, indeed,
   he performed the cure by degrees; as in the man that was restored to
   sight, and saw men at first confusedly, and without any distinction, as
   if they had been trees; (Mark viii. 24.) Sometimes he used some kind of
   means, but such as were very disproportionate in their nature to the
   effect that was produced; as in the case of the deaf man, which he
   cured by putting his finger into his ear, and by his spittle; (Mark
   vii. 33.) and the blind man, whose eyes he anointed with clay mixed
   with spittle, and sent him to wash in the pool of Siloam; (John ix. 6,
   7.) but most of his miracles he wrought in an instant, and merely by
   his word.

   (2.) As to the things he did, many of them were miraculous in
   themselves. He cured many inveterate diseases; (Matt. ix. 20.) a woman
   that had an issue of blood twelve years. He made the woman straight, by
   touching her, that had been crooked and bowed together eighteen years;
   (Luke xiii. 13.) and the man that had an infirmity thirty-eight years,
   only by bidding him take up his bed and walk; (John v. 8.) He cured the
   man that was born blind; (John ix.) And, which all men will grant to be
   miraculous, and to have exceeded all the power of nature that we know
   of, he raised several from the dead; and because it might be said that
   several of those were not really dead, but in a delirium or swoon,
   there is one instance beyond all exception; (John ix.) he raised up
   Lazarus to life, after he had been four days in the grave.

   3. He wrought his miracles frequently, upon all occasions that were
   offered, and for a long time together, during the whole time of his
   public minis try, which is generally computed to have been three years
   and a half; a time sufficient to have detected any impostor in;
   especially one that shewed him self so openly, and conversed
   indifferently with all sorts of persons with so little guard and
   caution.

   4. He did all his miracles publicly, not in corners and among some
   select company of people, but before multitudes, and in the greatest
   places of concourse; so that if there had been any thing of imposture
   in them, he gave the fairest opportunity that could be to his enemies
   to have detected him. Mahomet's miracles were wrought by himself alone,
   without witness, which was the best way in the world, certainly, for
   one that could work no miracles, but yet could persuade the people what
   he pleased: but our Saviour did nothing in private. His transfiguration
   only was before three of his disciples; and therefore, he made no use
   of that as an argument to the Jews, but charged his disciples to tell
   it to none, till after his resurrection, because that would give credit
   to it; after they were assured of that, they would easily believe his
   trans figuration; but all his other miracles were in the sight of the
   people. He healed publicly, and admitted all to see what he did. When
   he turned the water into wine, it was at a public feast; when he
   multiplied the loaves and the fishes, it was in the sight of four or
   five thousand people; when he raised Lazarus from the dead, it was
   before a great multitude of the people. The works that he did durst
   abide the light, and the more they were manifested, the more miraculous
   they did appear.

   6. His miracles were generally beneficial, and for the good of men; so
   that they had these two characters of Divinity stamped upon them that
   they were effects both of power and goodness. Most of his miracles were
   such as tended to the benefit of mankind; most of them were either
   healing or feeding miracles; or refreshing, as turning the water into
   wine; or tending to the peace of human society, as the miracle that he
   wrought rather than he would give offence by not paying tribute. It is
   true, indeed, he might have shewn his power every way; he gave some
   instances of it in other kinds, which might seem more for his purpose,
   and for the manifestation of his power, as in his allaying the storm,
   and walking upon the water: but he wrought no miracles that were
   destructive, except only two; namely, his permitting the devil to enter
   into the swine, (Matt. viii. 28.) whereby the inhabitants of the place
   sustained a great loss. But our Saviour did this upon very good reason,
   as a reproof of that sordid temper which he saw to be in them; they
   were so immersed in the world, and wedded to their interests, that they
   would, rather than lose any thing in that kind, forfeit all the
   blessings that the Messias brought with him; and this temper appeared
   afterwards in them; for though they were convinced that he had wrought
   a miracle, yet, because they had sustained some prejudice, they desired
   him to depart out of their coast.

   The other exception is his cursing the fig-tree; (Matt. xxi. 19.) which
   had a moral signification to his disciples, and was a sharp warning to
   them, what they must look for if they were unfruitful. Our Saviour
   rebukes our sloth and barrenness in the fig-tree.

   Secondly, Next to the miracles of our Saviour's life, I mentioned those
   that were wrought at his death, which, though they were not wrought by
   him, yet they were wrought to give testimony to him, that he was some
   extraordinary person; forasmuch as when he died the frame of nature was
   put into such a trembling and melancholy posture; so the history of the
   gospel tells us, (Matt. xxvii. 45.) that "from the sixth hour till the
   ninth, there was darkness over all the land;" which, as learned men
   have calculated, could not be an eclipse, according to the natural
   course of things. And, (ver. 51, 52, &c.) "The veil of the temple was
   rent from the top to the bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks
   rent, and the graves were opened."

   Thirdly, The great miracle which was wrought after his death, in
   raising him up from the dead, together with those two that were
   consequent upon it, his visible ascending into heaven, and his sending
   the Holy Ghost upon the apostles and primitive Christians, in such
   miraculous gifts and powers.

   First, The great miracle of his resurrection, after he had lain three
   days in the grave. This was the miracle which was to be the chief
   attestation of his Divine authority, and to give confirmation to the
   doctrine which he declared to the world. And accordingly we find that
   the chief office of the apostles was to be witnesses of his
   resurrection; and the great evidence they were to give to the world of
   his Divine authority was, that "God raised him from the dead." And we
   find the Scripture every where laying the great stress of his Divine
   authority upon this miracle: (Acts xvii. 31.) "By that man whom he hath
   ordained, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath
   raised him from the dead." (Rom. i. 4.) "Declared mightily to be the
   Son of God, by his resurrection from the dead." (1 Pet. i. 21.) "Who by
   him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him
   glory." Now that this miracle was really wrought, I shall endeavour to
   shew, by producing such evidence for it, as the nature of the thing to
   be proved (which is matter of fact) will bear. I shall, therefore,

   First, Produce such testimony as we have for it.

   Secondly, Add some considerations that may serve to give strength and
   advantage to the testimony.

   First, For the testimony we have of this. In short, we have it attested
   by an abundantly sufficient number of eye-witnesses; and greater
   evidence than this, matter of fact is not capable of. For the eye
   witnesses and the number of them, you have them produced by St. Paul,
   (1 Cor. xv. 5-8.) The sum of what he saith is this;--that Christ, after
   his resurrection, was seen once by Peter alone, once by James alone,
   and twice by all the apostles together, and by above five hundred
   brethren at once. So that the number of the eye-witnesses is abundantly
   sufficient. And that they did attest this, appears by the history of
   the gospel, which hath descended down to us by uncontrolled tradition.
   And in this case we require no more credit to be given to the gospel,
   than to any other history or narrative of matter of fact; which
   whosoever doth deny takes away the faith of history, and makes it
   impossible to prove the truth of any thing that is past. [16]

   Secondly, I shall add some considerations that may serve to give
   strength and advantage to this testimony; partly relating to the
   persons that give this testimony, and partly to the matter or thing
   which they attest.

   I. In reference to the persons that gave this testimony, we may
   consider them with these three advantages:

   (1.) That they are credible persons.

   (2.) That they agree in their testimony.

   (3.) That the greatest sufferings could not make them conceal it or
   deny it.

   (1.) For the credibility of the persons. Two things render a witness
   suspected--want of knowledge, or of integrity; if either he do not
   sufficiently know the thing which he attests; or there be reason to
   suspect his fidelity in relating the thing. Now the witnesses in this
   case of the resurrection cannot be questioned for either of these; not
   for want of knowledge, because they were eye-witnesses, as I said
   before: nor for want of faithfulness. There are two things which
   ordinarily make us suspect the fidelity of a witness; if there be
   either an appearance of deceit in the manner of the relation, or of
   design in the end of it: but the witnesses of Christ's resurrection are
   free from both these grounds of jealousy.

   1. There is no appearance of deceit in the manner of their relating it.
   We suspect a relation that is either too general, or too artificial;
   but the report of these witnesses cannot be charged with either of
   these. For,

   (1.) They report the thing with all its circumstances of time and
   place; when he rose, what were the circumstances of it, where he was
   seen, and by whom, how often he appeared, what he did and said.

   (2.) They use no art or insinuation in the manner of delivering, but
   report it with the greatest plainness, and nakedness, and simplicity,
   that can be imagined; without any ambiguity, or obscurity, or flourish
   of language, as becomes an honest relator, who useth no arts, because
   he is not guilty to himself of any design to deceive.

   2. Nor is there any appearance of design as to the end of their
   testimony. What design could they have, who did knowingly renounce all
   secular advantages of honour, and riches, and reputation, and forego
   all worldly contentment, and expose themselves to continual hazards and
   sufferings? They got nothing by bearing this testimony, but what every
   man that hath worldly designs doth most solicitously avoid.

   (2dly.) They concur and agree in their testimony. They constantly
   delivered the same testimony, with alt its circumstances, both in word
   and writing, several persons in several places, without varying or
   disagreeing in the least material circumstance.

   (3dly.) The greatest sufferings could not make them either deny it or
   conceal it; which is a great argument of their integrity. If the thing
   they attested had been false, it had been an unparalleled madness for
   any one to persist in it to the loss of life; and incredible, that so
   many should conspire in the same unreasonable and unaccountable folly;
   especially when the religion which they professed, did exclude all
   liars from all the happiness and rewards of the next life, which they
   pretended to be persuaded of; so that whatsoever those persons might be
   otherwise, and however they might falsify in other things, there is no
   reason to doubt of their truth and fidelity in this report, because
   they died for the testimony of it. Therefore the highest attestation of
   a thing is called martyrdom, and the most credible witnesses, martyrs.
   And though bare martyrdom be not an argument of the infallible truth of
   a testimony, or of the infallibility of the person that gives it; yet
   it is one of the highest arguments that can be of his honesty and
   integrity in that thing, and that he believes himself; otherwise he
   would not die for it: and it is a good evidence of the general
   integrity of these persons, as to all other things, that they were so
   conscientious, as not, for fear of death, to deny that which they
   believed to be a truth, nor to conceal that which they believed to be
   of importance.

   II. As to the matter or thing which they attested, we may consider it
   with these advantages:

   1. The resurrection of Christ was such a thing, as in its own nature
   they were capable of giving evidence to.

   2. We will consider a little the circumstances of it, which add much to
   the credit of it.

   3. We will consider the effects that this relation and report had in
   the world.

   4. The circumstances of the persons who entertained the belief of it.

   1. Let us consider that the resurrection of Christ is such a thing, as
   in the nature of it they were capable of giving testimony to. Indeed,
   if it were such a thing, as either in the nature of it were absolutely
   impossible, as if a man should say he had seen or handled a pure
   spirit; or else such, as these persons could not reasonably be presumed
   to be competent witnesses of it, as if a man that is altogether
   ignorant in geometry should say, that he had seen such a man
   demonstrate a proposition in Euclid; in these cases, though a man be
   ever so credible, yet he is not to be credited. But the resurrection of
   Christ is no such thing; no man that believes that God can make a
   living body out of nothing, can think it absolutely impossible to raise
   a dead body to life: nor was it a thing they could not be presumed
   competent witnesses of: for that which they attest concerning the
   resurrection of Christ, is that which every man may give evidence in,
   for it requires nothing but common sense and understanding; as to touch
   and handle a body, and know that it is a body; to see a man perform the
   operations of life, to see him walk, and eat, and hear him speak: and
   this they attest of Christ, after he was crucified, dead, and buried;
   that they saw him several times, and conversed with him; and they could
   not be mistaken in the person, being so intimately and familiarly
   acquainted with him in his life-time.

   2. We will consider a little the circumstances of his resurrection. He
   had foretold in his life-time, that he would rise again the third day.
   The chief priests and the pharisees remembered this saying, and
   therefore, lest his disciples should come by night and steal him away,
   they make the sepulchre sure, seal the stone, and set a guard of
   soldiers. The disciples, whom they were afraid of, they were scattered
   with fear; and that it might appear that it was the work of God, there
   was a great earthquake, which made the guard to tremble; and in their
   sight an angel, appearing in a most glorious manner, rolled away the
   stone; and when he was risen, and appeared to his disciples, they were
   terrified, and thought it had been a spirit, until our Saviour bids
   them see him, and handle him, that he had flesh and bones, which a
   spirit could not have. He conversed familiarly with them; and for their
   greater satisfaction did eat with them; and to satisfy the scrupulous
   unbelief of Thomas, he bid him put his hand into the hole of his side,
   and see in his hands the print of the nails, to shew that it was the
   same body that was crucified. Now the greater their jealousy and
   unbelief were, the greater is the evidence of the thing; and it shews
   that it was upon great conviction, and when they could no longer resist
   the evidence of the thing, that they did believe it: and after all
   this, they saw him ascend up into heaven, and found the promise of the
   Spirit made good to them, to furnish them with power and gifts for
   carrying on the work of the gospel.

   3. We will consider the strange and wonderful effects that this report
   and relation had in the world. The preaching of Christ crucified, and
   rising from the dead, had a strange operation upon the world. With such
   admirable success did this prevail, that in a few years the gospel was
   entertained in a great part of the world. The plain and naked relation
   of this, by men that were destitute of secular learning and arts,
   without the help of power, or policy, or any other worldly advantage,
   did prevail with men to entertain and embrace that profession, against
   the prejudice of education, the bias of corrupt nature, and the
   advantages of worldly interests: nor could all the opposition of the
   great and the wise, the princes and the philosophers of the world, give
   a check to the prevalency of it. Surely nothing but Truth could have
   wrought those great wonders and effects, naked and unarmed. Those
   strange and miraculous effects which are matter of fact, and
   undeniable, one would think should render it very easy to any man to
   believe the miracle of Christ's resurrection.

   4. We will consider the circumstances of the persons who entertained
   the belief of it. Many of them were very rational, and serious, and
   inquisitive persons, who had opportunity to satisfy themselves about
   the truth of it; and if there had been any reason to disbelieve the
   testimony that was given, had such great and generous spirits, that if
   it had been for their advantage and interest to have believed it, yet
   out of the greatness of their minds they would not have entertained any
   ungrounded relation, much less a religion built upon it. Such were
   some, eminent among the Jews and heathens for their great learning, and
   knowledge of philosophy, and all excellent endowments, who were early
   converted to Christianity. And as for the multitude who embraced the
   gospel, the doctrine of it was so contrary to their lusts, and the
   profession of it to their interests, that nothing can be imagined to
   have persuaded them to the belief of it, but a high satisfaction of the
   truth of it; and particularly of this great miracle of Christ's
   resurrection, upon which principally the gospel doth rely. And thus I
   have endeavoured to give you the best evidence I could of the truth of
   this miracle.

   I should now proceed to take notice of the objections that maybe made
   against it: but this I shall reserve to the following discourse.

SERMON CCXXXVI.

  THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them.--2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   I HAVE been considering the evidence which those who lived in oar
   Saviour's time had of his Divine authority, from the power of working
   miracles, with which he was endowed.

   The miracles which concern our Saviour, I reduced to three heads--those
   of his life; those wrought at his death; and the great miracle of his
   resurrection from the dead, together with those two that were
   consequent upon it--his visible ascension into heaven, and his sending
   the Holy Ghost.

   As to the resurrection of our Saviour, I have produced the testimonies
   for it, and have added some considerations that may give strength and
   advantage to that testimony; and shall now proceed to take notice of
   the most considerable exceptions that may be made against it. And all
   the exceptions that can be brought against it, that are of any moment,
   and that I know of, are these three--that tradition of the Jews, that
   he was stolen out of the grave; or that he was not really dead; or that
   his appearance was an illusion from evil spirits. The first of these is
   ancient, and was the invention of the Jews, and denies the integrity of
   the witnesses of his resurrection, making them deceivers: the two last
   suppose the fidelity of the witnesses, but say, they were deceived,
   either as to his death, or as to his appearance afterward: and these
   have been since invented by atheistical spirits. I shall briefly answer
   them, and, first, in general, I say these two things:

   1. That they who deny this, have this disadvantage, that they are to
   prove a negative, which is never capable of that evidence, which an
   affirmation is.

   2. These exceptions look very like envy, for they do not concur to make
   up one strong objection against the testimony of Christ's resurrection;
   but each of them contradicts the other, and is inconsistent with them:
   for if the tradition of the Jews be true, that he was stolen out of his
   grave after he was dead and buried, and that the story of his appearing
   to them was a forgery, then the two latter exceptions are false, and so
   of the rest; so that these exceptions look very like the false
   witnesses that were suborned against Christ, that "they do not agree
   together/ But to the objections themselves I answer,

   First, The tradition of the Jews; that his body was stolen out of the
   sepulchre, and all that which is related afterwards, of his appearing
   to his disciples and conversing with them, and ascending into heaven,
   was a forgery and imposture.

   Answer. We have early notice given of this in the history of the
   gospel, (Matt. xxviii. 11.) that when the chief priests heard that his
   body was gone out of the grave, they consulted together, and hired the
   soldiers to say that the disciples came by night, and, whilst they were
   asleep, stole him away. Observe what it was that the soldiers were to
   testify, that, whilst they were asleep, the disciples came and stole
   away his body. Very credible persons, that were to give testimony of
   what they saw done whilst they were asleep! A man had need be hired
   with a great sum to give such a testimony, so ridiculous; and it seems
   the pharisees looked upon the governor as very simple, that would be so
   easily persuaded of so unlikely a thing.

   2. It should seem it was not believed by themselves; for Josephus, a
   knowing and learned man of that nation and religion, who lived
   immediately after that time, speaks positively in the 18th book of his
   Antiquities, that "Christ was crucified, and appeared to his disciples
   the third day, rising from the dead;" and he speaks not a word of the
   forgery, which had been much for the credit of his nation and religion.

   3. If we compare the fidelity of the persons on both sides; the
   witnesses of Christ's resurrection cannot be suspected of any worldly
   interest or design; but the priests and pharisees were concerned both
   in reputation and interest, to blast this miracle as much as they
   could; because, if it should be entertained, both their religion would
   be endangered, and they would be looked upon as murderers of him whose
   holiness and innocency were attested by such a miracle.

   4. If this exception had been true, it had been easy to have discovered
   the imposture, and undeceived the people: the gospel would have fallen
   and sunk in a short time. Nothing but truth could have borne up and
   prevailed against so much opposition. If this had been the work of men,
   and an imposture, it "would have come to nought;" but it was truth, and
   of God, and therefore it "could not be overthrown."

   Secondly, That he was not dead when he was put into the grave, that he
   was but in a swoon or deliquium, and so might rise again without a
   miracle.

   Answ. 1.--We may reasonably suppose, that the malice of the Jews took
   care to kill him. Besides, the circumstances of the story do
   sufficiently evidence it. Upon the piercing of his side, "water and
   blood came out;" which was an evidence that his heart was pierced. And
   after his body was exhausted of its blood, there could be no return to
   life again. But it seems the soldiers were satisfied in the thing, who,
   when they came to break his bones, spared him, "because they found he
   was already dead."

   2. If he was not dead yet, how could he rise again? It was a pitiful
   securing of the grave, and a little great stone that was rolled upon
   it, if a weak and wounded, and spent man, after so much pain, and the
   expense of so much blood, could roll it away!

   3. Suppose he did rise, what became of him afterwards? How came we to
   have no particulars of what became of him? If those which the story
   gives us be true, that after forty days he was taken up into heaven, we
   need not doubt of his resurrection, for this is as miraculous as that.

   Thirdly, The third and last exception is as unreasonable as any, which
   grants that he did seem to appear to his disciples, but they were
   imposed upon by the illusion of evil spirits.

   Answ. 1. That which may be an evasion in any case, is to be admitted in
   no case. This exception supposeth as much evidence for his
   resurrection, as this or any other thing is capable of; and yet would
   make it an illusion: but this denies all certainty; for if we may be
   deceived when we have the greatest assurance of a thing that our senses
   can give us, then we may not only question the resurrection of Christ,
   but every thing else.

   2. If we believe the providence of God, we cannot think it to be so
   little vigilant, as that honest and well-meaning persons should be
   continually exposed to the insolence and cheats of evil spirits, and in
   a matter of the greatest concernment should be ever liable to be
   deceived, and cannot help it.

   Having thus considered our Saviour's resurrection, and answered the
   objections against it, I proceed to those two miracles which followed
   his resurrection; namely, his ascension into heaven, and his sending
   the Holy Ghost upon the apostles and primitive Christians in such
   miraculous powers and gifts.

   First, His ascension into heaven. And of this the disciples of our
   Saviour were also eye-witnesses. So St. Luke tells us, (Acts i. 4. 9.)
   "And when they were assembled together," and Christ among them after
   his resurrection, and when he had given them in charge what he would
   have them do, "as they looked on, he was taken up; and a cloud received
   him out of their sight." What more visible demonstration could there
   be, that this man was sent of God, than that, after he had preached the
   doctrine which he came to deliver to the world and confirmed it by so
   many miracles, and God had given so great an attestation to him, by
   raising him up from the dead; I say, what more visible demonstration
   that he came from God, than to see him taken up into heaven, after he
   had finished the work for which God sent him into the world?

   Secondly, The sending of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles and primitive
   Christians in such miraculous powers and gifts, whereby they were
   enabled to speak divers languages, in order to the more expedite
   publishing of the gospel to the world, to heal diseases, and to raise
   the dead, to foretell things to come, and (which was common with the
   apostles and all Christians for some ages) they had a power of casting
   out devils, by adjuring them in the name of Christ. Now what could be a
   clearer evidence that he came from God, and was returned to him, than
   the conferring of such miraculous powers and gifts upon men, after he
   was ascended into heaven, as a testimony that he was invested in his
   royalty, having a power conferred upon him to dispense those gifts to
   men?

   But of the ascension [17] of our Saviour, and the extraordinary gifts
   of the Holy Ghost, having upon other occasions discoursed at large, I
   shall need to add no more here; only, before I conclude this head, I
   shall briefly mention the chief of those objections, which these
   miracles which were wrought by our Saviour, and on his behalf, are
   liable to, and endeavour to return a satisfactory answer to them. And
   there are two objections against his miracles in general.

   First, That he wrought them by the power of the devil.

   Secondly, The other objection is taken from that expression of the
   evangelist, (Matt. xiii. 58.) where it is said, that when Jesus was in
   his own country, "he did not many mighty works there, because of their
   unbelief;" which saying is perversely abused by some, as if it
   signified, that the credulity, and strong imagination of the people,
   were a great ingredient into his miracles.

   First, That he wrought them by the power of the devil. This was the
   objection which the Jews of old made against our Saviour, (Matt. xii.
   24.) that he "cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils,"
   who had power and authority over the rest, and consequently to cast out
   those that were subject to him; and the Jews at this day make the same
   objection against all his miracles. Celsus did the same.

   To this I cannot render a better answer than our Saviour himself did,
   when this objection was first started, which was twofold:

   1. That it was very unlikely that the devil should contribute to the
   ruin and overthrow of his own kingdom. (Matt. xii. 25, 26.) "Every
   kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolation: and every
   city or house divided against itself, shall not stand. And if Satan
   cast out Satan, he is divided against himself: how then shall his
   kingdom stand?" The force of which argument is this: that it cannot be
   imagined, that he who preacheth a doctrine so contrary to the design
   which the devil carried on in the world, and so destructive to his
   kingdom, as our Saviour did, should be assisted by him to confirm the
   doctrine by any miraculous effects; especially such as did so directly
   tend to the over throw of his own kingdom, and to dispossess him of the
   advantage of tyrannizing over men, which he was so desirous to get and
   hold.

   But, 2. He tells them, that, by the same reason that they attributed
   those miracles of his to the devil, all miracles that ever were wrought
   in the world, might be attributed to him. Did it appear by the tendency
   of his doctrine, or the course and design of his life and actions, or
   by any magical rites that he used, that he had any familiarity with the
   devil; or carried on any design for him? What colour of reason then was
   there to ascribe the miracles that he wrought to the devil, any more
   than the miracles that Moses had wrought; or any more than those
   dispossessions which were wrought by the children of their own nation,
   in the name of the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob? (ver. 27.) "If
   I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?
   therefore, they shall be your judges." Several among yourselves do, or
   at least pretend to cast out devils, by the power of God, and you
   believe they do so; why should you not think that I do it by the same
   power? what reason have you to suspect me of correspondence with the
   devil more than them? No answer could have been more satisfactory in
   itself, and more opposite to those that made the objection.

   The second objection is grounded upon a spiteful and malicious
   perverting of those words of the evangelist, (Matt. xiii. 58.) where it
   is said, that Jesus, when he was in his own country, "did not many
   mighty works there, because of their unbelief." From whence some
   atheistical persons, as Cæsar Vaninus, and a wretched man of our own
   nation, who, I suppose, stole it out of him, have collected, that
   credulity and strong imagination in the people, were the principal
   ingredients in our Saviour's miracles; and where he did not meet with
   persons so disposed, he could do no great matter.

   This objection deserves rather to be abhorred and detested as a
   groundless and malicious insinuation, than to be answered; but because
   it seems to have some colour as well as spite in it, I shall briefly
   return an answer to it, and that by giving a plain account of this
   passage in the evangelist; and that is this: our Saviour comes to
   Nazareth, the place where he had been born, and he began to instruct
   them in his doctrine, and, as he used to do wherever he came, he
   wrought some miracles for the confirmation of his doctrine; but they,
   upon an unreasonable prejudice taken up against him, because they had
   known the meanness of his parents, and of his education, despised both
   his doctrine and his miracles. Our Saviour, perceiving that upon this
   prejudice they rejected the evidence of his miracles, the highest
   attestation that God can give, saw that there was no good to be done
   upon them; and therefore, leaving them to their own obstinacy and
   unreasonable unbelief, he for bore to do any more great works among
   them: for the text doth not say that he did no mighty works among them,
   because of their unbelief; but that he did not many mighty works among
   them; that is, finding them possessed with this unreasonable prejudice
   against him, he found they were not t6 be convinced by any miracle that
   he could work, and therefore, though he had done some mighty works
   among them, yet he forbore to do any more, as a just judgment upon them
   for their obstinacy and unbelief. And that this is the plain meaning of
   it, there needs no more to convince any man, but to read over this
   passage of the evangelist, (Matt. xiii. 54-58.) "And when he was come
   into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that
   they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and
   these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother
   called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
   And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man
   all these things? And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto
   them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in
   his own house. And he did not many mighty works there, because of their
   unbelief." And now judge, how little reason there is from these words,
   for any such foolish and malicious objection.

   I might add farther, if it were necessary, that many of his miracles
   were such, as no credulity or strength of imagination could assist to
   the working of them; as I could make evident from very many instances,
   particularly that of raising Lazarus, after he had lain four days in
   the grave. But enough of this.

   Now to reflect upon this evidence of Christ's Divine authority from the
   miracles which he did, and which were wrought to give testimony to him.
   What greater satisfaction can any one be imagined to have concerning
   any person, that he is sent from God, than the apostles had, and the
   rest of those who conversed with our Saviour, and saw the miracles that
   were wrought by him, and on his behalf? Suppose we had lived in our
   Saviour's time and had conversed with him, what greater evidence could
   we have desired of his Divine authority, than to have seen with our
   eyes so many strange things done by him, exceeding any natural power
   that we know of, and things so beneficial to mankind; and all these
   wrought so frequently, and so openly? To have seen this person put to
   death, and at that instant the whole frame of nature disordered and put
   out of its course? To have seen this person, after he had lain three
   days in the grave, raised to life again; and to have the greatest
   assurance of this that our senses can give us of any thing: by frequent
   and familiar conversation; by discoursing with him; by eating and
   drinking with him; by touching and handling of his body: and afterwards
   to have seen this same person visibly taken up into heaven; and,
   according as he had promised before he left the world, to have found
   ourselves afterwards endowed with a miraculous power of speaking all on
   the sudden all sorts of languages; of healing diseases; of foretelling
   things to come; of casting out devils; of raising the dead: had we seen
   all this with our eyes and experienced this strange power in ourselves;
   could there have remained any doubt in us, but that this person was
   sent from God, and specially commissioned from heaven, to declare the
   mind of God to the world?

   If, after all this, any man will say, that so many persons as were
   eye-witnesses of these things, might be deceived in a plain sensible
   matter; I would desire that man to prove to me that he is waking, or to
   evidence to me by better arguments, any thing else that he thinks
   himself most certain of.

   IV. The fourth evidence which those who lived in our Saviour's time had
   of his Divine authority, was the spirit of prophecy proved to be in
   him, and made good by the accomplishment of his own predictions. This
   also was a clear testimony that he was from God; for God challengeth
   this as peculiar to the Deity, to foretell future contingents. (Isa.
   xli. 23.) "Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know
   that ye are gods." The oracles of the heathen did give out some dark
   and doubtful conjectures about future things; but a clear and certain
   prediction of things was always looked upon as an argument, that the
   person that could do it was inspired from God; and therefore the spirit
   of prophecy which was in our Saviour, and by him conferred upon the
   apostles afterward, hath always been justly looked upon as a good
   testimony that he was from God. So the angel tells St. John, (Rev. xix.
   10.) that "the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."

   Now the predictions of our Saviour were many; and those very plain, and
   punctual, and particular; and such as all, or most of them, had their
   accomplishment in that age. That we may take a more distinct view of
   them, I shall reduce them to these five heads:

   1. Those that foretold his death, and the circumstances of it.

   2. His resurrection, and the particular circumstances of that.

   3. The descent of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles, with the
   circumstances belonging to that.

   4. The destruction of Jerusalem before the end of that age, with the
   signs foregoing it, and the concomitant circumstances of that.

   5. Those that foretold the fate of the gospel in the world, the
   opposition it should meet with, and yet the admirable success it should
   have, notwithstanding that opposition.

   1. Those that foretell his death? and the circumstances of it. This he
   did very particularly, and at several times; (Matt. xvi. 21.) he told
   his disciples, "That he must go unto Jerusalem, and there suffer many
   things of the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed."
   Mark x. 33, 34. and Matt. xx. 18, 19. he foretells more particularly
   the manner of their proceedings against him, that "the chief priests
   and scribes should condemn him to death;" but that they should not put
   him to death, but "deliver him to the gentiles, to mock, and scourge,
   and crucify him," which was afterwards done by Pilate, the Roman
   governor. He foretold likewise the manner how this should be brought
   about, (Matt. xx. 18.) that he should be "betrayed into the hands of
   men." And he did particularly point out beforehand the man that was to
   betray him, (Matt. xxvi. 23.) "He that dippeth his hand with me in the
   dish, the same shall betray me." He foretold that his disciples should
   forsake him, (Matt. xxvi. 31.) "All of you shall be offended because of
   me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
   sheep shall be scattered." And when Peter declared his confident
   resolution to stick to him, he foretold that he should deny him, with
   very particular circumstances of the time and manner of it; (Mark xiv.
   30.) "This night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me
   thrice:" which was all punctually accomplished.

   2. He punctually foretold his resurrection, with the circumstances of
   it, that "he should rise again the third day," (Matt. xvi. 21.) and
   that "after he was risen, he would. go before them into Galilee,"
   (Matt. xxvi. 32.) which was accomplished. (Matt. xxxviii. 16.)

   3. He foretold likewise the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles
   in miraculous powers and gifts; (Luke xxiv. 49.) "Behold I send the
   promise of my Father upon yon, but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem,
   until ye be endowed with power from on high." He specifies the place
   where the Holy Ghost should descend; and what the effects of this
   descent of the Holy Ghost upon them should be; he tells them
   particularly; (Mark xvi. 17, 18.) "And these signs shall follow them
   that believe: in my name shall they cast out devils, and they shall
   speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents, and if they drink
   any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the
   sick, and they shall recover." All which was punctually fulfilled in
   the second of the Acts, and the following part of that history.

   There are yet two other instances of our Saviour's prophetical spirit,
   which I mentioned; but those I reserve to the next discourse.

SERMON CCXXXVII.

  THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them.--2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   I AM considering the fourth evidence which those who lived in our
   Saviour's time had of his Divine authority, viz. the spirit of
   prophecy, proved to be in him, and made good by the accomplishment of
   his predictions. I gave five instances of our Saviour's predictions.

   1. Those which foretold his death, and its circumstances.

   2. Those which foretold his resurrection, and its circumstances.

   3. Those which foretold the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the
   apostles, with the circumstances thereof.

   These three I have considered, and now proceed to the two which remain:

   4. The next instance therefore of our Saviour's prophetical spirit, is
   his foretelling the destruction of Jerusalem, with the circumstances of
   it. Now be cause this is one of the greatest instances of our Saviour's
   prophetical spirit, and so particular a prediction, so punctually
   answered by the event, therefore I shall insist the longer upon it;
   especially because I look upon it as one of the most convincing
   arguments that can be brought against the Jews for the truth of our
   religion.

   And in order to our clearer proceeding in this matter that I am
   speaking to, I shall do these three things:

   First, Explain the series and order of this prediction of our Saviour's
   concerning the destruction of Jerusalem.

   Secondly, Expound the particulars of it, as we find them in Matt. xxiv.
   compared with the other two evangelists that wrote of it, St. Mark and
   St. Luke.

   Thirdly, Make some reflections upon this prediction, and the punctual
   accomplishment of it; from which it may appear of what force this
   argument is for the conviction of the Jews of the truth of our
   religion.

   First, I shall explain the series and order of this prediction
   concerning the destruction of Jerusalem. And this is necessary, because
   it seems to most interpreters to be so intermingled with a prophecy of
   Christ's last coming at the end of the world, that it is no easy matter
   to separate those two prophecies of the destruction of Jerusalem, and
   the end of the world. Besides that, it is encumbered with some other
   difficulties, arising from some particular expressions in this famous
   prediction of our Saviour's.

   From the 34th verse of the 23d chapter of St. Matthew, to the 29th of
   the 24th chapter, there is a clear prediction of the destruction of
   Jerusalem, with the preceding signs, and concomitant and subsequent
   circumstances of it: but at the 29th verse, the prophecy of the end of
   the world seems to be designedly joined to it: for the evangelist says,
   "Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be
   darkened," &c. Where he enumerates dismal signs, and forerunners of the
   dissolution of all things; but it is now sixteen hundred years since
   the destruction of Jerusalem, and yet the world is not at an end. How
   is it then that the evangelist says, "Immediately after the tribulation
   of those days?" This is the first difficulty.

   Secondly, After this prophecy of the end of the world, we find these
   words in all the three evangelists, "Verily, I say unto you, This
   generation shall not pass away, till all these things be fulfilled." As
   if not only the destruction of Jerusalem, but the end of the world were
   to happen in that age. This is the other difficulty.

   But notwithstanding all this, I doubt not but by comparing the three
   evangelists together, to make the series and order of these prophecies
   very clear.

   In order whereunto, we are to consider that our Saviour in this
   prophecy foretells three things very distinct in time.

   1. The destruction of Jerusalem.

   2. The fate and condemnation of the Jewish nation after this
   desolation, and during their captivity among the gentiles, among whom
   they were to be scattered. And this we have clearly and fully expressed
   by St. Luke, xxi. 23, 24. "There shall be great distress in the land,
   and wrath upon this people. And they shall fall by the edge of the
   sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations, and Jerusalem
   shall be trodden down of the gentiles, until the time of the gentiles
   be fulfilled." So that this prediction comprehends from the destruction
   of Jerusalem all the time of the captivity of the Jews among the
   gentiles, which we see is not yet expired, and God alone knows how long
   it shall last. And then,

   3. Forerunning signs of the end of the world, which the evangelists say
   shall happen "after the tribulation of those days;" that is, when God
   hath made an end of punishing the nation of the Jews. And this seems to
   me wholly to clear and take off the first difficulty.

   As to the second, namely, that, after the prophecy of the end of the
   world, we find these words added by our Saviour, "Verily, I say unto
   you, This generation shall not pass away, till all these things shall
   be fulfilled," which seems to intimate that the end of the world should
   happen in that age: for the answering of this, I shall not betake
   myself to that refuge which some have done, by explaining these words
   thus--"this generation," that is, this nation, "shall not pass away,"
   shall not be utterly destroyed, but shall remain scattered up and down
   the world, as a monument of God's displeasure against them, till the
   end of all things. For though the expression genea` au'te, "this
   generation," may well enough be translated "this nation--this race of
   people;" yet the precedent words will not admit this interpretation;
   for it is said in the verse immediately be fore, "So likewise ye, when
   ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the
   doors." So that our Saviour speaks of something very near at hand,
   which necessarily confines it to that generation.

   Therefore, the plain solution of this difficulty is this: that our
   Saviour ends his prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem, and the
   end of the world, at the 31st verse, where he says, that "the Son of
   man shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they
   shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of
   heaven to the other." And then he makes some reflections upon what he
   had foretold concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, and the end of
   the world.

   (1.) As to the destruction of Jerusalem, he tells them a parable of the
   fig-tree, that, by the putting forth of its leaves, we know that the
   summer is nigh; "So likewise, when ye shall see all these things,"
   namely, all those signs which I have given you of the destruction of
   Jerusalem, "know that it is near, even at the doors;" and then he adds,
   "Verily, I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away until all
   these things be fulfilled;" that is, many of those who are now alive,
   shall live to see all those signs which I have mentioned. And then,

   (2.) He reflects upon his prediction of the end of the world, (ver.
   36.) "But of that day and hour knoweth no man," &c. that is, not of
   that other day, of which I have been speaking, namely, of the end of
   the world, no man knows; as if he had said, The signs which I have
   given of the destruction of Jerusalem, are as plain, as the budding of
   the fig-tree is a sign of summer: but I have not given such plain signs
   of the end of the world, and the day of judgment. That I have declared
   to you in dark allegories, of the sun's being darkened, and the moon's
   not giving her light, and the stars falling from heaven; which cannot
   be understood literally, and the mystical meaning of them is very
   hidden.

   And thus I hope I have removed those difficulties, and made the order
   and series of this prophecy very clear.

   Secondly, I come in the next place to expound the particulars of this
   prophecy, so far as it concerns the destruction of Jerusalem, as we
   find them in the 24th of St. Matthew, compared with the other two
   evangelists that wrote of it, St. Mark and St. Luke; and to shew the
   exact accomplishment of each of these particulars, not only from the
   tradition of Christians, but from the writings of the Jews and
   heathens, which are so much the stronger on our side, because they are
   the testimonies of enemies. And, in the expounding of this prophecy, I
   shall distinctly consider these three things:

   1. Our Saviour's general prediction of the siege, and total destruction
   of the city of Jerusalem, and of the temple, which you have from the
   34th verse of the 23d chapter, to the 3d verse of the 24th.

   2. His prediction of the signs that should forerun the destruction of
   Jerusalem, from verse the 3d to verse the 21st.

   3. The concomitant and subsequent circumstances of it, from verse 21,
   to verse 29.

   1. Our Saviour's general prediction of the siege of Jerusalem, and of
   the total destruction of the city. This our Saviour foretells, (Luke
   xix. 41-44.) "And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept
   over it, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy
   day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from
   thine eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall
   cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on
   every side; and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children
   within thee: and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another;
   because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation." So Josephus
   tells, lib. vi. that Titus raised a wall round about Jerusalem, and
   kept them in on every side; so that none could come out, though many
   thousands were famished with hunger; which was so sad and dismal a
   calamity, that our Saviour, though he knew how just a cause there was
   for it, yet, out of very humanity and tenderness of nature, he could
   not but, upon the foresight of so sad a destruction, weep over it. He,
   indeed, expresseth his vehement desire that this might have been
   prevented; (Matt. xxiii. 37.) "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that
   killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how
   often would I have gathered thee, as a hen gathereth her chickens under
   her wings, and ye would not!" Therefore, having brought this ruin
   wilfully upon themselves, he pronounceth the sentence of their
   desolation, (verse 38.) "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate!"
   And at the beginning of the next chapter, when the disciples were
   shewing him the beautiful structure of the temple, he foretells, that
   "there should not one stone be left upon another, which should not be
   thrown down."

   Now that all this was punctually accomplished, Josephus tells us, lib.
   vii. Bell. Jud. that when the Romans had taken the city, Cæsar gave
   order to lay it waste to the ground, excepting some part of the wall
   which was left for the guards of soldiers, and three of the strongest
   towers, which he ordered to be left for a standing monument of the
   Roman courage; but all the rest of the city was so levelled, that no
   man that should come to see it, could believe that it was ever
   inhabited.

   And our Saviour's prediction of the utter ruin of the temple, was most
   remarkably fulfilled. For the Roman history tells us, that Turnus
   Rufus, with a plough-share, did tear up the foundation of the temple,
   and left no part of it, not so much as under ground, undissolved. So
   that our Saviour's prophecy was literally fulfilled, "There was not
   left one stone upon another, that was not thrown down.

   2. I shall next consider our Saviour's prediction of the signs which
   should forerun the destruction of Jerusalem; namely, these eight:

   First, That there should rise up false and counterfeit Christs, or
   Messiases.

   Secondly, Great judgments should befal the world, and particularly that
   nation, not long before that time; there should be "wars, and rumours
   of wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes, in divers places."

   Thirdly, Fearful sights and signs from heaven.

   Fourthly, Persecution of the Christians.

   Fifthly, That upon this occasion there should be a great apostacy of
   Christians.

   Sixthly, That upon this persecution many false prophets or teachers
   should arise.

   Seventhly, That there should be an universal; publication of the gospel
   before this great desolation should happen.

   Eighthly and lastly, which was to be the most immediate sign and
   forerunner of their ruin, "The abomination of desolation should be seen
   standing in the holy place." And these you have set down from the 3d
   verse of this 24th chapter, to the 21st, which I shall briefly expound,
   and shew how the event did correspond to the prediction.

   Our Saviour having before foretold the destruction of Jerusalem and the
   temple in general, the disciples come to him, and ask him two
   questions; "When these things should be? and what should be the sign of
   his corning?" that is, in judgment, to destroy Jerusalem, and what
   "should be the signs of the end of the world?" I shall only consider
   the first, the signs that should forerun the destruction of Jerusalem,
   as being only pertinent to my present purpose.

   First, He foretells there should be false and counterfeit Christs, or
   Messiases: (ver. 3, 4.) "Take heed that no man deceive you; for many
   shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many/
   This our Saviour gives as one of the first signs, and therefore, St.
   Luke adds, (chap. xxi. 8.) "The time draweth near," that is, it should
   not be long before this sign should appear; and it accordingly
   happened. Josephus mentions several of these; of whom, though Josephus
   do not expressly say that they called themselves the Messias, yet he
   says that which is equivalent, that they undertook to rescue the people
   from the Roman yoke, which was the thing which the Jews expected the
   Messias should do for them: and therefore we find, (Luke xxiv. 21.)
   that the disciples that were going up to Emmaus, and knew not that
   Christ was risen, and were doubtful what to think of him, because it
   was the third day, they say, "We hoped this had been he that should
   have redeemed Israel;" that is, they hoped this had been the Messias,
   that being, it seems, a common periphrasis of the Messias, that he was
   he that was to deliver Israel. Such as one Theudas pretended himself to
   be; not that Theudas of whom Gamaliel speaks (Acts v. 36.), but another
   of the same name, who, about twelve years after our Saviour's death,
   when one Cuspius Fadus was procurator of Judea, rose and seduced the
   people; of whom Josephus (lib. xviii.) gives this account--that, being
   a sorcerer, he rose up, and deceived many; which is the very expression
   our Saviour useth, "they shall deceive many." This man persuaded a
   great multitude to bring their goods and follow him down the river
   Jordan, which he promised by his command to divide, and to give them a
   safe passage over it. But while he was thus playing the fool among the
   people, Fadus sent some forces, and surprised him and his company,
   killing many of them, and cutting off his head; and so there was an end
   of him.

   Such likewise were those impostors, which, about two-and-twenty years
   after our Saviour's death, were so rife among them, when Felix was
   governor of Judea; of whom Josephus tells us, that they drew multitudes
   after them into the wilderness, promising to work great signs and
   wonders before them; which agrees exactly with the description which
   our Saviour gives of the false Christs and false prophets (ver. 24.),
   where he says, that they should "shew great signs and wonders," semeia
   kai` te'rata, the very words which Josephus useth. And, (ver. 26.) "If
   they shall say to you, He is in the desert, go not forth;" answerable
   to what Josephus says, "that they drew many after them into the
   wilderness."

   Such an one likewise was the Egyptian prophet, who, as Josephus tells,
   came to Jerusalem much about the same time, and persuaded the people to
   follow him to Mount Olivet, persuading them, that from thence they
   should see the walls of Jerusalem fall, and so might enter the city;
   which Felix understanding, sent soldiers, and slew and took several of
   them, but the Egyptian impostor himself made an escape; which is the
   reason of that saying of the chief captain to Paul, (Acts xxi. 38.)
   "Art not thou the Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar,"
   &c.

   Such another was that impostor (if he be distinct from the former) who,
   as Josephus tells us, about three years after, under Festus Portius,
   the procurator, deceived the people with vain promises of deliverance
   and ease from their oppressions, if they would follow him into the
   wilderness; but Festus sent soldiers, and destroyed him and his
   company.

   "And shall deceive many;" that is, by raising false expectations in the
   people, shall draw them into ruin, as Josephus tells us they did many
   of the Jews. And this our Saviour elsewhere foretold as a just judgment
   of God upon them for rejecting of him who was the true Messias; (John
   v. 43.) "I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not; if
   another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive."

   Secondly, The next sign our Saviour gives, is "wars, and rumours of
   wars, famines, pestilences, earthquakes," &c. (ver. 6, 7.) "And ye
   shall hear of wars and rumours of wars." About this time the Jews began
   to be set upon in several places, by the command of the emperor, and
   many thousands of them were slain at Alexandria and Babylon, as
   Josephus tells us. And there was a fear and rumour of a general war
   denounced against them by Caius Caligula, the emperor, unless they
   would receive his statue into the temple. Upon this rumour the whole
   nation was in great astonishment, insomuch that the Jews left their
   business, and neglected to till their, grounds, expecting the Romans
   would have fallen upon them; of which consternation, both Josephus and
   Philo give us a particular account.

   Our Saviour adds, "See that ye be not troubled; for these things must
   come to pass, but the end is not yet;" that is, when you see the nation
   in this danger from the Romans, be not ye troubled, as the Jews will
   be, thinking now will be the ruin of the nation. This and many other
   things will happen, before the final end come. And accordingly it fell
   out. For so Josephus and Tacitus tell us, that this storm was blown
   over by the sudden death of the emperor.

   (Verse 7.) "Nation shall rise up against nation." Which happened under
   Claudius and Nero, the two next Roman emperors, when, in several
   cities, as Cesarea, Ptolemais, and many others, the Jews, and those of
   other nations that inhabited those cities, fell upon and destroyed one
   another, as may be read at large in Josephus.

   And "kingdom against kingdom." This seems to refer to the several
   provinces or tetrarchies in Palestine, which were also called kingdoms,
   which at this time had cruel wars against one another; as the Jews and
   the Galileans against the Samaritans, and several others that Josephus
   speaks of.

   "And there shall be famines and pestilences;" accordingly Josephus
   tells us, that under Claudius Cæsar there was a great famine in Judea;
   namely, that which was prophesied of by Agabus (Acts xi. 28.) And this
   Grotius very probably supposeth to be the reason why St. Paul, in his
   epistles written about that time, is so earnest with the Christians to
   send relief to the saints at Jerusalem. "Pestilences," they usually
   follow famine; "and earthquakes, in divers places," which happened in
   the times of Claudius and Nero. Philostratus speaks of a great earth
   quake that happened in Crete in the time of Claudius, and in several
   other places, as Smyrna, Chios, Samos, &c. not long before the
   destruction of Jerusalem; Tacitus speaks of one in Asia about the same
   time. And though these were at a greater distance than the other signs
   which our Saviour mentions, yet the Jews could not but hear of them,
   because several of the nation were dispersed into some of those places.

   Thirdly, "Fearful sights and signs from heaven." So St. Luke, (chap.
   xxi. 11.) "There shall be fearful sights, and great signs from heaven."
   Joseph us gives us a clear comment upon this; Bell. Jud. lib. vii. says
   he, "This wretched people believed impostors and counterfeits; but
   those great signs and prodigies which did forerun their desolation,
   they neither minded, nor believed." A little before their destruction
   (he tells us) there hung over their city a fiery sword, which continued
   for a year together. A little before their rebellion against the
   Romans, there appeared a comet, which shined so clear in the temple,
   and about the altar, as if it had been day. And the same day an heifer,
   that was led to be sacrificed, brought forth a lamb in the middle of
   the temple. The eastern gate of the temple, which was of massy brass,
   and very heavy, and could scarce be shut by the strength of twenty men,
   and was constantly made fast with strong locks and bars, flew open at
   midnight, which, when it was told to the magistrate, and he came to see
   it, they could scarce get strength enough to shut it. One evening not
   long before their desolation, there were seen in the air chariots and
   armies hovering over the city. At the feast of Pentecost, the priests,
   going one night into the temple, according to their custom, first heard
   a noise, and afterwards a sudden voice, saying, "Let us go hence." And,
   which is very terrible, one Jesus, a plain countryman, four years
   before any troubles began, when the city was in a deep peace, came up
   to Jerusalem, and upon one of their festivals, began to cry out with a
   loud voice, "A voice from the east, a voice from the west, a voice from
   the four winds, a voice against Jerusalem and the temple, a voice
   against bridegrooms and brides, a voice against the people." And thus
   he went about crying day and night; and being seized on by the
   magistrate, and punished and tortured, he would not give over, but
   still went crying about, "Woe, woe to Jerusalem!" And thus he continued
   for seven years and five months together, and was neither weary nor
   hoarse until the city was besieged, and then he was quiet; but one time
   went up upon the walls, and cried with a loud voice, "Woe, woe to the
   city, and the temple, and the people!" and added, "Woe also to myself!"
   and immediately was struck dead by a stone out of a cross-bow.

   Were not these "fearful sights, and great signs from heaven?" and these
   we have all related by one of the most prudent historians, who lived at
   that very time, and that very place; and he says, that many were alive
   when he wrote, and could attest all this.

   (Verse 8.) "All these are the beginning of sorrows." The Scripture
   usually compares the greatest sufferings and afflictions to the pains
   of a woman in travail, to which our Saviour here alludes, and says,
   "These were but the first pangs, nothing to those throes which should
   come at last."

   These are three of the signs forerunning the destruction of Jerusalem,
   which were predicted by our Saviour. There are yet five more, which I
   reserve for my next discourse on this subject.

  SERMON CCXXXVIII.

    THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them.--2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   THE fourth evidence, which those who lived in our Saviour's time had of
   his Divine authority, was, the spirit of prophecy, proved to be in him,
   and made good by the accomplishment of his predictions.

   I have given five instances of our Saviour's predictions, and am now
   treating of them, viz. his foretelling the destruction of Jerusalem,
   with the circumstances of it.

   In explaining the particulars of this prophecy, I proposed three things
   to be considered:

   1. Our Saviour's general prediction of the siege, and total destruction
   of Jerusalem and the temple.

   2. His predictions of the signs that should fore run it.

   3. His predictions of the concomitant and subsequent circumstances of
   it.

   I am upon the second of these, viz. our Saviour's prediction of the
   signs that should forerun the destruction of Jerusalem; three of which
   I have despatched, and now proceed to those which remain.

   Fourthly, Another sign which our Saviour foretold, as a forerunner of
   the destruction of Jerusalem, was, persecution of the Christians. "They
   shall deliver you to be afflicted, and shall kill you." St. Mark
   expresseth it more particularly; (Mark xiii. 9.) "But take heed to
   yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils, and in the
   synagogues ye shall be beaten, and ye shall be brought before rulers
   and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them." And these did
   partly happen before the forementioned calamities, and partly upon
   them: but our Saviour first reckons by themselves the common calamities
   of the nation; and then he comes to those which did concern his
   disciples and followers; and this follows very fitly upon the former
   more general calamities. For we find the fathers in their apologies
   every where complaining, that the Jews and heathens laid the blame of
   all the judgments and calamities which befel them, as famine,
   pestilence, and earthquakes, upon the Christians, as the causes of
   them; and from this pretence they many times took occasion to persecute
   them.

   "They shall deliver you to be afflicted." This was fulfilled in
   delivering some of the apostles to be whipped and imprisoned by the
   chief priests and rulers, as Peter and John; or giving them up to the
   Roman power, as they did James and Peter to Herod; Paul to Gallic,
   Felix, and Festus, and last of all to Nero.

   "And shall kill you." St. Luke saith, "some of you;" for of others he
   saith, "that not a hair of their head should fall to the ground." Thus
   Stephen was killed by a popular tumult; and the two Jameses were put to
   death under colour of a judicial process; the one stoned by the council
   of the Jews, and the other put to death by Herod.

   "And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake." Which began
   under Nero, who, charging the Christians with the burning of the city,
   as Tacitus tells us, when himself had set it on fire, tortured many of
   them as guilty of the fact, "For my name's sake." This was exactly
   fulfilled, in that the Christians were so miserably persecuted for no
   other cause, but for being called Christians. They did not punish them
   for opposing their idolatry, for that the Jews did as well as the
   Christians, who yet escaped their malice; nor could they lay any other
   crime to their charge. Hence was that common saying among the heathens,
   Vir bonus Caius Sejus; tantummodo quod Christianus.

   Fifthly, And upon this persecution, the apostacy of many from
   Christianity; (verse 10.) "Then shall many be offended;" that is, fall
   off from Christianity because of these persecutions; as we read several
   did, Demas, Hermogenes, Phygellus, and probably several others.

   "And they shall betray one another, and hate one another." Which was
   remarkably fulfilled in the sect of the gnostics, who did not only
   decline persecution themselves, but joined with those that persecuted
   the Christians, as ecclesiastical history tells us.

   Sixthly, That likewise upon this occasion of persecution "many false
   prophets should arise and deceive many," (ver. 11.) which seems to
   refer to Simon Magus, who gave himself out to be the power of God, and
   to the other heads of the gnostic sect. (Ver. 12.) "And the love of
   many shall grow cold, because iniquity shall abound." Which seems to
   refer likewise to the gnostics, of whom St. John, in his First Epistle,
   doth so frequently make mention of their name; as "He that saith, I
   know him, and keepeth not his commandments," &c. of whom he doth so
   much complain for want of love to their brethren.

   (Verse 13.) "But he that shall endure to the end shall be saved;" that
   is, he that shall continue constant in the profession of the faith,
   notwithstanding these persecutions and apostacies, and false teachers
   that shall arise, shall be saved.

   Seventhly, That there should be an universal publication of the gospel,
   before this great desolation should happen: (ver. 14.) "And this gospel
   of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto
   all nations." And this was accomplished before the destruction of
   Jerusalem: for the gospel was published all over the Roman empire,
   before that time: and that is it which is here meant by "the world," in
   the same sense that Augustus is said by St. Luke, "to have taxed all
   the world." And this is the very phrase which the Romans constantly
   used, calling the Roman empire, imperium orbis terrarum. And that the
   gospel was thus published, we may easily believe, if we consider how
   many were sent forth for this purpose, and what indefatigable pains
   they took in this work; especially St. Paul, who preached from
   Jerusalem to Illyricum, which, according to the account which he gives
   of the journey, is computed to be no less than two thousand miles, and
   yet he made considerable stays in many places.

   "For a witness unto all nations;" that is, that all nations might be
   convinced of the unreasonable obstinacy of the Jews, before God brought
   those dreadful calamities upon that nation.

   "And then shall the end come;" that is, the final destruction of the
   Jews, the total desolation of the Jewish church and commonwealth,
   according to the prophecy of Jacob, (Gen. xlix. 10.) which put these
   two signs together, that "the sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor
   a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall
   the gathering of the people be."

   Eighthly, The last and most immediate sign and forerunner which he gave
   of their destruction, is, "the standing of the abomination of
   desolation in the holy place:" (ver. 15.) "When ye shall see the
   abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in
   the holy place; then let them which be in Judea flee into the
   mountains." There is a great difference among expositors, what is here
   meant by "the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place."
   Some refer it to the statue of Adrian the emperor, placed where the
   temple was at Jerusalem. But that cannot be, because that was a long
   time after the destruction of Jerusalem, and therefore could not be
   given by our Saviour for a sign and forerunner of it. Others (as
   Capellus) refer it to the faction of the zealots, which, before Titus
   came to besiege Jerusalem, seized upon the temple, and profaned it by
   bloodshed and slaughter, and made so horrible a devastation in the
   city. And this would not be improbable, if St. Luke had not given us so
   clear an interpretation of it; (Luke xxi. 20, 21.) who, instead of "the
   abomination of desolation," mentioned by St. Matthew and St. Mark, puts
   the Roman armies: "And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with
   armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them
   that are in Judea flee to the mountains." So that, according to St.
   Luke, "the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place," is
   the Roman armies compassing Jerusalem; which, therefore, is called "the
   abomination of desolation," because it would cause so great a
   desolation among them. "When ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies,
   then know that the desolation thereof is nigh:" and it is said to stand
   in the holy place," because Jerusalem was the holy city, and so many
   furlongs about it were accounted holy. Now when the Roman army should
   approach within the limits of the holy ground, then the "abomination of
   desolation" might be said to "stand in the holy place:" but the word
   abomination seems particularly to refer to the Roman ensigns, upon
   which were the images of their emperors, which the Romans worshipped,
   as Suetonius expressly tells us; and Tacitus calls them their bellorum
   dii, their gods of war. Now it was an abomination to the Jews to see
   these idols set up within the limits of the holy city. To which I may
   add, what Josephus tells us afterward, that the Romans, after they had
   conquered the city, set up those ensigns in the ruins of the temple,
   and sacrificed to them,

   (Verse 15.) "Then let them that be in Judea flee to the mountains; and
   let him which is on the house top not come down to take any thing out
   of his house: neither let him which is in the field, return back to
   take his clothes;" which are several expressions to signify what haste
   the Christians would make, when they saw the Romans making so near
   approaches to Jerusalem.

   "Let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains." Some refer this to
   the last siege by Titus; but I see no probability for that; for the
   Jews did not permit any to go out of the city. Others refer it to
   Vespasian's drawing his forces toward Jerusalem sometime before the
   siege, but hearing of the death of Nero, the emperor, he forbore to
   besiege it till he had received orders from the new emperor; and that
   this was a warning to the Christians, and they took their opportunity
   then to flee into the mountains. But this could not be neither,
   because, for a good while before, the faction of the zealots under John
   and Simon's faction, who lay without the city, did slay all who
   endeavoured to escape out of the city. If we limit these words to
   Jerusalem (which the text does not) the most probable time was when
   Jerusalem was first compassed by the Roman army under Cestius Gall us,
   who after ward withdrew his siege; and then, indeed, those that would,
   had liberty to flee away. And at this time Josephus doth say that many
   did flee, foreseeing the approaching danger. But there is no reason to
   confine it to Jerusalem; for our Saviour's words are more large, "Then
   let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains." And if so, there is
   an express passage in Josephus to this purpose: that when Titus was
   drawing up his forces towards Jerusalem, a great number of those who
   were at Jericho went from thence, eis ta` oreine, into the mountainous
   places, and thereby consulted their own safety.

   (Verse 15.) "Let him that is on the house-top not come down to take any
   thing from thence." Our Saviour alludes to the fashion of the Jewish
   houses, which had plain roofs, upon which they used to walk; and he
   bids them make such haste, that when they saw this sign they should not
   think of saving any thing in their houses, but to betake themselves
   presently to the mountains for safety.

   (Verse 16.) "Neither let him that is in the field return back to take
   his clothes." Another expression to signify what haste they should make
   from the approaching danger.

   (Verse 17.) "But woe unto them that are with child, and to those that
   give suck in those days," because of the impediment that this would be
   to their flight. Or, possibly, it may refer to the dreadful story, not
   paralleled in any place or age, which Josephus tells of one Mary, who,
   in the time of the siege, out of very famine, boiled her sucking child
   and eat it. And therefore St. Luke (xxi. 23.) does mention this of the
   women's being with child, not as an impediment to flight, but as an
   instance of the great calamity that should befal them: (Luke xxi. 23.)
   "But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in
   those days: for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath
   upon this people."

   (Verse 18.) "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, nor on
   the sabbath-day/ "Not in winter," because of the hardness of the
   season, and the difficulty of travelling and living upon the mountains:
   "nor on the sabbath-day." This concerned the Christian Jews as well as
   others, most of which observed the Jewish law and rites after our
   Saviour's death, till the desolation of the Jewish state and temple, as
   appears out of the history of the Acts. For though St. Paul stood for
   the liberty of the gentiles, yet it appears from Acts xxi. 21. that he
   vindicated himself from the calumny or aspersion which was cast upon
   him, as if he taught the Jews which were among the gentiles to forsake
   Moses, and that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to
   walk after their customs. So that the Christian Jews, retaining the
   observance of the Jewish sabbath, upon which it was not lawful to go
   any farther than a sabbath-day's journey, which was scarce two miles;
   if the danger should happen at that time (as the Romans usually took
   advantages to make all their onsets on that day, knowing the
   superstition of the Jews in that point) they must Heeds have been in
   great perplexity.

   Having thus particularly treated of the signs which our Saviour
   foretold, as the forerunners of the destruction of Jerusalem, I
   proceed,

   3. To consider the concomitant and subsequent circumstances of it. As,

   1. The unparalleled greatness of their calamity.

   2. The arising of false Christs.

   3. Their being led into captivity, and dispersed up and down in the
   world.

   4. Their continuance in this captivity and dispersed state out of their
   country, till the gospel had had its course among the gentiles.

   1. The unparalleled greatness of their calamity and destruction; (ver.
   19.) "For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not from the
   beginning of the world to this time, neither ever shall be." This is a
   very material circumstance in this prophecy, that the calamity of the
   Jews should be so strange and unparalleled as never was in the world
   before: for though it might easily have been foretold from the temper
   of the people, which was prone to sedition, that they were very like.
   to provoke the Romans against them; yet there was no probability that
   all things should have come to that extremity; for it was not the
   design of the Roman government to destroy any of those provinces which
   were under them, but only to keep them in subjection, and reduce them
   by reasonable severity in case of revolt. But that such a calamity
   should have happened to them under Titus, who was the mildest and
   farthest from severity of all mankind, nothing was more unlikely; and
   that any people should conspire together to their own ruin, and so
   blindly and obstinately run themselves into such calamities, as made
   them the pity of their enemies, was the most incredible thing; so that
   no thing less than a prophetical spirit could have foretold so
   contingent and improbable a thing as this was.

   St. Luke expresseth the dismal calamity that should happen to them in
   other words, but much to the same sense: (Luke xxi. 22, 23.) "For these
   be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be
   fulfilled. But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
   suck, in those days: for there shall be great distress in the land, and
   wrath upon this people." And to this Josephus fully gives testimony, as
   will appear, both by what he says in general concerning their calamity,
   and by the particular account of their miseries and sufferings.

   (1.) In general he tells us, "that never was any age so fruitful of
   misery as this was;" and almost in our Saviour's words, in his preface
   to his books of the siege of Jerusalem, he says, that "all the
   calamities that had fallen upon any nation from the beginning of the
   world, were but small in comparison of what happened to the nation of
   the Jews in that age." And in his sixth book he says, that "as there
   was never any nation so wicked, so never any nation suffered such
   calamitous accidents." But this will best appear,

   (2 ) By a brief and particular enumeration of their calamities. Not to
   mention the burning and destroying of several of their chief cities, as
   Zabulon, Gadara, Japha, Jotapatah, Joppa, and several others, I shall
   insist chiefly upon the sufferings of the people themselves, by their
   tumults and seditions against the Romans. Before the coming of
   Vespasian, there were slain at Jerusalem and in Syria two thousand, at
   Askalon two thousand five hundred, at Ptolemais two thousand, at
   Alexandria fifty thousand, at Joppa eight thousand four hundred, at
   Mount Asamon two thousand, at Damascus ten thousand, and afterward at
   Askalon by Antonius a Roman commander eighteen thousand; in all, almost
   one hundred thousand.

   By Vespasian in Galilee and other parts, very great numbers; at Japha
   fifteen thousand, at Mount Gerizim eleven thousand six hundred, at
   Jotapatah (the city of which Josephus our historian was governor) forty
   thousand, at Joppa four thousand, at Tarichæa near upon eight thousand,
   at Gamala nine thousand, at Giscala two thousand; in all fourscore and
   ten thousand.

   Afterward, by their own seditions at Jerusalem, eight thousand five
   hundred at several times: and afterward, by the faction of the zealots,
   twelve thousand of the chiefest and noblest of the citizens were slain
   at one time; at the river Jordan by Placidus thirteen thousand, besides
   many thousands drowned, so that the river was filled up almost with
   dead carcasses: at two towns in Idumæa by Vespasian ten thousand, at
   Gerasa, one thousand; in all forty-five thousand.

   Whilst Vespasian was thus wasting the cities of Judea, the faction of
   the zealots filled all places at Jerusalem, even the temple itself,
   with continual slaughters; and after they had conquered Ananus, who
   stood for the people against the zealots, and got all into their own
   hands, they were divided into parties, and made slaughter of one
   another; and one party let in Simon, who headed a seditious multitude,
   which he brought out of the country; and after that they were
   subdivided into three parties, John's, and Eleazer's, and Simon's,
   which held several parts of the city, and day and night continued to
   destroy one another; in which seditions all their granaries of corn,
   and magazines of arms, were burnt; so that though provision had been
   laid in the city, that would have sufficed for several years, yet, be
   fore they came to be besieged by Titus, they were almost reduced to
   famine.

   And after they were besieged, at the first they united a little against
   the Romans; yet, after a few days, they divided again into factions,
   and more of them were slain by one another's hand, and with more
   cruelty, than by the Romans; insomuch that Titus, the general of the
   Romans, wept several times, to consider the misery they brought upon
   themselves; and their very enemies were more pitiful to wards them,
   than they to one another.

   After two months siege, the famine began to rage within, and then all
   manner of cruelties was exercised by the soldiers upon that miserable
   people; and at last they were brought to such necessity, that many
   endeavoured to flee out to the enemy, and yet were not permitted; but
   as many as were suspected of any endeavour to escape were cruelly
   killed. It is not to be imagined what barbarous inhumanities, in those
   straits, all exercised one towards another; snatching the meat out of
   one another's mouth, and from their dearest friends, and their very
   children.

   And so obstinate were they, that neither those calamities which they
   suffered, nor the severity of the Romans in crucifying many thousands
   of them before the walls, and threatening them all with the same death,
   in case they would not yield, in ripping open the bowels of two
   thousand of them in a night, who fled out of Jerusalem, upon a report
   that they had swallowed gold (as many of them had, Josephus, lib. vi.
   cap. 15.) nor all the kind messages of Titus, offering peace to them,
   and using all manner of intreaties and persuasions not to run upon
   their own ruin, could prevail with them to accept of a peace. And thus
   they continued, till by famine and force the city was taken, and then
   their provocation of the Romans to cruelty towards those they had got
   into their power was so great, that Titus was not able to withhold the
   soldiers from exercising great cruelties towards them.

   In short, from the beginning of the siege, to the taking of the city,
   there were famished and slain by the factions among themselves and by
   the Romans one million one hundred thousand; the greatest number, and
   with the saddest circumstances, that is to be read of in any story.

   Was not this "a time of great tribulation?" Were not these "days of
   vengeance" indeed? Was there ever a sadder accomplishment of any
   prediction, than these words of our Saviour had?

   And after all this, the temple was burnt and made desolate, the whole
   city destroyed, and all their whole land seized by the Roman emperor,
   and the remnant of the people in other parts of the nation were
   prosecuted with great severity. Great numbers of Jews were destroyed at
   the taking of the castle of Herodion, and Machærus, and Massada, and in
   the thickets or wood of Jandes. And there were great slaughters of the
   Jews in other parts, at Antioch, in all places about Alexandria and
   Thebes, and at Cyrene, so that it was visible that there was "wrath
   upon this people."

   (Verse 22.) "And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no
   flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen,
   he hath shortened the days;" that is, if those calamities had lasted a
   little longer, there would not one Jew have been left alive: "but for
   the elect's sake," that is, for the sake of those Christians who were
   left among them, "those days were shortened:" God inclining the heart
   of Titus to shew pity towards the remnant, and not to suffer the
   nations to exercise any more cruelty towards them; particularly at
   Antioch (the first seat of the Christians). Josephus tells us, that
   when Titus came thither, the people petitioned him earnestly, that they
   might expel the Jews, but he told them that was unreasonable, for now
   their country was laid waste, there was no place for them to go to.
   Thus we see how, "for the elect's sake, those days were shortened."

   2. Another circumstance, which was to follow the destruction of
   Jerusalem, was, the arising of false Christs, and false prophets, (ver.
   23, 24.) "And then, if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ,
   or, lo, he is there! believe him not. For false Christs and false
   prophets shall arise, and shall shew signs and wonders." Such was
   Jonathan, who presently after the destruction of Jerusalem, as Josephus
   tells us, drew many into the wilderness of Cyrene, pretending that he
   would shew signs and wonders to them; therefore our Saviour adds, (ver.
   25, 26.) "Behold, I have told you before.--Wherefore if they shall say
   unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth." There appeared in
   Egypt, Crete, and Cyprus, several other impostors, who gave themselves
   out to be Christs and false prophets, who applied the prophecies of the
   Old Testament to these counterfeit Messiases; as they did that of
   Balaam concerning a "star coming out of Jacob" to Barchochebas, be
   cause his name signifies "the son of a star." And this was a notorious
   impostor in the time of Adrian the emperor, not many years after the
   destruction of Jerusalem, about twenty (as I remember) Eusebius counts;
   he had a great multitude followed him, which put to death many
   Christians, because they would not renounce Christ, and join with them
   against the Romans, and that was the cause of the death of some hundred
   thousands of them.

   3. Another subsequent circumstance, was, the Jews being led into
   captivity, and dispersed into all nations. This St. Luke adds, (Luke
   xxi. 24.) "They shall be led away captive into all nations." I need not
   prove this out of history; we see the effect of it to this day.

   4. That they should continue in this captivity and dispersed state, and
   their city remain in the power of the gentiles, "until the times of the
   gentiles were fulfilled." So also St. Luke tells us, (ver. 24.) "They
   shall be led away captive into all nations, and Jerusalem shall be
   trodden down of the gentiles, until the time of the gentiles be
   fulfilled;" that is, till the gospel have had its course among the
   nations. And thus it is still with them at this day, Jerusalem is in
   the hands of other nations, and the captivity of the Jews continues;
   and when it shall end, God alone knows.

   Having thus explained the particulars of our Saviour's prediction,
   concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, I should in the next place
   proceed to make some reflections upon this prediction, and its punctual
   accomplishment; but this I reserve for the following discourse.
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON CCXXXIX.

  THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them.--2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   IN discoursing on the fourth evidence which those who lived in our
   Saviour's time had of his Divine authority, viz. the spirit of
   prophecy, proved to be in him, and made good by the accomplishment of
   his predictions, I came to consider that remarkable prediction of the
   destruction of Jerusalem.

   In doing this, I proposed three things:

   First, To explain the series and order of this prediction.

   Secondly, To consider the particulars of it, as we find them in the
   24th of St. Matthew, compared with the other two evangelists.

   Thirdly, To make some reflections upon this prediction, and its
   punctual accomplishment. The two former of these I have despatched, and
   now proceed to what remains, viz. the

   Third thing I propounded, which was, to make some reflections upon this
   prediction of our Saviour's concerning the destruction of Jerusalem,
   and the punctual accomplishment of it. And now that I have been so
   large in the explication of this prophecy, I shall make use of this
   argument farther than I intended, not only to shew that those who lived
   in that age, and saw our Saviour's prediction so punctually answered by
   the event, might from hence be satisfied of the prophetic spirit of our
   Saviour, and consequently of his Divine authority; but likewise to shew
   of what force to the conviction of the Jews this consideration is, of
   the destruction of Jerusalem, and that long train of miserable
   consequences which followed upon it, and have lasted to this day.

   And the reflections I shall make upon this shall be these:

   I. That nothing less than a prophetic spirit could so punctually have
   foretold so many contingents, and improbable things, as this prediction
   of our Saviour's does contain in it. Such were some of those signs
   which did forerun the destruction of Jerusalem as, the great famine
   which happened under Claudius; the several great earthquakes under
   Claudius and Nero; the universal publication of the gospel all over the
   Roman empire, in so short a space; those wonderful sights, and
   prodigious signs from heaven, so strange as are not to be paralleled in
   any history. And such likewise were the circumstances of the
   destruction of the city and the temple; as, that it should be an utter
   desolation, which was strangely accomplished, when, as Josephus tells
   us, the very mountain upon which the temple stood was almost burnt up
   and consumed with the fierceness of the fire; and the Roman history
   gives account of the plucking up of the very foundations of the temple,
   by Rufus Turnus: but the most remarkable circumstance of all, which is
   so fully expressed by our Saviour in this prediction, was, the strange
   and unexampled calamities which should attend this destruction, such as
   never befel any people before, which our Saviour foretells in these
   words, "Then shall be great tribulation, such as was not from the
   beginning of the world to this time, nor ever shall be." And never had
   any words a more sad and full accomplishment than this part of our
   Saviour's prophecy had, in those woful miseries which befel that people
   by civil and intestine seditions, and the utmost extremity that famine
   could reduce a people to; besides the cruel ties of a foreign enemy. No
   history makes mention of so vast a number of men, that in so short a
   time did perish in such sad circumstances; fourteen or fifteen hundred
   thousand within less than a year's space, and more of these by far
   cruelly murdered by one another's hands than by the Romans. So that
   these were "days of vengeance," and "of great tribulation," such as the
   world had never seen before, and "if they had not been shortened, no
   flesh could have been saved," as our Saviour adds in the prophecy; if
   things had gone on at that rate a little longer, not one of the Jewish
   nation would have been left alive.

   Now that our Saviour should foretell so punctually the sad calamity of
   this people, I take to be one of the most material circumstances of
   this prophecy, and to be a thing so contingent and unlikely, that it
   could not have been foreseen, but by Divine inspiration. For though one
   might easily have foretold from the temper of the people, which was
   prone to sedition, and very impatient of the Roman government, that the
   Jews were very likely in a short time to provoke the Romans against
   them; yet there was no probability at all, that things should have come
   to that extremity; for it was not in the design of the Roman government
   to destroy any of their provinces; but that such a calamity should have
   happened unto them under Titus, who was the mildest and farthest from
   cruelty of all mankind, nothing was more unlikely; that ever any people
   should have been so besotted, as the Jews were at that time, and have
   so madly conspired together to their own ruin, as they did; that they
   should so blindly and obstinately run themselves into such calamities,
   as made them the pity of their very enemies, was the most incredible
   thing in the world. Nothing but a prophetic spirit could have foretold
   an event so contingent, and so extremely improbable.

   II. Not only those who lived in that age were capable of satisfaction
   concerning the accomplishment of this prediction of our Saviour; but
   that we also might receive full satisfaction concerning this, the
   providence of God hath so ordered it, as to preserve to us a more
   punctual and credible history of the destruction of Jerusalem, than
   there is of any other matter whatsoever so long since done.

   And this is more considerable, than possibly at first we may imagine.
   For,

   1. We have this matter related, not by a Christian (who might have been
   suspected of partiality, and a design to have paralleled the event with
   our Saviour's prediction), but by a Jew, both by nation and religion,
   who seems designedly to have avoided, as much as possibly he could, the
   very mention of the Christian name, and all particulars relating to our
   Saviour, though no historian was ever more punctual in all other
   things.

   2. We have this matter related by one that was an eye-witness of all
   those sad calamities that befel the nation of the Jews, and during the
   war in Galilee, against Vespasian, was one of their chief commanders,
   and being taken by the Romans, was in their camp all the time that
   Jerusalem was besieged.

   3. As he was an eye-witness, and so able to give the truest account of
   those matters, so hath he always had the repute of a most faithful
   historian. Joseph Scaliger, who was a very good judge in these matters,
   gives this character of him; that he was diligentissimus kai`
   philalethi'statos, omnium scriptorum; "The most painful historian, and
   the greatest lover of truth, of any that he had ever read;" De quo nos
   hoc audacter dicimus, non solum in rebus Judaicis, sed etiam in
   externis, tutius illi credi quam omnibus Græcis et Latinis historicis;
   "Of whom (says he) I might confidently affirm, that not only in the
   Jewish affairs, but in all foreign matters, one may more safely rely
   upon his credit, than upon all the Greek and Latin historians put
   together."

   4. There is no ancient history extant, that relates any matter with so
   much particularity of circumstances, as Josephus does this of the
   Jewish wars, especially the siege and destruction of Jerusalem.

   5. That the providence of God may appear the more remarkable in this
   history, which is the only punctual one that hath been preserved down
   to us of this great action, it will be worth our observation to
   consider, how remarkably this person was preserved for the writing of
   this history.

   When Vespasian made war upon Galilee, Josephus was chief commander
   there, and was besieged by Vespasian, in the city of Jotapatah; which,
   after a long and stout resistance, being taken by the Romans, he, with
   forty more, hid themselves in a cave, where at last they were
   discovered by the Romans; which Vespasian hearing of, sent and offered
   them life; and Josephus would have accepted of their offer, but the
   rest would not permit him to yield himself, but threatened to kill him;
   and when by no persuasions he could take them off from this obstinate
   resolution, he was glad to propound this to them that they should cast
   lots, two by two, who should die first, and he that had the second lot
   should kill the first, and the next him, and so on, and the last should
   kill himself. The providence of God preserved Josephus and another to
   the last lot; and when all the rest were killed, Josephus persuaded him
   to yield himself up to the Romans, and so they two escaped with their
   lives; by which remarkable providence he was preserved to write this
   history.

   III. It seems very plain, from this relation which Josephus gives, that
   the Jewish nation were remarkably devoted by God to destruction, and
   most fatally hardened and blinded to their own ruin. This Josephus
   every where takes notice of, that there was a sad and black fate hung
   over the nation, and God seemed to have determined their ruin. And
   after the destruction of Jerusalem, when the castle of Massada was
   besieged by the Romans, Eleazer, the governor, in his speech to the
   soldiers, reckons up the sad symptoms of God's displeasure against
   them; and tells them, that from the beginning of the war it was easy
   for any one to conjecture, that God in great wrath had devoted the
   nation, which he formerly loved, to destruction.

   And indeed all along the hand of God was very visible against them; for
   when, in the beginning of their rebellion, Cestus Gallus, the Roman
   commander, had an opportunity to have taken Jerusalem, and to have put
   an end to the war; Josephus tells us, that God, being angry with them,
   would not permit it, but did reserve them for a greater and sadder
   destruction. And afterward, when Vespasian renewed the war against
   them, Josephus tells us, that he used all kind of earnest persuasion
   with his countrymen to prevent their ruin, by submitting to the Roman
   government; but they were obstinate, and would not hearken to any
   moderate counsels. And when the sedition of the zealots began in
   Jerusalem, Josephus takes notice, that all the wisest men among them,
   and those who were most likely, by their interest and moderation, to
   have saved the city, were first of all cut off by the zealots, so that
   there were none left to persuade the people to moderate things.

   They provoked the Romans against them all manner of ways; their
   seditions among themselves continued when the enemy was before their
   walls; and when in probability they might have held out so long as to
   have wearied the Romans, by their own seditions they burnt all their
   granaries, and provisions of corn, and magazines of arms, as if they
   had consulted the advantage of the Romans against themselves; and
   which, was very remarkable, Josephus tells us, that before the siege
   the fountain of Siloam was almost dried up, and all the springs about
   Jerusalem, so that water bore a great price; but as soon as Titus came
   before Jerusalem, the springs broke out again, and there was never
   greater plenty; which if it had not happened, the Roman armies could
   very hardly have subsisted. And after the temple was destroyed, when
   Titus would have given John and Simon, and the rest of the zealots,
   their lives, they would not submit, but were all destroyed by their own
   obstinacy. At Massada, rather than yield to the Romans, nine hundred
   men, women, and children, killed one another; so that when the Romans
   entered the castle, they found them all dead, except one woman and a
   child that had hidden themselves.

   Philostratus tells us, that when some of the nearer nations would have
   crowned Titus for his victories over the Jews, he refused it, saying,
   That he deserved nothing upon that account, for it was not his work,
   but God had made him the instrument of his wrath against that people.
   So that there were never greater acknowledgments of a Divine hand
   against any people, than at this time against the Jews. Never was there
   greater courage and contempt of death in any people, and yet they were
   conquered by numbers much inferior to them. Never was any soldier so
   merciful as Titus was, and so solicitous to have spared the effusion of
   blood; and yet he was necessitated, against his nature, to exercise
   great cruelties towards them. Many times he endeavoured, by the most
   severe inhibitions, to restrain the cruelties of the soldiers towards
   them; and when he found that they ripped open the bowels of the Jews
   who fled out of Jerusalem, in. hopes to find gold which they had
   swallowed, he was much enraged against the soldiers, and would have put
   all to death that were engaged in that cruelty, but that he found them
   so many; and not withstanding this, when he forbade the like cruelty to
   be exercised for the future, under the most severe penalties, yet
   Josephus says that the soldiers did not forbear privately to do it; and
   though, in other cases, such a severe prohibition would have taken
   place; yet, says he, because God had devoted that people to ruin, all
   the ways which Titus used for the saving of them, turned to their
   destruction, (lib. vi. cap. 15.) Nay, there was as much blood shed by
   the dissensions among themselves, between those who desired peace with
   the Romans, and those that would not hearken to it, as by the Romans.
   So much reason was there for that passionate wish of our Saviour's
   concerning Jerusalem, "Oh! that thou hadst known, in this thy day, the
   things which belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thine
   eyes." Never was any nation so infatuated; never were the things that
   tended to peace so strangely hidden from any people as from the Jews.

   IV. It must needs be, that it was for some very great sin that God sent
   those dreadful calamities upon that nation. Josephus says, that it was
   sure for some greater impiety than that nation were guilty of, when
   they were carried away captive to Babylon. Nay, he says that the sins
   of Sodom and Gomorrah were but small in comparison of those the Jews
   were guilty of; so that he says, that they were so ripe for
   destruction, that if the Roman army had not come when it did, he did
   verily believe that either an earthquake would have swallowed up the
   city, or a deluge overflown them, or fire from heaven have consumed
   them; which is very much the same with that the apostle says of them,
   (1 Thess. ii. 16.) that they were "filling up the measure of their
   sins, that wrath might come upon them to the uttermost."

   Now what can we imagine their great sin should be at that time? All
   along the history of the Old Testament, usually, the great sin whereby
   they provoked God was their idolatry, for which God sent many judgments
   upon them, and at last sold them into captivity. But when this
   desolation came upon them, and for a long time before, even ever after
   the captivity, they had been free from that great transgression, and
   were mightily bent against idolatry, so that they would rather die than
   commit that sin.

   The account which Josephus gives of their sin, was their intestine
   seditions, and the cruelties and profanations of the temple that were
   consequent upon them. But that this could not be the original
   provocation, is plain, because, by the acknowledgment of Josephus and
   the Jews themselves, this was the greatest judgment and calamity that
   came upon them; yea, much greater than any thing which they suffered by
   the Romans; yea, so great, that it rendered them the pity of their very
   enemies; and when the Romans would have granted peace to them, and
   gladly have put an end to those miseries they saw them involved in, yet
   they continued their intestine seditions, and would not betaken off
   from destroying one another.

   Let them then give us any probable account, for what great sin it was,
   that God first gave them up to this great judgment of an industrious
   endeavour to destroy one another; or if they cannot, let them believe
   the account which the history of the New Testament gives of it, and the
   truth whereof was so remarkably confirmed by the fulfilling of our
   Saviour's predictions against them. The apostle gives a clear account
   of their sin in the forementioned place, (1 Thess. ii. 15, 16.) that it
   was because "they had killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets,
   and persecuted the apostles:" by these steps they "filled up their
   sins, and wrath came upon them to the uttermost."

   V. The punishment that was inflicted upon them hath very shrewd marks
   and signatures upon it, from which it is easy to conjecture, for what
   sin it was that they were thus punished. Titus laid his siege to
   Jerusalem at the very same time and season that the Jews crucified
   Christ, namely, at the time of the passover; and the very day that he
   began his siege, he crucified one before their walls, and afterward,
   almost the only cruelty that the Romans exercised towards them by the
   command and permission of Titus, was crucifixion; insomuch that
   sometimes five hundred were crucified in a day, till they wanted wood
   for crosses. So that they who earnestly cried out against our Saviour,
   "Crucify, crucify," had at last enough, God made them "eat the fruit of
   their own ways, and filled them with their own devices;" and they who
   had bought Christ for thirty pieces of silver, were afterwards
   themselves sold at a lower rate.

   VI. Their religion was remarkably struck at, and affronted, as if God
   intended to put an end to that dispensation, and to abrogate their law.
   Most of their great calamities happened to them upon the sabbath-day,
   and upon their great festivals. Cestius Gallus sat down with his army
   before Jerusalem on the sabbath. Titus besieged them at the time of the
   passover. And Jerusalem was taken (as Dio, in his Roman history,
   observes) on the sabbath-day, that day for which the Jews have so great
   a veneration. The zealots profaned the temple by making it a garrison,
   and by the rapine and bloodshed committed in it; they brought the
   priesthood into contempt, by choosing the meanest of the people into
   the highest offices; they turned the materials of the temple into
   instruments of war. The Romans themselves were as much grieved to see
   how the Jews profaned the temple, as the Jews themselves ought to have
   been if it had been so profaned by the Romans; they are the very words
   of Josephus. And though Titus gave express orders, and used great
   endeavours to have saved the temple, and hazarded himself to have
   quenched it when it was on fire; yet he could not do it, but it was
   burnt to the ground: and afterward, when the priests came to him, and
   supplicated to him for their lives, contrary to his usual clemency, he
   commanded them to be slain, saying they came too late; that it was fit
   they should perish with the temple, and now that was destroyed, for the
   sake of which they should have been saved, he saw no reason to spare
   them. Afterward the Roman ensigns were set up upon the ruins of the
   temple, and the soldiers sacrificed to them; and their law was carried
   in triumph at Rome before Vespasian and Titus.

   These were as great signs as could be, that God had a design to
   abrogate and put a period to that administration; especially if we take
   in this, which Ammianus Marcellinus, a heathen historian, tells us,
   that this temple could never be rebuilt, though it was attempted by the
   Jews several times, and that whenever they went about to lay the
   foundation, fire broke out of the foundation, and consumed the workmen.

   I will add but one circumstance more, to shew that that dispensation
   was at an end. God seemed to have wholly given over his particular care
   of that people, and to have no longer regard to the covenant made with
   them, in which he had promised, that when they came up three times a
   year, from all parts of the land, to serve the Lord, he would so order
   things by his providence, that the enemy should make no advantage of
   their absence from their borders; nay, the enemy should not then desire
   their land; and yet, notwithstanding this, at the time of the passover,
   when the whole nation were met at Jerusalem, Titus came upon them, and
   enclosed them all in the city.

   VII. And lastly, Consider how God hath pursued the Jews with great
   severity ever since, making them to be stigmatized and hated in all
   nations; great cruelties and oppressions have frequently been exercised
   towards them; and, by a strange providence, God hath kept them distinct
   from other people, that they might remain as a monument of his
   displeasure; and considering how other colonies of people have fallen
   in, and been mixed with the inhabitants in an age or two, so as they
   never could be kept distinct for any long time; that the Jews for
   sixteen hundred years should still remain so, as it is an argument of
   the special providence of God, so it is one of the most material and
   standing evidences of the truth of our religion, that they should
   remain still as witnesses of the Old Testament; and as monuments of the
   destruction of Jerusalem, and the fierce wrath which God executed upon
   them for the crucifying of Christ.

   Upon the whole matter, if so particular a prediction as this of our
   Saviour's concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, so punctually
   answered by the event, be not an argument of Divine inspiration, then
   there can be no evidence of any such thing as a spirit of prophecy. For
   what greater evidence of a true prophet, than to foretell so many
   things, so contingent and improbable; all which have accordingly
   afterward fallen out, just as they were foretold?

   Suppose the Jews say true, that Jesus Christ was an impostor, and
   consequently justly put to death by them; what greater reflection upon
   the providence of God can be imagined, than that this person should be
   permitted to foretell, that such and such calamities should befal those
   that had put him to death, as a punishment upon them for that sin; and
   afterward all this should happen in so remarkable a manner, as the
   world cannot give the like instance? Is it in the least credible, that
   the Divine Providence should permit such things, as of necessity will
   give credit to an impostor, and would be good evidence, to a prudent
   and considerate man, that he was divinely inspired?

   I have now done with the fourth head of our Saviour's predictions,
   namely, his prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem; which I have been
   the longer upon, because it is so considerable an evidence of the truth
   of our religion, and so strong an argument against the Jews, that, if
   they are not wrought upon by the consideration of the accomplishment of
   this prediction of our Saviour's, and the great severity of God still
   continued towards that nation, it can be ascribed to nothing but the
   just judgment of God, still hiding the things of their peace from their
   eyes, and giving them up to the same kind of fatal hardness and
   blindness, which sixteen hundred years ago was the cause of their
   destruction.

   There remains yet one instance more of our Saviour's prophetic spirit,
   which I must reserve for another discourse.

SERMON CCXL.

  THE EVIDENCES OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them.--2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   I AM still upon the fourth evidence, which those who lived in our
   Saviour's time had of his Divine authority, viz. the spirit of
   prophecy, proved to be in him, and made good by the accomplishment of
   his predictions. Four instances I have already given, and now proceed
   to the

   Fifth and last instance I shall give of our Saviour's prophetic spirit,
   viz. in those predictions which foretell the fate of the gospel in the
   world; what discouragements and difficulties the first publishers of
   the gospel should meet with from the persecutions which the powers of
   the world should stir up against them, and from the rising of false
   Christs and false prophets; what assistance they should find in the
   carrying on the work; and what success the gospel should have,
   notwithstanding the opposition that should be made against it. I shall
   speak briefly to these.

   I. What discouragements and difficulties the first publishers of the
   gospel should meet with. Our Saviour foretells two great
   discouragements.

   1. From the persecutions which the powers of the world should stir up
   against them. This our Saviour gave his disciples early notice of, when
   he first called them together, and sent them forth, (Matt. x. 16-18.)
   "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be ye
   therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. But beware of men;
   for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you
   in their synagogues. And ye shall be brought before governors and kings
   for my sake." And, (ver. 21, 22.) "And the brother shall deliver up the
   brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise
   up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. And ye
   shall be hated of all men for my name's sake." And that the disciples
   might not be surprised with this, when it should happen, as an
   unexpected thing, a little before his death, when he foretold the
   destruction of Jerusalem, he repeats this prediction to them again, as
   you may see, Matt. xxiv. 9. "Then they shall deliver you up to be
   afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for
   my name's sake." And (Luke xxi. 12.) "But before all these, they shall
   lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the
   synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for
   my name's sake."

   And all this we find punctually fulfilled in those persecutions that
   they met with at Jerusalem, and in other places wherever they went to
   preach the gospel, as you may read at large in the history of the Acts
   of the Apostles. And afterward in the persecutions raised against the
   Christians by the Roman emperors, where all kinds of cruelties and
   tortures were exercised upon them, and the Christians killed by
   thousands in a day, as if they would have destroyed the very name of
   Christ out of the world, as every one knows that is acquainted with
   ecclesiastical history.

   Particularly he foretold the two sons of Zebedee, James and John, that
   they should be put to death. Matt. xx. 23. saith he unto them, "Ye
   shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I
   am baptized with." And this accordingly happened to them; for we find
   (Acts xii. 2.) that James was slain by Herod. Indeed St. John lived a
   great while after, as our Saviour foretold, (John xxi. 22.) that John
   should tarry till he came; that is, he should live till the destruction
   of Jerusalem, which is very frequently in the evangelists called
   "Christ's coming;" and so he did, and at last was put to death by the
   sword, as St. Chrysostom saith; though Justin, Irenæus, Clemens
   Alexandrinus, say nothing of it; and Origen and Tertullian say he died
   another death.

   He likewise foretold Peter what kind of death he should die; namely,
   that when he was old, he should be crucified: (John xxi. 18, 19.)
   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst
   thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be
   old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee,
   and carry thee whither thou wouldest not." And the evangelist adds,
   "This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God." And
   accordingly, he was crucified about forty years after, as Eusebius
   tells us, and several of the fathers.

   2. Another great discouragement which our Saviour foretold they should
   meet with in the publishing of the gospel, was, from the rising of
   false Christs and false prophets. This our Saviour foretells, in the
   24th of St. Matthew, verse 5-24, That many should come in his name, and
   should deceive many; that there should "arise false Christs and false
   prophets, and shew great signs and wonders; insomuch, that, if it were
   possible, they should deceive the very elect." And this I have already
   shewn was fulfilled in those many impostors that rose up among the
   Jews, pretending themselves to be Messiases, and drawing many people
   after them, both before and after the destruction of Jerusalem; and in
   Simon, and the other heads of the gnostic sect, who did great prejudice
   to Christianity, by "turning the grace of God into wantonness," and
   abusing the holy doctrine of our Saviour to all manner of
   licentiousness, and drawing of Christians, not only to loose and filthy
   practices, but to a denial of the gospel for fear of persecution, and
   at last to join with the heathens in the persecuting of the Christians.

   II. Our Saviour likewise foretold what assistance the apostles should
   find in the carrying on their work. He promised that he would be with
   them in the preaching of the gospel, (Matt. xxviii. 20.) More
   particularly before his ascension, he told them that they should
   receive power by the coming of the Holy Ghost upon them, whereby they
   should be qualified to be witnesses unto him, in Judea, and Jerusalem,
   and Samaria, and to the utmost parts of the earth, (Acts i. 8.) And
   (Matt. x. 19, 20.) our Saviour promiseth that his Spirit should direct
   them what to say, when they should be accused before kings and
   governors: "When they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
   shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall
   speak: for it is not you that speak; but the Spirit of your Father
   which speaketh in you." And again to the same purpose, he encourageth
   them a little before his death: (Luke xxi. 14, 15.) "Settle it
   therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer:
   for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries
   shall not be able to gainsay nor resist."

   And all this we find was made good to them after our Saviour's
   ascension. They were wonderfully assisted, and carried on above
   themselves in the preaching of the gospel. So the evangelist St. Mark
   tells us, (Mark xvi. 20.) that the apostles "went forth and preached
   every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with
   signs following." And all along in the history of the Acts, we find,
   that they were extraordinarily strengthened and assisted in the
   publishing of the gospel. And particularly our Saviour's prediction and
   promise were made good to St. Stephen, of whom it is said, (Acts vi.
   10.) that when he was disputing with the Jews, "they were not able to
   resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake."

   III. Our Saviour foretold also what success the gospel should have,
   notwithstanding all the opposition that should be made against it; that
   it should be "published in all nations;" (Matt. xxiv. 14.) and in
   despite of all the malice of the Jews, and the potent opposition that
   the gentiles should make against the publishers of the gospel, they
   should "make disciples in every nation, and bear witness unto Christ to
   the uttermost parts of the earth:" (Matt. xxviii. 19. and Acts i. 8.)
   that he would "build his church upon a rock, and the gates of hell
   should not prevail against it:" (Matt. xvi. 18.) and this we find was
   done with great success, both among the Jews and gentiles, as appears
   out of the history of the Acts of the Apostles, and other histories of
   the first ages of the church.

   Particularly our Saviour foretold, that that act of kindness which Mary
   shewed to him, in anointing his head with precious ointment, should be
   remembered wherever the gospel was preached: (Matt. xxvi. 13.) "Verily,
   I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole
   world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a
   memorial of her." And accordingly this little particular history hath
   every where been propagated with the gospel, and the fame of it hath
   spread as far as the notice of Christianity.

   And thus I have done with the fourth and last evidence of our Saviour's
   Divine authority, namely, the prophetic spirit, which was proved to be
   in him, and made good by the punctual accomplishment of his
   predictions. I shall only shew that these in stances which I have
   given, are clear arguments of a prophetic spirit in our Saviour. And
   this will appear, if we consider these two things:

   First, That all these things which our Saviour foretold, were purely
   contingent in respect of us, that is, there was no necessity that they
   should come to pass; and consequently nothing but infinite knowledge
   could certainly foresee that they would.

   Secondly, All or most of them were not only contingent, but exceedingly
   unlikely; there was no probability that they should happen; and,
   consequently, no one could reasonably and prudently have foreseen that
   they would. And these two things being made out, will abundantly
   evidence, that the foretelling of these things doth argue a prophetic
   spirit in our Saviour; and consequently his Divine authority. Things
   that have necessary causes, if those causes be evident, any one may
   foretell that they will be; things that are probable, and likely to
   happen, every prudent man may reasonably conjecture that they will be,
   and consequently may in many cases successfully foretell them without a
   spirit of prophecy: but such things as in respect of us are purely
   contingent, and depend upon no necessary causes we know of, especially
   if they be withal unlikely to come to pass, no man can foretell but by
   the inspiration of that Spirit, whose infinite wisdom knows all things;
   and this is the true reason why the foretelling of future contingents
   hath always been looked upon as an argument of inspiration.

   First, These things which our Saviour foretold were purely contingent;
   that is, there was no necessity in human reason that they should come
   to pass: and consequently no man without inspiration could certainly
   foretell them. Those things are said to be contingent in respect of us,
   which have no necessary cause that we know of; particularly those
   things which depend upon the will of free agents, either the will of
   men, or of God. And such were those things which our Saviour foretold;
   many of them depended upon the will of men, whether they should happen
   or not, supposing the permissive will of God, that is, that God had
   determined not to interpose and hinder them.

   The death of Christ, with all the wicked and opprobrious circumstances
   of it, depended upon the will of men; and therefore it was a thing that
   no man could foresee whether it would be or not. So likewise the
   resistance and opposition that were made to the gospel by the
   persecutions of men, and the malice of false prophets, did depend upon
   the wills of men.

   But many of these events depended purely upon the will of God, which no
   man could foreknow, unless he did reveal it to him; and if he did, this
   was an argument of inspiration, which is the thing we are contending
   for. Of this kind were the resurrection of our Saviour from the dead;
   his being taken up into heaven; the miraculous powers and gifts
   wherewith the apostles and primitive Christians were endowed; the fatal
   destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish nation, contrary to the design
   of those who brought it to pass; the prevalency of the gospel in the
   world, in despite of all opposition made against it. All these were
   brought to pass in a more immediate manner by the power of God, and
   therefore depended purely upon his will.

   Secondly, Most of the things which our Saviour foretold, were not only
   purely contingent in respect of us, and therefore could not without
   inspiration be certainly foreseen; but were also exceedingly unlikely
   and improbable in themselves, and therefore could not so much as
   prudently have been conjectured. And to make this out more fully, I
   shall run over the several instances of our Saviour's predictions, and
   shew how unlikely the things which he foretold were to have come to
   pass: and if this appear, it must be granted that our Saviour was a
   prophet.

   1. Our Saviour's prediction concerning his own death and sufferings was
   a thing very unlikely to have come to pass. It was very likely that the
   pharisees and chief priests, whose interest was so much struck at,
   should have malice enough against him to design his ruin; but that ever
   they should have accomplished it without a popular tumult and sedition,
   was very unlikely, considering the esteem and favour he had among the
   people. Who could have believed that the Jews, who had seen so many
   miracles, and received so great benefits by them, who were such
   admirers of his doctrine, and so astonished at it, who would have made
   him king, should ever have consented to have put him to death? Who
   could have thought that so soon after they had so unanimously brought
   him to Jerusalem in triumph with such hosannahs and acclamations, the
   same people should have been so eager to have him crucified? I know
   there is nothing more inconstant than the giddy and fickle multitude;
   nothing less to be relied upon than the opinion and applause of the
   people: but because the humour of the people is so uncertain,
   therefore, for this reason, it was hard to prophesy what they would do.
   And nothing was more improbable than that any should certainly fore
   tell where this humour would at last fix and settle. Nay, it was very
   unlikely that they, who had been raised to so great and just an esteem
   of him, from a clear conviction of his innocence and holiness, and of
   the Divine power which attended him, should have had either the
   wickedness or the confidence to have gone about to compass the death of
   so innocent and Divine a person.

   And it is very remarkable, that this was a thing so incredible to the
   disciples, that though our Saviour did several times, in the plainest
   words that could be, tell them of his death and sufferings, yet they
   could not understand it; that is, it could by no means sink into them,
   they could not apprehend that ever any such thing should come to pass;
   (Mark ix. 31, 32.) "For he taught his disciples, and said unto them,
   The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill
   him, and after that he is killed he shall rise the third day. But they
   understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him." And (Luke ix.
   43-45.) after our Saviour had done a great miracle, it is said, "they
   were all amazed at the mighty power of God: but while they wondered
   every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
   Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be
   delivered into the hands of men. But they under stood not this saying,
   and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not; and they feared
   to ask him of that saying." They looked upon it as a thing incredible,
   that he, who did such works, and was at tended with such Divine power,
   should ever be "delivered into the hands of men:" if men should be so
   malicious as to design his death, yet it was not credible that God
   should give up such a person into their hands. And again, a little
   before his sufferings, he inculcates this more particularly upon them,
   (Luke xviii. 31-34.) "Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto
   them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by
   the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. For he
   shall be delivered unto the gentiles, and shall be mocked, and
   spitefully en treated, and spit upon; and they shall scourge him, and
   put him to death." And then it is said of the disciples, that "they
   understood none of these things, and this saving was hid from them,
   neither knew they the things which were spoken." What was the matter?
   Could any thing have been said in plainer words, than our Saviour's
   declaring this to them? No, certainly, they understood very well the
   meaning of those words; for it is said, (Matt. xvii. 23.) that "when he
   said this to them, they were exceeding sorry," they were very much
   troubled to hear him say this; they understood very well what the words
   signified, and they were troubled at the first appearance and literal
   sense of them; but it seems they took them to be a parable, and to have
   some allegorical meaning hidden under them; for they could not imagine,
   that ever they should be literally true. And, that this was their
   apprehension, seems to be sufficiently intimated by both the
   evangelists, St. Mark and St. Luke, who, after they had told us that
   "the disciples understood not this saying," they immediately add, that
   "they feared to ask Christ of this saying;" that is, they did not
   understand whether they were to take this saying in the obvious and
   literal sense of it; or to look upon it as an allegory, or a parable
   that had some hidden sense; but being troubled at the saying, because
   the literal and obvious sense had a great deal of horror, they were
   afraid to ask our Saviour the meaning of it, (as they used always to
   ask him the meaning of his parables) for fear he should tell them that
   he intended it literally. Now from this it appears, how unlikely it
   seemed to the disciples, that our Saviour should suffer such things as
   he foretold of himself.

   2. Our Saviour's predictions concerning his rising again out of the
   grave the third day; concerning his being taken up into heaven;
   concerning the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles, in such
   miraculous powers and gifts after his ascension, were all things very
   unlikely and incredible, because so exceeding strange, and above the
   common course of nature. We look upon it as a wonderful thing for a man
   certainly to foretell an ordinary thing: but if any man should tell us,
   that, after he was dead, and had Iain three days in the grave, he
   should rise again, and be visibly taken up into heaven, and from thence
   bestow miraculous gifts upon men, and this should accordingly come to
   pass; it were impossible not to think this man a prophet.

   3. Our Saviour's prediction concerning the fatal destruction of
   Jerusalem and the Jewish nation, was very unlikely. But this I spake to
   at large, when I explained the prophecy.

   4. The fate which our Saviour foretold the gospel should have in the
   world, was a thing very improbable. That it should meet with great
   opposition and persecution was not strange; nothing being more likely
   than that a religion which was new to the world, so contrary to the
   principles of those who had been educated in another religion, and so
   opposite to the interests of men, should be opposed and resisted to the
   utmost: but then there are these three things very strange, which our
   Saviour foretold should attend the publication of the gospel.

   (1.) That an action of no greater consideration than that was of Mary's
   anointing our Lord's head, and done privately, should be celebrated
   through the world in all ages; and the memory of it should be as far,
   and as long propagated, as the most famous actions of the greatest
   prince that ever was in the world.

   (2.) This was strange and unlikely, which our Saviour likewise
   foretold, that false Christs, and false prophets and teachers, should
   arise after his death; that, after the Jews had been so severe to our
   Saviour, for giving out himself to be the Messias, though he gave such
   convincing evidence of it, this should not deter counterfeits from
   assuming so dangerous a person; and that when Christianity was
   persecuted, there should arise false apostles, and false teachers, that
   should pretend to Christianity, when it was so odious a profession,
   that any should be found that should dissemble in a matter so full of
   hazard and danger; this was very strange and unlikely.

   But, because this prediction of our Saviour's concerning false Christs
   and false prophets is aspersed by the atheists, and particularly by
   Vaninus, as one of the most cunning and crafty actions that our Saviour
   did; as if, after he had let himself into a reputation and esteem in
   the world, he had designed by this prediction to bolt the door against
   all others; therefore it will be requisite that I speak a little more
   particularly to this.

   1. It is acknowledged by the atheists themselves, particularly by
   Vaninus, that it does not appear that our Saviour carried on any
   worldly design. Why then should he be suspected of it in this matter,
   which is capable of a good interpretation, when his whole life, and all
   the actions of it, do clear him of any such suspicion? But because it
   is said, that though he carried on no design for riches and power, yet
   he had a deep design to gain reputation and fame to himself in
   after-ages; therefore I shall add one or two considerations more, to
   shew how unreasonable, and how perfectly malicious, this jealousy is.

   2. Let us consider, then, that this prediction of his would either be
   accomplished or not; but whether it was, or was not, it can be no
   argument of any design of vain-glory. If it had not come to pass (as I
   have shewn it was very unlikely it should, especially within the
   compass of the time which he had prefixed for it) then he had been a
   false prophet, and so he had lost his reputation, by the very means
   whereby he intended to have established it, which I do not understand
   the craft and cunning of: for either he knew certainly that it would
   come to pass, or not; if he did, he was a true prophet; if he did not,
   he did not do politicly, in putting his reputation upon such a hazard.

   3. If we suppose him, as this objection does, to have been an impostor,
   and consequently not to have believed his own doctrine of the
   immortality of the soul, and another life after this; what an apparent
   madness had it been to neglect the present advantages of this world,
   which he was capable of enjoying; and to lay out for a fame and
   reputation, after he was dead and extinguished, and consequently when
   he should not be capable of having any sense and enjoyment of it!

   And the instance of the Romans, who ventured their lives out of
   vain-glory, to get a name after they were dead, will avail nothing in
   this case: because it plainly appears from all the heathen writers,
   that they did this upon a presumption of their immortality, and a
   persuasion that they should live in another world, and enjoy the
   pleasure of the fame by which their names should be celebrated in this
   world: but had they not been persuaded of this, it would have been the
   greatest folly in the world, to have ventured their lives to gain a
   fame after death, and to be spoken of with honour when they were not,
   and consequently could take no pleasure in it. This may suffice to be
   said in short, to this malicious and absurd objection. But,

   (3.) This was strange and unlikely, that the gospel should have such
   success in the world. And the more likely it was that it should meet
   with so much opposition and resistance, the more unlikely was it that
   it should prevail, especially by such means and in such manner as it
   did; that a few unlearned men, destitute of secular arts and learning,
   opposed by all the wit and power that the world could exert, should be
   able in the space of a few years to propagate and plant all over the
   known world a doctrine so despised and persecuted, so contrary to the
   almost invincible prejudice of education in another religion, so
   opposite to those two great governors of the world, the lusts and the
   interests of men; nothing could have been foretold so unlikely and
   improbable as this is; especially if we take in this, that the chief
   instrument of spreading this doctrine in the world was the fiercest
   opposer and persecutor of it, I mean St. Paul, who, by a light and
   voice from heaven, was taken off from persecuting Christianity, and
   became the most active and zealous instrument of its propagation. The
   wonderful success and prevalency of the gospel by such means, and in
   such circumstances of difficulty, and potent opposition made against
   it, are a plain indication, that this doctrine was assisted and
   countenanced from Heaven; that "it was of God, and therefore could not
   be overthrown." Nothing but the mighty force of truth could, naked and
   unarmed, have done such wonders in the world.

   And thus I have, I hope, fully shewn that those who lived in the age of
   our Saviour, were capable of having sufficient assurance, that Jesus
   Christ, who declared the Christian religion to the world, was sent of
   God: from the prophecies concerning him; the testimonies that were
   given him by an immediate voice from heaven; the miracles that were
   wrought by him, and on his behalf; and by the prophetic spirit, that
   gave evidence of his inspiration. And if any one doubt whether he gave
   these testimonies of his Divine authority to the world, let him
   consider that it is almost as great a miracle as any of those, that a
   doctrine preached by one that gave no testimony of his Divine authority
   to the world, should be so strangely propagated, and maintain its
   possession so long in the world; I say, let him consider this, and
   methinks this should convince him of the truth of Christianity.

SERMON CCXLI.

  THE EVIDENCE OF THE TRUTH OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

   But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them. 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4.

   IN discoursing of the evidence of our Saviour's Divine authority, I
   proposed the considering three things.

   First, What evidence they had who heard the doctrine of the gospel
   immediately from our Saviour.

   Secondly, What evidence they had who received this doctrine by the
   preaching of the apostles.

   Thirdly, What evidence after-ages have until the present time.

   The first of these I have handled at large; and now proceed to the

   Second, viz. To consider what assurance those who heard the doctrine of
   Christ from the apostles were capable of having concerning his Divine
   authority: and of this I shall give you an account in these three
   particulars:

   First, They had all the assurance concerning this matter which men can
   have of any thing from the testimony of credible eye and ear-witnesses.

   Secondly, They had this testimony confirmed by miracles.

   Thirdly, They had yet a farther evidence of the divinity of this
   doctrine, from the wonderful prevalency and success of it, by such
   improbable and unlikely means.

   First, Those who received the doctrine of Christ from the apostles, had
   all the assurance of Christ's Divine authority that men can have of any
   thing from the testimony of credible eye and ear-witnesses. The
   apostles who immediately conversed with our Saviour, and heard his
   doctrine, and saw his miracles, they had the testimony of their own
   senses for his Divine authority; they heard and saw the attestations
   which God gave to him; and those to whom the apostles preached,
   received all this from them, as from eye and ear-witnesses. So that
   those who received the doctrine of Christ from the apostles, had all
   the arguments which the apostles had, to satisfy them concerning
   Christ's Divine authority, only they were not conveyed to them in so
   immediate a manner. The apostles saw and heard those things themselves,
   which gave them satisfaction that Jesus Christ came from God: those to
   whom the apostles preached, received these things from their testimony.

   And this also was a sufficient ground of assurance, as will clearly
   appear, if we can make out these two things.

   I. That the apostles were credible witnesses. And,

   II. That if they were so, then their testimony was sufficient to
   persuade belief.

   I. That the apostles were credible witnesses. Of their knowledge there
   can be no question, because they gave testimony only of what themselves
   had seen and heard: so that if they falsified in any thing, it could
   not be for want of sufficient knowledge, but for want of fidelity. Now
   those who heard them, had all the arguments that could be to satisfy
   them of their fidelity. They delivered things plainly, and without
   artificial insinuations; they all agreed in their testimony, and were
   always constant to themselves in the same relation; there was no
   visible interest to sway them in the least to falsify against their
   knowledge; they gained nothing by it; nay, so far were they from that,
   that they run themselves hereby upon the greatest hazards and
   disadvantages; and, which is the high est evidence that this world can
   give of any man's sincerity, they ventured their lives for this
   testimony, and sealed it with their blood. For though martyrdom be no
   sufficient argument of the truth of that for which a man lays down his
   life, yet it is a very good argument of a man's sincerity; it signifies
   that a man is in earnest, and believes him self; and if the thing be
   not true, yet that he thinks it to be so, otherwise he would not have
   died for it: so that if we have no reason to doubt of the knowledge of
   those witnesses, (as certainly we have no reason, the things which they
   testified being plain matters, what they saw and heard, in which every
   man knows whether he speaks truth or not; I say, if we have no reason
   to doubt of their knowledge) we cannot question their integrity and
   sincerity, having the highest evidence of that which this world can
   afford; for there cannot be a better argument of the integrity of
   witnesses, than to lay down their lives for their testimony.

   II. If the apostles were credible witnesses, then was their testimony
   sufficient to persuade belief. For what greater evidence can any man
   have of any thing which himself has not seen, than to receive it from
   credible eye-witnesses; that is, from such persons as we have all the
   reason in the world to judge worthy of credit? This evidence men are
   contented to accept in other cases, as sufficient to induce belief; and
   if we will not accept it in matters of religion, we are very partial
   and unjust. We find that upon the evidence of credible witnesses men
   generally proceed with good assurance in human affairs: the chief
   temporal interests of men, of their estates and reputation, and lives,
   are determined upon no better evidence than this. Now if in matters of
   religion we will reject the evidence which shall be sufficient to sway
   our assent in other things, it is a plain sign that we have less mind
   to religion than to other things; that we have some interest or pique
   against it; otherwise we would not refuse to yield an equal assent,
   where the evidence is equal.

   This reason tells us; and our Saviour in effect says the same thing,
   when he chargeth those who rejected this evidence of credible witnesses
   with the sin of unbelief: (Mark xvi. 14.) "Afterward he appeared unto
   the eleven, as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief
   and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen
   him after he was risen." But now if the testimony of credible witnesses
   be not sufficient ground of faith, it could have been no sin in the
   disciples, not to believe those who had seen Christ risen from the
   dead.

   Secondly, Those who received the doctrine of Christ from the apostles,
   had not only the testimony of credible witnesses, but they had this
   testimony confirmed by miracles. Because the apostles were to go abroad
   into the world, and to preach to many who never saw nor knew them
   before, and consequently had no reason at first to believe their
   testimony, till they were satisfied of the value of the witnesses; and
   this would require long time and frequent conversation, so that the
   gospel must have made but a very slow progress at this rate: and be
   cause they were like to meet with great opposition from the powers and
   wits of the world, from the prejudices of education, and from the lusts
   and interests of men; therefore, for the speedier and more effectual
   propagation of the gospel, God was pleased to confirm this testimony by
   miracles, to endue those who were to preach the gospel to the world,
   with miraculous powers and gifts, of speaking all languages, and
   healing diseases, and casting out devils; of foretelling things to
   come, and raising the dead; that, being accompanied with these visible
   and sensible signs of the Divine presence and power, their testimony
   might more easily be believed.

   And that this was the end of those miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost,
   the Scripture frequently tells us. Hence it is that our Saviour forbade
   them to preach the gospel abroad, till they were furnished with this
   power, (Luke xxiv. 49.) "But tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until
   ye be endued with power from on high." And (Acts i. 8 ) our Saviour
   tells the apostles before his ascension, "But ye shall receive power
   after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses
   unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the
   utmost parts of the earth." This was that which qualified them to be
   witnesses to Christ, and which gave confirmation to their testimony. So
   St. Mark tells us, (Mark xvi. 20.) "And they went forth and preached
   every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with
   signs following." To the same purpose the apostle to the Hebrews,
   (chap. ii. 3, 4.) speaking of the publishing of the gospel, "How shall
   we escape, (says he) if we neglect so great salvation, which at the
   first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them
   that heard him?" What was the confirmation that was given to it? It
   follows in the next words, "God also bearing them witness, both with
   signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy
   Ghost." The apostles bare witness of Christ, and God bare witness to
   them, by those miraculous powers and gifts, that their testimony was
   true.

   Thirdly, Those who received the doctrine of Christ from the apostles,
   had yet a farther evidence of the divinity of this doctrine, from the
   wonderful success and prevalency of it, by such improbable and unlikely
   means. Had the doctrine of Christ's religion been suited to the
   corruptions of men, and stolen insensibly into the world, and prevailed
   by degrees in the revolution of many ages, as the heathen superstition
   and idolatry did, which met with no opposition from the lusts and
   interests of men, it then had been no strange thing: or had it been
   planted by power and force of arms, as the religion of Mahomet was,
   then indeed the success of it had been no argument that it was from
   God. Had it been set off with all imaginable advantages of wit and
   eloquence, as the philosophy of the heathens was; and had it been
   entertained by a few more sublime spirits, and those who were more
   studious and contemplative, and whose understandings were elevated
   above the common pitch, this might have been looked upon but as human
   and ordinary, and according to the common and usual course of things.
   But that a doctrine which was so opposite to the lusts and inclinations
   of men, which was persecuted and opposed by all the powers of the
   world, and despised and condemned by the witty part of man kind; that a
   doctrine, the profession whereof did expose men to so many worldly
   inconveniences, to so many dangers and sufferings, to derision and to
   death, should be planted by a few mean and inconsiderable men,
   destitute of all secular power, and advantages of human learning and
   eloquence; and in so short a time be so vastly propagated, and so
   generally entertained by all sorts of men, rich and poor, philosophers
   and illiterate; this was extraordinary, and can be attributed to
   nothing else but a Divine power accompanying it, and bearing it up
   against the power and malice of men. That the doctrine of the gospel,
   delivered to the world by mean persons, with so much simplicity and
   plainness, should so strangely affect the hearts of men, and be of so
   admirable a force to stir up and inflame men to piety and virtue, seems
   to me a very plain argument of its divinity: for we do not find that
   any doctrine that was merely human, had ever any considerable power
   upon the minds of men, where it was not set off with the arts of speech
   and charms of eloquence; and then it only produceth some present
   motions and heats; but seldom hath any lasting and permanent effect,
   such as the Christian religion hath had in the world.

   Thus I have shewn what assurance those who received the doctrine of the
   gospel from the apostles were capable of having, concerning the
   divinity of this doctrine, and the Divine authority of the persons who
   declared it to the world.

   Thirdly, I am to consider, what assurance after-ages, down to this day,
   are capable of having concerning this matter: and this principally
   concerns us who live at the distance of so many ages from the first
   revelation of the gospel. Of this I shall give you an account in these
   two particulars:

   First, We have an authentic and credible account of this doctrine, and
   of the confirmation which was in the first ages given to it,
   transmitted down to us.

   Secondly, The effects of this doctrine still remain in the world.

   First, We have a credible and authentic account of this doctrine, and
   of the confirmation which in the first ages was given to it,
   transmitted down to us. I told you at first, that there are but these
   three ways whereby we can be assured of matters of fact.

   1. By the immediate testimony of our own senses, if we ourselves be
   present when the thing is done or spoken, and see and hear it.

   2. By the testimony of credible eye or ear-witnesses of it. Or,

   3. By a credible account or i-elation of it transmitted to us. And all
   these ways, in (heir kind, are accounted sufficient to give men an
   undoubted assurance of matter of fact. No man doubts of what he himself
   sees or hears: men generally believe many things which they have not
   opportunity of seeing themselves, if they be attested to them by
   credible eye-witnesses: and for things that were done long ago, and
   which no man now alive was witness of, men are abundantly satisfied by
   a credible relation transmitted down to them. Upon this account men do
   firmly believe, that Alexander about two thousand years ago conquered a
   great part of the world; and that there was such a person as Julius
   Cæsar, who seventeen hundred years ago conquered England; and the like.
   Now if we have the doctrine and history of the gospel, and all the
   evidences of our Saviour's Divine authority, conveyed down to us, in as
   credible a manner as any of these ancient matters of fact are, which
   mankind do most firmly believe, then we have sufficient ground to be
   assured of it.

   Now there are but two ways imaginable whereby the doctrine of Christ's
   religion and the evidences of its divinity can be conveyed down to
   us--either by oral report and tradition, or by books and writing. The
   former of these the experience of the world hath shewn to be very
   uncertain, and in the succession of many ages liable to great changes
   and hazard. Hence it is that the prudence of mankind, and the necessity
   of human affairs, have introduced the latter way of conveying the
   memory of things to after-ages, namely, by writing and records: and the
   good God likewise in his wise providence hath taken care, that those
   who were eye and ear-witnesses of our Saviour's doctrine and life,
   should commit to writing the history and relation of those matters,
   that so the memory of them might be preserved to all generations; and
   these books, which we call the Holy Scriptures, are the authentic
   records of our religion, without which Christian religion in
   probability had long since either been strangely corrupted or wholly
   lost out of the world. For that oral report would not have preserved
   it, there is this evidence, sufficient to convince any man that is not
   obstinately resolved to the contrary that, of all the persons that
   formerly lived in the world, and the great actions that have been done,
   besides what are recorded in history, and of the innumerable miracles
   of our Saviour, which were not written in the books of the gospel: I
   say, of all these, oral tradition hath preserved nothing; so that, if
   the doctrine of the Christian religion, and the history of the life and
   actions of our Saviour and the apostles, had not been put into a surer
   way of conveyance than that of oral tradition, in all probability
   before this time there would have been left no certain monuments of
   them in the world.

   And, that we may understand how much these latter ages are indebted to
   the wisdom and goodness of God, that he hath furnished us with so fixed
   and certain a way of being acquainted with his will, with the doctrine
   and grounds of our religion, I might represent to you what advantages
   this standing revelation of the Scripture hath above that way of oral
   tradition; yea, though the revelation of the gospel had been renewed
   every two or three ages, But this has been done in some former
   discourses. [18] I therefore proceed to the other ground of assurance,
   which the ages after the apostles are capable of having; viz.

   Secondly, The effect of this doctrine still remains in the world.
   Christian religion is still professed in several nations, and is
   entertained by a considerable part of the world: and allowing for the
   difference between the extraordinary assistance which at first
   accompanied the gospel, and was necessary for the planting of it, and
   the more human and ordinaryways whereby it is now propagated, it hath
   considerable effects upon the hearts and lives of men.

   It might justly indeed be expected, considering the reasonableness of
   the Christian religion, and the great evidence we have of the truth and
   divinity of it, that it should have a greater force and power upon men,
   than it hath in most parts of Christendom; but we cannot reasonably
   expect in a prosperous state of Christianity, those extraordinary heats
   and fervours which the primitive Christians had whilst they were under
   continual persecution: we cannot reasonably expect that unity among
   Christians, and that they should be so generally and universally good,
   as they were under a state of persecution; for common sufferings have a
   strange force to unite men, and to endear them to one another: in times
   of persecution it might be expected that all or most of those who
   profess themselves Christians, should be really so: when a profession
   is dangerous to those that make it, and at tended with persecutions,
   then there will be but few pretenders to it; scarce any man will
   dissemble to the hazard of his life: but when any religion flourisheth,
   and is prosperous, when it is an odious thing, and against a man's
   interest, not to profess it, then it may justly be feared that there
   will be great numbers of hypocrites, of those who, in compliance with
   the fashion, and the prevailing interest, will take upon them the
   outward profession of it.

   But, however, we see the same effects of Christianity still remain in
   the world: Christ is still owned as the true Messias and the Son of
   God; his doctrine acknowledged to be true, and to have been from God;
   so that thus far his promise hath been made good of "building his
   church upon a rock," and that "the gates of hell should not prevail
   against it." That Christianity hath uninterruptedly continued for above
   sixteen hundred years, is an additional evidence of the divinity of
   this doctrine, which the first ages of the world could not have: only
   this is sadly to be bewailed, that this religion, which hath all
   imaginable confirmation given to the truth of it, should have no
   greater effect upon the lives of men; that when we have so much reason
   to assent to it, yet so few can be persuaded to practise it; that when
   we make so many solemn professions of our belief of the truth of it,
   yet, by the actions of our lives, we should so visibly contradict the
   articles of our belief.

   Thus I have gone through the first thing I proposed to be considered in
   my text, viz. the full and clear evidence which we have of the truth of
   the gospel, and particularly of the Divine authority of that person who
   declared the Christian religion to the world. There are two other
   general heads which the text would lead us to consider, which I shall
   but briefly treat of, and so conclude this subject.

   The second thing considerable in the words is, the cause of the
   infidelity of men, notwithstanding all the evidence which the gospel
   carries along with it; which the apostle expresseth in these words:
   "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the
   god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,
   lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of
   God, should shine unto them."

   In speaking to this, I shall do these four things:

   First, Shew why the infidelity of men is attributed to the devil, as
   the cause of it.

   Secondly, Shew more particularly what influence the devil hath upon the
   minds of men to keep them in unbelief.

   Thirdly, That this doth not excuse the infidelity of men.

   Fourthly, Shew the wickedness and unreasonableness of infidelity.

   First, Why the infidelity of men is attributed to the devil, as the
   cause of it. There are two principles that bear sway in the world, and
   have a more immediate influence upon the mind of man; the Holy Spirit
   of God, and the devil. The former of these is continually moving and
   inclining them to good: the latter swaying and tempting them to evil;
   and these two principles share mankind between them. Hence it is that
   in Scripture the Spirit of God is said to dwell in good men; and the
   wicked and vicious part of mankind (whom the Scripture frequently calls
   the world) are said to be in the possession of the devil, and to belong
   to his share and lot. Upon this account the devil is called in the text
   "the god of this world." Accordingly St. John frequently rangeth
   mankind under these two heads; those that belong to God, and those that
   belong to the devil, (1 John iii. 8.) "He that committeth sin is of the
   devil: but he that committeth not sin, is born of God." In the next
   verse he calleth them the children of God, and the children of the
   devil: "in this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
   the devil." So likewise chap. v. 19. "And we know that we are of God,
   and the whole world lieth in wickedness." Or, as the words may be
   rendered more suitably to the opposition which the apostle aims at,
   "the whole world is subject to the wicked one; we are of God, but the
   rest of the world is subject to the devil." Upon this account it is,
   that in the constant phrase of Scripture all good motions and
   inclinations, and all good graces and virtues, are ascribed to the
   Spirit of God, as the author and worker of them; and all wicked and
   vicious inclinations, all the sins and vices of men, are attributed to
   the devil, as in some sort the author and worker of them: and because
   faith is the root of all other graces and virtues, as infidelity is of
   sin and wickedness, therefore faith is in a peculiar manner said to be
   the work of the Holy Ghost; and infidelity the work of the devil. And
   as the Spirit of God is said "to enlighten the understandings" of men,
   and "to open their hearts that they may believe:" so the devil is said
   "to blind the minds of them that believe not." As the Spirit of God is
   said * to work in them that believe;" so the devil is said "to work in
   the children of unbelief." (Eph. ii. 2.) He is called "the spirit that
   worketh in the children of disobedience," apeithei'as, of unbelief.
   This is one of the principal designs which the devil hath always
   carried on in the world, to bring men to unbelief, and to keep them in
   it. As it is the great work of the Spirit of truth "to lead men into
   truth," and bring them to the belief of it: so the great business of
   the devil is to seduce men from the truth. Upon this account he is said
   (John viii. 44.) to be "a murderer from the beginning, because he abode
   not in the truth;" which refers to the first temptation, whereby he
   ruined and destroyed our first parents, by seducing them to unbelief;
   "Hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree in the garden?" And
   because he found this attempt so successful, he still pursues mankind
   with the same temptation of unbelief. This for the first; why
   infidelity is attributed to the devil, as the cause of it.

   I come, in the second place, to shew more particularly, what influence
   the devil hath upon the minds of men, to keep them in unbelief; how,
   and in what manner "he blinds the minds of them that believe not."
   These two ways chiefly; by false principles, and by vicious and corrupt
   habits.

   I. By false principles, which, when they have once got possession of
   the understanding, like so many enemies, they defend it, and hold out
   against the truth. By this means the devil kept a great part of the
   Jews and of the heathen world in unbelief; and their minds were so
   blinded by these false principles which they had entertained, that they
   could not see "the light of the glorious gospel of Christ." As for the
   Jews, he had, with a great deal of art, conveyed false principles into
   them, whereby they were extremely prejudiced against Christ and his
   doctrine, so that when he, who was "the Desire of all nations," and
   whom the Jews had looked for, with so longing an expectation, was come,
   they could "see no beauty in him, wherefore he should be desired." The
   devil, no doubt, understood very well by the prophecies of the Old
   Testament, that the Messias was to come, who would give a terrible blow
   to his kingdom: and therefore, to provide against this storm which he
   saw coming upon him, he possessed the Jews a great while before with
   false apprehensions of the Messias, that he was to be a great temporal
   prince, and to deliver Israel from all their enemies, and to subdue all
   nations to them; and he played his game so well, that the most learned
   among the Jews were generally possessed with this apprehension, under
   the notion of a Divine doctrine, which had been brought down to them by
   tradition from Moses and the prophets: so that when the Messias came,
   and they saw no thing of the outward glory and splendour which they
   expected, they would not know him, but despised and rejected him as a
   counterfeit and impostor.

   As for the idolatrous gentiles, he had, for many ages together, blinded
   them with false notions of God and his worship, and with principles of
   a false philosophy, by which, when they came to measure the doctrine of
   Christ, the plain truths of the Christian religion seemed foolish and
   ridiculous to them, and by these prejudices the devil kept many of
   them, especially of the philosophers, from believing the gospel.

   And proportionably in every age, suitably to the temper of it, he
   endeavours to possess men with false principles, either to keep them in
   unbelief, or to drive them to it.

   II. The second way whereby the devil "blinds the minds of them that
   believe not," is by vicious and corrupt habits; which, though they do
   not possess the understanding, yet they have a bad influence upon it;
   as fumes and vapours from the lower parts of the body affect the head.
   The vices and lusts of men darken the understanding, and fill the mind
   with gross and sensual apprehensions of things, and render men unfit to
   discern those truths that are of a spiritual nature and tendency, and
   indisposed to receive them. When men's "deeds are evil, they do not
   love the light," lest it should reprove their vices, "and make them
   manifest." Truth is offensive and grievous to a corrupt mind, as the
   light of the sun is to sore eyes. A vicious man is not free to
   entertain those truths which would check and cross him in his way; he
   looks upon them as enemies, and therefore thinks himself concerned to
   oppose them. Every lust makes a man partial in his judgment, and lays a
   false bias upon his under standing, which carries it off from truth,
   and makes it lean towards that side of the question which is most
   agreeable to the interest of his lusts.

   And by this means the devil kept many, both of the Jews and gentiles,
   in unbelief: he had tempted them to those sins which did indispose them
   for the receiving of that doctrine which enjoins "the denying of
   ungodliness and worldly lusts," and chargeth men so strictly with all
   manner of holiness and purity. The pharisees, under a mask of religion,
   were guilty of great wickedness and impiety; and the heathens were
   monstrously degenerated into all manner of vice. So that it was not
   only the false principles, but likewise the vicious lives of men, which
   were opposite to the doctrine of the gospel, "and blinded their minds,
   that the light of the glorious gospel of Christ did not shine unto
   them."

   And the devil still makes use of this means to bring men to infidelity,
   and keep them in it; as knowing that the shortest way to atheism and
   infidelity, is to debauch them in their lives. Therefore the apostle
   seems to give this as the reason of the infidelity of some in his time,
   (2 Thess. ii. 12.) "That they all may be damned who believed not the
   truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." When men once take
   pleasure in wickedness, then infidelity becomes their interest; for
   they cannot otherwise defend and excuse a wicked life, but in denying
   the truth which opposeth it. That man only stands fair for the
   entertaining of truth, who is under the power of no lust, because he
   hath nothing to seduce him, and draw him aside in his inquiry after
   truth; he hath no interest but to find truth; he hath the indifference
   of a traveller, who is not inclined to one way more than another, but
   is only concerned to know the right way. Such indifferency of mind
   every good man hath; he is ready to receive truth, when sufficient
   evidence is offered to him, because he is not concerned that the
   contrary proposition should be true; if a man be addicted to any lust,
   he is not likely to judge impartially of things: and therefore our
   Saviour doth with great reason require this disposition to qualify a
   man for the discerning of truth, (John vii. 17.) "If any man will do
   God's will, he shall know the doctrine, whether it be of God, or
   whether I speak of myself." He that is desirous to do the will of God,
   he is likely to judge indifferently concerning any doctrine that
   pretends to be from God: for if there be not good evidence for it, he
   hath no reason to deceive himself, by entertaining that as from God,
   which he hath no assurance that it is so: and if there be good evidence
   for it, he hath no interest to reject it: but if a man be enslaved to
   any vice or lust, he is not free to judge of those matters which touch
   upon his interest; but is under a great temptation to infidelity,
   because he must needs be unwilling to acknowledge the truth of that
   doctrine which lies so cross to his interest.

   Thirdly, This does not excuse the infidelity of men, that the devil is
   in some sort the cause of it; because he cannot blind our minds, unless
   we consent to it: he can only suggest false principles to us, but we
   may choose whether we will entertain them; he can only tempt us to be
   wicked, he can not force us to be so whether we will or not: as we may
   resist the dictates, and quench the blessed motions and suggestions of
   God's Spirit, and too often do; so may we "resist the devil," and repel
   or quench those fiery darts which he casts into our minds, though we do
   not do it so often as we should. We cannot resist the motions of God's
   Spirit with out injury to ourselves; but we may safely oppose the
   suggestions of the devil; and we may do it with success, if we
   sincerely endeavour it. So God hath promised, that if we resist the
   devil, he shall flee from us: but if we voluntarily consent to his
   temptations, and suffer ourselves to be blinded by him, the fault is
   our own, as well as his, and we are guilty of that infidelity which we
   suffer him to tempt us into. And this will appear, if we consider,

   Fourthly, The wickedness and unreasonableness of infidelity. The
   Scripture every where gives it a bad character, calling it, "an evil
   heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God." Not to believe those
   revelations of God, which are sufficiently propounded to us, is "an
   apostacy from the living God," a kind of atheism, and an argument of a
   very evil temper and disposition. And therefore St. John speaks of
   infidelity as the highest affront to God imaginable, and as it were a
   giving God the lie; (1 John v. 10.) "He that believeth not the record
   which God hath given of his Son," is said to make God a liar.

   The greatest and clearest testimonies that ever God gave to any person
   in the world were to Jesus Christ, and yet how full of infidelity were
   the Jews, to whom these testimonies were given! They are the great
   patterns of infidelity, who resisted such immediate evidence; and by
   the characters which the New Testament gives us of them, we may judge
   of the evil and unreasonableness of infidelity: and if we consult the
   history of the New Testament, we (shall find infidelity described by
   such character and properties, and accompanied with such qualities, as
   shew it to be a very evil and unreasonable spirit. The principal of
   them are these:

   1. Monstrous partiality in denying that which had greater evidence than
   other matters which they did believe.

   2. Unreasonable and groundless prejudice.

   3. A childish kind of perverseness.

   4. Obstinacy and pertinacious persisting in error.

   5. Want of patience to consider and examine what can be said for the
   truth.

   6. Rudeness, and boisterous falling into uncivil terms.

   7. Fury, and outrageous passion.

   8. Infidelity is usually attended with bloody and inhuman persecution.
   But the treating on these particulars I reserve for another subject.
   [19]

   The third and last thing contained in the text is, the dangerous state
   of those who, having the gospel propounded to them, yet do not
   entertain and believe it; the apostle tells us they are in a lost and
   perishing condition; "If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are
   lost."

   I say of those who have the gospel propounded to them. As for those to
   whom the gospel was never offered, they shall not be condemned for
   their unbelief of it: God will not punish them for not believing the
   revelation which was never propounded to them, but for sinning against
   "the law written in their hearts." So the apostle hath stated this
   matter; (Rom. ii. 12, 14, 15.) they that have a law revealed to them by
   God, shall "be judged by that law;" but they that are without such a
   law, shall be l judged without the law, by the law which is written in
   their hearts." Those persons and nations in the world, to whom the
   gospel was not revealed, shall not be condemned for not believing it;
   but for sins committed by them against the light of nature, and the law
   which is written in every man's breast.

   But those who have the gospel propounded to them, and yet continue in
   unbelief, their case is the most dangerous of any persons in the world,
   whether they be speculative or practical infidels.

   1. For speculative infidels (of whom I have been principally speaking)
   we may guess how great their condemnation shall be, by the greatness of
   their sin, which I have endeavoured fully to describe to you, with all
   its aggravations. It is called, (Heb. iii. 12.) "an evil heart of
   unbelief, to depart from the living God," en to apostenai apo Theou
   zontos. Infidelity is a kind of "apostacy from God;" it is said to be
   the giving of God the lie, (1 John v. 10.) "He that believeth on the
   Son of God, hath the witness in him self: he that believeth not God,
   hath made him a liar;" and we cannot but think that God will severely
   punish those who put such affronts upon him: it is but equal, that they
   who resist the clearest light, should "have their portion in utter
   darkness."

   2. For the practical infidels, those who in words acknowledge the
   gospel to be true, but "in works deny it;" their condition is every
   whit as bad as the others; nay, I had almost said, that it shall be
   more tolerable at the day of judgment for the speculative infidel than
   for them. He who denies the truth of the Christian religion, and lives
   contrary to the precepts of it, he acts suitably to his principles; but
   he that owns the truth of the gospel, and lives a wicked life, offers
   violence to those principles which he hath entertained.

   For if we profess ourselves Christians, by this profession we declare
   to the world, that we believe that the Son of God hath delivered that
   doctrine to the world which we call the gospel, and hath promised to be
   "the author of eternal salvation to them that obey him," and hath
   threatened men with eternal misery in case of disobedience; and that we
   make not the least doubt, but that both in his promises and
   threatenings God will be as good as his word: but if in the midst of
   this profession, we live contrary to the holy precepts of the gospel,
   in "ungodliness and worldly lusts," in profane swearing, by a trifling
   and irreverent use of the great and glorious name of God, in the
   neglect of God, and of the duties of religion, in the profanation of
   his day, in drunkenness and filthy lusts, in fraud and oppression, in
   lying and perjury, in wrath and malice, in enmity and uncharitableness
   one towards another; this very thing, that we have made profession of
   the gospel, will be an aggravation of our condemnation. Do we think,
   that, at the day of judgment, we shall escape by pleading this for
   ourselves, that we believed the gospel, and made profession of it? No,
   out of our own mouths we shall be condemned; for it seems "we knew our
   Master's will, and yet did it not;" we were convinced that we ought not
   to do such things, and yet we did them; we believed the glorious
   promises of the gospel, and yet we "neglected this great salvation," as
   a thing not worthy the looking after; we were verily persuaded of the
   intolerable and endless torments of hell, and yet we would leap into
   those flames.

   Nothing can make more against us, than such an apology as this; our
   very excuse will be the highest accusation and charge that can be
   brought against us, and out of our own confession we shall be
   condemned.

   All that now remains is, to make some application of this discourse
   which I have made to you concerning the truth of the Christian
   religion; which I should do in these two particulars,

   First, To persuade us to a firm belief of the Christian religion. And,

   Secondly, To live according to it. But as to this, I have prevented
   myself in some former discourses. [20]

SERMON CCXLII.

  THE EXCELLENCY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE CHRISTIAN REVELATION, WITH THE SIN AND
  DANGER OF REJECTING IT.

   And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
   men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
   evil.--John iii. 19.

   AT the 16th verse of this chapter our Saviour declares to Nicodemus
   (who was already convinced by his miracles, that he was "a teacher come
   from God") the great love and goodness of God to man kind in sending
   him into the world, to be the Saviour of it; "God so loved the world,
   that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
   should not perish, but have everlasting life." Considering the great
   wickedness of mankind, it might justly have been feared and expected,
   that God should have sent his Son into the world upon a different
   errand, to have punished the wickedness of men, and to have destroyed
   them from off the face of the earth; but he tells us at the 17th verse,
   that "God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but
   that through him the world might be saved;" and that the only way to
   avoid this condemnation, and to obtain that salvation which God
   designed for us, is "to believe on him whom God hath sent," (ver. 18.)
   "He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not
   is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the
   only-begotten Son of God." He is condemned by this very act of
   rejecting the Son of God, because he rejects the only way whereby
   salvation is to be had; and to aggravate the condemnation of such
   persons, our Saviour here in the text represents himself and his
   doctrine as "a light come into the world, "on purpose to discover to us
   our sinful and miserable condition, and the way of our recovery out of
   it, and salvation from it; and those that believe not on him, who do
   not entertain and welcome this clear and gracious discovery of God's
   love and goodness to mankind, as doing the absurdest thing imaginable,
   and making the most preposterous choice, preferring darkness before
   light: "This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
   and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
   evil."

   In which words there are these six things observable:

   First, The description which is here given of our Saviour and his
   doctrine, they are called a light: "Light is come;" that is, the Son of
   God preaching the doctrine of life and salvation to men.

   Secondly, The universal influence of this light: "Light is come into
   the world." It is designed for illumination and instruction, not only
   of a particular place and nation, but of a whole world.

   Thirdly, The excellency and advantages of this doctrine above any other
   doctrine or institution, even that of the Jewish religion, which was
   likewise immediately from God; they are all but darkness in comparison
   of it, "Light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather
   than light."

   Fourthly, The absurdity and unreasonableness of rejecting the doctrine
   of the gospel; it is a preferring darkness before light: "men loved
   darkness rather than light;" that is, they choose rather to continue in
   their former ignorance, than to entertain this clear and most perfect
   discovery of God's will to mankind.

   Fifthly, The true reason and account of this ab surd choice: "Men loved
   darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil."

   Sixthly, The great guilt of those who reject the doctrine of the
   gospel; by this very act of theirs they are condemned, nay, they
   condemn themselves, because they reject the only means of their
   salvation: "This is the condemnation," this very thing condemns them,
   and argues the height of their folly and guilt, that when light is come
   into the world, they preferred darkness before it. I shall discourse
   distinctly these particulars.

   First, We will consider the description which is here given of our
   Saviour and his doctrine; they are called light; "Light is come into
   the world." Light is a metaphor frequently used in Scripture for
   knowledge, especially for spiritual and Divine knowledge; and those who
   teach and instruct others are said to be lights. So our Saviour is
   frequently called "the light of the world," and "the true light;" and
   his disciples, who were to instruct the world, are called light, "ye
   are the light of the world:" and the doctrine of our Saviour is
   likewise called a light, "the light of the glorious gospel of Christ,"
   (2 Cor. iv. 4.) And it is with respect to his doctrine, that he is here
   said in the text to be a "light come into the world:" which phrase, of
   coining into the world, does not so immediately refer to his nativity,
   as to his commission from God; for this phrase of coming into the
   world, is of the same importance with that of being sent from God; as
   (verse 17.) where he says of himself, that "God sent him not into the
   world to condemn the world;" and here in the text, "this is the
   condemnation, that light is come into the world," that is, that when
   God sent his Son on purpose to preach such a doctrine, men should
   reject it and set it at nought: and in this sense, this phrase, of
   coming into the world, is I think frequently used in the New Testament,
   for coming in God's name, upon some message into the world. So chap.
   iv. 14. some of the Jews being convinced of our Saviour's Divine
   commission, express it thus; "Of a truth this is that prophet which was
   to come into the world." So chap. xii. 46. speaking of himself as sent
   of God, says he, "I am come a light into the world;" he had said just
   before, "He that seeth me, seeth him that sent me;" and then he adds,
   "I am a light come into the world." There is one text indeed, where
   this phrase seems to be taken for "being born into the world;" (chap.
   i. 9.) "And that was the true light, which enlightens every man that
   cometh into the world:" but several of the fathers, as St. Cyril and
   St. Augustine, read this text .otherwise, and that with great
   probability, considering the use of this phrase every where else; I
   say, they read it thus: "This was the true light, which, coining into
   the world, enlighteneth every man;" that is, which was sent from God to
   enlighten all mankind: and so this phrase, of coming into the world,
   refers not to men's being born into the world, but to our Saviour's
   being sent from God: and this our Saviour seems to distinguish from his
   birth: (John xviii. 37.) "To this end was I born, and for this cause
   came I into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth;" meaning
   that he was not only born, but commissioned by God for this end.

   But enough for the explication of this phrase, the proper importance
   whereof is not unworthy our knowledge; especially since a sect amongst
   us build their doctrine of a light within them, and born with them,
   sufficient to conduct every man to salvation, upon that text I
   mentioned before, "This was the true light, which enlightens every man
   that cometh into the world;" for which there is no pretence, if we read
   it as the original will very well bear it, "This was the true light,
   which, coming into the world, enlighteneth every man." And so our
   Saviour says of himself, (chap. xii. 46.) "I who am the light, am come
   into the world."

   But that which I principally intended under this head, is, the
   unfolding of the metaphor, which runs through the text, that so we may
   come at the plain sense and meaning of it, namely, why our Saviour, or
   (which is all one) the doctrine which he preached to the world, is
   represented to us by light. And here I might tell you that the doctrine
   of the gospel is called a light, with regard to its cheering and
   reviving nature; for "light (says Solomon) is sweet, and it is a
   pleasant thing to the eye to behold the sun:" so the gospel is "glad
   tidings of great joy." In regard likewise of its purity; as light is
   the purest of all corporeal beings, so the doctrine of the gospel doth
   enjoin a greater holiness and purity than any other religion ever did.
   And (not to be tedious in slight things) in regard of its sudden
   communication and speedy propagation in the world. As light darts
   itself from east to west in a moment; so the gospel was propagated with
   incredible swiftness, and did in a very short space diffuse itself over
   the world. Thus I might tell you, that in these, and many more such
   pretty respects, the doctrine of the gospel is called a light: but I do
   not love to hunt down a metaphor; for I know very well, that the
   Scripture (like other authors) useth a metaphor only to one purpose
   atone time; and though many more similitudes may by fancy be found out,
   it is certain, but one is intended; which I take notice of on purpose
   to reprove the vanity and injudiciousness of chasing metaphors farther
   than ever they were intended: for a metaphor is commonly used to
   represent to our mind the first and most obvious likeness of things.
   Thus the doctrine of the gospel is called light, in respect of the
   clearness of its discovery, it being one of the chief and most obvious
   properties of light, to discover and make visible itself, and other
   things. So the apostle tells us, (Ephes. v. 13.) "But all things that
   are reproved are made manifest by the light:" and in this respect and
   no other, the doctrine of the gospel is here called a light; because it
   clearly discovers to the world those things which they were either
   wholly ignorant or uncertain of before; and withal it carries its own
   evidence along with it, and hath plain characters of its own divinity
   upon it.

   And here I might shew at large these two things:

   First, What discoveries the doctrine of the gospel hath made to the
   world.

   Secondly, What evidence it brings along with it of its own divinity,
   that it is from God.

   First, What discoveries the doctrine of the gospel hath made to the
   world. It hath more clearly discovered,

   1. The nature of God, which is the great foundation of religion.

   2. Our own sinful and miserable state.

   3. The way and means of our remedy and recovery out of it.

   4. A more perfect and certain law and rule of life.

   5. A more powerful assistance, for the aid and encouragement of our
   obedience.

   6. And lastly, The gospel hath more clearly discovered to us the
   eternal rewards and punishments of another world, which are the great
   arguments to obedience and a holy life. I shall go over these as
   briefly as I can, having elsewhere [21] treated more largely on some of
   them.

   1. In the doctrine of the gospel we have a clear discovery made to us
   of the nature of God; which is the great foundation of all religion.
   For such as men's notions and conceptions of God are, such will their
   religious worship and services of him be; either worthy of him, and
   becoming his great and glorious majesty; or vain and superstitious,
   answerable to the idol of their own imagination: and such will be the
   actions of their lives; for all men make their God their example, and
   esteem it an essential piece of religion, to endeavour to be like him.
   Now the gospel gives us the most true and perfect character of the
   Divine nature, most agreeable to reason and the wisest and best
   apprehensions of mankind, such a character as is apt to be get in us
   the highest love and reverence towards him, and to engage us to the
   imitation of him, by the constant practice of holiness and virtue;
   representing him to us as most amiable for his goodness, and most
   dreadful for his power and justice; describing him to be a pure spirit,
   which the heathen did not generally believe; and consequently to be
   worshipped in such a manner, as is most suitable to his spiritual
   nature, concerning which the Jews were infinitely mistaken: for God did
   not command sacrifices to the Jews, and all those external and
   troublesome observances, because they were most agreeable to his own
   nature; but because of the grossness of their apprehensions, and the
   carnality and hardness of their hearts. God did not prescribe this way
   of worship to them, because it was best; but because the temper of that
   people, which was so very prone to idolatry, would admit of no other.

   The gospel likewise discovers to us more clearly the goodness of God,
   and his great love to mankind, one of the best and strongest motives in
   the world to the love of God. The heathen did generally dread God, and
   look upon him as fierce and revengeful, and therefore they studied by
   all means to appease him, even by human sacrifices, and offering up
   their own children to him; and all along in the Old Testament, though
   there be plain and express declarations of the goodness of God, yet he
   is generally described as very terrible and severe; but the gospel is
   full of gracious declarations of God's love and mercy to mankind. In
   the Old Testament he is usually styled "the Lord of hosts, the great
   and terrible God; but in the New Testament, he represents himself in a
   milder style, "the God of love and peace, the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ," and in him "the Father of mercies, and the God of all patience
   and consolation." And this difference between the style of the Old and
   New Testament was so remarkable, that one of the greatest sects in the
   primitive church (I mean that of the gnostics, which was subdivided
   into many other sects) did upon this found their heresy of two
   principles, or Gods; the one evil, and fierce, and cruel, whom they
   called the God of the Old Testament; the other kind, and loving, and
   merciful, whom they called the God of the New.

   2. The gospel hath likewise more clearly discovered to us our own
   sinful and wretched state; that, being made upright, and originally
   designed by God to live in a holy and happy condition, and endued with
   sufficient power for that purpose, we, by our wilful transgressions and
   disobedience of an easy law given to our first parents, are sunk into a
   wretched state of ignorance and weakness of sin and sorrow, and thereby
   are become estranged from God, and obnoxious to his wrath and
   displeasure, and utterly unable to help and recover ourselves out of
   this sad and miserable state. And this is a great advantage to us, to
   understand the truth of our condition, and the worst of our case;
   because a just sense of it will prompt us to seek out for a remedy, and
   make us ready to embrace it when it is offered to us. And therefore, in
   the

   3. Third place, The gospel hath plainly discovered to us the way and
   means of our recovery out of this wretched condition; namely, that, in
   tender commiseration of our miserable and helpless condition, God was
   pleased to send his Son, his only Son, into the world, to assume our
   nature, and "to be made in all things like unto us, sin only excepted;"
   to dwell among us, to converse with us, that he might instruct us in
   the way to happiness, and lead us therein by the example of his holy
   life; and that by his death he might be a propitiation for our sins,
   and purchase the forgiveness of them, and obtain eternal redemption for
   us. So that here is an adequate and perfect remedy discovered in the
   gospel, every way answerable to the weakness and impotency, the
   degeneracy and guilt, of man kind, "God having laid help upon one that
   is mighty, and able to save to the utmost all those that come to God by
   him." He took our nature upon him, and became man, "that he might bring
   us to God," and, by restoring us to his image and likeness, might
   repair those woful ruins which sin had made in us; and to obtain the
   pardon and forgiveness of our sins, "God spared not his own Son, but
   freely gave him to death for us all; and having raised him from the
   dead, hath sent him to bless us, in turning us away every one from our
   iniquity." So that, by this means, the great doubts and fears of
   mankind, concerning the way of appeasing the offended justice of God,
   are removed and satisfied. The gospel having given us full assurance,
   not only that God is reconciled to us, and willing, after all our
   offences and provocations, to become our friend; but that he hath
   established the way and means of it; so that "if any man sin, we have
   an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous, who is the
   propitiation for our sins, and for the sins of the whole world." And
   this is a peculiar advantage of the Christian religion, to assure us of
   the forgiveness of sins, of the manner how it is procured, and the
   certain terms upon which it is granted, which neither by the light of
   nature, nor by any revelation from God, was clearly discovered before.

   4. The gospel hath likewise revealed to us a more certain and perfect
   law and rule of life. It hath fixed our duty, and made it more plain
   and certain in all the instances of it, than either the light of
   nature, or the utmost improvement of that light by philosophy, or than
   the Jewish religion had done before. It hath cleared our duty in some
   instances, which the light of nature had left doubtful, or which the
   subtle disputes of men had made so. It hath heightened our duty in
   several instances; and those things which had not the clear force of
   law before, but were only the counsels of wiser men, it hath turned
   into strict precepts, and made them necessary parts of our duty. It
   commands universal love, and kindness, and good-will among men, and
   perfect forgiveness of the greatest injuries and offences; and
   inculcates these precepts more vehemently, and forbids all malice and
   revenge more strictly and peremptorily, than any religion or philosophy
   had done before; as will fully appear to any one who will but
   attentively read and consider our Saviour's sermon upon the mount.

   I cannot now enlarge in giving a particular account of the excellent
   laws and precepts of our religion, relating to God, our neighbour, and
   ourselves; I shall only say of them, that they all tend to the
   perfection of our nature, and the raising of it to the highest pitch of
   virtue and goodness that we are capable of in this life, and to qualify
   and dispose us for the felicity of the next; that they every way
   conduce to the benefit and advantage of particular persons, singly
   considered, and to the peace and welfare of human society; in a word,
   they all conspire in the glory of God, and the comfort and happiness of
   man: and no religion that ever was in the world, nor no philosophy, can
   shew such a system of moral precepts, in which, as there is nothing
   vain and faulty, so neither is there any thing defective and wanting;
   so that St. James doth with great reason call it "a perfect law."

   5. The gospel doth also discover and offer to us a most powerful
   assistance for the aid and encouragement of our obedience, abundant
   help and strength to enable us to the performance of all which God
   requires of us. It offers us wisdom to enlighten our dark minds, and to
   direct us in doubtful and difficult cases. (James i. 5.) "If any of you
   lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
   upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." Our Saviour hath promised
   "to give his Holy Spirit to them that ask it," to help our weakness,
   and to raise our courage to strengthen us against the power and force
   of strong and violent temptations, and to assist us in all our
   conflicts with our spiritual enemies, and to comfort and sup port us in
   all our afflictions and sufferings.

   And without this, all the other advantages which our religion affords
   us would signify little. For what would the knowledge of our sinful and
   miserable state avail us, without power to rescue ourselves out of it?
   What is the pardon of our sins past, without strength against them for
   the future? What would signify the most complete rule of life, and the
   most perfect pattern of holiness and virtue, without ability in some
   measure to observe them and live up to them? Without this necessary aid
   and support, we might despair of resisting the temptations, and
   mastering the difficulties, of a Christian course, of subduing the
   power of bad inclinations, and breaking the force of vicious habits,
   and bearing up against the violence of extreme suffering and
   persecution for righteousness sake; without this gracious assistance we
   can do nothing of all this; and by the help of this we may become, as
   St. Paul expresses it, "more than conquerors."

   6. And lastly, The gospel hath clearly discovered to us the eternal
   rewards and punishments of an other world, which are the great
   incentives and arguments to obedience, and a patient and constant
   continuance in well-doing. The gospel (as the apostle to the Hebrews
   tells us) is in this respect a better covenant than the law, being
   established upon better promises, and having the sanction of more
   severe and terrible threatenings. These great and powerful arguments to
   keep mankind within the bounds of their duty, which the wisest of the
   heathen had some doubt of, and which were but very imperfectly revealed
   to the Jews, are clearly made manifest by the gospel. So the apostle
   tells us, that "life and immortality are brought to light by the
   gospel;" and that "therein the wrath of God is revealed from heaven,
   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men." And this gives the
   gospel a mighty power and influence over the minds of men. "Now God
   commands all men every where to repent," and obey his laws; "because he
   hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness
   by that man, whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he
   hath raised him from the dead." The resurrection of Christ from the
   dead is a sensible demonstration to all mankind of another life after
   this, and consequently of a future judgment.

   I might proceed to shew, in the second place, That as the gospel is a
   light, in respect of its clear discovery of other things to us, so
   likewise of itself, and its own Divine authority.

   It is a holy and reasonable doctrine, suitable to the highest and
   best-improved reason of mankind, and plainly tending to our perfection
   and happiness; both for the sublimity of its mysteries, and the
   simplicity and excellency of its precepts, every way worthy to have God
   for its author, and most likely to proceed from him, and from none
   else. In a word, it is a doctrine in all respects so excellent and
   perfect, that it is beyond the compass of human understanding to
   imagine any thing better; and impossible, that any religion, materially
   differing from this, should be so good. No religion that ever was, or
   which the wit of man can devise, can give us juster notions of God, a
   truer account of ourselves, better rules of a good life, and arguments
   more powerful to persuade us to goodness, than the Christian religion
   hath done. And the intrinsic goodness and excellency of any religion,
   goes half way in the proof of its Divinity; to which, if God be pleased
   to add the external confirmation of plain and unquestionable miracles,
   it amounts to a full demonstration, and hath all the evidence that it
   is possible for any religion to have, that it is from God.

   But this is a very large argument, which I have handled in some other
   discourses. [22] All therefore that I shall at present add, is an
   inference or two from what I have been discoursing upon this argument,
   suited to the solemnity of this season. [23]

   I. We should welcome this light which is come into the world with all
   possible expressions of joy and thankfulness. The doctrine of the
   gospel is the most glorious light that ever shone upon the world, the
   best news that ever arrived to mankind. Light is a cheerful thing; "The
   light of the eyes (says Solomon) rejoiceth the heart, and good news
   maketh the bones fat." When the angel brought the news of our Saviour's
   birth to the shepherds, with what joy does he relate it to them! (Luke
   ii. 10, 11.) "Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which
   shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of
   David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord." And (Matt. ii. 10.) when
   the wise men saw the star, which pointed at the place of his birth, and
   conducted them to it, it is said, "they rejoiced with great joy."

   And whenever we commemorate the breaking in of this glorious light upon
   the world, I mean the birth of our blessed Saviour, how should our
   hearts be filled with joy, and our mouths with praises! We should every
   one of us break out into that hymn of the blessed mother of our Lord,
   "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my
   Saviour," for he hath regarded me and all mankind in our low estate. He
   was pleased to come down from heaven to save us from hell; and to
   become man, that he might "bring us to God;" and was contented to be
   miserable, that he might make us happy; and he did declare this mighty
   affection to us, when we were not only unworthy of his love, but even
   beneath the consideration and regard of his pity; for what is man, that
   God should be thus mindful of him, or the son of man, that the Son of
   God should visit him? that he should condescend to inhabit our nature,
   and "to dwell among us?" All mankind may with equal or greater reason
   say, as the centurion once did to him, "Lord, we are not worthy that
   thou shouldst come under our roof." What means this amazing
   condescension, that thou shouldst leave thy glory, to be thus obscured,
   and come from God, to be "despised and rejected of men;" and quit the
   regions of bliss and happiness, to become "a man of sorrows, and
   acquainted with grief!" Was it for us that thou didst all this? Yea,
   for our sakes, who never had done any thing for thine, who may be
   ashamed to remember, that we were grievous sinners, and bitter enemies
   to thee, when all this was done for us.

   Thus we should celebrate the memory of this blessed season, and as
   often as the year returns, with great joy and thankfulness commemorate
   the great blessings which this day brought to the world, and say with
   David, "This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will be glad and
   rejoice therein." Abraham and David saw this day, but far off; and yet
   they rejoiced: how should we then be transported with joy, to whom this
   day is come, and upon whom the Sun of righteousness is long since
   risen, with healing and salvation under his wings!

   II. Let us "walk in this light." This expression the Scripture useth to
   signify what use we should make of the advantages and opportunities
   which, by the glorious light of the gospel, are afforded to us, (John
   xii. 35.) "Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you."
   (Ephes. v. 8.) "For ye were sometimes darkness: but now are ye light in
   the Lord: walk therefore as children of the light." (Rom. xiii. 11-14.)
   "It is now high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation
   nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at
   hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put
   on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in
   rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in
   strife and envying;. but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not
   provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."

   This counsel is proper for Christians at all times, who live under the
   light of the gospel; but more especially at this time, when we
   commemorate the coming of this light into the world. Nothing can be
   more unsuitable and contrary to it, than works of darkness, I mean sin
   and wickedness, and those abominable vices, which too many are apt to
   indulge themselves in at this time, more especially such as the apostle
   names in the text just now mentioned, "rioting and drunkenness,
   chambering and wantonness, contention and quarrelling." We should at
   this time more especially put off those vices, and "put on the Lord
   Jesus Christ;" that is, be clothed with all those graces and virtues,
   which, in the precepts of his religion, and the example of his life, he
   hath recommended to us. This is the time when the "Word was made
   flesh," and put on our nature; and what return can be more proper for
   us at this season, than "to put on the Lord Jesus; and to make no
   provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof?"

   Nay, at this time we should retrench more than usual from our excess
   and superfluity, both because of the crying necessities of the poor,
   who are very numerous, and likewise for the relief of our distressed
   and persecuted brethren, who are fled to us for shelter from the
   barbarous rage of their persecutors. What we would have done for the
   honour of Christ at another time, let us now do for the relief of his
   members; and whatever kindness we shew to them, he will take it as done
   to himself. We have great cause to be cheerful at this time, and we may
   testify our joy by feasting, or any other lawful expressions of it: but
   we must not so feast, as to forget the affliction of Joseph, and not to
   remember that we also are in the body, and liable to the same
   sufferings. We must therefore take heed, that our table do not become
   "a snare to us;" and that our mirth do not degenerate into sensuality
   and sin.

   Every Christian hath so many arguments against sin, that we should
   abstain from it at all times: but of all other times we should be most
   ashamed to be guilty of any lewdness and wickedness when we are
   remembering" the appearance of the Son of God, to bring salvation to
   us, and to teach us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live
   soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world."

   To conclude: let us by all that hath been said be persuaded so to
   celebrate the memory of Christ's first coming, to "take away sin by the
   sacrifice of himself," that we may with comfort and joy "wait for the
   blessed hope, and the glorious appearance of the great God and our
   Saviour Jesus Christ, when he shall appear a second time, without sin
   unto salvation."

SERMON CCXLIII.

  THE EXCELLENCY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE CHRISTIAN REVELATION, WITH THE SIN AND
  DANGER OF REJECTING IT.

   And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
   men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
   evil.--John iii. 19.

   IN discoursing on these words, I have already considered the first
   thing observable in them, viz. The description which is here given of
   our Saviour and his doctrine; they are called a light: "Light is come,"
   that is, the Son of God, bringing the doctrine and knowledge of
   salvation to the world; it being one of the first and most obvious
   properties of light to discover and make visible itself and other
   things: "That which makes all things manifest is light;" and
   accordingly I have observed, that the Christian religion hath made a
   clear discovery to us of many great and important things, of which the
   world was either ignorant or doubtful before: and likewise that it
   brought great evidence along with it of its own divinity, and that it
   was from God.

   I proceed now to the second thing observable in the text, viz. The
   universal influence of this light: "Light is come into the world." The
   doctrine of the gospel was designed for the illumination and
   instruction, not of one particular place and nation, but of the whole
   world. Thus our Saviour and his doctrine are described by old Simeon,
   (Luke ii. 30-32.) "For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, which thou
   hast prepared before the face of all people: a light to lighten the
   gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel." To the gentiles, who
   were before in darkness, he is said to be a light: but to the Jews, who
   had the light of Divine revelation in some degree before, he is said to
   be a glory; that is, a brighter and more glorious light; "A light to
   lighten the gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel." And (John i.
   9.) he is called "the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh
   into the world," that is, which was sent into the world for the
   illumination of all mankind. And (John viii. 12.) he says of himself,
   "I am the light of the world."

   Now that the revelation of the gospel by Jesus Christ was designed for
   the whole world, for the instruction, and comfort, and benefit of all
   mankind, I shall endeavour to make out by these three steps:

   I. In that it is very credible, that God would some time or other make
   such a revelation of his will, as might be sufficient to direct and
   bring man kind to happiness.

   II. That before the revelation of the gospel by Jesus Christ, no such
   general and universal declaration of God's will had been made to the
   world.

   III. That the revelation of the gospel hath all the marks and
   characters of an universal revelation, and was certainly by God
   designed for that purpose.

   I. It is very credible, that God would some time or other, when his
   infinite wisdom and goodness should think it most fit and seasonable,
   make such a revelation of his will to the world, as might be sufficient
   to direct and bring mankind to happiness. The consideration of the
   Divine goodness is very apt to induce such a persuasion; for what more
   reasonable to believe concerning God, than that he, who is good to all,
   and the common Father of all mankind, not the God of the Jews only, but
   the God of the gentiles also (as St. Paul argues to this purpose, in
   his Epistle to the Romans,) should some time or other, in pity and
   compassion of the ignorant and degenerate and helpless condition of
   mankind, provide some universal remedy, by such a general revelation of
   his will, as was every way fitted and calculated to be of universal use
   and benefit to direct all men in the way to happiness, and if they be
   not wanting to themselves to bring them to it; that, in the doublings
   and uncertainties of mankind concerning the will of God, and the rule
   of their duty, he should give an universal law, equally obliging all
   men, to be a perfect and standing rule and measure of their duty in all
   times and places, and which should never stand in need of any addition,
   amendment, or alteration.

   For why should we think that God, who is so equally related to us all,
   should confine the effects of his goodness to a few persons, or a small
   part of mankind, to one particular family or nation? That he, whose
   bounty is so equal and unconfined in the disposing of temporal
   blessings, should be so partial and narrow in the bestowing of his
   greatest and best gifts, those spiritual blessings which concern our
   souls, and our happiness to all eternity? How can we in reason imagine,
   that he who "causeth the sun to rise, and his rain to fall," upon the
   whole world, should vouchsafe that great and most glorious light of his
   Divine and heavenly truth only to a few, and shower down his spiritual
   blessings upon a small part of the earth, leaving all the rest of the
   world a wilderness, and a land of darkness? Thus to think of God is no
   ways agreeable to those large apprehensions which mankind have always
   had of the goodness of God, by no means honourable to the Divine
   nature; and therefore it is most highly probable, that God should one
   time or other make such a revelation of his will to mankind, as is of
   universal concernment and advantage.

   II. I shall shew that before the revelation of the gospel by Jesus
   Christ, no such general and universal declaration of God's will had
   been made to the world. All the revelations which God had made to men
   before, were either made to some particular persons upon particular
   occasions, or to one particular nation and people, I mean that of the
   Jews. Those which were made to particular persons were so narrow and
   limited, and of so private concernment, that they signified nothing to
   the generality of man kind; nor could the knowledge of them, with any
   degree of evidence, have been propagated. As for that revelation which
   was made to the Jews, it was, both in its nature and design, and in all
   the circumstances of it, plainly limited to one particular place and
   nation. And as God discovered no intention, so neither were there any
   proper means and endeavours used to proclaim and propagate it, as an
   universal law and institution obligatory to all mankind.

   From the nature and all the circumstances of the Jewish law, it clearly
   appears to have been designed for a municipal law and constitution, for
   the governing of one particular people and nation, within a certain
   territory and spot of ground, to which a great part of the precepts of
   it is peculiarly limited, and could be exercised and practised no where
   else; and not intended to take in and oblige all the nations of the
   earth. For when this law was first given, God plainly directs it to the
   people of Israel, beginning it in this form of words, "Hear, O Israel,
   the Lord thy God is one God;" and "I am the Lord thy God, who brought
   thee out of the land of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage;" and he
   frequently tells them, that he had separated them from all the people
   upon the face of the earth, to be a peculiar people to himself; to be
   governed by peculiar civil laws, and by a particular way of religious
   worship: for which reason the apostle calls the Jewish law and religion
   "a wall of partition, which did separate and divide them from all other
   people; so that even towards the strangers that lived among them, they
   were not bound in several cases to observe the same laws towards them
   which they were obliged strictly to observe towards their brethren; as
   in the case of usury, and remitting debts, and releasing of servants.

   Besides that, a great part of their religion was confined to a
   particular place, which God should appoint, and which at last by his
   appointment was fixed to the temple at Jerusalem, to which they were
   obliged to resort thrice every year; which it was impossible for other
   nations to do. Not to mention that the great promises and threatening*
   of that law were, of plenty and prosperity, or of famine and affliction
   in that land. To all which we may add, that a great part of the laws
   and ordinances of that religion, was peculiarly fitted and suited to
   the genius and inclination of that people, and made in condescension to
   their capacities and prejudices, to the obstinacy and hardness of their
   hearts.

   It is very clear, likewise, that God did not design to spread and
   propagate this law any farther than that people; since no means were
   appointed by him, no endeavours were used, to that end: no apostles and
   prophets were sent forth to proclaim and publish this law to other
   nations; nay, the providence of God seems rather purposely to have
   designed to conceal them and their law, till the time drew near of
   God's revealing to the world a more perfect institution, which should
   have its rise and beginning there, and from thence be published over
   the world, according to that of the prophet, that "the law should come
   out of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem:" but the law
   which was given by Moses to the Jews was, for many ages in a great
   measure concealed from the rest of the world. So the Psalmist tells us,
   (Psal. cxlvii. 19, 20.) "He sheweth his word unto Jacob; his statutes
   and judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation; and as
   for his judgments, they have not known them." Nay, on the contrary, God
   had provided, by several strict and severe laws, that the people of
   Israel should have as little commerce and conversation as was possible
   with other nations; a plain sign he never intended their religion to be
   propagated among them; but this is so manifest from the nature of the
   Jewish religion, and all the circumstances of its constitution, that I
   need not to labour any farther in the proof of it. I proceed therefore
   to shew, in the

   III. Third and last place, That the revelation of the gospel hath all
   the marks and characters of an universal revelation, and was certainly
   designed by God for that end. And this will clearly appear, by
   considering these four things:--

   1. The person by whom God was pleased to make this revelation to the
   world.

   2. The nature and design of it.

   3. The prophecies and predictions concerning it. And,

   4. The remarkable countenance and assistance which were given from
   heaven to the first publishers of it.

   1. If we consider the person by whom God was pleased to make this
   revelation to the world, we cannot think that God had any less design
   therein, than the recovery and reformation of mankind. Now the person
   employed by God to make this revelation of his will, was the eternal
   and only-begotten Son of God, assuming our nature and appearing in it;
   I say, the eternal and only-begotten Son of God. So the apostle to the
   Hebrews describes him, and there by distinguished! him from all the
   former prophets, by whom, in former ages, God had made particular
   revelations of himself to men: (Heb. i. 1-3.) "God, who at sundry times
   (or by several parts and degrees), and in divers manners, spake in
   times past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days
   spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things,
   by whom also he made the worlds: who being the brightness of his glory,
   and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the
   word of his power." What a character is here of the greatest and most
   glorious person that ever was employed to men! a messenger of God to
   man; and who so fit as the Son of God, who came from the bosom of his
   Father, to reveal his will to all mankind? Who so proper as he, who
   made the world, and upholds and preserves it, to be sent upon so great
   an errand, as the recovery and salvation of the whole world? And, on
   the contrary, who so unfit, as this great and glorious person, to be
   employed in any less and lower design, than that which was of general
   concernment to the benefit and happiness of all mankind? So great an
   ambassador was not fit to be sent to treat of any thing less than an
   universal peace, and the reconciliation of the whole world.

   And then, if we consider him as assuming human nature, and thereby
   equally related to all mankind, it was fit he should be concerned for
   that whole race of creatures to whom he had so nearly allied himself,
   and whose nature he had vouchsafed to assume. It became him, who became
   man, to shew himself a lover of mankind, to reveal the will of God, and
   the way to happiness, to all men, to be an universal teacher and
   lawgiver; that by the direction and doctrine, and the obedience of his
   laws, "all men might come to the knowledge of the truth, and be saved."

   2. If we consider the nature of this revelation, it will appear to be
   designed for the general use and benefit of mankind. The matters
   revealed, whether concerning God or ourselves, this world or the other,
   are of universal concernment. The laws of this religion are not
   calculated for any particular place or nation, one more than another;
   and the arguments and encouragements to the obedience of these laws,
   are equally fitted to work upon all capacities and conditions, and apt
   to affect them alike, because they equally touch the interests and
   concernments of all men: for since all men are equal in the immortal
   duration of their souls, and equally obnoxious to the judgment of God
   in another world, it concerns all men alike to understand their duty,
   and the way to gain the favour of God, and thereby to escape the
   endless and intolerable miseries, and to obtain the unspeakable and
   everlasting happiness, of another world: and to direct, and excite men
   hereto, the whole revelation of the gospel, and the doctrines, and all
   the laws of it, do plainly tend. There is nothing in the Christian
   religion but what is fit for all men to know and practise, in order to
   their present peace and comfort, and their future and eternal
   happiness; and these things surely are of universal and equal
   concernment to mankind.

   3. The predictions and prophecies concerning the Messias, and the
   doctrine which should be delivered to the world, do plainly shew, that
   this revelation should be universal. In the first promise to Abraham,
   it is plainly foretold, that in his seed, that is, as the Jews always
   understood it, in the Messias, all the nations of the earth should be
   blessed. And there are innumerable predictions in the prophets of the
   Old Testament to this purpose. I shall mention but a few of many:
   (Psal. ii. 8.) "Ask of me, (saith God to his Son) and I shall give thee
   the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth
   for thy possession." Psal. lxxii. 17. speaking of the Messias, "Men
   shall be blessed in him; all nations shall call him Blessed." (Isa.
   xlix. 6.) "I will give thee (says God there concerning him) for a light
   to lighten the gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation to the ends
   of the earth."

   4. And lastly, This revelation was actually published to the world, God
   giving remarkable countenance and assistance from heaven to the first
   preachers and publishers of it.

   The apostles of our Lord and Saviour, in virtue of his commission, and
   by his express command just before his ascension, went forth and
   published his doctrine to the world. Having, upon the day of Pentecost,
   according to his promise which he made to them before his death, and
   renewed to them after his resurrection, when he was going to his
   Father; I say, having, according to his express promise, received the
   miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost, they began to publish the gospel
   first to the Jews; and, being rejected by the greatest part of them,
   they preached it to the gentiles; and as a confirmation of the doctrine
   which they preached, they witnessed the resurrection of Christ from the
   dead, as the great evidence of the truth of his doctrine; and to give
   confirmation to this testimony, God enabled them to work miracles, and
   particularly to raise the dead to life, which was a confirmation of
   their testimony beyond all exception: and in order to the more speedy
   and effectual propagation of this doctrine, God was pleased to work a
   strange miracle never wrought upon any occasion before or since; he
   endowed the apostles and first preachers of Christianity with a power
   of speaking all languages, which they had occasion in their travels to
   make use of, without ever having studied or learned them; and this
   miraculous gift was common to all the apostles, and continued till the
   gospel was published by them in most parts of the then known world;
   greater evidence than which God cannot be imagined to give of his
   design to communicate the knowledge of this doctrine universally, and
   to all nations: and if it was rejected in some places, and the progress
   of it obstructed in others, this doth not hinder but that God designed
   it to be universally known, and that it is of its own nature fit to be
   a law to all mankind; and God, who, in his secret counsel, bath not
   thought fit as yet to grant the knowledge of this doctrine of salvation
   to some parts of the world, may in his due time send this light into
   those dark places of the earth, which are full of the habitations of
   barbarousness and cruelty, and grant the knowledge of salvation to
   them. In the mean time, what cause have we to bless God, to whom this
   light came so soon, and who have enjoyed it so long! "Let us walk in
   the light, while we have it, lest darkness overtake us."

   And thus much may suffice to have been spoken of the second particular
   which I observed in the text, namely, the Universal influence of this
   light; "light is come into the world."

   I proceed to speak briefly to the third particular I mentioned, viz.
   the excellency and advantages of this doctrine of the Christian
   religion, above any other doctrine or institution, even that of the
   Jewish religion, which was likewise immediately from God. They are all
   but darkness in comparison of it. "Light is come into the world." But
   in this I have in a great measure prevented myself, in what I have
   already discoursed upon the two former heads, and therefore I shall say
   the less upon it: for by what I have already said, it will in good
   measure appear, how obscure and imperfect the discoveries both of
   natural light, and of the Jewish religion were, in comparison of the
   bright revelation of the gospel; and that, both concerning the nature
   of God, and the worship which is most suitable and acceptable to him;
   and likewise concerning the rule of our duty, and the rewards and
   punishments of another life, which are the great motives and arguments
   to obedience; and which, as to the greatest part of mankind, both Jews
   and gentiles, had but a very weak and faint influence before. And how
   could it well be otherwise, since the apprehensions of mankind
   concerning these things were dark and doubtful!

   What gross and imperfect notions the heathens had concerning God, we
   may judge by their universal and abominable idolatry. How uncertain
   their morality was (which yet was the best part of heathenism) we may
   see by their endless differences and disputes concerning moral duties.
   How wavering they were concerning the immortality of souls, and the
   rewards of another world, we may judge by the different and contrary
   opinions of the greatest philosophers about these points. So that
   heathen ism was plainly defective, both in the knowledge of God, which
   is the great foundation of all religion, and the precepts of a good
   life, which are the rule of it; and the assurance of immortality, which
   is the great motive to religion, and the only solid comfort and support
   of the mind of man under the evils and afflictions of life, and against
   the fears of death.

   And the Jewish religion, likewise, though it had manifold advantages of
   paganism, yet was it very short and imperfect in many of these respects
   which I have mentioned: besides that, it gave no clear and
   well-grounded assurance of the pardon and forgiveness of sins; and the
   rewards of another world were very obscurely revealed under that
   dispensation. So that well might the apostle, upon comparison of the
   law and the gospel, say, "The law made nothing perfect: but the
   bringing in of a better hope did."

   And as for the evidence which those religions had, paganism pretended
   to no other authority for their idolatrous worship, but the long custom
   and practice of the world. This Symmachus, the heathen, insists upon,
   instead of all other arguments: Sequimur majores nostros, qui feliciter
   secuti sunt suos: "We follow our forefathers, who happily followed
   theirs."

   The Jewish religion, indeed, produced good evidence that it was from
   God; but it is very destitute of arguments to prove, that it was either
   an universal, or perfect, or final revelation of God's will to mankind;
   nay, it was expressly said in their law, that God would raise up
   another prophet among them, to whom they were to hearken, and to be
   obedient in all things. The Messias was plainly foretold, and spoken
   of, both in the law and the prophets, as one that was to be the author
   of a more perfect law and institution, which in due time was to be
   revealed to the whole world, "to be a light to lighten the gentiles,"
   as well as to be the glory of the people of Israel: and accordingly,
   "in the fulness of time," he came, and by a greater confirmation of
   miracles, than the Jewish religion had, he put a period to that weak
   and imperfect institution; and to shew that the law of Moses was at an
   end, God hath now, for above sixteen hundred years, taken away their
   place and nation, destroyed their temple, and laid waste their country,
   and dispersed them over the world; so that they are not capable of
   observing a great part of their religion. By all which it appears, that
   whatever was in the world before, was but darkness, in comparison of
   the glorious light of the gospel; so that well might our evangelist
   say, "This light was the true light, which coming into the world,
   enlightens every man:" "the true light," by way of excellency and
   eminency; as our Saviour calls himself "the true bread which came down
   from heaven," so the doctrine of the gospel is called "the true light,"
   in opposition to those false or imperfect lights which were in the
   world before. This doctrine of the Christian religion is a perfect, and
   therefore a final discovery of the will of God to man; because it can
   receive no amendment, therefore it shall never have any change or
   alteration.

   I will conclude this particular with that inference which the apostle
   to the Hebrews makes, from the consideration of the perfection and
   unchangeableness of the gospel dispensation, which he calls "a kingdom
   which cannot be shaken:" (Heb. xii. 28, 29.) "Wherefore we receiving a
   kingdom which cannot be removed, let us have grace, whereby we may
   serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear. For our God is a
   consuming fire." The better, and more perfect, and more unchangeable,
   our religion is, the better we should be; the more steadfastly should
   we persist in the sincere profession and practice of it: and if we do
   not, the heavier will be our condemnation; "for our God is a consuming
   fire." I proceed to the

   Fourth particular observable in the text, viz. The great
   unreasonableness of rejecting this doctrine of the gospel. It is to
   make the absurdest judgment and choice possible, to prefer darkness
   before light. "Men loved darkness rather than light;" that is, they
   chose rather to continue in their former ignorance, than to entertain
   the most clear and perfect discovery of God's will to mankind. And what
   can be more absurd and unreasonable, when the difference is so
   palpable, and the choice so plain? That man is blind that cannot
   distinguish light from darkness; and he is very perverse and obstinate,
   who, seeing the difference between them, will choose darkness rather
   than light. Such was the unreasonableness of those who rejected the
   gospel when it was revealed to the world; since no thing is more clear
   to an impartial and considerate man, than that the Christian religion
   is the best and most perfect institution, of the greatest and most
   universal concernment to mankind, that ever was revealed to men; and
   our blessed Saviour, who was the author and founder of this religion,
   gave greater evidence that he came from God, than any other prophet or
   teacher that ever was; and the worship of God which this religion
   prescribes, is most agreeable to his nature, being a spiritual and a
   reasonable service, fit for men to give, and for God to accept. In a
   word, the precepts of the gospel are more excellent in themselves, and
   better calculated for the happiness and perfection of human nature; and
   the motives and arguments to persuade men to the obedience of these
   precepts, more powerful than those of any other religion that ever yet
   appeared in the world.

   So that the difference between the Christian religion and all others
   that have been received and professed in the world, is so plain and
   apparent, that nothing but passion, or prejudice, or interest, or some
   other faulty principle, can hinder any man from yielding his assent to
   Christianity. The comparison is almost equal to that betwixt light and
   darkness; and therefore, our Saviour had great reason to speak so very
   severely of the infidelity of the Jews, who rejected such a doctrine,
   propounded to them with so much evidence and advantage. And because the
   Jews are the great Scripture pattern of perverse infidelity and
   opposition to the truth, it will not he amiss to take our estimate and
   measure of the unreasonableness of this spirit and temper from the
   properties and characters which we find of it in the Jews, most of
   which do still inseparably accompany the spirit of infidelity wherever
   it is; that as face answers face in water, so does the infidelity of
   this present age resemble that of the Jews in our Saviour's time, in
   all those perverse and unreasonable qualities which did then attend
   them; and therefore I shall take notice of some of the chief of them,
   as I find them dispersed up and down in the history of the New
   Testament. But this, and what remains to be said upon this argument, I
   must reserve for another discourse.

SERMON CCXLIV.

  THE EXCELLENCY AND UNIVERSALITY OF THE CHRISTIAN REVELATION, WITH THE SIN AND
  DANGER OF REJECTING IT.

   And this is Ike condemnation, that light is come into the world, and
   men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
   evil.--John iii. 19.

   WHEN I began to discourse on these words, I observed in them several
   particulars. As,

   First, The description which is here given of our Saviour and his
   doctrine, by the metaphor of light. "Light is come."

   Secondly, The universal influence of this light. "Light is come into
   the world."

   Thirdly, The excellency and advantages of the doctrine of the gospel,
   above any other doctrine or institution, even that of the Jewish
   religion, which was likewise immediately from God. They are all but
   darkness, in comparison with this: "Light is come into the world; and
   men loved darkness."

   These three I have dispatched, and have entered upon the fourth
   particular observable in my text; namely,

   The great unreasonableness of rejecting this doctrine of the gospel. It
   is to make the absurdest judgment and choice that is possible, to
   prefer darkness before light. "Men loved darkness rather than light."
   The difference between the Christian religion and all others is so very
   plain, that our Saviour had great reason to speak thus severely of the
   infidelity of the Jews. And because the Jews are the great Scripture
   pattern of perverse infidelity, I proposed the taking an estimate of
   the unreasonableness of this spirit and temper, from the characters
   which we find of it in that people, most of which do still inseparably
   attend the spirit of infidelity, wherever it is. I shall therefore take
   notice of some of the chief of those characters, as I find them
   dispersed up and down in the history of the New Testament; and they are
   these which follow:--

   I. Monstrous partiality, in denying and rejecting that revelation,
   which had not only as great, but greater evidence, than other things
   which they did believe, and were ready enough to entertain. They
   believed Moses and the prophets: and the great confirmation which was
   given to them, was by the miracles which God wrought by them. Those
   miracles they did not see themselves, but received them from the
   testimony of their forefathers, being brought down to them by a very
   credible and uncontrolled revelation, which they had no reason to doubt
   of the truth of; but they themselves saw the miracles which our Saviour
   wrought, which were more and greater than the miracles of Moses and all
   the prophets, so that they were eye-witnesses of that Divine power
   which accompanied our Saviour; and yet they rejected him and his
   doctrine: nay, so unequally did they deal with him, that, after they
   had rejected him, notwithstanding all the evidence which he gave that
   he came from God, they greedily received and ran after false prophets
   who gave no such testimony. So our Saviour foretells concerning them,
   (John v. 43.) and so afterwards it came to pass, "I am come (saith he)
   in my Father's name, that is, have given sufficient evidence that he
   sent me, and "ye received me not; if another shall come in his own
   name, him will ye receive."--"In his own name," that is, without any
   miracles to prove that he comes from God.

   And to shew their horrible partiality yet more, after they had refused
   the clearest testimony that God could give of him, they were contented
   to accept of the disagreeing testimony of two witnesses against him,
   and upon that uncertain evidence to put him to death.

   And this hath been the temper of those that oppose the truth, in all
   ages, and in all kind of matters. Thus the church of Rome will needs
   understand those words of our Saviour, "This is my body," in the sense
   of transubstantiation, contrary to the plain intention of them, and in
   contradiction to the reason and senses of all mankind; and yet they
   will not understand the plain institution of the sacrament in both
   kinds. And thus the atheists, who will not believe that there is a God,
   who made the world, can yet swallow things ten times harder to be
   believed; as, that either the world was eternal of itself, or the
   matter of it; and that the parts of this matter, being in perpetual
   motion, did, after infinite trials and attempts, at last happen to
   settle in this order in which we now are; that is, that this admirable
   frame of the world, which hath all the characters upon it of deep
   wisdom and contrivance, was made merely by chance, and without
   direction and design of any intelligent author: so partial is
   infidelity, as to assent to the most absurd things, rather than believe
   the revelations of God, or to own those principles, which are naturally
   imprinted upon the minds of men, and have the general consent of man
   kind.

   II. Another usual concomitant of infidelity is, unreasonable and
   groundless prejudice. The Jews were strangely prejudiced against our
   Saviour, and that upon the weakest and slightest ground; as, that his
   original was known amongst them. (John vii. 27.) "Howbeit we know this
   man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is."
   Surely they were very ready to take exceptions against him, that would
   urge this for an objection; for what if his original were known, might
   he not be from God for all that? Moses was a great prophet, and yet it
   was very well known from whence he was; and it was no where said in the
   Old Testament that his original should be unknown; nay, on the
   contrary, it was plainly declared, that he was to be of the tribe of
   Judah, of the lineage of David, and to come out of Bethlehem.

   Another prejudice against him was the meanness of his parents, and of
   the manner of his education. (Matt. xiii. 54.) "Whence hath this man
   this wisdom, and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter's son?
   Is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and
   Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence
   then hath this man all these things? And they were offended in him."
   And so, likewise, (John vii. 15.) "How knoweth this man letters, having
   never learned?" A strange kind of unreasonable prejudice! They could
   not believe him to be an extraordinary person, because his parents and
   relations, his birth and manner of breeding, were so mean; because he
   had been brought up to a trade, and not bred up like one of their
   scribes and rabbies; as if God could not inspire a man with all those
   gifts, which men ordinarily acquire by study and pains: and as if it
   had not been reasonable to expect, that the Messias, who they believed
   was to be the greatest prophet that ever was, should be thus inspired.
   Now in all reason the argument is strong the other way that sure he was
   an extraordinary prophet, who all on a sudden gave such evidence of his
   great knowledge and wisdom, and did such mighty works; because this
   could not be imputed to his breeding and education, since that was so
   mean, and therefore there must be something extraordinary and divine in
   it; thus another man, who had been free from prejudice, would have been
   apt to reason.

   Another unreasonable prejudice was grounded upon a spiteful and
   malicious proverb, concerning the country where our Saviour was brought
   up, namely Galilee, (John i. 46.) "Can any good thing come out of
   Nazareth?" And, (John vii. 41.) "Shall Christ (that is, the Messias,)
   come out of Galilee?" And, (ver. 52.) "Search and look, for out of
   Galilee ariseth no prophet." Nathanael, indeed, who was a sincere good
   man, was easily wrought off from this prejudice, and was contented to
   be convinced of the contrary by plain evidence, when Philip desired him
   "to come and see." (John i. 46.) But the Jews it seems laid great
   weight upon it, as if this one thing had been enough to confute all our
   Saviour's miracles, and, after they had shot this bolt at him, the
   matter had been clearly concluded against him.

   But wise and unprejudiced men do not use to be swayed and carried away
   with ill-natured proverbs; nor do they believe the bad characters which
   are given of a country, to be universally true without exception, as if
   every country did not yield some brave spirits, and excellent persons,
   whatever the general temper and disposition of the inhabitants may be
   observed to be; or as if a man could not be an inspired prophet, unless
   he were bred in a good air; nor be sent by God, unless men approved the
   place from whence he came. The Boeotians among the Greeks were a heavy
   and dull people, even to a proverb; and yet Pindar, a great poet and
   wit, was born in that country. The Scythians were so barbarous, that
   one would have thought surely no good could come from thence; and yet
   they yielded Anacharsis, none of the meanest of the philosophers. The
   Idumeans were "aliens and strangers from the commonwealth of Israel;"
   and yet Job, one of the most excellent persons that ever lived, was
   born among them. God can bring forth eminent instruments out of any
   place and nation he pleases, "out of stones raise up children unto
   Abraham." Our conceits are no rule to him, nor does he govern the world
   by our foolish proverbs; "His ways are not as our ways, nor his
   thoughts as our thoughts."

   And thus some in our days have endeavoured to slur the Reformation, by
   calling it "the northern heresy;" as if the light of truth were at as
   great a distance from these northern parts, as that of the sun, and
   nothing but error and heresy could come thence; which is just such a
   conceit, and grounded upon as wise a reason, as that of the Donatists,
   who would needs have truth and the catholic church confined to Africa,
   because that was the southern part of the world, and because it is said
   in the Song of Solomon, concerning the church, "Tell me, O thou whom my
   soul loveth, where thou feedest, and where thou makest thy flocks to
   rest at noon."

   Another mighty prejudice against our Saviour we find mentioned John
   vii. 48. "Have any of the rulers or pharisees believed on him?" For
   this there seems to be some better colour than for the other; because
   the example of superiors and of persons thought to be more knowing, is
   considerable indeed in a doubtful case, and a good rule of action, when
   we have no better; but ought to be of no force to sway our judgment
   against clear and convincing evidence. Zedekiah and the princes of
   Judah would not hearken to Jeremiah: yet was he a true prophet for all
   that, though it was not their pleasure to think so. Sometimes there is
   a gross and palpable corruption in those who ought to be guides to
   others, and they have a visible interest in opposing and rejecting the
   truth. And this was the case of the pharisees and rulers among the Jews
   in our Saviour's time. Any one that had known them, and judged
   impartially concerning them, would rather have chosen to have followed
   any example than theirs. Religion may sometimes be in greatest danger,
   from those who ought to understand it best, and to be the greatest
   supports of it. So it was of old among the Jews, when the prophet
   complains, that "their leaders had caused them to err:" and so it hath
   been among Christians, in the great degeneracy of the Roman church;
   their popes and their general councils, as they call them, have been
   the great corrupters of Christianity, and seducers of Christendom;
   which made Luther to say, with truth and sharpness enough, Religio
   nunquam magis periclitatur quam inter reverendissimos; "Religion is
   never in greater danger than among the most reverend;" meaning the pope
   and the cardinals: when those who ought to teach and reform others, are
   guilty of the greatest errors and corruptions themselves.

   I will mention but one prejudice more, which we find John ix. 16, "This
   man (say the Jews concerning our Saviour) is not of God, because he
   keepeth not the sabbath-day." This indeed had been a considerable
   exception, if it had been true; and therefore our Saviour takes great
   care to vindicate himself from this aspersion; he shews, that the law
   of the sabbath did not oblige in all cases, and that, being a positive
   precept, it ought to give place to moral duties, which are of perpetual
   obligation, and therefore he bids them "go and learn what that meaneth,
   I will have mercy, and not sacrifice; and the plain meaning of that
   saying was, that when positive institutions interfere with any moral
   duty, they cease to oblige in that case; that the sabbath was designed
   for the ease and benefit of men, and not for their grievance and
   burden: and therefore, where the life of man is concerned, the law of
   the sabbath ceaseth; as in case of necessity, "David did eat of the
   show-bread, and was blameless," though by a positive law it was
   forbidden for any man to eat of it but the priests only. Lastly, from a
   general practice in a common case among themselves, it being allowed by
   their own law, to take an ox or an ass out of a pit on the sabbath-day;
   and therefore much more to heal one on the sabbath-day and "to loose a
   daughter of Abraham, that had been bound eighteen years," as our
   Saviour invincibly argues.

   Upon the like prejudice several churches and communions in the world
   will not allow others to be good Christians, and in a state of
   salvation, because they do not lay the same weight that they do upon
   positive institutions, not of Divine, but of mere ecclesiastical
   authority, in which they are more unreasonable than the Jews. [24] But
   I proceed to a

   III. Third concomitant of their infidelity, and this was, a childish
   kind of perverseness. Being strongly prejudiced against our Saviour,
   they were so peevish and froward, that nothing would satisfy them. And
   of this he himself gives us a remarkable instance; (Matt. xi. 16, 17.)
   "But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children
   sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, and saying, We
   have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you,
   and ye have not lamented." The business was this: the Jews found fault
   with John the Baptist, because his habit and conversation were so rough
   and severe; and yet our Saviour could not please them neither, who was
   of a quite different temper. "John the Baptist came in the way of
   righteousness, and they received him not;" his way was very strict and
   severe, "he came neither eating nor drinking," was very strict in his
   diet, and manner of living, of a coarse carriage and melancholy temper,
   and "they said he had a devil." He was to be a preacher of repentance,
   and his garb was suitable to his employment. Our Saviour was of a more
   easy and familiar and conversable temper, suitable to a preacher of
   pardon and forgiveness: "the Son of man came eating and drinking; and
   they said, Behold a wine-bibber and a glutton, a friend of publicans
   and sinners." Now what could be more childish and perverse than to be
   pleased with nothing? By this it plainly appeared, that whatever garb
   he had put on, whatever his carriage had been, they would have found
   fault with it, and have made some exception against it; at this rate it
   was impossible for him to escape the censure of men so perversely
   disposed; and therefore our Saviour fitly compares them to "children
   playing in the markets," who were neither pleased with mourning nor
   dancing.

   And this is the humour of infidelity, and of those who oppose the
   truth, to cavil and make exceptions at every thing, and to argue
   against religion and the principles of it, from contrary topics, and
   arguments that are inconsistent with one another.

   There are other instances of this perverseness in the Jews; as, that
   when they believed Moses, and had a mighty veneration for him, yet they
   would not believe him when he testified concerning the Messias. So
   likewise they looked upon John the Baptist as a prophet; but yet would
   give no credit to his testimony concerning Christ. Nay, so froward were
   they, that when our Saviour had wrought the greatest and plainest
   miracle that could be, in feeding five thousand persons with five
   loaves and two little fishes; yet, as if this had been nothing, they
   still call upon him to work a miracle; (John vi. 30.) "What sign
   workest thou, that we may see and believe?"

   IV. Another usual concomitant of infidelity, is obstinacy, and
   pertinacious persisting in error. This likewise was the temper of the
   Jews, not to be convinced by any evidence that could be offered to
   them. When our Saviour had several times put them to silence, so that
   they were not able to answer him, yet they obstinately persisted in
   their former conceit, and stiffly held the conclusion, though they were
   not able to make good the premises. (Matt. xxii.) Our Saviour confuted
   the Sadducees about the resurrection, and put them to silence; and then
   undertook the pharisees, and they could not answer him neither; both of
   them continued in their opinion, though each of them thought the other
   to be clearly baffled and confuted.

   This obstinacy of theirs our Saviour makes a great aggravation of their
   infidelity; (Matt. xxi. 31, 32.) "Verily, I say unto you, that the
   publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. For
   John came unto you by the way of righteousness, and ye believed him
   not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him. And ye, when ye
   had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him."

   Nay, which was the most unreasonable of all, when they could not answer
   his arguments, nor deny the miracles which he wrought, yet they were
   resolved not to believe on him, nor to suffer others to confess him.
   (John xi. 47, 48.) After he had wrought that great miracle, in raising
   Lazarus from the dead, after he had lain four days in the grave, they
   were so far from owning themselves convinced by it, that hereupon they
   took counsel to put him to death. So the text tells us, that "many of
   the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus had
   done (namely, the raising of Lazarus), believed on him: but some of
   them went their way to the pharisees, and told them what things Jesus
   had done." And now one would have thought, that either they should not
   have acknowledged this mighty miracle, or, if they had, that they
   should have been convinced by it that he was from God: but the miracle
   was so notorious, that they could not deny it; and they were so
   obstinately set against him, that they would not be convinced by it;
   they granted the premises, and yet denied the conclusion; (ver. 47.)
   "Then gathered the chief priests and pharisees a council, and said,
   What do we? for this man doeth many miracles; if we let him alone all
   men will believe on him." And it follows, (ver. 53.) "From that day
   forth they took counsel together to put him to death."

   And after he was risen from the dead, and those that bare witness to
   his resurrection had their testimony confirmed by miracles, yet the
   Jews continued in the same obstinacy, as if they were resolved to
   oppose the gospel in despite of all evidence that could be brought for
   it. So we find (Acts iv. 15, 16.) that when the rulers and scribes
   beheld the man whom the apostles had healed, standing by them, it is
   said, "They could say nothing against it." But when they had commanded
   them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, u
   saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable
   miracle hath been done by them, is manifest to all them that dwell in
   Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it: but, that it spread no farther among
   the people, let us straight) y threaten them, that they speak
   henceforth to no man in this name." What could be more unreasonable,
   than to own the miracle, and yet to reject the testimony?

   V. Another quality which accompanied this spirit of infidelity and
   opposition to the truth in the Jews, was want of patience to consider
   and examine what could be said for the truth; a hastiness to pronounce
   and pass sentence, before they had heard what could be said for it.
   Thus the pharisees, when they saw our Saviour cast out devils, they
   presently, without any farther consideration, pronounce, that he did it
   "by the prince of devils," (Matt. xii. 24.) Had they not been headily
   carried on by passion and prejudice, they would never have passed this
   rash sentence. Had they but had patience to have considered matters,
   they could not have believed, that the devil was confederate with
   Christ against himself, and the interest of his own kingdom.

   And as it was then, so it is at this day; many continue in unbelief and
   error, not because there is not evidence enough for the things proposed
   to their belief, but because they have not patience enough to consider
   what may be said for them. Nay, in the church of Rome, that they may
   retain their people in their communion, they strictly forbid all
   examination of their religion, or so much as to hear or read what can
   be said against it; because this is doubting, and doubting is next to
   infidelity, a mortal sin, and a temptation of the devil. There is but
   one season and nick of time, wherein they will allow any of the people
   to examine and inquire into matters of religion, and that is, when they
   would gain a man to their religion, and they allow it then only because
   they cannot help it. Some reasons they must offer to persuade men to be
   of their church; and when they offer them, they must allow them to
   consider them, and judge of the force of them, though they had much
   rather they would take their words for the strength and goodness of
   them; for they do what they can to hinder them from advising with those
   that will dispute the matter with them: or if they cannot prevent
   examination, yet they divert them as much as they can from any
   particular inquiry into their doctrines and practices; this they
   pretend is a tedious and endless course, and therefore they commonly
   direct them to a shorter way, which is, not to inquire first into the
   truth of their doctrines, and the goodness of their worship and
   practice; but first to find out the true church, and then learn of her
   what doctrines and practices are truly Christian; and by this means
   they get their religion swallowed whole, without any particular
   examination of their doctrines and practices, which will not bear the
   trial; and therefore, to make the work short, they take it for granted,
   that there is always a visible catholic church; that this church is
   infallible in all matters of faith; and that the Roman church is this
   visible infallible catholic church, because no other church pretends to
   be so; as indeed there is no reason why any particular church should
   pretend to be catholic, or universal; or, to speak plainer, why a part
   should pretend to be the whole: and all this being admitted, there is
   nothing more now to be done, but to receive all the doctrines which
   this church teacheth, without any further examination of them, be cause
   this church being supposed to be infallible, all that she says must be
   true, though it appears to be never so contrary to Scripture, or
   reason, or sense. But now, in this way of proceeding, there are two or
   three things which seem to be very odd:--

   1. That men must take their religion in a lump, and not be allowed to
   examine the particular doctrines and practices of it: which is to say,
   they have an excellent religion, but men must by no means examine it,
   nor look into it. This looks so suspiciously, that a wise man, for this
   very reason, if there were no other, would reject it, because they are
   so afraid to bring it to a trial.

   2. It seems likewise very strange, that when they go to make
   proselytes, they should take so many things which are in question and
   controversy between us, for granted; as, that the church in every age
   is infallible, and that the church of Rome is the infallible and
   catholic church. They meet indeed sometimes with some easy and willing
   converts, that will meet them thus far; that is, more than half way:
   but what if a man will not take all this for granted, but will put them
   to the proof of it? Why then he is not so civil as they hoped and
   expected; and commonly they give over tempting him, or at least depart
   from him for a season, until they can find him in a more pliable
   temper; for it is a long work, and requires a great deal of time, to
   prove some things, especially to the dull capacity of a northern
   heretic: besides that, some things are stubborn, and will not be
   proved, though never so much pains be taken to do it; and so are the
   propositions now mentioned, towards the proof where of I never saw any
   argument offered, that is within distance, or indeed within sight, of
   the conclusion. And then,

   3. It seems a very strange method of coming to know what the true
   doctrines of Christianity are, by first knowing which is the true
   church: for it is not the church which makes the doctrines of
   Christianity to be true, but the profession of the true Christian
   doctrine which makes the true church; and therefore we must first know
   which are the true doctrines of Christianity, the profession whereof
   makes the true church, before we can possibly know which is the true
   church; but which are the true doctrines of Christianity is not to be
   known but by a particular examination of them, and comparing them with
   the rule of the Christian faith, "the word of God." But they that have
   a mind to delude men, and keep them in error, must never admit their
   religion to be tried by this rule. But to proceed.

   VI. Another quality which accompanies infidelity and opposition to the
   truth, is rudeness and boisterousness, falling into uncivil terms and
   reproachful names. Such was the carriage of the Jews towards our
   Saviour; when they were not able to reason with him, they fell to
   railing at him, (John viii. 48.) When he argued against their
   infidelity in the calmest manner, and, by the strongest and clear est
   arguments, endeavoured to convince them of the unreasonableness of it:
   "Which of you (saith he) convinceth me of sin? And if I speak the
   truth, why do you not believe? He that is of God, heareth God's words;
   ye, therefore, hear them not, be cause ye are not of God. Then answered
   the Jews, Say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a
   devil?" They presently call him heretic; for so the Jews esteemed the
   Samaritans.

   VII. Another quality near akin to this, is fury and outrageous passion.
   (John vii. 23.) The Jews were in a great passion against our Saviour,
   for healing on the sabbath-day. When the apostles wrought miracles, it
   is said, that "the high priest, and they that were with him, were
   filled with indignation." And when St. Stephen preached to them, it is
   said, "They gnashed on him with their teeth." And St. Paul acknowledged
   of himself, while he opposed the truth of Christianity, he was "mad
   against all that were of that way."

   VIII. And lastly, to mention no more, infidelity and opposition to the
   truth, is usually attended with bloody and inhuman persecution; a
   certain argument of a weak cause, and which wants better means of
   conviction. Thus the Jews treated our Saviour; when they could not deal
   with him by reason, they persecuted him, and "sought to kill him."
   (John v. 16. and chap. viii. 59.) When our Saviour had answered all
   their objections, and they had nothing to reply unto him, "they took up
   stones to cast at him;" a sign their reasons were spent, and that their
   arguments were at an end. Thus infidelity and error betrays its own
   weakness, and want of reason on its side, by making use of such brutish
   and unreasonable weapons in its own defence. Our blessed Saviour and
   his apostles never thought of propagating their religion by these
   inhuman and barbarous ways. These methods are proper to the destroyer,
   but not to the Lamb of God, and Saviour of men. "The Son of man came
   not to destroy men's lives, but to save them;" to do good to the
   bodies, and to the souls of men; and not to destroy their bodies, no,
   not in order to the saving of their souls. All the means that he or his
   apostles used, were teaching and persuading, and that with great
   meekness: "Learn of me, for I am meek," saith our Lord: and the
   apostles every where command the teachers of this religion, "to shew
   all gentleness to all men," and "in meekness to instruct those that
   oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the
   acknowledgment of the truth." They did not go about to convert men by
   armed force, and ways of violence and cruelty. It is a sign that reason
   runs very low with that religion, which hath no better arguments to
   persuade men to it, than dragoons and the galleys; these are carnal,
   and therefore not Christian weapons. So St. Paul tells us, "The weapons
   of our warfare are not carnal," and yet they were "mighty through God,
   to subdue" a great part of the world to the belief and obedience of the
   Christian religion. Thus I have done with the fourth particular in the
   text--the unreasonableness of infidelity and opposition to the truth.
   The two remaining ones I shall dispatch in a few words.

   Fifthly, therefore, I observed the true reason and account of men's
   opposition to the truth, and rejection of it; "Men loved darkness
   rather than light, because their deeds were evil." And, indeed darkness
   is more suitable to a wicked and vicious life, because the deformity of
   it is not so easily discovered as in the light; this makes the evil of
   men's actions more manifest, and their faults more inexcusable. Men may
   pretend other reasons for their infidelity and opposition of the truth,
   and may seem to argue against the principles of religion in good
   earnest, and against the reasonableness and truth of Christianity, from
   a real contrary persuasion: but no man that hath these things fairly
   proposed to him, and with all the advantages they are capable of, and
   hath the patience to consider the true nature and design of the
   Christian doctrine, but must acknowledge it, not only to be the most
   reasonable, but the most Divine, most likely to come from God, and to
   make men like God, of any religion that ever yet appeared in the world.
   If any man reject it, it is not because he hath good and sufficient
   reasons against it; but because he is swayed by some unreasonable
   prejudice and passion, or biassed by some lust or interest, which he is
   strongly addicted to, and loath to part with, and yet he must part with
   it, if he entertain this religion, and submit himself to the terms and
   rules of it. This is that which commonly lies at the bottom of
   infidelity, and is the true reason of their opposition to the
   truth--that "their deeds are evil." And it is natural for every man to
   defend himself, and justify his doings, as well as he can; and if
   religion be clearly against him, to set himself with all the despite
   and malice he can against religion; and to hate, and with all his might
   to oppose, that which contradicts that course which he is in love with,
   and is resolved to continue in: for, as our Saviour reasons in a like
   case, "No man can serve two masters; but either he will hate the one,
   and love the other; or he will cleave to the one, and quit the other."
   Men cannot entertain the truth, and retain their lusts; and, therefore,
   as our Saviour tells us immediately after the text, "Every one that
   doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh he to the light, lest his
   deeds should be reproved." The light of truth is as grievous to a bad
   man, as the light of the sun is to sore eyes: because it lays open and
   discovers the faults and vices of men, and if they entertain it, will
   urge them, and put them upon a necessity of reforming their wicked
   lives; and because they have no mind to this, therefore they resist the
   light, and endeavour to keep it out. The vices and lusts of men are so
   many diseases; and men naturally loath physic, and put it off as long
   as they can: and this makes many inconsiderate and wilful men to favour
   their disease, and take part with it against all counsel and advice;
   and when the great Physician of souls comes and offers them a remedy,
   they slight and reject him, and will rather perish than follow his
   prescriptions.

   And this was the true reason why the Jews rejected the gospel: they
   were vicious in their lives, and loath to undergo the severity of a
   cure; they were not willing to be saved by so sharp and unpleasant a
   remedy. And this is still the true reason at this day, of men's enmity
   and opposition to religion, because it declares against their evil
   deeds, and proclaims open war against those vices and lusts which they
   love, and are resolved to live in; so that they have no other way to
   justify themselves and their actions, but by condemning and rejecting
   that which reproves and finds fault with them.

   And here I might shew more particularly, that there are two accounts to
   be given why bad men are so apt to resist and reject the Divine truth,
   even when it is revealed and proposed to them in the fairest manner,
   and with the clearest evidence.

   1. Because their minds are not so rightly prepared and disposed for the
   receiving of Divine truth. And,

   2. Because they have an interest against it, their designs and deeds
   are evil, they have some worldly interest to carry on, or they are in
   love with some vice or lust which they cannot reconcile with the truths
   of God and religion. But this I have done at large elsewhere. [25] I
   proceed, therefore, to the

   Sixth and last particular in the text, namely, The great guilt of those
   who reject the doctrine of the gospel. By this very act of theirs they
   are condemned, nay, they condemn themselves; because they reject the
   only means of their salvation. "This is the condemnation," this very
   thing argues the height of their folly and guilt, that "when light is
   come," they prefer darkness before it. If any thing will condemn men,
   this will; and if any thing will aggravate their condemnation, and make
   it above measure heavy and intolerable, this will. If it were in a
   doubtful matter that men made so ill and foolish a choice, the thing
   would admit of some excuse: but the dispute is between light and
   darkness. If the Christian religion had not so plainly the advantage of
   any other institution that ever was; if that holiness which the gospel
   commands, and that happiness which it promiseth, were not infinitely to
   be preferred before the ways of sin and death, the unbeliever and the
   disobedient might have something to say for themselves; but the case is
   plainly other wise: so that whoever, having the Christian religion
   fairly and fully proposed to him, doth not believe it; or, professing
   to believe it, doth not live according to it, "hath no cloak for his
   sin;" neither the one for his infidelity, nor the other for his
   disobedience: and if any thing will aggravate the condemnation of men,
   this will; for the greater light men sin against, the greater is their
   guilt; and the greater any man's guilt is, the heavier will be his
   doom. The heathen world, that lived for many ages in "darkness and the
   shadow of death," shall be condemned for sinning against that imperfect
   knowledge of their duty, which they had from the glimmering of natural
   light; but they shall be "beaten with few stripes," their punishment
   shall be gentle in comparison; but what punishment can be severe enough
   for those obstinate infidels that reject the light, and prefer darkness
   before it? for those impudent offenders, who admit the light of the
   gospel, and yet rebel against it; who do the works of darkness in the
   midst of this light, at noon-day, and in the face of the sun? This
   consideration the Scripture frequently urgeth upon those who enjoy the
   light of the gospel. "I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for
   Tyre and Sidon, for Sodom and Gomorrah, (the very worst and wickedest
   of the heathens) than for you." "How shall we escape, if we neglect so
   great salvation?" If either we reject the knowledge of the truth, or
   sin wilfully after we have received it, (that is, apostatize either to
   infidelity or impiety of life) there remains no more sacrifice for sin,
   nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, to
   consume the adversary, that is, such implacable enemies of God and his
   truth; in so doing, we resist and reject our last remedy; and after God
   hath sent and sacrificed his only Son for our salvation, we cannot in
   reason think there remains any more sacrifice for sin.--I have gone
   over the several particulars in the text: I shall only make two or
   three inferences.

   First, If the great design of the Son of God was to enlighten the world
   with the knowledge of Divine truth, what shall we think of those, who
   make it their great endeavour to stifle and suppress this light, and to
   hinder the free communication of it? who conceal the word of life from
   the people, and lock up the knowledge of salvation, contained in the
   Holy Scriptures, in an unknown tongue?

   Secondly, Having represented the unreasonableness of infidelity, and
   the evil concomitants of it in the Jews, "Let us take heed lest there
   be in any of us an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living
   God, and lest any of us fall after the same example of infidelity." Let
   us not reject the principles of religion, because they are inconsistent
   with our practices, but let us rather endeavour to reconcile our lives
   to the rules of religion, and resolve to reform those faults which
   religion reproves, and which the reason of our own minds, if we would
   at tend to it, reproves as much as religion; a clear evidence that we
   are in the wrong, and religion in the right, because it hath the best
   and soberest reason of mankind on its side.

   Let us then, with all readiness of mind, entertain that light which God
   hath afforded to us, to conduct us and shew us the way to happiness,
   whether by the principles of natural religion, or by the revelation of
   the gospel in its primitive purity and lustre, and not as it hath been
   muffled and disguised by the ignorance and superstition which prevailed
   in after-ages, till the light of the Reformation sprang out, and
   restored a new day to us, and "called us again out of darkness into a
   marvellous light," which, by the blessing of God, we have now enjoyed
   for many years, and which we cannot go about to quench, without
   incurring the condemnation in the text.

   Thirdly, and lastly, Let us take heed of practical infidelity, of
   opposing and contradicting the Christian religion by our wicked lives
   and actions. Though we profess to believe the gospel, yet if our "deeds
   be evil," we do in effect and by interpretation reject it, and "love
   darkness rather than light;" though we assent to the truth of it, yet
   we "withhold it in unrighteousness," we resist the virtue and efficacy
   of it, and do oppose and blaspheme it by our lives; nay, we do as much
   as in us lies to make others atheists, by exposing religion to the
   contempt and scorn of such persons, and by opening their mouths against
   it; as either not containing the laws of a good life, or as destitute
   of power and efficacy to persuade men to the obedience of those laws.
   Where (will they say) is this excellent religion, so much boasted of?
   how does it appear? Look into the lives of Christians, and there you
   will best see the admirable effects of this doctrine, the mighty force
   of this institution! And what a shameful reproach is this to us! What a
   scandal and disparagement to our holy religion, to see some of the
   worst of men wearing the badge and livery of the best religion and
   institution that ever was in the world!

   I shall conclude all with the words of the apostle, (Phil. i. 27.)
   "Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ;"
   and "stand fast with one spirit, with one mind, striving together for
   the faith of the gospel."
