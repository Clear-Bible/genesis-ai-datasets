   Adams, Sarah Flower, was born at Harlow, England, February 22, 1805;
   and died in London August 21, 1848. Sarah Flower was the younger
   daughter of Benjamin Flower, editor and proprietor of the Cambridge
   Intelligencer. In 1834 she married John Brydges Adams, a civil engineer
   and inventor. She is represented by her friends as being beautiful,
   intelligent, and high-minded. Mrs. Adams had a gift for lyric poetry,
   and wrote thirteen hymns for her pastor, the Rev. William Johnson Fox,
   an Independent minister. These were all published in Hymns and Anthems,
   London, 1841. Several of these hymns have come into common use, but her
   masterpiece is the one found in this book:

   Nearer, my God, to thee 315

   Addison, Joseph, whose fame is coextensive with English literature, was
   the son of Rev. Lancelot Addison, Dean of Lichfield, England, and was
   born May 1, 1672. He was educated at Oxford, and early developed poetic
   talent. His literary contributions were made chiefly to the Tattler,
   the Guardian and the Spectator. He is the author of five hymns, all of
   which appeared in the Spectator in 1712. It has been claimed that
   Andrew Marvell is the author of two of these hymns ("The spacious
   firmament on high" and "When all thy mercies, O my God"), but this
   claim is not justified by the historical facts, which are too lengthy
   to present here. Addison died June 17, 1719, being a devout and
   consistent member of the Church of England. His last effort at writing
   was on an article upon the Christian Religion. At the time of his death
   he was contemplating a poetic version of the Psalms. "The piety of
   Addison," says Macaulay, "was in truth of a singularly cheerful kind.
   The feeling which predominates in all his devotional writings is
   gratitude; and on that goodness to which he ascribed all the happiness
   of his life he relied in the hour of death with a love which casteth
   out fear." The three hymns by Addison are among the finest in this
   collection:

   How are thy servants blest, O Lord 102
   The spacious firmament on high     84
   When all thy mercies, O my God     105

   Alexander, Cecil Frances, daughter of Maj. John Humphreys, was born in
   Ireland in 1823. In 1850 she married the Rt. Rev. William Alexander,
   Bishop of Derry. She wrote "The Burial of Moses," and was the author of
   several books of poetry. Among them were: Verses for Holy Seasons,
   1846; Hymns for Little Children, 1848; Hymns Descriptive and
   Devotional, 1858; and The Legend of the Golden Prayers, 1859. She was
   the author of many hymns, several of which have been widely used, as,
   for example, "There is a green hill far away." She died at Londonderry
   October 12, 1895.

   Jesus calls us o'er the tumult 545

   Alexander, James Waddell, an eminent clergyman of the Presbyterian
   Church and the son of a no less distinguished divine (Rev. Archibald
   Alexander, D.D.), was born at Hopewell, Va., March 13, 1804. After
   graduating at Princeton College, he entered the ministry and was a
   pastor in Charlotte County; Va., and later in Trenton, N. J. He then
   became a professor in Princeton College, and in 1844 a pastor in New
   York City. In 1849 he returned to Princeton, becoming a professor in
   the Theological Seminary, which position he resigned at the end of
   three years, his heart yearning to get back into the regular work of
   the ministry. He now became pastor of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian
   Church, in New York City. He died July 31, 1859. Dr. Alexander's only
   hymn in this collection is a translation:

   O sacred Head, now wounded 151

   Alford, Henry, widely known as the author of The Greek Testament with
   Notes and other volumes, was born in London October 7, 1810; was pious
   from his youth, and in his sixteenth year wrote the following
   dedication in his Bible: "I do this day, in the presence of God and my
   own soul, renew my covenant with God, and solemnly determine henceforth
   to become his and to do his work as far as in me lies." He was educated
   at Trinity College, Cambridge, ordained in 1833, and soon made a
   reputation as an eloquent preacher and sound biblical critic. He was
   appointed Dean of Canterbury in 1857, which distinction he held to the
   day of his death, in 1871. Dean Alford's Poetical Works (two volumes)
   were published in London in 1845. An American edition was published in
   Boston in 1853. He was the editor of The Year of Praise, a hymn and
   tune book intended primarily for use in Canterbury Cathedral, 1867.
   Four of his hymns appear in this collection:

   Come, ye thankful people, come  717
   Forward be our watchword        284
   My bark is wafted to the strand 451
   Ten thousand times ten thousand 618

   Amis, Lewis Randolph, a Southern Methodist minister, was born in Maury
   County, Tenn., December 7, 1856; graduated at Vanderbilt University in
   1878, and that same year joined the Tennessee Conference of the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, South, as an itinerant preacher. He filled
   many important appointments, being pastor at Pulaski, Tenn., when he
   died, in 1904. A useful and greatly beloved minister.

   Jehovah, God, who dwelt of old 665

   Andrew of Crete, so called because he was bishop of the island of
   Crete, was born in Damascus in 660. He died about 732. He was deputed
   by Theodore, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to attend the sixth General
   Council at Constantinople (680). He was also a member of the
   Pseudo-Synod of Constantinople, held in 712, which revived the
   Monothelite heresy. Afterwards he returned to the faith of the Church.
   Seventeen of his homilies remain to us. His most ambitious poem is
   called "The Great Canon." it contains more than three hundred stanzas,
   yet it is sung right through on Thursday of mid-lent week in the Greek
   Church.

   Christian, dost thou see them 616

   Anstice, Joseph, was born in Shropshire, England, in 1808. Soon after
   leaving Oxford University, where he took a high stand as a student, he
   became Professor of Classical Literature in King's College, London. He
   was a member of the Church of England. He died February 29, 1836, being
   twenty-eight years old. It was during the last evenings of his life,
   when he was a great sufferer, that he dictated to his wife the hymns
   (fifty-two in number) which were collected and published the year he
   died for private distribution. From this collection the following hymn
   was taken:

   Lord, how happy should we be 519

   Auber, Harriet, was born October 4, 1773; and died January 20, 1862.
   She led a quiet and contented life, writing much, but publishing only
   one volume. The full title of this book was: The Spirit of the Psalms;
   A Compressed Version of Select Portions of the Psalms of David. It was
   published anonymously in 1829. It is not entirely original; some pieces
   were selected from well-known writers. This book is sometimes
   confounded with The Spirit of the Psalms, by the [25]Rev. H. F. Lyte,
   but it is entirely different. The author became known through the Rev.
   Henry Auber Harvey. In a note to Daniel Sedgwick, dated November 25,
   1862, he wrote: "The Spirit of the Psalms was partly a compilation and
   partly the composition of the late Miss Harriet Auber, an aunt of my
   mother's; and the preface to the book was drawn up by the editor, my
   late father, Mr. Harvey, a canon of Bristol." [26]Julian, in the
   Dictionary of Hymnology, gives the first lines of twenty-five of Miss
   Auber's hymns which he says are in common use. This Hymnal contains
   only three:

   Hasten, Lord, the glorious time     637
   Our blest Redeemer, ere he breathed 189
   With joy we hail the sacred day     65

   Babcock, Maltbie Davenport, an American Presbyterian clergyman, was
   born in Syracuse, N. Y., August 3, 1858; and died at Naples, Italy, May
   18, 1901. He was graduated at Syracuse University in 1879, and Auburn
   Theological Seminary in 1883. He filled most successful and popular
   pastorates at Lockport, N. Y., Baltimore, Md., and at the Brick
   Presbyterian Church, in New York. While on a visit to the Levant in
   1901 he was seized with the Mediterranean fever, and died under
   pathetic circumstances in the International Hospital, at Naples. He was
   a man of extraordinary personality and influence both in the social
   circle and in the pulpit. A volume of his prose and verse, edited by
   his wife, appeared soon after his death, entitled Thoughts for
   Every-Day Living, 1901. Dr. Babcock's writings show strength, delicacy
   of thought, and great originality.

   Baker, Sir Henry Williams, an eminent English clergyman, son of Sir
   Henry L. Baker, born in London May 27, 1821; educated at Trinity
   College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1844. He took holy
   orders in 1844, and became vicar of Monkland, Herefordshire, in 1851,
   which benefice he held until his death. He succeeded to the baronetcy
   in 1851. He is best known as editor in chief of Hymns Ancient and
   Modern, to which he contributed several of his hymns. Dr. Julian says:
   "Of his hymns four only are in the highest strain of jubilation,
   another four are bright and cheerful, and the remainder are very tender
   but exceedingly plaintive, sometimes even to sadness." The language of
   his hymns is smooth and simple, the thought is correct and sometimes
   very beautifully expressed. He died February 12, 1877. His last audible
   words were a quotation of the third stanza of his own exquisite
   rendering of the twenty-third Psalm, No. 136 in this book:


   Perverse and foolish, oft I strayed

   But yet in love He sought me,

   And on His shoulder gently laid,

   And home rejoicing brought me.

   O God of love, O King of Peace  705
   O perfect life of love          155
   The King of love my Shepherd is 136

   Bakewell, John, a Wesleyan lay preacher, was born at Brailsford, in
   Derbyshire, in 1721. He was a man of piety, earnestness, and
   consecration. He was made a lay preacher in 1749, and proved to be one
   of [27]Mr. Wesley's most efficient workers. He was for several years
   Master of the Greenwich Royal Park Academy. It was in his house that
   [28]Thomas Olivers wrote his justly famous and much-admired hymn, "The
   God of Abraham praise." He was an eminently useful man, and lived to a
   ripe old age, being ninety-eight years old when he died, in 1819. He
   was buried in City Road Chapel not far from the tomb of John Wesley.
   The epitaph upon his tombstone states that "he adorned the doctrines of
   God our Saviour eighty years, and preached his glorious gospel about
   seventy years." He composed many hymns "which remain in the manuscript
   beautifully written," but only one finds a place in modern Church
   hymnals:

   Hail, thou once despised Jesus 171

   Barbauld, Anna Letitia, was a daughter of the Rev. John Aikin, D.D., an
   English Dissenting minister. She was born June 20, 1743, and early in
   life gave evidence of poetic talent. She had a great desire for a
   classical education, to which her father strongly objected. At length
   she prevailed in some measure, and was permitted to read Latin and
   Greek. She published her first volume of poems in 1773. In 1774 she
   married the Rev. Rochemont Barbauld, a young man of French descent, who
   attended a school at Warrington, where her father was a classical
   Instructor. Mr. Barbauld had charge of a Dissenting congregation at
   Palgrave. They also opened a boarding school, which they carried on
   successfully for eleven years. Mr. Barbauld afterwards held other
   pastoral relations, and died in 1808. Mrs. Barbauld occupied her time
   and mind in literary pursuits, editing various works and contributing
   to the press. She died March 9, 1825.

   Barber, Mary Ann Serrett, was an Englishwoman, the daughter of Thomas
   Barber. She wrote many poems for the Church of England Magazine, and
   was the author of several books. One of these, Bread Winning; or, The
   Ledger and the Lute, an Autobiography, by M. A. S. Barber, was
   published in 1865. Miss Barber died in Brighton, England, March 9,
   1864, at the age of sixty-three years.

   Baring-Gould, Sabine, an English clergyman, was born in Exeter,
   England, January 28, 1834. He was educated at Clare College, Cambridge,
   receiving the degrees of B.A., 1854, and M.A., 1856. He took orders in
   1864. His prose works are numerous and well known: Lives of the Saints,
   in fifteen volumes, 1872-77; Curious Myths of the Middle Ages, in two
   series, 1866-68; The Origin and Development of Religious Belief, two
   volumes, 1869-70. He is the author of a number of fine hymns, the
   best-known of which is "Onward, Christian soldiers." He published a
   volume of original Church Songs in 1884. From 1854 to 1906 he had
   published eighty-five volumes. His present address is Lew-Trenchard
   House, North Devon.

   Barton, Bernard, widely known as the "Quaker Poet," was born in London
   January 31, 1784, and was educated at a Quaker school at Ipswich. In
   1810 he was employed at a local bank at Woodbridge, Suffolk, where he
   remained forty years. He was the author of eight or ten small volumes
   of verse between 1812 and 1845. From these books some twenty pieces
   have come into common use as hymns. He died at Woodbridge in 1849. His
   daughter published his Poems and Letters, 1849, after his death. His
   writings show a familiarity with the Scriptures and a love for good
   men. "Light" is the keynote to each of his three hymns found in this
   volume:

   Lamp of our feet, whereby we trace 205
   Walk in the light, so shalt thou   361
   We journey through a vale of tears 447

   Bateman, Henry, an English layman and successful business man, was born
   March 6, 1802; and died in 1872. He was much interested in literary and
   religious work. He was the author of several volumes of verse, the most
   successful of which was Sunday Sunshine: New Hymns and Poems for the
   Young, 1858. From this book some forty hymns have come into common use.

   Light of the world! whose kind 505

   Bathurst, William Hiley, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born
   at Cleve Dale, ar Bristol, England, August 28, 1796. He was the son of
   Charles Bragge, who was member of Parliament for Bristol, and who, upon
   inheriting his uncle's estate, assumed his name, Bathurst. He graduated
   at Christ Church College, Oxford, and was ordained a priest of the
   Church of England in 1819. The following year he became rector of
   Barwick-in-Elmet, Yorkshire, where he mained thirty-two years. His
   biographer, speaking of these years of ministerial service, says:
   "Faithfully devoting himself to the spiritual welfare of his
   parishioners, he greatly endeared himself to them all by his eminent
   piety, his great simplicity of character, his tender love, and his
   abundant generosity." In 1852 he resigned his living and retired to
   private life because of conscientious scruples in relation to parts of
   the baptismal and burial services of the Church. In 1863, upon the
   death of his older brother, he succeeded to the family estate of Sidney
   Park, Gloucestershire, where he died November 25, 1877. His published
   works are: Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Use, 1831 (which
   volume contains 132 psalms and 206 hymns from his pen); The Georgics of
   Virgil, 1849; Metrical Musings; or, Thoughts on Sacred Subjects in
   Verse, 1849.

   Baxter, Lydia, the writer of "There is a gate that stands ajar" and
   other popular hymns, was born in Petersburg, N. Y., September 2, 1809.
   She was converted early in life, and united with the Baptist Church.
   Later in life she resided in New York City. She was an invalid for many
   years, but a patient and cheerful sufferer. She died June 22, 1874. A
   volume of her poems, titled Gems by the Wayside, was published in 1855.

   Take the name of Jesus with you 508

   Baxter, Richard, an eminent Puritan divine and voluminous author of the
   seventeenth century, is best known to Christians of the present day by
   his Call to the Unconverted and his Saint's Everlasting Rest. When
   about twenty-five years of age he entered the ministry, and was
   appointed to the parish of Kidderminster (1640). Here he remained until
   "for conscience' sake" he, along with many other Nonconformist divines,
   was driven out from his weeping flock by the "Act of Uniformity" passed
   in 1662. He now ceased to preach; but being caught holding family
   prayers "with more than four persons," he was, under the conditions of
   the "Conventicle Act" (1564), arrested and imprisoned for six months.
   He lived in retirement until 1672, when the "Act of Indulgence" gave
   him liberty to preach and to publish. But in 1685 the infamous Jeffries
   had him arrested and shamefully convicted of sedition, the foundation
   for the charge being found in his Paraphrase of the New Testament, for
   which he was imprisoned two years. He endured this unjust and cruel
   imprisonment with Christian patience and resignation, which finds
   illustration in the hymn below. His pastorate of twenty-two years at
   Kidderminster was faithful and untiring in the ministry of the Word,
   and was followed by rich spiritual fruits in the improved lives and
   characters of his six hundred parishioners. He exemplified his own
   couplet:


   I preached as though I ne'er should preach again,

   And as a dying man to dying men.

   In few hymns are the faith and fidelity of the author more truly
   expressed than in this hymn by Baxter.

   Lord, it belongs not to my care 470

   Beddome, Benjamin, an English Baptist minister, was born in
   Warwickshire January 23, 1717. He was apprenticed to an apothecary in
   Bristol; but when he was twenty years of age he was converted, and soon
   after began to prepare for the ministry. In 1743 he was ordained and
   became the pastor of a small Baptist Church at Bourton. Later he
   received an urgent call to a Church in London; but he refused the call
   and remained at Bourton fifty-two years--until his death, September 3,
   1795. It was a frequent custom with him to write a hymn to be sung
   after his morning sermon. A number of these hymns were published in
   Rippon's Selection, 1787, and so came into common use. A volume of his
   hymns, over eight hundred in number, was Published in 1818. [29]James
   Montgomery, in the preface to his Christian Psalmist, quotes the first
   stanza of one of Beddome's hymns as follows,


   Let party names no more

   The Christian world o'erspread;

   Gentile and Jew, and bond and free

   Are one in Christ their head.

   and makes this just remark: "His name would deserve to be held in
   everlasting remembrance if he had left no other memorial of the
   excellent spirit which was in him than these few humble verses."
   Beddome's hymns have been more highly appreciated in America than in
   his native country. The honorary degree of Master of Arts was conferred
   upon him in 1770 by Rhode Island College, now Brown University.

   Bernard of Clairvaux, an eminent monk, theologian, scholar, preacher,
   and poet, was born at Fontaine, near Dijon, in Burgundy, France, in
   1091. Aletta, his mother, was a devotedly pious woman, and consecrated
   her son to God from his birth. "Her death chamber was his spiritual
   birthplace." He was educated at Paris. Being naturally fond of
   seclusion, meditation, and study, and living in the twelfth century, it
   is not surprising that one so piously inclined as he soon sought a home
   in the cloister. At twenty-two years of age he entered the small
   monastery of Citeaux, and later he founded and made famous that of
   Clairvaux, where by fasting and self-mortification he became an
   emaciated monk, but with it all one of the most conspicuous and
   influential characters in Europe. Kings and popes sought his advice.
   His enthusiasm and impassioned eloquence were all but irresistible. He
   died August 20, 1153. His life was pure, his faith strong, his love
   ardent, his courage inflinching, his piety unquestioned. Luther greatly
   admired him and thought him "the greatest monk that ever lived." His
   published works are in five folio volumes. His Sacred Songs of Praise
   have long been the admiration of the Church. Christ crucified was the
   theme of his preaching and of his song, as the four hymns here given
   will testify. His love for Christ amounted to a deep and ardent passion
   that was unconscious of using terms of endearment not altogether
   becoming to so divine a theme.

   Jesus, the very thought of thee  533

   Bernard of Cluny was a monk of the twelfth century; the exact dates of
   his birth and death are not known. His parents were English, but he was
   born at Morlaix, France. He was an inmate of the Abbey of Cluny, and
   dedicated his famous poem to Peter the Venerable, Abbot of Cluny from
   1122 to 1156. His long poem, about three thousand lines, was a satire
   against the vices and follies of his time. [30]Dr. Neale, who gives a
   translation of four hundred lines in the third edition of his Mediaeval
   Hymns, 1868, says of this poem: "The greater part is a bitter satire on
   the fearful corruptions of the age. But, as a contrast to the misery
   and pollution of earth, the poem opens with a description of the peace
   and glory of heaven of such rare beauty as not easily to be matched by
   any mediaeval composition on the same subject." It is this part of the
   poem that Dr. Neale translated and from which our hymns are taken.

   Berridge, John, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born in
   Nottinghamshire March 1, 1716. He became Vicar of Everton in 1755, and
   remained there until his death, January 22, 1793. His preaching was at
   first sadly lacking in spirituality; but being happily converted, he
   became one of the most earnest of the evangelical clergymen who
   sympathized with and aided the Methodist revival. Frequent allusions to
   him are found in the writings of [31]John Wesley, who esteemed him
   highly and found in him a helpful coworker. He was never married. In
   1785 he published a volume of hymns titled Zion's Songs. His "wedding
   hymn," a prayer in song for the divine blessing on the bridal couple,
   is the only one of his three hundred and forty-two hymns that finds a
   place in this collection:

   Bethune, George Washington, an eminent divine of the Reformed Dutch
   Church, was born in New York March 18, 1805. He was graduated at
   Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa., in 1823, and studied theology at
   Princeton, N. J. In 1827 he became pastor of a Reformed Dutch Church at
   Rhinebeck, N. Y.; in 1830, at Utica, N. Y.; in 1834 he passed to
   Philadelphia, and in 1850 to Brooklyn, N. Y. In 1861 he went abroad for
   his health. He died at Florence, Italy, April 27, 1862, suddenly after
   preaching. Dr. Bethune wrote occasional hymns and poems for more than
   thirty years. One of his first compositions was a sailor's hymn
   beginning, "Tossed upon life's raging billow," which appeared in The
   Christian Lyre, 1830. A collection of his poems, Lays of Love and
   Faith, was published in Philadelphia in 1847.

   Bickersteth, Edward Henry, a bishop of the church of England, son of
   Edward Bickersteth, rector of Walton, was born at Islington, England,
   January 25, 1825. He was graduated at Cambridge University B.A. 1847,
   M.A. 1850). Taking holy orders in the Church of England in 1848, he
   became curate first at Banningham, Norfolk, and then at Tunbridge
   Wells; and in 1852 became rector of Hinton-Martell and vicar of Christ
   Church, Hampstead in 1855. He became Dean of Gloucester in 1885, and
   that same year he was appointed Bishop of Exeter. Beginning with a
   volume of Poems in 1849, he published successively no less than twelve
   volumes, the most widely known being his extended poem titled
   Yesterday, To-Day, and Forever, 1867, and The Spirit of Life, 1868. He
   edited and published in 1858 a volume titled Psalms and Hymns. His
   Hymnal Companion first edition 1870, last edition 1890) called forth
   from [32]Dr. Julian, editor of the Dictionary of Hymnology, these high
   words of praise: "Of its kind and from its theological standpoint, as
   an evangelical hymn book, it is in poetic grace, literary excellence,
   and lyric beauty, the finest collection in the Anglican Church;" and
   the author's contributions to this volume are pronounced "very
   beautiful and of much value." He retired from active work in 1900, and
   died May 16, 1906. Four of his hymns are in this collection:

   O God, the Rock of Ages            18

   Blacklock, Thomas, was born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, November 10,
   1721. He lost his sight by smallpox when an infant, but was
   nevertheless well educated and ordained a minister in 1762. Two years
   later he retired to Edinburgh and spent his time in teaching and
   authorship. An edition of his poems, which are characterized by elegant
   mediocrity, was published in 1793. He died July 7, 1791.

   Bode, John Ernest, a clergyman in the Church of England, was born in
   1816. He was educated at Eton and at Oxford, graduating at Christ's
   Church in 1837, and took orders in 1841. He was a rector several years,
   and for a time a tutor of his college. He delivered the Bampton
   Lectures in 1855. He published Short Occasional Poems, 1858, and Hymns
   from the Gospel of the Day for Each Sunday and Festivals of Our Lord,
   1860. He died October 6, 1874.

   Boehm, Anthony Wilhelm, a German writer, was born in 1673; and died in
   1722. Very little is known of him. He translated and published Arndt's
   True Christianity in 1712, in which volume was a translation of St.
   Bernard's "Jesu, Dulcis Memoria," which [33]J. C. Jacobi altered and
   published in his Psalmodia Germanica, 1732. Jacobi's version was in
   turn altered by others, and among these alterations the one found in
   [34]Madan's Psalms and Hymns, 1760, beginning, "Of Him who did
   salvation bring," has long been a favorite with American Methodists. If
   any hymn in our Hymnal has to be traced back through a long genealogy,
   this one surely has.

   Bonar, Horatius, a distinguished Presbyterian divine, was born in
   Edinburgh, Scotland, December 19, 1808; and was educated at the high
   school and University of Edinburgh. He was ordained in 1837, and became
   a minister of the Established Church of Scotland at Kelso. At the
   Disruption in 1843 he became one of the founders of the Free Church of
   Scotland. The University of Aberdeen gave him the doctorate in 1853. In
   1866 he became the minister of the Chalmers Memorial Church, in
   Edinburgh. Dr. Bonar died July 31, 1889. He was a voluminous writer of
   sacred poetry, and more than one hundred of his hymns are in common
   use. He published the following books, in which most of his hymns are
   found: Songs of the Wilderness, 1843-44; The Bible Hymn Book, 1845;
   Hymns Original and Selected, 1846; Hymns of Faith and Hope, first
   series, 1857 (second series, 1864; third series, 1867); Hymns of the
   Nativity, 1879; Communion Hymns, 1881. Dr. Bonar was an able, pious man
   and a sweet singer, though as a premillenarian some of his poems are
   plaintive and sad almost to pessimism. Twelve of his hymns are found in
   this book. He died July 31, 1889.

   Bonar, Jane Catherine, the wife of [35]Dr. Horatius Bonar, was the
   youngest daughter of Rev. Robert Lundie, of Kelso, Scotland (where she
   was born, December, 1821), and sister of that devotedly pious woman,
   Mary Lundie Duncan, whose Memoir was written by her gifted mother. She
   was married to Dr. Bonar in 1843, and died at Edinburgh December 3,
   1885. Her hymns, which are few in number, appeared in her husband's
   Songs for the Wilderness, 1843-44, and Bible Hymn Book, 1845.

   Borthwick, Jane, was born in Edinburgh April 9, 1813. In connection
   with her sister, [36]Mrs. Sarah Findlater, wife of Rev. Eric J.
   Findlater, she translated Hymns from the Land of Luther, 1854. Miss
   Borthwick not only translated many German hymns, but wrote a number of
   original poems. Many of them were collected and published under the
   title of Thoughts for Thoughtful Hours, 1857. She died September 7,
   1897.

   Bourignon, Antoinette, a gifted and pious, but eccentric, mystic of the
   seventeenth century, was born January 13, 1616. She became fascinated
   at an early age with books of devotion and with a life of celibacy. She
   twice fled from home to escape marriage, into which relation her
   parents wished her to enter. Her father died in 1648, leaving her
   possessed of considerable wealth. Wishing to do good with her worldly
   means, she took charge of a foundling hospital in 1653. She joined the
   order of Augustines in 1667. She attracted great attention by her
   tracts and discourses. Renouncing Roman Catholicism, she declared
   herself divinely called to found a new and pure communion. She became
   an object of persecution, and fled from place to place. She died at
   Franeker, in Friesland, October 30, 1680. Her works were published in
   nineteen volumes in 1686. One of her works, The Light of the World, was
   translated into English, and met with such a large sale and was of such
   influence in Great Britain that at one time all the candidates for the
   Presbyterian ministry were required to disavow all belief in or
   sympathy with "Bourignonism." The fact that for twenty years she
   boasted that she had not read a word of the Holy Scripture shows the
   erratic character of her piety. But by [37]John Wesley's (or possibly
   John Byrom's?) rare power of translation we have from her a most useful
   hymn, which was written in 1640, at the time when she renounced the
   world for a religious life.

   Bourne, William St. Hill, a Church of England clergyman, was born in
   1846. He was educated at the London College of Divinity, and took
   orders in 1869. He is the author of a number of hymns and poems, only
   one of which is found in this collection. He published A Supplementary
   Hymnal in 1898. He became rector of Finchley in 1900.

   Bowring, Sir John, an eminent English politician, statesman, foreign
   minister, and literary man, was born at Exeter, England, October 17,
   1792. He held many official positions of responsibility under the
   English government, and was knighted in 1854. He was a genius in the
   acquisition of languages. He made translations from no less than
   thirteen modern languages, mostly of poetry. For many years he
   represented the English government in China and other portions of the
   Orient. He was a Unitarian in faith. He died at Exeter November 23,
   1872, being eighty years old. His hymns are found in his Matins and
   Vespers, 1823, and in his Sequel to the Matins, 1825. His published
   volumes are very numerous, no less than ten of them containing poetic
   translations from foreign languages or disquisitions on poetry.
   Although a Unitarian, he is the author of two of our most popular and
   useful hymns on Christ, one on the life of Christ (No. 290) and the
   other on the cross of Christ (No. 143); while two others (Nos. 199 and
   636) are among our best missionary hymns, striking a triumphant note
   concerning the beneficent and universal spread of the gospel of Christ.

   Brace, Seth Collins, a Congregational cleryman, son of Rev. Joab Brace,
   was born at Newington, Conn., August 3, 1811; was graduated at Yale
   College, class of 1832, and received his theological education at the
   Yale Theological Seminary. He entered the Presbyterian ministry in
   1842, but became a Congregationalist later. For many years he was
   engaged in teaching and literary work, preaching occasionally. In 1861
   he was installed pastor of a Congregational Church at Bethany, Conn.
   Subsequently he was compelled by illness to retire from active work in
   the ministry. He died in Philadelphia January 25, 1897.

   Brady, Nicholas, an English divine, was born at Bandon, County Cork,
   Ireland, October 28, 1659; was educated at Westminster, Oxford, and
   Trinity College, Dublin. He was a Prebendary of Cork, Ireland. In
   1702-05 he was incumbent at Stratford. Later, while incumbent at
   Richmond, he taught school in addition to his ministerial work. He died
   May 20, 1726. He published two volumes of poetry, one being a
   translation of Virgil's Aeneid. His association with [38]Nahum Tate in
   making a New Version of the Psalms of David, 1696, which long held a
   dominant place in the Church of England, has given him a permanent and
   honored place in the history of hymnology. From this Version we have
   four selections:

   Bridges, Matthew, was an Englishman born at Malden, Essex, England,
   July 14, 1800. He was educated in the Church of England, but became a
   convert to the Church of Rome in connection with the famous Tractarian
   movement led by [39]Cardinal Newman and others. For several years
   before his death he resided in the province of Quebec, Canada, where he
   died October 6, 1894. He was the author of several books, the most
   valuable of which is Hymns of the Heart, 1848.

   Bromehead, Joseph, was born in 1748, and after his graduation at
   Queen's College, Oxford (B.A. 1768, M.A. 1771), he became curate of
   Eckington, Derbyshire, remaining there until his death, January 30,
   1826. His Melancholy Student reached a second edition in 1776. He
   translated some of the Psalms into English verse, and was editor of the
   Eckington Collection, in which volume the hymn beginning "Jerusalem, my
   happy home," first appeared in its present familiar form. From this
   collection of hymns it passed into the Williams and Boden Collection of
   1801, and thence into many modern hymnals--from which circumstance
   several hymnologists have inferred that Bromehead gave that hymn its
   present form when he inserted it in the Eckington Collection. See full
   discussion of authorship under the hymn.

   Brooks, Charles Timothy, a Unitarian divine and a poet and author of
   more than ordinary ability, was born at Salem, Mass., in 1813;
   graduated at Harvard College in 1832 and at the Harvard Divinity School
   in 1835; was pastor of a Unitarian Church in Newport, R. I., from 1836

   Brooks, Phillips, a bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church, was born
   in Boston December 13, 1835; graduated at Harvard College in 1855, and
   then attended the Episcopal School of Theology, at Alexandria, Va. He
   was ordained in 1859, and became the rector of the Church of the
   Advent, in Philadelphia. In 1869 he became the rector of Trinity
   Church, Boston. This church was on Summer Street; but the great fire of
   1872 destroyed it, and a new church was erected in Copley Square. He
   was greatly beloved by his people, and his fame and influence were
   widely spread. In 1891 he was elected Bishop of Massachusetts, but he
   did not long serve in this Position. He died January 23, 1893. Bishop
   Brooks was a great soul in a gigantic body. He made friends of all with
   whom he came in contact. His influence was positive, strong, and good.
   Besides the carol in this book, he wrote at least four Christmas and
   two Easter carols, all of which are very fine.

   Brown, Phoebe Hinsdale, was the daughter of George Hinsdale, and was
   born May 1, 1783, at Canaan, N. Y. Being left an orphan and moneyless
   when only two years of age, her early life was one of want, hardship,
   and drudgery. When nine years of age she went to live with a relative
   who kept a county jail. "These were years of intense and cruel
   suffering," says her son. "The tale of her early life which she has
   left her children is a narrative of such deprivations, toil, and cruel
   treatment as it breaks my heart to read." Not until she was eighteen
   years of age did she escape from this bondage and find a home among
   kind and sympathetic people. Her education was limited to three months
   in the public school at Claverack, N. Y., where she learned to write.
   She made at this time a profession of faith in Christ and joined the
   Congregational Church. She did not improve her worldly fortune when, in
   1805, she married Thomas H. Brown, a journeyman house painter, after
   which she lived successively at East Windsor and Ellington, Conn.,
   Monson, Mass., and at Marshall, Ill., where she died October 10, 1861.
   "Despite all her disadvantages," says Prof. F. M. Bird in Julian's
   Dictionary, "Mrs. Brown's talents and work are superior to those of any
   other early female hymnist of America." Fifteen of her hymns have found
   a place in the different Church hymnals of America, though only one is
   given a place in this collection--her famous "Twilight Hymn," the
   origin of which is deeply interesting. The "little ones" to whom she
   referred in this hymn all became eminent for piety and usefulness.

   Browne, Simon, an English Independent minister and contemporary of
   [40]Dr. Isaac Watts, was born at Shepton Mallet, in Somersetshire,
   about 1680; and died in 1732. He was the pastor of a Church in
   Portsmouth and later in London. While living in London he published his
   original Hymns and Spiritual Songs, 1720. He was also the author of a
   number of prose volumes, among them a Defence of Christianity. Near the
   close of life he suffered from a peculiar mental disease. He imagined
   that God in his displeasure had gradually annihilated in him the
   thinking substance--that he had no reasoning soul. At the same time he
   was so acute a disputant that his friends said he could reason as if he
   had two souls. In the old hymn books a number of his hymns were in
   common use.

   Browning, Elizabeth Barrett, scarcely less famous as a poet than her
   illustrious husband, Robert Browning, was born in Londen March 4, 1809,
   being the eldest daughter of Edward Moulton, a country gentleman, who
   took the name of Barrett soon after her birth. On September 12, 1846,
   she was married to Robert Browning, and the remainder of her life was
   spent in Italy, chiefly at Florence, where she died June 30, 1861. In
   all literature there is no parallel case where husband and wife have
   each attained such distinction as poets and hold so high a place in the
   world of letters. As a poet she stands foremost among English literary
   women. Beginning at eight years of age to write poetry and being a
   great reader and a tireless worker, she produced during the forty years
   of her literary life, although much of the time an invalid, poems of
   rare intellectual power, artistic beauty, and ethical force; and a
   beautiful Christian faith pervades them all, which is also true of the
   writings of her illustrious husband. The happy married life and
   literary fellowship of Mrs. Browning and her husband constitute one of
   the most beautiful things in the biography of literature. This volume
   contains two lyrics from her pen:

   Bryant, William Cullen, eminent American editor and poet, was born in
   Cummington, Mass., November 3, 1794; spent two years at Williams
   College, after which he studled law and practiced about ten years. In
   1826 he connected himself with the New York Evening Post and continued
   to be one of its editors and proprietors to the day of his death, June
   12, 1878. Bryant is known as one of the ablest and sweetest of American
   poets. Many editions of his poems have been published. He also made an
   excellent translation of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Nineteen of his
   hymns were privately printed and circulated among his friends in 1869.
   A number of them are in common use.

   Bulfinch, Stephen Greenleaf, a Unitarian minister, was born in Boston
   June 18, 1809. His father, Charles Bulfinch, a well-known architect,
   was the designer of the national capitol at Washington, where he lived
   and where his son Stephen was graduated at Columbian College in 1827.
   He was also a graduate of the Theological School at Cambridge, Mass.,
   1830. He was ordained in 1831, and began his ministry at Augusta, Ga.
   Later he was the pastor of Unitarian Churches in several places. Dr.
   Bulfinch died at East Cambridge, Mass., October 12, 1870. The Boston
   Transcript just after his decease said: "Of a beautiful spirit, earnest
   convictions, sympathetic and devout nature, he won the respect and love
   of the people wherever he served." Most of his poems are found in his
   Lays of the Gospel, Boston, 1845.

   Burleigh, William Henry, a social reformer and member of the Unitarian
   Church, was born at Woodstock, Conn., February 12, 1812. He was brought
   up on his father's farm, and attended the district school. He was a
   born reformer, and living in New England in his time and with his
   disposition, naturally identified himself with the radical
   abolitionists and prohibitionists. His business was that of editor and
   lecturer. In 1837 he began at Pittsburg, Pa., the publication of the
   Christian Witness and Temperance Banner. In 1843 he became editor of
   the Christian Freeman at Hartford, Conn. From 1849 to 1855 he was agent
   of the New York State Temperance Society, and was harbor master at New
   York from 1855 to 1870. He died at Brooklyn, N. Y., March 18, 1871.
   Poetry was his recreation. His poems were collected and published in
   1841; second and enlarged edition, 1871. The poem titled "Blessed Are
   They That Mourn" was born of sorrow. Within the space of two years he
   buried his father, wife, eldest daughter, and eldest son. Let no one
   imagine that the strong, calm faith of this hymn was attained without
   difficulty. In a letter to a friend he said: "It is not without strong
   wrestlings that doubt and murmurings are put under my feet and I am
   enabled to struggle up into the purer atmosphere of faith." He is one
   of the few American hymn writers whose hymns are more extensively used
   in England than in America. Of fourteen hymns by him in common use,
   only two are here given:--

   Lead us, O Father, in the paths of 475
   Still will we trust                486

   Dunblane. In 1848 he took charge of a Presbyterian Church at Funchal,
   Madeira. In 1855 he became pastor of a Presbyterian Church in London.
   He died at Mentone November 27, 1864. He was the author of about one
   hundred hymns, only a few of which have come into common use. He was
   also the translator of thirty-nine German hymns. His Memoir was written

   Burton, Henry, a Methodist minister, born in 1840 at Swannington,
   Leicestershire, in the house where his grandmother, Mrs. James Burton,
   in 1818 organized the first Wesleyan juvenile missionary society. His
   parents moving to America in his boyhood, he was educated at Beloit
   College, Wisconsin. After his graduation he became a local preacher in
   the Methodist Episcopal Church and acted as a supply for the brother of
   Miss Frances E. Willard and also for six months as pastor at Monroe,
   Wis., after which he returned to England, and in 1865 entered the
   Wesleyan ministry. His labors have been chiefly in Lancashire and
   London. He married the sister of Rev. Mark Guy Pearse, the well-known
   Wesleyan preacher and author. He is the author of the commentary on St.
   Luke in the Expositor's Bible series of commentaries and also of
   Gleanings in the Gospels and Wayside Songs, 1886. In 1900 he received
   the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Beloit College. His famous little
   poem titled "Pass It On" has been set to music by no less than ten
   different composers. His present address is Charnwood, West Kirby,
   Birkenhead, Cheshire, England.

   Cockburn-Campbell, who was one of the founders of the Plymouth Brethren
   in England. Some of her hymns appeared in the collection of the
   Plymouth Brethren in 1842, and so came into general use. She died
   February 6, 1841.

   Carney, Julia A., was Miss Fletcher when she wrote the hymn contained
   in this collection, beginning: "Think gently of the erring one." She
   was born at Lancaster, Mass., April 6, 1823; began writing verses in
   early childhood, contributing poems to juvenile periodicals when she
   was only fourteen; became a teacher in one of the primary schools of
   Boston in 1844; wrote the familiar little poem beginning, "Little drops
   of water, little grains of sand," in 1845; married Rev. Thomas J.
   Carney in 1849. She died at Galesburg, Ill., November 1, 1908. Mr. and
   Mrs. Carney were members of the Universalist Church.

   Cary, Phoebe, and her sister Alice hold an honored place among the
   female poets of America. Phoebe (her sister Alice being four years her
   senior) was born in the Miami Valley, Ohio, September 4, 1824. The
   sisters began writing poetry at a very early age. Their collected Poems
   were first published in 1850. They moved to New York City in 1852, and
   soon had bought and paid for with their pens a very delightful home on
   Twentieth Street, where they lived until their death. The death of the
   elder sister preceded and hastened that of the younger, which occurred
   in 1871 while on a visit to Newport, R. I. Miss Cary was at the time of
   her death a member of the Church of the Strangers (Independent), in New
   York City. In 1869, in coöperation with her pastor, [41]Dr. Charles F.
   Deems, she published a collection of sacred songs titled Hymns for All
   Christians. She published Poems and Parodies in 1854 and Poems of
   Faith, Hope, and Love in 1868. The deep devotion of these two sisters
   to each other and their intimate fellowship in literary work attracted
   widespread and admiring attention on the part of all who knew them.
   Three other hymns by Phoebe Cary and seven hymns by Alice Cary are
   found in Church hymnals.

   Caswall, Edward, is the translator of many popular hymns. He comes of a
   literary family. His father and a brother were both clergymen of
   distinction in the Church of England. He was born at Yateley, in
   Hampshire, July 15, 1814; graduated at Oxford in 1836; was ordained
   deacon in the Church of England in 1838; became perpetual curate of
   Stratford-and-Castle, near Salisbury, in 1840; resigned his
   ecclesiastical position in the Church of England in 1846 with a view to
   joining the Roman Catholic Church, which he and his wife did in 1847;
   became a priest in the Congregation of the Oratory, which [42]Cardinal
   Newman had established at Birmingham, where he remained until his
   death, January 2, 1878. His biographer says:

   His life was marked by earnest devotion to his clerical duties and a
   loving interest in the poor, the sick, and in little children. His
   translations of Latin hymns have a wider circulation in modern hymnals
   than those of any other translator, [43]Dr. Neale alone excepted. This
   is owing to his general faithfulness to the originals and the purity of
   his rhythm, the latter feature specially adapting his hymns to music
   and for congregational purposes.

   His translation from [44]St. Bernard, beginning, "Jesus, the very
   thought of thee," is one of the finest in the entire Hymnal. Most of
   his original hymns are so Romish in doctrinal teaching as to make them
   unfitted for use in Protestant hymnals. His hymns are found in his Lyra
   Catholica, 1849; Masque of Mary and Other Poems, 1858; A May Pageant
   and Other Poems, 1865. The contents of all these volumes are contained
   in his Hymns and Poems, 1873, many of his hymns being rewritten or
   revised for this final volume. Four of his translations are in our
   Hymnal:

   Jesus, the very thought of thee  533
   My God, I love thee, not because 483
   O come, all ye faithful          125

   Cawood, John, a clergyman of the Church England, was born at Matlock,
   in Derbyshire, March 18, 1775. He was a farmer's son, and his early
   educational advantages were limited. By private study he succeeded in
   entering St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1797, obtaining his degree four
   years later. He took holy orders in 1801. In 1814 he became perpetual
   curate in Bewdely, Worcestershire, remaining there until his death,
   November 7, 1852. Cawood wrote only a few hymns. Nine were published in
   [45]Cotterill's Selection, eighth edition, 1819. Three others are found
   in Lyra Britannica, 1867. Only one appears in this collection:

   Cennick, John, was born in Berkshire, England, December 12, 1718. Being
   converted in his seventeenth year, he connected himself first with the
   Methodists and became a preacher among them, and was placed in charge
   of the Kingswood School; but his theological views undergoing a change,
   he separated from them in 1741, carrying several members with him and
   founding an independent society of his own, which, however, was soon
   gathered into the Whitefield, or Lady Huntingdon, Connection. A few
   years later he joined the Moravians, and spent most of the remainder of
   his life in the northern part of Ireland, returning to London in 1755,
   where he died July 4 of that same year, at the age of thirty-seven. He
   was a man of sincere and earnest piety. His first hymns were written
   for the use of the Methodists, and were altered and probably improved
   by the Wesleys. He published Sacred Hymns in three parts and in various
   editions, 1741-49, and in 1754 his Hymns to the Honor of Jesus Christ,
   Composed for Such Little Children as Desire to be Saved. "I would not
   have any," says Cennick, "who read these hymns look to find either good
   poetry or fine language, for indeed there is none." to which Dr.
   Hatfield says: "It was the truth. The few hymns from his pen that are
   now used have been considerably modified to fit them for the service of
   song, and are known at present almost wholly in these altered forms."
   He is the author of two well-known "Graces" before and after meat,
   commencing, "Be present at our table, Lord," and "We thank thee, Lord,
   for his our food." (See notes under Nos. 306 and 532 for further
   biographical facts.) His three best hymns are:

   Children of the heavenly King    547
   Jesus, my all, to heaven is gone 306
   Thou dear Redeemer, dying Lamb   532

   Charles, Elizabeth Rundle, the daughter of John Rundle, a banker and
   member of Parliament, was born at Tavistock, Devonshire, England,
   January 2, 1828. In 1851 she was married to Andrew Paton Charles, a
   barrister at law, who died in 1868. For some years previous to her
   death (March 28, 1896) she signed her name "Rundle-Charles." She is
   described in Allibone's Dictionary of Authors as one who had reputation
   as a linguist, painter, musician, poet, and preëminently as the author
   of The Chronicles of the Schönberg-Cotta Family, 1863, and more than
   twenty-five other volumes, several of which were poetry. No books
   written in the past century designed to popularize the notable epochs
   in modern Church history have had a wider reading or a greater and more
   healthful influence than The Schönberg-Cotta Family and the series of
   historic volumes that followed it. Among her many volumes discussing
   poetry and containing poems from her pen, none has attained such
   widespread recognition and influence as The Voice of Christian Life in
   Song in Many Lands and Ages, 1865. Her Poems were published in New York
   in 1867. Many of her works have had an immense circulation in England
   and America. Before her death she had won a high and permanent place in
   English literature as one of the purest and most wholesome of modern
   Christian authors. Some half dozen of her hymns are found in the
   hymnals of different Churches.

   Chorley, Henry Fothergill, an English editor and author, was born at
   Blackleyhurst, Lancashire, December 15, 1808. He was educated at the
   Royal Institution, Liverpool. In 1834 he went to London to take a place
   on the staff of the Athenaeum, and retained this editorial position for
   thirty-five years. He was the author of several novels and a large
   number of songs. He died February 15, 1872.

   Claudius, Matthias, the son of a Lutheran Pastor, was born at Reinfeld,
   near Lubeck, August 15, 1740. He entered the university at Jena in 1759
   as a student of theology, but later turned to law and literature. While
   residing at Darmstadt he associated with a circle of freethinking
   philosophers, but a severe sickness caused him to return to the faith
   of his childhood. He did not intentionally write hymns for the Church,
   but much of his poetry is Christian in spirit and a few pieces have
   been utilized as hymns. He died at Hamburg January 21, 1815.

   Clement of Alexandria, whose real name was Titus Flavius Clemens, was
   born about 160 or 170 A.D., at either Athens or Alexandria; and died
   about 215 or 220. A diligent student of Greek literature and
   philosophy, he was also as a young man an earnest seeker after the
   truth, and at length found it in the Christian faith. He traveled far
   and wide, seeking instruction from Christian teachers. He seemed to
   have been most influenced by Pantaenus, the head of the celebrated
   Catechetical School at Alexandria, and succeeded him about 190. While
   in this position he was ordained a presbyter. He continued to teach and
   preach at Alexandria until driven away by the persecution of Severus in
   202. Origen and Alexander, Bishop of Jerusalem, were both pupils of
   Clement at Alexandria. The last knowledge of him is in 211, when he
   bore a letter of commendation and confidence from Bishop Alexander, his
   former pupil, to the Christians at Antioch. It is not known whether he
   died in the East or returned to Alexandria. Three of his theological
   works are extant; also one sermon and one hymn to Christ, which, as
   found in this collection, owes as much to the translator as it does to
   the author.

   Codner, Elizabeth, was the wife of an English clergyman, the author of
   Among the Brambles and Other Lessons from Life, in which her hymn,
   "Lord, I hear of showers of blessing," was printed. She published two
   small volumes titled The Missionary Ship and The Bible in the Kitchen,
   and edited the periodical, Woman's Work in the Great Harvest Field. She
   was associated for some years with the Mildmay Protestant Mission,
   London. Hymnologists do not give the date of her birth or death.

   Coghill, Annie Louisa, daughter of Robert Walker, was born in
   Kiddermore, England, In 1836. In 1884 she was married to Harry Coghill.
   "Work, for the night is coming," was written in 1854, which was before
   her marriage and when she was only eighteen years of age. She was then
   residing in Canada, and the hymn was first printed in a Canadian
   newspaper. The author's text is found in her Oak and Maple, 1890. Her
   occasional poems printed in various Canadian newspapers were gathered
   together and published in 1859 In a volume titled Leaves from the
   Backwoods. In 1898 Mrs. Coghill edited and published the Autobiography
   and Letters of her cousin, Mrs. Oliphant.

   Collyer, William Bengo, was the pastor of an Independent or
   Congregational Church from 1801, when he was ordained, until his death,
   January 8, 1854. He was born at Blackheath, near London, April 14,
   1782, He was educated at Homerton College, which he entered at the age
   of sixteen. Dr. Collyer's Church was at Peckham, England. Dr. Falding,
   in the Dictionary of Hymnology, says he "was eminent in his day as an
   eloquent evangelical preacher when formalism in worship and Arianism in
   doctrine prevailed. He was a man of amiable disposition, polished
   manners, and Christian courtesy, popular with rich and poor alike." He
   edited a hymn book which was published in London, 1812, Hymns Partly
   Collected and Partly Original. To this book he contributed fifty-seven
   of his own hymns. He also contributed thirty-nine pieces to Dr.
   Leifchild's book of Original Hymns, 1843. A few of his hymns have been
   useful, but none of them have reached the first rank.

   Conder, Josiah, the son of Thomas Conder, a London bookseller, and the
   grandson of Dr. John Conder, an eminent Dissenting clergyman, was born
   in London September 17, 1789. At an early age he lost the sight of his
   right eye. At the age of fifteen he entered his father's bookstore,
   where he was thrown much with intellectual people; and this increased
   and confirmed the interest which he already had in literature. At the
   early age of twenty-one we find him, conjointly with several other
   young aspirants for literary fame (one of whom, Eliza Thomas, became
   his wife), issuing a volume of poetry called The Associate Minstrels,
   which attained sufficient popularity to justify a second edition two
   years later (1812). This same year he contributed three hymns to
   [47]Dr. Collyer's collection. In 1814 he obtained control of the
   Eclectic Review, and from this time on he devoted all his time to
   literature and journalism. In 1832 he started the Patriot newspaper,
   which he continued to edit and publish until his death, December 27,
   1855. He published more than a dozen scholarly volumes during his life,
   and these show him to have been a devout and pious believer. His
   Congregational Hymn Book, published in 1836, attained a widespread
   popularity which lasted for many years. Just before he died he
   collected all the hymns he had written with a view to publication. They
   were issued the year after his death under the title: Hymns of Praise,
   Prayer, and Devout Meditation. "His friends included most of the
   literary and Christian men of eminence living in the first half of the
   nineteenth century." A larger number of Conder's hymns are said to be
   in common use in England and America at this time than those of any
   other writer of the Congregational body, [48]Watts and [49]Doddridge
   alone excepted.

   Copeland, Benjamin, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   residing at present (1911) in Buffalo, N. Y., was born in 1855. He has
   filled various important stations in his Church since entering the
   ministry. The two useful hymns which we have here from his pen show
   that he has fine poetic ability. They are both hymns of more than
   ordinary merit. The first of the two especially neets a real need in
   the Hymnal and fills a place not filled by any other hymn.

   Cotterill, Jane, was the daughter of a minister, Rev. John Book, the
   wife of a minister, Rev. Joseph Cotterill, and the mother of a
   minister, Rt. Rev. Henry Cotterill, Bishop of Edinburgh. She lived but
   thirty-five years. Born in 1790, married in 1811, died in 1825. She
   wrote only a few hymns, which appeared first in [50]Thomas Cotterill's
   Selection, 1815, without name; and later they appeared in
   [51]Montgomery's Christian Psalmist, 1825, with the name of the author.

   Cotterill, Thomas, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born at
   Cannock, Staffordshire, December 4, 1779; graduated at Cambridge in
   1801, and entered the ministry of the Church of England. In 1817 he
   became perpetual curate of St. Paul's, at Sheffield, where he spent the
   rest of his life, teaching a small school part of file time in
   connection with his pastoral work. It was here that he met and formed
   an intimate friendship with [52]James Montgomery, the poet and hymn
   writer, who helped him in the preparation of a volume of hymns under
   the following title: A Selection of Psalms and Hymns for Public and
   Private Use, Adapted to the Services of the Church of England. So
   popular was this book that it reached its eighth edition by 1819. This
   work contained one hundred and fifty psalms and three hundred and
   sixty-seven hymns, of which Montgomery furnished fifty and Cotterill
   thirty-two, though the authors' names were not in any cases attached to
   the hymns. This book brought Cotterill into trouble with the
   ecclesiastical authorities, and was actually carried into the courts;
   but the suit was settled through the mediation of the archbishop, who
   revised Cotterill's selections and added several of his own, reducing
   the number to one hundred and forty-six. In spite of ecclesiastical
   influence, however, this "suppressed" volume continued to be used and
   to have widespread influence. "It did more," says Julian, "than any
   other collection in the Church of England to mold the hymn books of the
   next period; and nearly nine-tenths of the hymns therein, and usually
   in the altered form given them by Cotterill or James Montgomery, who
   assisted him, are still in common use in Great Britain and America."
   Cotterill died December 29, 1823. Montgomery's sorrow over his death
   found expression in the well-known hymn beginning "Friend after friend
   departs."

   Cowper, Frances Maria, was born in England in 1727; and died in 1797.
   She was the wife of Major Cowper, a sister of the [53]Rev. Martin
   Madan, and a cousin, through her mother, of [54]William Cowper, the
   poet. Her poems, Original Poems on Various Occasions, by a Lady, were
   published in 1792.

   Cowper, William, one of the most popular poets and letter writers of
   the English language, was born in Berkhampstead, Hertfordshire,
   November 26, 1731. His father, Rev. John Cowper, was a chaplain to
   George II. He spent ten years in Westminster School, and then began
   reading law, but abandoned it for literature after a very brief
   practice. He became the most distinguished poet of the English language
   in the latter half of the eighteenth century. His poetic works are too
   numerous and too well known to need mention here. His life is invested
   with a peculiar and sorrowful interest, owing to his constitutional
   tendency to mental and moral despondency, which brought on frequent
   attacks of insanity. His disappointment in not being permitted to marry
   his cousin added to his malady. His melancholia had come upon him and
   placed its dark limitations upon his life before he went, in 1765, to
   live at Huntingdon, where his association with and love for Mrs. Mary
   Unwin became one of the tenderest and holiest attachments of his life.
   In 1767 he moved to Olney, the home of [55]Rev. John Newton. An
   intimate friendship between the two at once began. Cowper was a
   constant and prayerful attendant upon Newton's Church services,
   especially his cottage prayer meetings, for which nearly all of his
   hymns were written at Newton's request. The [56]Olney Hymns, 1779, was
   their joint production, seventy-eight of them coming from Cowper. He
   also translated many of the [57]hymns of Madame Guyon, one of which is
   found in this volume. He died April 25, 1800, at East Dereham. He is
   regarded as the greatest letter writer in Engllsh literature. None of
   his great poems show signs of melancholia, but breathe a healthful and
   cheerful piety. No other great poet has written so many hymns as he.
   His hymns give expression to sentiments of peace and gratitude, of
   trust and submission, rather than of hope and joy. A plaintive and
   refined tenderness runs through them all.

   Cox, Samuel Keener, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   South, was born in Baltimore, Md., July 16, 1823; and died at
   Harrisonburg, Va., November 27, 1909. He was the son of Rev. Luther J.
   Cox, a Methodist local preacher, and was a first cousin of Bishop John
   C. Keener. He enjoyed fine educational advantages in early life, and in
   1844 he joined the Maryland Conference of the Methodist Protestant
   Church, of which his father was one of the organizers in 1828. After
   filling various pastoral charges in Washington City and elsewhere, he
   became in 1853 Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy in Madison
   College, Uniontown, Pa., which position he filled for some years, and
   then was engaged in educational work in Virginia and Alabama until
   1866, when he joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in which
   Church he served as educator, pastor in Baltimore, Washington City, and
   elsewhere and as editor of the Episcopal Methodist, the Baltimore
   Christian Advocate, and the Baltimore and Richmond Christian Advocate.
   He was a member of the committee of nine which in 1886-88 compiled the
   hymn book of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, which was the
   official hymnal of that Church until this present book became the joint
   hymnal of both branches of American Episcopal Methodism. Dr. Cox was a
   brother of [59]Dr. Christopher C. Cox, the author of Hymn No. 52.

   Coxe, Arthur Cleveland, a bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church,
   was born at Mendham, N, J., May 10, 1818; graduated at the University
   of New York in 1838; took orders in the ministry in 1841, and served as
   rector at Hartford, Baltimore, and New York. In 1865 he was elected
   bishop of Western New York. He died July 20, 1896. Bishop Coxe was the
   author of several small volumes of Poems: Advent, 1837; Christian
   Ballads, 1840; Athanasion, 1842; Hallowe'en and Other Poems, 1844;
   Saul, a Mystery, 1845. A few of his hymns are found in many
   collections. As a member of the Hymnal Commission that prepared the
   official hymnal of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1869-71 he
   refused to allow any of his own hymns to be inserted in that volume,
   which, Prof. F. M. Bird thinks, was a case of "too scrupulous modesty."

   Crewdson, Jane, the daughter of George Fox, was born at Perraw,
   Cornwall, England, in October, 1809, and was married to Thomas
   Crewdson, of Manchester, in 1836. Always delicate in health, toward the
   close of her life she became a confirmed invalid and a great sufferer;
   and most of her hymns were written during this period of suffering. She
   died at Summerlands, near Manchester, September 14, 1863, "leaving
   behind her the memory of a beautiful Christian life and many admirable
   verses." She truly learned in suffering what she taught in song. Her
   husband wrote beautifully of her: "As a constant sufferer, the
   spiritual life deepening and the intellectual life retaining all its
   power, she became well prepared to testify as to the all-sufficiency of
   her Saviour's love. Many felt that her sick room was the highest place
   to which they could resort for refreshment of spirit and even for
   mental recreation. From that apartment came many a letter of earnest
   sympathy or of charming playfulness." She published anonymously several
   small volumes of poetry, and the year after her death a book of her
   poems was published under the title: A Little While and Other Poems,
   1864. A verse, written just before she died, titled "During Sickness,"
   is a gem worthy of immortality:


   O Saviour, I have naught to plead

   In earth beneath or heaven above,

   But just my own exceeding need

   And thy exceeding love:

   The need will soon be past and gone,

   Exceeding great but quickly o'er;

   The love, unbought, is all Thine own,

   And lasts for evermore.

   O Thou, whose bounty fills my cup 531

   Croly, George, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born at Dublin
   August 17, 1780. In 1804 he took the degree of Master of Arts at Dublin
   University, which institution also conferred on him in 1831 the degree
   of LL.D. After receiving holy orders he labored in Ireland until 1810,
   when he removed to London and devoted himself largely to literature. He
   died November 24, 1860. Dr. Croly's hymns were published in his Psalms
   and Hymns for Public Worship, 1854.

   Crosby, Fanny Jane (Mrs. Van Alstyne), is the most prolific and perhaps
   the most popular writer of Sunday school hymns that America has ever
   produced. She was born at South East, Putnam County, N. Y., March 24,
   1820. When only six weeks old she lost her eyesight. Her first poem was
   written when she was only eight years old. At the age of fifteen she
   entered the Institution for the Blind in New York City, where she spent
   seven years as a pupil and eleven years (1847-58) as a teacher. In 1844
   she published a volume entitled The Blind Girl and Other Poems, and in
   1849 Monterey and Other Poems. In 1851 she was happily converted, and
   united with the Old John Street Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1858 she
   was married to Mr. Alexander Van Alstyne, who was also, like herself,
   blind, had been a teacher in the Institution, and was possessed of rare
   musical talent, and thus eminently fitted to be a congenial and helpful
   life companion. As a hymn writer, however, she has continued since her
   marriage to bear her maiden name. A third volume of her poems was
   issued the year of her marriage: A Wreath of Columbia's Flowers, 1858.
   She was in the employ of Mr. William B. Bradbury for the last four
   years before he died, and she was for some years regularly employed by
   Biglow and Main to write "three hymns a week the year round." She has
   written about six thousand hymns, considerably less than half of which
   number have been published. In 1898 she published Bells at Evening and
   Other Poems, and in 1906 Memories of Eighty Years. Revered, honored,
   and loved by millions, she resides at Bridgeport, Conn., being at this
   writing (1911) ninety-one years of age. Fanny Crosby's hymns and the
   tunes to which they are sung have a peculiar charm for the young and
   for the masses of the people. There are thousands of religious homes
   where her sweet and simple songs are sung daily, and are scarcely less
   familiar than the words of Scripture. In sunshine and darkness alike
   and in all lands her songs are sung "with a glad heart and free." Few
   women that have ever lived can claim a higher honor than belongs to
   Fanny Crosby in being permitted to witness the world-wide popularity of
   so many of her hymns.

   Cross, Ada Cambridge, the daughter of Henry Cambridge, was born at
   Norfolk, England, November 21, 1844. In 1870 she married Rev. George
   Frederick Cross, a clergyman of the Church of England. The same year
   she removed with her husband to Australia, where she has since resided.
   She published Hymns on the Holy Communion, 1866, and Hymns on the
   Litany, 1865. A few of her hymns have become popular. Her hymns, says
   Dr. Julian, "are characterized by great sweetness and purity of rhythm,
   combined with naturalness and simplicity."

   Cummins, James John, was born in Cork, Ireland, May 5, 1795. He moved
   to London in 1834. He was for many years a director of the Union Bank
   of Australia. He died at Wildecroft, Buckland, Surrey, November 23,
   1867. He was a devout member of the Church of England. He took a deep
   interest in the study of Hebrew and of theology. His volume titled
   Seals of the Covenant Opened in the Sacraments, 1839, was prepared with
   a view to meeting the needs of his own children in their preparation
   for assuming the vows of Church membership. It contained poetical
   meditations and hymns which were also published separately the same
   year and republished ten years later under the title, Hymns,
   Meditations, and Other Poems, 1849, the title on the cover being Lyra
   Evangelica.

   Cutter, William, an editor and publisher, was born in North Yarmouth,
   Me., May 15, 1801. He was educated at Bowdoin College, where he was
   graduated in 1821. He belonged to the Congregational Church. He was
   engaged in business in Portland, Me., for several years, and then in
   Brooklyn, N. Y. His hymns were contributed to the Christian Mirror, a
   periodical published at Portland. He died February 8, 1867. Professor
   Bird describes Mr. Cutter as "a deserving writer who has hitherto
   missed his due meed of acknowledgment."

   Davies, Samuel, an eminent Presbyterian divine, was born near Summit
   Ridge, Newcastle, Del., November 3, 1723. He was licensed in 1745 and
   ordained to the ministry in 1747, and labored for several years as a
   missionary and evangelist in the State of Virginia. He succeeded
   Jonathan Edwards as President of Princeton College in 1759, but died
   February 4, 1761, in his thirty-seventh year. His published sermons
   show him to have been a man of great intellectual vigor, piety, and
   usefulness. They have been frequently reprinted. In Dr. Thomas Gibson's
   Hymns Adapted to Divine Worship (London, 1769) there are sixteen hymns
   by Mr. Davies, one of which is the following:

   Decius, Nicolaus, was born in Upper Franconia, Bavaria, toward the
   close of the fifteenth century. He was first a monk in the Roman
   Catholic Church, being in 1519 Probst of the cloister at Steterburg,
   near Wolfenbüttel; but becoming a convert to [60]Luther's views, he
   left the Romish Church in 1522 and moved to Brunswick, where he taught
   school for one year. He became an Evangelical preacher at Stettin in
   1523, and was for many years pastor of the Church of St. Nicholas. He
   died suddenly March 21, 1541. His work was carried on under constant
   opposition from the Church of Rome, but he was a popular and
   influential preacher among the early Protestants. He was a good
   musician, and composed tunes for three hymns that he wrote, only one of
   which is contained in this collection:

   Deems, Charles Force, was for a number of years a minister in the
   Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and from 1866 till his death, in
   1893, pastor of the Church of the Strangers, an independent
   congregation in New York City. He was born in Baltimore, Md., December
   4, 1820; graduated at Dickinson College in 1839, after which he settled
   in North Carolina, entering the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church and serving as Agent of the American Bible Society in that State
   for 1840-41; Professor of Logic and Rhetoric in the University of North
   Carolina, 1842-5; Professor of Chemistry in Randolph-Macon College,
   Virginia, 1845-46. He served as pastor of sevral Churches in the North
   Carolina Conference. He was President of the Greensboro Female College,
   North Carolina, 1846-50. In 1866 he moved to New York, where he died
   November 18, 1893. Deems was a popular preacher and forcible public
   speaker. He was the author of a valuable life of Christ, titled The
   Light of the Nations. In connection with [61]Miss Phoebe Cary he edited
   Hymns for All Christians, 1869. As pastor of Commodore Venderbilt he
   had, in connection with Bishop H. N. McTyeire, not a little to do with
   influencing that man of princely wealth to give a million dollars to
   the "Central University of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South" (now
   Vanderbilt University), at Nashville, Tenn. He was the founder and for
   many years the President of the American Institute of Christian
   Philosophy, and also editor of its organ, Christian Thought.

   Denny, Sir Edward, was born at Tralee Castle, County Kerry, Ireland,
   October 2, 1796, and succeeded to the baronetcy upon the death of his
   father, in 1831. He owned a large estate in Ireland, though his
   principal residence was in London. His Church membership was with the
   Plymouth Brethren. He published A Selection of Hymns in 1839 and a
   volume of Hymns and Poems in 1848. His Millennial Hymns, 1870, is a
   republication of his former work. It contains a long preface on
   prophecy, in which he advocates Millenarianism. He died in London June
   13, 1889.

   Dessler, Wolfgang Christopher, was born at Nuremberg February 11, 1660.
   His father was a jeweler, and wished his son to follow the same trade.
   But the son was devoted to study, and at length entered the University
   of Altdorf as a student of divinity. On account of ill health, he was
   obliged to give up his course; but he continued his literary work as he
   was able. He was head master of a school at Nuremberg some fifteen
   years. Dessler was the author of fifty-six hymns, an accurate scholar
   and a devout Christian. He died March 11, 1722.

   Dix, William Chatterton, an eminent English author, was born at Bristol
   June 14, 1837. He was manager of a marine insurance company in Glasgow.
   His contributions to hymnody are valuable. Some twenty or thirty of
   them are in common use in Great Britain and America; a few of them are
   of first rank. He published Hymns of Love and Joy, 1861; Altar Songs,
   1867; Vision of All Saints, 1871; and Seekers of a City, 1878. Many of
   his hymns were contributed to Hymns Ancient and Modern and other
   English hymnals. Among his best-known volumes are two titled The Risen

   Doane, George Washington, a bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church,
   was born in Trenton, N. J., May 27, 1799; graduated at Union College,
   Schenectady, N. Y., in 1818; entered the ministry in 1821, and served
   as an assistant minister at Trinity Church, New York, until 1824, when
   he was called to a chair in Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., where he
   remained until 1828, when he became rector of Trinity Church, Boston,
   being in this position when he was elected in 1832 to the bishopric of
   New Jersey. St. Mary's Hall, Burlington, was founded by him in 1837,
   and Burlington College in 1846. A man of great energy and force of
   character, of rare warmth of heart, and of exceptional learning, he was
   regarded as one of the most able and influential prelates of the
   Episcopal Church in America. He had not only warm friends and ardent
   admirers, but bitter enemies and numerous controversies. He died April
   27, 1859. His Songs by the Way, 1824, published when he was only
   twenty-five years old, gave evidence of unusual gifts as a poet and
   hymn writer. Just after his death his son published his Works, in four
   volumes, and an enlarged edition of his Sangs by the Way. There are
   some who claim that his hymn beginning "Thou art the Way" is the
   greatest hymn that America has yet produced.

   was rector of St. John's Church, Hartford, Conn. In 1869 he was
   consecrated bishop of the new diocese of Albany. In 1902 his fugitive
   poems were collected and published in a volume titled Rhymes from Time
   to Time. Bishop Doane received the title of D.D. from Oxford and LL.D.
   from Cambridge. His residence is Albany, N. Y.

   Doddridge, Philip, one of the most distinguished Dissenting ministers
   of the eighteenth century, was the youngest of twenty children. He was
   born June 26, 1702. He entered the ministry when only nineteen years
   old. In 1729 he moved to Northampton, where he became pastor of the
   Dissenting Church and also, by the urgent advice of [64]Isaac Watts and
   others, organized and conducted a theological school for young
   preachers; and as many as a hundred and fifty studied theology with him
   during the twenty years he was there. His Family Expositor and Rise and
   Progress of Religion in the Soul have been translated into many
   languages, and are still widely read, while his Sermons attest his
   vigor and piety as a preacher. He died of consumption at Lisbon,
   Portugal, October 16, 1751, in the fiftieth year of his age. It was Dr.
   Doddridge's custom immediately after finishing a sermon, while his mind
   was yet aglow with the warmth and unction of earnest, prayerful study
   and the thought and plan of the sermon were fresh in his mind, to write
   a hymn embodying the doctrinal and devotional sentiment of the
   discourse, and have it sung immediately after the conclusion of his
   sermon. This gives to his hymns a doctrinal unity not found in many
   hymns. Hence his hymns, as a rule, are suitable for one subject, not
   for any subject or occasion. They are the hymns of a pastor and
   preacher, written to meet his own needs. Dr. Doddridge's hymns were
   circulated only in manuscript during his lifetime. It was not until
   four years after his death that they (three hundred and seventy in all)
   were collected and published under the title: Hymns Founded on Various
   Texts in the Holy Scriptures, 1755. A later edition (1766) contained
   five additional hymns; and in 1839 a great-grandson of Dr. Doddridge
   published a "new and corrected edition," which contained twenty-two
   additional hymns. Dr. Julian states in his Dictionary that over
   one-third of Dr. Doddridge's hymns are in common use at the present
   time. Twenty-two only are found in this collection:

   Dryden, John, the distinguished English poet, was born at Aldwinkle
   August 9, 1631. He attended Westminster School and entered Trinity
   College, Cambridge, in 1650, taking his A.B. in 1654. He was of Puritan
   blood, and his first great poem was Heroic Stanzas on the Death of
   Oliver Cromwell, 1658. Soon after the restoration he became a Royalist,
   and was made Poet Laureate in 1670. He did not remain, however, in the
   Church of England, but in 1785 he became a Romanist. He died May 18,
   1701.

   pastor successively, of many of the leading Presbyterian Churches in
   the North and Northwest--viz., Brooklyn, N. Y., 1840-47; Bloomfield, N.
   J., 1847-52; Philadelphia, 1852-61; Adrian, Mich., 1861-65; Galesburg,
   Ill., 1865-69; and at Ann Arbor and Lansing, Mich., 1869-84. He retired
   from the active work of the ministry in 1884, and settled at Detroit,
   Mich. He died July 6, 1888, at Bloomfield, N. J., while on a visit to
   his son's widow. He was the son of Rev. George Duffield, D.D., the
   "patriarch of Michigan," 'who was born in 1796 and died at Detroit in
   1868, and the father of the late Rev. Samuel W. Duffield, D.D., of

   graduated in 1832. He studied for the ministry at the Harvard Divinity
   School, and was ordained in 1836 as pastor of the Unitarian Church at
   Northanipton. In a few years he gave up the ministry and devoted
   himself to literature and music. In 1852 he established Dwight's
   Journal of Music, which he owned and edited for thirty years, making it
   one of the foremost musical journals of the time. He died September 5,
   1893.

   Dwight, Timothy, a distinguished Congregational minister and educator,
   was born at Northampton, Mass., May 14, 1752. His mother was a daughter
   of Jonathan Edwards. He entered Yale College at the age of thirteen,
   and, graduating four years later, became a tutor, which position he
   resigned in 1777 to become chaplain in the Revolutionary army. He next
   became a pastor at Greenfield, Conn., and in 1795 was elected President
   of Yale College, and remained in this position until his death, January
   11, 1817. He is best known by his theological works, which are numerous
   and strong and show him to be a moderate Calvinist in faith. In 1800 he
   prepared and published a revised edition of Watts's Psalms, which was
   approved and adopted by the General Association of Connecticut
   (Congregational). This volume contained several other hymns from
   various sources, some of which were written by himself. He is the
   author of about a dozen hymns found in modern Church hymnals. "This is
   the most important name," says Prof. F. M. Bird, "in early American
   hymnology, as it is also one of the most illustrious in American
   literature and education."

   Edmeston, James, an Englishman, born September 10, 1791. He was
   educated as an architect and surveyor, and practiced these callings
   until his death, January 7, 1867. He was a member of the Church of
   England. Edmeston wrote nearly two thousand hymns, mostly for children.
   Some of them have been very popular. Between 1817 and 1847 he was the
   author of twelve small volumes composed of hymns and other short poems
   on religious subjects.

   trade of printing and that of a machinist also. In 1854 he became a
   student and Christian worker in Wesleyan University, from which he
   graduated with honors in 1857. He was a successful pastor and presiding
   elder in the Methodist Episcopal Church in New England for many years.
   Cornell College gave him the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1876. His

   Ellerton, John, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born in
   London December 16, 1826. He was educated at Trinity College,
   Cambridge, graduating in 1849. From 1850 till his death, June 15, 1893,
   he filled various positions in the Church of England as vicar and
   rector, being appointed Canon of St. Albans in 1892. He was the author
   of some prose writings, but is best known as a hymnologist. His
   contributions to hymnody are not numerous--about fifty original hymns
   and ten translations. Many of these are in common use, and a few are of
   special value. Dr. Julian says of his hymns: "His verse is elevated in
   tone, devotional in spirit, and elegant in diction." He published his
   Hymns for Schools and Bible Classes in 1859, and in 1871, in connection
   with [65]Bishop How, Church Hymns. His Notes and Illustrations of
   Church Hymns, 1881, was a valuable popular contribution to hymnology.

   Elliott, Charlotte, one of the sweetest though saddest of Christian
   singers, was the daughter of Charles Elliott, of Clapham and Brighton,
   England, and the granddaughter of Rev. Henry Venn, an eminent Church of
   England divine of apostolic character and labors. She was born March
   18, 1789. Reared amid refined, cultured Christian surroundings, she
   developed at quite an early age a passion for music and art. She was
   unusually well educated. From her thirty-second year until her death,
   which occurred September 22, 1871, in her eighty-third year, she was a
   confirmed invalid and oftentimes a great sufferer. She was a member of
   the Church of England. Her hymns have in them a tenderness and
   sweetness born of suffering and resignation. Although an invalid, she
   did a large amount of literary work in her lifetime, publishing several
   volumes. Her Invalid's Hymn Book was published in various editions from
   1834 to 1854, and contained altogether one hundred and fifteen of her
   hymns. Other poetic volumes by her containing hymns were: Hours of
   Sorrow, 1836; Hymns for a Week, 1839; Thoughts in Verse on Sacred
   Subjects, 1869. Her hymns number about one hundred and fifty, a large
   percentage of which, according to Julian's Dictionary, are in common
   use. "Her verse is characterized by tenderness of feeling, plaintive
   simplicity, deep devotion, and perfect rhythm. For those in sickness
   and sorrow she has sung as few others have done." It is doubtful if any
   hymn written in the past century is more widely sung and popular the
   world over than "Just as I am, without one plea." Miss Elliott shrank
   from publicity, nearly all her books being published in the first
   instance anonymously.

   volume of seventy original hymns, in 1873, and Chimes for Daily
   Service, seventy-one hymns, in 1880. A few of her hymns have obtained
   wide acceptance. She edited the Church Missionary Juvenile Instructor
   for several years. She died at Mildmay, London, August 3, 1897.

   resided from that date till the death of her husband, in 1844, at Rio
   de Janeiro, after which she returned to Philadelphia. In 1850 her poems

   but was immediately transferred to the Virginia Conference. After
   filling various appointments in this Conference, he transferred his
   Church relationship in 1892 to the Protestant Episcopal Church. Dr.
   Evans is at present rector of an Episcopal Church in Birmingham, Ala.

   Everest, Charles William, an Episcopal clergyman, was born at East
   Windsor, Conn., May 27, 1814; graduated at Trinity College, Hartford,
   in 1838; was ordained priest in 1842, and became at once rector of the
   parish of Hampden, near New Haven, Conn., where he remained for
   thirty-one years. He died at Waterbury, Conn., January 11, 1877, being
   at the time an officer in the Society for the Increase of the Ministry.
   His volume is titled Visions of Death and Other Poems, 1833.

   Faber, Frederick William, was born in Yorkshire, England, June 28,
   1814. He was of Huguenot origin. He was educated at Harrow School and
   Balliol College, Oxford, which he entered in 1832. At Oxford he came
   under the influence of the [67]Rev. John Henry Newman, then vicar of
   St. Mary's. He entered the ministry of the Church of England, taking
   deacon's orders in 1837 and priest's orders two years later. Most of
   his time for the next four years was spent in traveling on the
   Continent, where he further developed his leaning toward Romanism. On
   his return to England he became rector of Elton, where he was popular
   and highly useful. Sunday evening, September 16, 1845, he told his
   people that he could no longer remain in communion with the Church of
   England. The next day he was admitted into the Roman Catholic Church at
   Northampton. In April, 1849, he went to London and took charge of the
   Oratory of St. Philip Neri, where he remained until his death,
   September 26, 1863. In the preface to the 1849 edition of his Hymns he
   wrote: "It seemed then in every way desirable that Catholics should
   have a hymn book for reading. which should contain the mysteries of the
   faith in easy verse or different states of heart and conscience
   depicted with the same unadorned simplicity, for example, as the 'O for
   a closer walk with God' of the [68]Olney Hymns." It was to satisfy this
   need that Dr. Faber wrote his hymns, and he not only succeeded in large
   measure in his undertaking to give Roman Catholics good modern hymns,
   but he wrote many which have had a wide circulation among Protestant
   Churches. It has been found necessary, however, to eliminate
   objectionable Romish expressions from many of his hymns in order to
   adapt them to use in Protestant worship.

   Fabricius, Jacob, a chaplain in the army of [69]Gustavus Adolphus, was
   born in 1593, and died in 1654. There is some doubt as to the
   authorship of the hymn here credited to him. Some hymnologists have
   attributed it to Johann Michael Altenburg (1584-1640), a preacher,
   teacher, and musician of Erfurt, and others attribute it to Gustavus
   Adolphus.

   Farrar, Frederick William, a distinguished divine of the Church of
   England, was the son of Rev. C. P. Farrar, a missionary to India, and
   was born in Bombay, India, August 7, 1831. He had the best educational
   opportunities that England could furnish; received the degree of B.A.
   at the University of London, and then passed to Trinity College,
   Cambridge, where he graduated with high honors in 1854. He took orders
   the same year and served in various positions. In 1876 he was made a
   Canon of Westminster Abbey and rector of St. Margaret's Church. Dr.
   Farrar became Dean of Canterbury in 1895, and died there March 22,
   1903. As a preacher and lecturer he was a man of first rank. He was the
   author of many books. The best known perhaps are his Life of Christ and
   Life and Work of St. Paul.

   Fawcett, John, a Baptist divine of England, was born at Lidget Green,
   near Bradford, Yorkshire, January 6, 1739. He was converted under the
   preaching of Whitefield in 1755 and fellowshiped with the Methodists
   until 1758, when he joined the Baptist Church at Bradford. In 1765 he
   became pastor of the Baptist Church at Wainsgate; and although he
   received many flattering calls to go elsewhere, he remained here, or in
   the neighborhood at least, living on a pitifully small salary, until
   his death, July 25, 1817. He was an honored and useful minister of the
   gospel. He published many volumes on religious subjects, his poetic
   publications being: Poetic Essays, 1767; The Christian's Humble Plea, a
   Poem in Answer to Dr. Priestly (a Unitarian), 1772; The Death of
   Eumenio, a Divine Poem, 1779; The Reign of Death, 1780; Hymns Adapted
   to the Circumstances of Public Worship and Private Devotion, Leeds,
   1782. He wrote altogether one hundred and sixty-six hymns. Most of
   these hymns were written in the midnight hours of Saturday nights, and,
   like those of [70]Dr. Doddridge, were composed especially to be sung at
   the conclusion of his sermons on the Sabbath following.

   born November 26, 1823, and died May 2, 1886. She is joint translator
   with her sister, [71]Jane Borthwick, of the well-known volumes titled

   Fortunatus, Venantius, a Latin poet, was born in Italy about the year
   530. He was past middle life when he entered the ministry. In 599 he
   was appointed Bishop of Portiers, but died soon after, about 609. Some
   of his hymns have a great reputation in the Roman Catholic Church. The
   most famous is the passion hymn, Pange, lingua, gloriosi, proelium
   certaminis, which has been translated by [72]Neale and others.

   Francis, Benjamin, an English Baptist minister, born in Wales in 1734.
   He united with the Baptist Church at fifteen years of age, and began
   preaching when only nineteen. He was educated at the Bristol Baptist
   College. After a brief ministry at Sodbury, he accepted a call to the
   Baptist Church at Shortwood in 1757, and remained there until his
   death, December 14, 1799. An earnest and popular preacher and
   indefatigable worker, he received flattering calls from London and
   elsewhere, but refused them all in deep devotion to his flock at
   Shortwood, He published several small volumes of poetry, among them two
   volumes of Welsh hymns, 1774 and 1786. Five of his hymns were published
   in Rippon's Selection, 1787. [73]Joseph Grigg's well-known hymn
   beginning, "Jesus, and shall it ever be," owes its present popular form
   to Francis.

   Gerhardt, Paul, a distinguished Lutheran minister, and, next to
   [74]Luther, the most popular hymn writer of Germany, was born in Saxony
   March 12, 1607. He matriculated as a student at the University of
   Wittenberg January 2, 1628, and seems to have resided in Wittenberg
   until 1642 or 1643, when he went to Berlin, where he became a tutor in
   the family of the advocate, Andreas Barthold, whose daughter he married
   in 1655. In the meantime he had begun to preach, and on November 18,
   1651, he was ordained as chief pastor at Mittenwalde, near Berlin.
   Several of his hymns were published in 1653 in the Berlin Hymn Book,
   and later in other collections in Brandenburg and Saxony; and became at
   once very popular with the people. In 1657 he was appointed to the
   large and influential Church of St. Nicholas, in Berlin, where he
   preached to large crowds and was happy and useful in his ministry until
   ejected in 1666 by the edict of the Elector Frederick William, which
   was designed to make all preaching conform to the Reformed
   (Calvinistic) faith, and to which edict Gerhardt, believing in an
   unlimited atonement, refused to conform. As a consequence he was
   ejected and suffered many and great hardships. In 1669 he was appointed
   archdeacon of Lubben, in Saxony. He died June 7, 1676. His hymns number
   only one hundred and twenty-three, of which number about fifty are in
   common use.

   Gibbons, Thomas, an English Independent clergyman, was born at Reak,
   near Newmarket, May 31, 1720; was a friend of [75]Dr. Watts, and wrote
   his memoir. In 1743 he accepted a call to a Church in Cheapside,
   London, and held this pastorate up to his death, February 22, 1785. Dr.
   Gibbons published a volume of sermons and two volumes of hymns of more
   than average merit titled Hymns Adapted to Divine Worship, 1769 and
   1784.

   Gilder, Richard Watson, a distinguished editor and author, the son of
   Rev. William Henry Gilder, a Methodist minister, was born at
   Bordentown, N. J., February 8, 1844; educated at his father's seminary
   at Flushing, Long Island, and later studied Greek and Hebrew under the
   eminent scholar, Dr. James Strong. He was a private in the Civil War in
   1863, and in railroad service in 1864-65, after which he took up
   literary and editorial work, first on daily papers at Newark, N. J.,
   and then on Hours at Home, a New York monthly. In 1870 he became
   managing editor of Scribner's Monthly and later its editor in chief,
   retaining this position after it became the Century Magazine (1881). He
   was connected with various literary and social reform clubs. He is the
   author of numerous volumes of poetry. He received the honorary degree
   of Doctor of Laws from several of the leading universities of America
   in recognition of his scholarly attainments and splendid service to
   American literature. He died November 19, 1909.

   Gill, Thomas Hornblower, an English layman, was born in Birmingham
   February 10, 1819, and died in 1906. He prepared for the University of
   Oxford, but could not enter because, having been trained in Unitarian
   principles, he could not subscribe to the Articles of the Church of
   England, as was then required. Later he left the Unitarian Church. He
   wrote about two hundred hymns. Most of them were collected in his
   Golden Chain of Praise, London, 1869. He was an original hymnist, and
   had some very correct ideas as to what a hymn should be. In his preface
   he said: "Hymns are not meant to be theological statements, expositions
   of doctrine, or enunciations of precepts; they are utterances of the
   soul in its manifold moods of hope and fear, joy and sorrow, love,
   wonder, and aspiration. . . . Hymns are meant and made to be sung. The
   best and most glorious hymns cannot be more exactly defined than as
   divine love songs."

   Gladden, Washington, a distinguished Congregational minister and
   author, son of Solomon Gladden, was born at Pottsgrove, Pa., February
   11, 1836. Reared on a farm near Oswego, N. Y., and educated in a
   country district school and at Oswego Academy, he first learned the
   printer's trade and later entered Williams College, from which he
   graduated in 1859. He was licensed to preach in 1860. He was
   successively pastor of Congregational Churches in Brooklyn, N. Y.,
   1860; Morrisania, N. Y., 1861-66; North Adams, Mass., 1866-71;
   Springfield, Mass., 1875-82; and from 1882 to the present date (1911)
   he has been pastor of the First Congregational Church of Columbus,
   Ohio, where he now resides. From 1871 to 1875 he was on the editorial
   staff of the New York Independent, and later, while pastor at
   Springfield, he was editor of the weekly periodical, Sunday Afternoon.
   Dr. Gladden is one of the most widely known and influential pastors,
   preachers, lecturers, and religious writers in America. In deep
   sympathy with the masses and the working people, his voice and pen have
   long been exercised in the work of social reform. He is the author of
   about thirty widely read volumes on religious, ethical, and social
   subjects, among which may be mentioned: Plain Thoughts on the Art of
   Living, 1868; Workingmen and Their Employers, 1876; The Young Men and

   took orders in the Church of England in 1786. His Works, edited by his
   son, were published in 1822. He was the author of An Entire New Version
   of the Book of Psalms, London, 1811, which was somewhat widely used for
   a time. Most of his versions of the Psalms have fallen out of use. He
   is represented in this Hymnal by one doxology. He died April 15, 1816.

   Grant, Robert, was born in India in 1785. His father, a stanch and
   pious Scotchman, was a leading officer of the East India Company, and
   his brother Charles was Lord Glenelg. He graduated at Cambridge in
   1804; was admitted to the bar in 1807, and filled various public
   official positions; was appointed Governor of Bombay in 1824. He died
   in India July 9, 1838. He is the author of several volumes on the work
   of the East India Company and also of twelve hymns which his brother,
   Lord Glenelg, published the year after his death in a volume titled
   Sacred Poems. It rarely happens that a man engaged so deeply in public
   and political life as was Sir Robert Grant finds time and inclination
   to write Christian hymns. There are very few hymns of adoration and
   worship in the entire collection that surpass his hymn beginning: "O
   worship the King."

   Grigg, Joseph, an English Presbyterian minister, was born in 1720. He
   was the son of poor parents and brought up to mechanical pursuits. He
   began writing hymns when he was only ten years old. He entered the
   ministry in 1743, and became an assistant to Rev. Thomas Bures, pastor
   of the Silver Street Presbyterian Church, London. He continued here
   only four years, when he married a woman of wealth and settled at St.
   Albans. He retired from the active work of the ministry at this time,
   but did much literary work thereafter, his published works numbering
   about forty. He died at Walthamstow, Essex, October 29, 1768. Two of
   his volumes were titled Miscellanies on Moral and Religious Subjects,
   1756, and Four Hymns on Divine Subjects Wherein the Patience and Love
   of Our Divine Saviour Is Displayed, 1765. In 1806 his hymns were
   collected and published; and again in 1861, nearly a century after his
   death, a second edition of his hymns was published by Dr. Sedgwick.
   Only two of his forty-three hymns are found generally in modern
   hymnals.

   Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, is justly regarded as one of the
   greatest and noblest figures in history. He was born at Stockholm in
   1594; was slain in the battle of Lützen November 6, 1632. His father
   died in 1611, and Gustavus ascended the throne of Sweden in his
   eighteenth year. In the Thirty Years' War, which began in 1618, he was
   hailed as the champion of Protestantism, and his untimely death at the
   age of thirty-eight years was an unspeakable loss to that cause. His
   armies were distinguished for bravery, discipline, and morality.
   Robbery and license were not allowed. Morning and evening the soldiers
   gathered around their regimental chaplains for prayer. On the morning
   of the battle of Lützen it is said the army sang Gustavus's battle
   bymn, "Fear not, O little flock, the foe." Such an army was a novelty
   in the history of war.

   Guyon, Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte, an eminent mystic writer of
   the seventeenth century, was born at Montargis, France, April 13, 1648.
   Her father, Claude Bouvier, was the Lord Proprietor of La Motte
   Vergonville. She was religiously inclined from her youth and desired to
   enter a convent; but her parents prevented this by giving her in
   marriage in her sixteenth year to Jacques Guyon, a man twenty-two years
   her senior and in every way uncongenial. Am unhappy married life of
   twelve years terminated in the death of her husband in 1676, leaving
   her three children, to whose education and to the care of her estate
   she now devoted herself. She later devoted herself to religious works
   and to writing on her peculiar views of spiritual religion. Her
   published volumes soon brought on her the persecution of the Roman
   Catholic Church. She was twice imprisoned, the first imprisonment
   lasting eight months and the second seven years, ending in the Bastile.
   After her release she lived with her children and continued her
   writings. Most of her hymns were written during this imprisonment.
   [76]Thirty-seven of the choicest of her hymns were translated by
   [77]Cowper. She was a strong believer in the witness of the Spirit,
   perfect faith, and perfect love. She died June 9, 1717, in her
   seventieth year. Deeply religious, enthusiastic and impassioned In the
   advocacy of her views, whether by tongue or pen, persecuted by enemies,
   and ardently loved by friends, she was one of the most remarkable women
   in the entire range of religious biography. Though criticized and
   persecuted by Romanists through well-nigh her whole life, she heard
   mass daily and died in full communion with the Church of Rome. Her
   published works fill forty volumes.

   Hall, Christopher Newman, an English Congregationalist minister, was
   born at Maidstone May 22, 1816. He was educated at the University of
   London, receiving the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1841. From 1842 to
   1854 he was minister at Albion Church, Hull. In 1854 he became the
   pastor of Surrey Chapel, London, and its successor, Christ Church,
   Westminster. He was the author of several prose works, and he edited
   the Christ Church Hymnal, 1876, to which he contributed eighty-two
   original hymns. His published volumes include the following: Hymns
   Composed at Bolton Abbey, 1858; Pilgrim Songs in Sunshine and Shade,
   1870; Songs of Earth and Heaven, 1886; Lyrics of a Long Life, 1894; and
   other volumes. His famous little tract, "Come to Jesus," has been
   translated into more than thirty different languages, and has reached a
   circulation of over three million. He died February 18, 1902.

   Hammond, William, a Moravian minister of England, was born at Battle,
   Sussex, January 6, 1719. He graduated at Cambridge in 1739. He was
   converted in 1740. He joined the Calvinistic Methodists in 1743, and
   began to preach. Two years later he united with the Moravians, and
   continued with them until his death. He died in London August 19, 1783,
   leaving an autobiography in Greek which has never been published. In
   1744 he published a volume titled Medulla Ecclesiae, which was
   considered of sufficient value and interest to be republished in
   England in 1779 and also in America in 1816 under the title The Marrow
   of the Church. In 1745 he published a volume of Psalms, Hymns, and
   Spiritual Songs, containing 161 original hymns, which are said to have
   been "much above the hymnology of the period." He was associated with
   [78]John Cennick, author of "Children of the heavenly King." About
   twelve of his hymns are in common use.

   Hankey, Katherine, is known to the public as the author of two of the
   most popular of modern hymns, She published The Old, Old Story in 1866,
   The Old, Old Story and Other Verses in 1879, and Heart to Heart in
   1870. Many editions of these small books were sold, and some of her
   hymns have been translated into many languages. They are full of
   sweetness and faith. Miss Hankey is said to be the daughter of an
   English banker. The date of her birth we have not been able to learn.
   We hope to be able to present later additional facts concerning the
   life of the author of the very popular hymn which here bears her name.
   The hymn beginning, "Tell me the old, old story," is scarcely less

   Hart, Joseph, a Congregational minister of England, was born in 1712 of
   pious parents. He was well educated, and was for many years a teacher
   of the classics. In early life he was pious, but relapsed into sin and
   exerted a most pernicious influence upon all with whom he associated.
   While in this backslidden state he wrote a pamphlet titled The
   Unreasonableness of Religion, Being Remarks and Animadversions on the
   Rev. John Wesley's Sermon on Romans viii. 32. But he was deeply
   convicted in his fortieth year, and betook himself to daily prayer and
   to reading the Scriptures. It was not, however, until he attended a
   service at the Moravian church in Fetter Lane, London, on Whitsunday,
   1757, that he obtained peace. He now became an earnest and consecrated
   Christian, and many of his best hymns were written within the next two
   years following his conversion. His Hymns Composed on Various Subjects,
   with the Author's Experience were published in several editions during
   his lifetime (first edition, 1759) and subsequent to his death. This
   volume led to his being importuned to become a preacher, which he did,
   although in his forty-eighth year, becoming pastor of an Independent
   congregation in Jewin Street, London, to which he ministered for eight
   years, "great crowds gathering to hear his fervid and eloquent
   discourses." He died May 24, 1768, in the midst of labors and successes
   almost unprecedented, his funeral being attended by twenty thousand
   people. Of his volume of Hymns a competent judge said: "Herein the
   doctrines of the gospel are illustrated so practically, the precepts of
   the Word enforced so evangelically, and their effects stated so
   experimentally that with propriety it may be styled a treasury of
   doctrinal, practical, and experimental divinity." One of the author's
   sons, who attained remarkable success as a barrister, was made a
   baronet by George IV., and was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

   Hastings, Thomas, editor, author, and Doctor of Music, was born at
   Washington, Conn., October 15, 1784. In youth he removed with his
   father to Northern New York, and pubsequently resided in New York City.
   He edited and largely contributed to the following works: Spiritual
   Songs, 1832; Christian Psalmist, 1836; The Mother's Hymn Book, 1849;
   and Devotional Hymns and Religious Poems, 1850; and he was also the
   editor of a number of music books. He died in New York May 15, 1872.
   "His aim," says Prof. F. M. Bird, "was the greater glory of God through
   better musical worship; and to this end he, was always training choirs,
   compiling works, and composing music."

   Hatch, Edwin, a Church of England clergyman, was born at Derby
   September 4, 1835. He graduated at Oxford in 1857. After spending some
   years in Canada, he returned to England and became in 1867 vice
   principal of St. Mary's Hall, Oxford. He delivered the Bampton Lectures
   in 1881 on "The Origin of Early Christian Churches." He was rector of
   Purleigh from 1883 till his death, November 10, 1889. His hymns and
   other poems were published in a posthumous volume titled Towards Fields
   of Light, 1890.

   Hatfield, Edwin Francis, a prominent clergyman of the Presbyterian
   Church, was born at Elizabethtown, N. J., January 9, 1807; was
   graduated at Middlebury College, and studied theology at Andover. He
   was ordained in 1832. He was a Pastor in St. Louis three years; in New
   York (Seventh Church) twenty-one years; and of North Church, in the
   same city, seven years. Failing health compelled him to give up the
   pastorate. Dr. Hatfield was an able writer and a useful man. He died at
   Summit, N. J., September 22, 1883. He is the author of a valuable and
   well-known volume titled The Poets of the Church, being a series of
   biographical sketches of hymn writers, with notes on their hymns. it
   was published in 1884, the year after his death.

   Havergal, Frances Ridley, the daughter of Canon W. H. Havergal, of the
   Church of England, was born at Astley, Worcestershire, December 14,
   1836. She is the most gifted and popular lady hymn writer that England
   has produced in the last half century, being the author of a larger
   number of hymns in this and other recent Church hymnals than any other
   woman. Her father was the author of about one hundred hymns, but was
   more distinguished as a musician and composer of Church music than as a
   poet. Everything that inheritance, a literary and musical environment,
   and a cultured Christian home could do to make a Christian singer and
   hymn writer belonged to Frances Havergal in her youth. "When fifteen
   years old," she says, "I committed my soul to the Saviour, and earth
   and heaven seemed brighter from that moment." This was the beginning of
   a beautiful Christian life. Her knowledge of Hebrew and Greek and
   modern languages was extensive. Few poets have consecrated their gifts
   of head and heart and pen more fully to Christ than she did, and few
   lives ending at forty-three years of age have left behind more pleasing
   and precious literary treasures than are found in her poems of
   Christian faith and love and service. She died at Caswall Bay, Swansea,
   June 3, 1879. Her popularity and influence as an author and hymn writer
   have steadily increased ever since her death. About seventy-five of her
   hymns are in common use, and are taken from her various volumes: The
   Ministry of Song, 1869; Twelve Sacred Songs for Little Singers, 1870;
   Under the Surface, 1874; Loyal Besponses, 1878; Life Mosaics, 1879;
   Life Chords, 1880; Life Echoes, 1883; Poems, 1884. Eight of her hymns
   are contained in this collection. (See note to No. 648.)

   Haweis, Hugh Reginald, an eminent author and clergyman of the Church of
   England, son of Rev. J. W. O. Haweis, canon of Chichester, was born in
   1838 at Egham, Surrey. He graduated at Cambridge in 1861. For many
   years before his death he was incumbent of St. James's, Marylebone,
   London. He was a skilled musician, and drilled and led his own choir of
   boys and men. He was the author of many volumes, among them My Musical
   Life, 1886, and Music and Morals, 1871 (fifteenth edition, 1888). He
   was for a time editor of Cassell's Magazine. He died in 1901. It is
   very doubtful whether Dr. Haweis is properly credited with the hymn
   here attributed to him.

   Hawker, Robert, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born at
   Exeter, England, in 1753, and was educated for the medical profession,
   becoming a doctor of medicine. After taking holy orders, he became
   incumbent of a Church in Plymouth, and remained there until his death,
   April 6, 1827. He was noted as a polemical preacher and writer, and
   also as the author and compiler of one of the earliest and most popular
   of the hymn books for children called forth by the Sunday school
   movement. His Psalms and Hymns Sung by the Sunday School (published
   about 1787) passed through thirteen editions. His most famous hymn is
   the doxology found in this Hymnal:

   Lord, dismiss us with thy blessing 723

   Hawks, Annie Sherwood, has written a number of hymns, some of them very
   popular, but no other so widely useful as "I need thee every hour,"
   found in this book. Mrs. Hawks was born in Hoosick, N. Y., May 28,
   1835. For many years she resided in Brooklyn, N. Y., where this hymn
   was written in 1872. She was a member of the Baptist Church in
   Brooklyn, of which Rev. Robert Lowry, the musical composer and hymn
   writer, was pastor. We hope to be able to supplement these brief facts
   at some later time with additional information concerning the author of
   this popular hymn.

   Hay, John, the late Secretary of State under Presidents McKinley and
   Roosevelt, was a poet as well as a diplomat and statesman. He was born
   at Salem, Ind., October 8, 1838; graduated in 1858 at Brown University;
   entered the legal profession in Illinois, and became private secretary
   to President Lincoln, which position he resigned to enter the Union
   army in the Civil War. In the diplomatic service he represented the
   United States successively at Paris, Madrid, and Vienna; and in 1897-98
   he was Ambassador to the Court of St. James. He was First Assistant
   Secretary of State in 1879-81, and in 1898 he was called home from
   England to fill the most responsible office in the government,
   excepting only that of the chief executive, being Secretary of State
   from 1898 until his death, July 1, 1905. In addition to a voluminous
   life of Abraham Lincoln in ten volumes (in connection with J. G.
   Nicolay), 1887, he published Castilian Days, 1871; Pike County Ballads,
   1871; and Poems, 1890. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church.
   Three of his poems are used as hymns in modern Church hymnals. His hymn
   on "Sinai and Calvary" is possessed of more than ordinary merit, and
   shows that a great statesman may rightly estimate the moral value and
   lessons of both the law and the gospel.

   Hayward. It is to be regretted that nothing is known of the author of
   the beautiful hymn beginning "Welcome, delightful morn," except that
   his name is given as "Hayward" is Dobell's New Selection of Evangelical
   Hymns, published in 1806. It is possible, but not probable, that some
   facts may yet come to light bearing upon the authorship of this hymn,
   now more than a century old.

   Hearn, Marianne, was born at Farningham, Kent, England, December 17,
   1834; and died at Barmouth March 16, 1909. She was a member of the
   Baptist Church. She was on the editorial staff of the religious
   periodical called the Christian World, and was also editor of the
   Sunday School Times (of England). She wrote under the nom de plume of
   "Marianne Farningham." She published volumes titled: Lays and Lyrics of
   the Blessed Life, 1861; Poems, 1865; Morning and Evening Hymns for the
   Week, 1870; Song of Sunshine, 1878; and Harvest Gleanings and Gathered
   Fragments, 1903. She is most widely known as the author of a popular
   hymn sung by Mr. Ira D. Sankey, titled "Waiting and Watching for Me."
   At her death she was one of the most greatly beloved and honored women
   in the Baptist Church in England.

   Heath, George, an Englishman, was born about 1745. He was the pastor of
   a Presbyterian Church at Honiton, Devon, in 1770; died in 1822. He was
   the author of Hymns and Poetic Essays Sacred to the Public and Private
   Worship of the Deity, and to Religious and Christian Improvement,
   Bristol, 1781. According to Hatfield, Duffield, and other authorities,
   Heath "proved unworthy of his office as a Presbyterian pastor and lost
   his position by bad conduct." He later, it seems, became a Unitarian
   minister. "It is a striking commentary on his hymn," says Duffield,
   "that its author should have failed in the very mode against which his
   stirring trumpet blast ought effectually to have warned him. But let us
   be charitable and hope that this was one of the fruits of true
   repentance, for the hymn was published in 1781."

   Heber, Reginald a bishop of the Church of England, was born at Malpas
   April 21, 1783. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he
   early took the prize for both Latin and English poems; ordained in
   1807, and became rector at Hodnet. He was Missionary Bishop of Calcutta
   from 1823 until his death, April 3, 1826. He was a man of learning and
   piety. He was Bampton lecturer in 1815. His hymns are among the most
   popular in the language. They were collected and published the year
   after his death under the title Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly
   Church Service of the Year, 1827. All of Bishop Heber's hymns were
   written while he was at Hodnet. He tried in 1820 to secure from
   Archbishop Manners Sutton and the Bishop of London official episcopal
   authorization for the use of his manuscript hymns in the Church, but
   they declined to grant it. But the whole Christian world has done what
   the prelates of the Church would not do. His authorship of our most
   popular missionary hymn and his early and pathetic death as Missionary
   Bishop of India have made his name "as ointment poured forth" in the
   annals of modern Christian missions.

   Hedge, Frederick Henry, a Unitarian divine, professor and author of
   note, was born at Cambridge, Mass., December 12, 1805. He graduated at
   Harvard College in 1825, and at the Theological School, Cambridge, in
   1828. For a number of years he was the pastor of Unitarian Churches. In
   1857 he became Professor of Ecclesiastical History in the Divinity
   School, and in 1872 Professor of German Literature at Harvard, which
   place he held many years. In 1853 he and Dr. F. D. Huntingdon (who
   later became a bishop in the Episcopal Church) prepared a volume titled
   Hymns for the Church of Christ, for use in Unitarian Churches. Dr.
   Hedge was for some years one of the editors of the Christian Examiner.
   His Prose Writers of Germany, 1848, is a standard work. He did much to
   introduce and popularize German scholarship and literature in this
   country. Dr. Hedge died at Cambridge August 21, 1890. Of some eight or
   more hymns and translations by him, we have but one in our Hymnal--a
   translation--but it is one of the best in the entire collection.

   1593; was graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge; was a pastor at
   Layton Ecclesia, in 1626, and at Bemerton from 1630 to his death, in
   1632. He occupied his moments of leisure in the cultivation of sacred
   music. The following hymn is in keeping with the spirit of consecration
   and the heavenly-mindedness that marked his Christian life:

   Holland, Josiah Gilbert, an eminent American editor and author, was
   born in Belchertown, Mass., July 24, 1819. He was a farmer's son, and
   his early educational advantages were poor. He succeeded in attending a
   high school at Northampton for a time. At the age of twenty-one he
   began the study of medicine, and graduated with the degree of M.D. at
   Berkshire Medical College, Pittsfield, Mass., in 1844. A short practice
   of his profession developed a dislike for it, and he turned to
   literature. About 1850 he became connected with the Springfield
   Republican, a position which he held fifteen years. He was a voluminous
   author. Among his works we find: Timothy Titcomb's Letters, 1858; Gold
   Foil, 1859; Life of Abraham Lincoln, 1865; Bitter Sweet, a dramatic
   poem, 1858; Kathrina, 1867; Arthur Bonnicastle, 1873. In connection
   with the Scribners in 1870 he founded Scribner's Monthly, of which
   periodical he became the editor, and continued in this relation until
   his death, in New York City, October 12, 1881.

   Holmes, Oliver Wendell, the eminent American poet and man of letters,
   was the son of Rev. Abiel Holmes, D.D., a Congregational minister, and
   was born in Cambridge, Mass., August 29, 1809. He was graduated at
   Harvard in 1829, then made a thorough study of medicine at home and
   abroad, was elected Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth in
   1838, and in 1847 was elected to the same chair at Harvard, which
   position he filled until 1882, when he became emeritus professor. He
   lived to the advanced age of eighty-five and continued to do literary
   work almost to the end. He died October 7, 1894. He published many
   volumes during his life, and is one of the most widely known of
   American authors. His writings abound in pathos and humor. He was a
   Unitarian in faith. Dr. Holmes wrote only a few hymns, some half a
   dozen of which are found in modern hymnals, the three here found being
   perhaps his best.

   Zealand, Denmark, from 1822 till his death, in 1862. The only hymn by
   him in common use is that found in this volume; but it possesses more
   than ordinary merit, and is widely known in its English dress. It
   brings out very forcibly the brotherhood of man and the expectation of
   the Christian believer. Seven of his hymns have been translated into
   English. His collected works were published in thirty-four volumes in
   1851.

   18, 1883. His most valuable prose work was his Bampton Lectures, 1870,
   on "Christianity as Taught by St. Paul." He was also the editor or
   author of several books of hymns. Dr. Julian says of him: "Amongst
   modern hymn writers Dr. Irons ranks with the first. His hymns have not
   been largely used outside of his own congregation, but their high
   excellence, variety of subjects and meters, intense earnestness,
   powerful grasp of the subject, and almost faultless rhythm must commend
   them to the notice of hymn book compilers."

   keeper of the Royal German Chapel, St. James's Palace, London, from
   1708 till his death, December 14, 1750. He published in 1720 a volume
   titled A Collection of Hymns, Translated front the High Dutch. It
   contained fifteen hymns. Two years later, it was republished in
   enlarged form under the title Psalmodia Germanica; or, A Specimen of
   Divine Hymns. Translated from the High Dutch. This edition contained
   sixty-two hymns. The hymn here given is a translation of one of
   [80]Paul Gerhardt's hymns.

   Jacopone da Todi, also known as Jacobus de Benedictis, an Italian monk
   and poet, was born at Todi, in Umbria, early in the thirteenth century.
   "He was descended from a noble family," says Julian, "and for some time
   led a secular life. Some remarkable circumstances which attended the
   violent death of his wife led him to withdraw himself from the world
   and to enter the order of St. Francis, in which he remained as a lay
   brother till his death, at an advanced age, in 1306. His zeal led him
   to attack the religious abuses of the day. This brought him into
   conflict with Pope Boniface VIII., the result being his imprisonment
   for long periods." His oddities, eccentricities, and extravagances were
   such as to leave neighbors in doubt as to whether he was of a sound
   mind. Tradition at Todi, his birthplace, credits him with the
   authorship of the famous Latin hymn, "Stabat mater dolorosa," but it is
   by no means certain that he wrote it.

   John of Damascus was the greatest theologian and poet of the Greek
   Church. His active life belonged to the eighth century, but the exact
   dates of his birth and death are unknown. His work on theology,
   Doctrines of the Orthodox Church, is still a standard textbook in the
   Eastern Church. He was famous as a philosopher and as an opponent of
   the Iconoclasts of his time. Late in life he was ordained priest of the
   Church at Jerusalem.

   Johnson, E., is known only as the author of the hymn here attributed to
   him. We shall welcome any information concerning him or his hymn that
   may be in the possession of any one who may read these lines. The
   popular tune to which this hymn is sung was composed by William G.
   Fischer, who found the words in a newspaper. It is to be hoped that
   some facts concerning Mr. Johnson and his hymn may come to light in
   time to be incorporated in later editions of this volume. The hymn
   reads as if it had been called forth by an experience of suffering or
   sorrow, as if the author had learned in suffering what he teaches in
   song. It is, as a rule, only when storms and floods come that one flees
   for refuge to "the Rock that is higher than I."

   Johnson, Samuel, an Independent preacher, was born in Salem, Mass.,
   October 10, 1822; was graduated at Harvard College in 1842, and at
   Cambridge Divinity School in 1846. In 1853 he established an
   Independent Church at Lynn, Mass., and continued as its pastor until
   1870. Although independent in Church relations, he was associated in
   the public mind with the Unitarians. He was a man of strong intellect,
   a voluminous writer, and published many pamphlets and books. In
   connection with [81]Rev. Samuel Longfellow, he compiled a Book of
   Hymns, 1846, and Hymns of the Spirit, 1864. He died in 1882. "His
   contributions to these collections," says Prof. F. M. Bird, "were less
   numerous but not less meritorious than those by Mr. Longfellow."

   Jones, Edmund, an English Baptist minister, son of Rev. Philip Jones,
   was born in 1722 in Gloucestershire; educated at the Baptist College at
   Bristol; was ordained pastor of the Baptist Church at Exeter,
   Devonshire, in 1743; died April 15, 1765. The Church at Exeter, like
   many Baptist Churches at that day, was opposed to "the service of song"
   in public worship, but it is not a matter of surprise that the author
   of so excellent a hymn as the following should have wrought a complete
   revolution in their sentiments regarding this feature of divine
   worship. in 1760 he published a volume titled Sacred Poems.

   Julian, John, an eminent English clergyman, was born at St. Agnes, in
   Cornwall, January 27, 1839; was educated privately; took orders in the
   Church of England in 1866; was vicar of Wincobanck, 1876-1905; since
   1905, vicar of Topcliff. He received M.A. from Durham University, 1887;
   D.D. from Lambeth, 1894; LL.D. from Howard University, Washington,
   1894. Dr. Julian was editor in chief of the Dictionary of Hymnology,
   published in London and New York in 1892. A second edition of this
   great and invaluable work, with a new supplement, was published in
   1907. This Dictionary is the most important work ever published in
   English hymnology. It is a truly monumental work, and to it all who now
   study or write in the department of hymnology must go for information
   not to be found in any other volume. Dr. Julian has also published
   volumes titled: Concerning Hymns, 1874; History of the Use of Hymns in
   Public Worship, and Their Proper Characteristics, 1894; Carols, Ancient
   and Modern, 1900. He is the author of several hymns and translations
   found in English hymnals. A few years ago he presented his large
   collection of hymnological books and manuscripts to the Church House,
   Dean's Yard, London, where it forms the hymnological department of the
   library.

   Keble, John, author of The Christian Year, was the son of a clergyman
   of the same name belonging to the Church of England, and was born April
   25, 1792. He was graduated at Oxford in 1810, and was ordained in 1815.
   In 1827 he published his well-known volume, The Christian Year,
   ninety-six editions of which appeared before his death. In 1831 he was
   elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford. A sermon preached by him on
   "National Apostacy" has been regarded as he real origin of the
   "tractarian movement in 1833." He wrote eight of the "Tracts for the
   Times." He was a pronounced High-Churchman. He was a contributor to the
   Lyra Apostolica, and in 1834 he united with Drs. [82]Newman and Pusey
   in editing the Library of the Fathers. He was the author of several
   volumes, among them A Metrical Version of the Psalms, 1839, and Lyra
   Innocentium, 1846. He died March 29, 1866.

   Keen, R., was a leader of music in the Baptist Church in London, of
   which Dr. John Rippon (1751-1836) was pastor, and in whose volume
   titled A Selection of Hymns from the Best Authors, 1787, the hymn
   beginning "How firm a foundation" was first published. The tune
   accompanying this hymn was composed by R. Keen (also spelled "Keene" in
   some collections), and the letter "K" is signed to the hymn. In a
   Baptist Collection of Hymns published by Dr. A. Fletcher in 1822 the
   signature at the end of the hymn is "Kn," and in the 1835 edition of
   Fletcher's Collection it is given as "Keen." Dr. Fletcher was assisted
   in the preparation of his hymn book by Thomas Walker, who was the
   compiler of the Tune Book accompanying Dr. Rippon's Selection, and who
   therefore not only knew Keen, but also knew, we may safely infer, what
   the "K" stood for at the end of this now famous hymn. Dr. Rippon was
   also living in 1835, when Fletcher and Walker assigned this hymn to
   Keen. Putting all these facts together, it is not strange that Dr.
   Julian and other hymnologists have reached the conclusion that this
   hymn should be assigned to Keen and not to Kirkham (as in modern
   editions of Rippon's Selection, published since Dr. Rippon's death) or
   to George Keith, as was done by Daniel Sedgwick and others, acting
   wholly in doing so on the questionable testimony of an old woman in an
   almshouse. In view of these facts, we feel justified in giving Keen a
   place among the hymn writers of the Church. We await the discovery of
   information concerning him.

   Kelly, Thomas, the son of Right Hon. Baron Kelly, was born in Dublin,
   Ireland, July 13, 1769; was graduated at Trinity College, Dublin
   University; studied law. but abandoned it in 1793 to enter the ministry
   of the Established Church. His evangelical and heart-searching
   preaching proved too strong for the Established Church, and he was
   forbidden by Archbishop Fowler to preach in the city. For some time he
   preached in two "unconsecrated places" in Dublin, and then he left the
   Established Church and became an Independent. He was very wealthy, and
   as liberal as he was wealthy. He was a most pious, consecrated, and
   useful preacher. He labored in Dublin for more than sixty years, and
   lived to be eighty-five years old. He died May 14, 1854. His Scripture
   Hymns grew from a volume of ninety-six hymns as first published in 1804
   to a collection of 765 in 1853, all original.

   Ken, Thomas, a bishop of the Church of England, one of the gentlest,
   truest, and grandest men of his age, was born in Berkhampstead,
   England, in July, 1637; was educated at Winchester School and Oxford
   University, graduating B.A. in 1661. He held several livings in
   different parts of England. In 1680 he returned to Winchester. In 1685
   he was appointed by Charles H. Bishop of Bath and Wells. In connection
   with six other bishops, he refused to publish the "Declaration of
   Indulgence" issued by James II. in 1688, and was imprisoned in the
   Tower of London. After the revolution he became a nonjuror for
   conscience' sake, was superseded in office, and spent the rest of his
   life in retirement. He died March 19, 1711, at the residence of his
   friend, Lord Weymouth. In 1695 he published A Manual of Prayers for the
   Use of the Scholars of Winchester College and All Other Devout
   Christians, to Which Is Added Three Hymns for Morning, Evening, and
   Midnight.

   Kethe, William, was a Scotch divine of the sixteenth century. The exact
   dates of his birth and death are unknown. He is the author of the
   English versions of twenty-seven Psalms found in the Anglo-Genevan
   Psalter, 1561. The hundredth Psalm was one of these. He lived in the
   days that tried men's souls, being one of that heroic number of
   Protestants that were driven in exile to Frankfurt and Geneva about the
   middle of the sixteenth century. There is no more unique, quaint, and
   interesting hymn in our Hymnal than the version of the one hundredth
   Psalm which we owe to William Kethe.

   Kimball, Harriet McEwen, was born at Portsmouth, N. H., in November,
   1834. She is a member of the Roman Catholic Church and the author of
   both sacred and secular verse. Among her publications are: Hymns, 1866;
   Swallow Flights of Song, 1874; Poems (complete edition), 1889. Miss
   Kimball is the chief founder of the Cottage Hospital at Portsmouth,
   where she still resides.

   Kipling, Rudyard, the well-known English poet, was born at Bombay,
   India, December 30, 1865. His father, John Lockwood Kipling (a retired
   officer of the British Indian Educational Service, now living at
   Salisbury, England), is a son of the late Rev. Joseph Kipling and Alice
   Macdonald Kipling (a daughter of Rev. G. B. Macdonald, a Wesleyan
   minister). It thus appears that the grandfather of the poet, both on
   his father's and his mother's side, was a clergyman. There is no more
   familiar and honored name in contemporaneous English literature than
   that of Rudyard Kipling. His writings are so numerous, so well known,
   and so widely read as not to need mention here. He is a Christian
   patriot in the highest sense, his poems making for international peace
   and universal brotherhood among men. Most notable among the poems that
   promote this larger patriotism and international Christian altruism
   among men may be mentioned "The White Man's Burden" and "The
   Recessional," which is rapidly finding its place in all the great
   hymnals of the modern Church. What Kipling has done as a poet is so
   marked by poetic genius and moral strength as to make the English
   people hope for and expect yet greater contributions in the future
   perhaps than anything he has yet written. He resides at Burwash,
   Sussex, England.

   Lanier, Sidney, an American poet, was born at Macon, Ga., February 3,
   1842. He was educated at Oglethorpe College, Ga., where he was
   graduated in 1860. He was a private in the Confederate army during the
   Civil War (1861-65); was captured in 1863, spending several months in a
   Federal prison, and his first published volume, titled Tiger Lilies,
   1867, was founded on his experiences in prison. After the close of the
   war he was a clerk, a teacher, and a lawyer; but being by nature a
   musician and a poet, he found any calling but that of literature and
   music irksome to him. He was noted as a flute-player, and many of his
   best poems are enriched by his rare knowledge of music. In 1877 he was
   appointed lecturer on English Literature in Johns Hopkins University,
   and two of his most scholarly volumes contain lectures delivered
   there--viz., The Science of English Verse, 1880, and The English Novel,
   1883. His Poems were first published in 1876, and a complete edition
   after his death. After a hard struggle against the inroads of
   consumption, he died September 7, 1881, in Western North Carolina,
   where he had gone in search of health. Many of his finest poems were
   written when he was almost too weak to guide his pen. He is regarded as
   the greatest of Southern poets. The latest and best life of Lanier is
   that of Prof. Edwin Mims, and the best study of his poems for the
   distinctly Christian teaching they contain is found in a volume by
   President H. N. Snyder. Both Dr. Mims and Dr. Snyder were members of
   the Commission that prepared this Hymnal. Lanier was a lover of nature
   scarcely less than Wordsworth, and much of what he taught in song he
   learned in suffering. His love of nature and his deep devotion to
   Christ, the great sufferer, are beautifully brought out in the little
   gem here selected from his poems.

   Lathbury, Mary Artemisia, the daughter of Rev. John Lathbury, a
   Methodist minister, was born in Manchester, N. Y., August 10, 1841. Two
   of her brothers, Albert Augustus and Clarence Lathbury, are ministers
   of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Her present address is East Orange,
   N. J. After leaving school she became an art teacher, and later engaged
   in editorial work. For many years her work has been in general
   literature and illustration, being editor of a picture lesson paper.
   Miss Lathbury is the author of some eight or ten small volumes, but she
   is most widely and favorably known through her songs and hymns, which
   were composed especially for use in the religious exercises at
   Chautauqua. Among the new hymns added by the compilers to the Methodist
   Hymnal none are more universally admired than the two short hymns from
   her pen found in this collection. In both cases the tunes are
   beautifully suited to the sentiment of the hymns. It could be wished
   that we had a dozen or more hymns from her pen in our Hymnal if all of
   them could be as poetic and devotional as these two beautiful lyrics.

   Paraphrases and Hymns for Congregational Singing, 1853. Miss Leeson had
   rare gifts in writing for children. She died in 1882. It is hoped that
   we may obtain additional facts concerning her life to add to this
   meager sketch, which embodies all that is at present known of her.

   connected with the Religious Tract Society in 1816. He prepared a large
   number of small books for the use of children, writing, editing, or
   compiling them. He began the Sunday School Teacher's Magazine. His
   Thoughts in Rhyme, a book of one hundred and six pages, was published
   in London in 1851. Mr. Lloyd died April 22, 1853.

   Longfellow, Samuel, a Unitarian minister, brother of the poet Henry W.
   Longfellow, was born in Portland, Me., June 18, 1819. He was graduated
   at Harvard in 1839, and at the Divinity School, Cambridge, in 1846. His
   first Church was at Fall River, Mass. In 1853 he was installed pastor
   of the Second Unitarian Church in Brooklyn, N. Y., where he remained
   until 1860. After that he did not serve as a regular pastor. He
   preached occasionally and engaged in a variety of literary labor. He
   died at Portland, Me., October 3, 1892. In connection with the [83]Rev.
   Samuel Johnson, he compiled A Book of Hymns, 1846, and Hymns of the
   Spirit, 1864. Three of his hymns appear in this book. They are of far
   more than average merit.

   Juvenile Magazine. She published a volume titled The Female Jesuit in
   1851 and A Memoir of Eliza Ann Harris, of Clifton, in 1859, but her
   name is known to the Christian world almost wholly through the one hymn
   found in this volume. Mrs. Luke died February 2, 1906.

   Luther, Martin, the hero of the Reformation, was born in the village of
   Eisleben November 10, 1483; entered the University at Erfurt in 1501,
   and was graduated with honor, receiving the degree of Doctor of
   Philosophy. In 1505 he entered an Augustinian monastery at Erfurt, was
   consecrated to the priesthood in 1507, and was very faithful to all the
   regulations of the order. He afterwards said: "If ever a monk got to
   heaven by monkery, I was determined to get there." He was a diligent
   scholar, and in 1508 was called to the chair of Philosophy in the
   University of Wittenberg. In 1512 he received the degree of Doctor of
   Theology. In the meantime he made a pilgrimage to Rome, where he saw
   much corruption among the clergy; but still his faith was strong in the
   Roman Church. It was the shameless sale of indulgences by Tetzel,
   authorized by Leo X., that first opened his eyes and determined him to
   make public opposition. On October 31, 1517, at midday, Luther posted
   his ninety-five Theses against the Merits of Indulgences on the church
   door at Wittenberg. That day was the birthday of the Reformation. The
   burning of the pope's bull of excommunication in 1520, the Diet of
   Worms in 1521, Luther's concealment in the castle at Wartburg, and his
   marriage in 1525 are matters of interest upon which we cannot dwell. It
   was during his Wartburg captivity that he translated the New Testament,
   published in 1522, into the mother tongue of the German people. After
   giving them the Scriptures he felt the need of psalms and hymns in the
   German language, and employed others to supply them. He himself
   translated psalms and wrote hymns, to some of which he adapted tunes.
   Luther wove the gospel into these hymns. They were gladly received and
   widely circulated. A Romanist of the time wrote: "The whole people is
   singing itself into this Lutheran doctrine." The first collection of
   Luther's hymns was published in 1524. He died February 18, 1546. Few
   things can stir Protestants like the singing of "Luther's hymn" (No.
   101).

   Lynch, Thomas Toke, an English Congregational minister, was born at
   Dunmow, Essex, July 5, 1818, and was educated at Islington and at
   Highbury Independent College. He was pastor of a small Church at
   Highgate in 1847 to 1849, and from 1849 to 1852 of a congregation on
   Mortimer Street, London, that later moved to Fitzroy Square. He was an
   invalid for three years (1856-59), but resumed pastoral relations in
   1860 with his former parishioners, who completed a new place of worship
   (Mornington Church) on Hampstead Road, London, in 1862, where he
   continued to preach until his death, May 9, 1871. His hymns were
   published in a volume titled The Rivulet, a Contribution to Sacred
   Song, which appeared in several editions, 1855-68. W. G. Horder gives
   the following discriminating estimate of Lynch's merits and influence
   as a hymn writer:

   The influence of Lynch's ministry was great, and reached far beyond his
   own congregation, since it included many students from the theological
   colleges of London and thoughtful men from other Churches, who were
   attracted to him by the freshness and spirituality of his preaching.
   His prose works were numerous. . . . His hymns are marked by intense
   individuality, gracefulness and felicity of diction, picturesqueness,
   spiritual freshness, and the sadness of a powerful soul struggling with
   a weak and emaciated body.

   The publication of his Rivulet caused one of the most bitter
   hymnological controversies known in the annals of modern
   Congregationalism. Time, however, and a criticism broader and more just
   have declared emphatically in favor of his hymns as valuable
   contributions to cultured sacred song.

   It is to be regretted that only one of his twenty-five hymns is found
   in our Hymnal.

   Lyte, Henry Francis, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born at
   Ednam, near Kelso, Scotland, June 1, 1793. He was educated at Trinity
   College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1814. During his college course
   he won the prize for the best English poem on three occasions. He took
   orders in the Church of England in 1815. In 1818, at Marazion, in
   Cornwall, he experienced a great spiritual change which influenced all
   his after life. This was occasioned by visits to a brother clergyman
   who was sick, and who died happy, trusting alone in the atonement and
   power of his Saviour. Lyte wrote concerning himself: "I was greatly
   affected by the whole matter, and brought to look at life and its issue
   with a different eye than before; and I began to study my Bible and
   preach in another manner than I had previously done." In 1823 he was
   appointed curate at Lower Brixham, which living he held until his
   death, November 20, 1847. His hymns are spiritual and tender. They are
   found mostly in two books: Poems, Chiefly Religious, 1833 (second
   edition, 1845), and The Spirit of the Psalms, 1834 (enlarged edition,
   1836). He died of consumption under pathetic circumstances while on a
   visit to Nice, a winter health resort in Southern France, where he lies
   buried. His swan song, "Abide with me," is used by all Christendom.

   Macduff, John Ross, a Presbyterian minister, was born at Bonhard, near

   Edinburgh and in the university of the same city. He became a minister
   of the Church of Scotland in 1842. Among his pastorates was one of
   fifteen years in the city of Glasgow. In 1871 Dr. Macduff gave up the
   pastoral relation. He is the author of a number of volumes in prose and
   poetry, some of which have great practical and devotional value and
   have a wide circulation. Most of his hymns appeared in his Altar
   Stones, 1853, and in The Gates of Praise, 1876. He died April 30, 1895.
   The Universities of Glasgow and of New York each conferred on him the
   degree of Doctor of Divinity.

   Londoun, Ayrshire; in 1843, of Dalkeith; and in 1851, of the Barony,
   Glasgow. In 1841 he was appointed as one of the queen's chaplains, and
   in 1860 he became the editor of Good Words, which he continued to edit
   until his death, at Glasgow on June 16, 1872. He is the author of
   numerous published volumes, several of which have attained great
   popularity. He was one of the most widely known and influential
   ministers of the Established Church of Scotland. He has but one hymn
   that has come into common use:

   Courage, brother! do not stumble 513

   Madan, Martin, was born in 1726, and designed to become a member of the
   English bar; but through the influence of a sermon by [84]John Wesley
   on the text, "Prepare to meet thy God," he was converted, and at length
   became a clergyman in the Church of England. He died in 1790. Ile was
   the editor of a small but famous hymn book: A Collection of Psalms and
   Hymns Extracted from Various Authors, London, 1760. Several editions of
   this book were published, and its influence was important in English
   hymnody. Madan was a popular preacher and a composer of several psalm
   tunes used in his day. His name appears in this book only in connection
   with one of the hymns of [85]Isaac Watts.

   Malan, Henri Abraham Caesar, was born in Geneva in 1787. He was a
   precocious child and a man of genius. In 1810 he was consecrated to the
   ministry, and was appointed to preach in the cathedral at Geneva that
   Calvin had formerly occupied. This influential Presbytery had become
   rationalistic and Socinian. Malan was led to see its errors, became
   orthodox in faith and experience, and in 1818 was in consequence
   dismissed from the Established Church. He continued to preach, write,
   and labor with great zeal and success until his death, in 1864. Dr.
   Malan was a composer of music as well as a hymn writer. Three of his
   tunes are found in the Hymnal.

   March, Daniel, an American Congregational minister, was born at
   Millbury, Mass., in 1816. He graduated at Yale in 1843, was ordained in
   the Presbyterian ministry in 1845, and joined the Congregational Church
   later. He was a pastor in Philadelphia in 1868 at the time he wrote the
   hymn found in this volume. He is the author of a widely circulated
   volume titled Night Scenes in the Bible, 1869, and of other popular
   prose works. He died at Woburn, Mass., March 2, 1909.

   Marcy, Elizabeth Eunice, was born at Eastham, Conn., December 22, 1821.
   She was the wife of Oliver Marcy, LL.D., Professor of Natural History

   and where Mrs. Marcy also died January 26, 1911.

   Marriott, John, a clergyman of the Church of England, was the son of a
   clergyman, and was born in 1780; was educated at Rugby and Oxford; took
   holy orders in 1803; served various parishes; and died at his home,
   near Exeter, March 31, 1825. He was a friend of [86]Sir Walter Scott,
   who dedicated the second canto of his Marmion to him. His Sermons were
   published in 1838. Two other hymns by him have been published, but the
   only one that is in common use is that here given, which is a Christian
   lyric of great value.

   Thou, whose almighty word 629

   Marsden, Joshua, a Wesleyan minister, was born in 1777, and died in
   1837. His early educational advantages were very limited, and he did
   not, it seems, make the most of such as he had. He was a wild,
   thoughtless, and wicked boy. At the age of eighteen he enlisted in the
   British navy and grew more reckless than ever. But at length, he says,
   "the grace of God that bringeth salvation turned my feet into the way
   of peace." He became a missionary to Nova Scotia, and afterwards to the
   Bermuda Islands. He was the author of several books. His poems were
   entitled The Amusements of a Mission, 1812.

   Go, ye messengers of God 640

   Mason, John, an earnest and pious clergyman of the English Church, was
   the son of a Dissenting minister; lived in the seventeenth century; was
   graduated at Cambridge in 1664; and died at the rectory of
   Water-Stratford, Buckinghamshire, in 1694. His Spiritual Songs were
   published in 1683. He was the best English hymn writer preceding
   [87]Watts, and many think they can detect his influence upon Watts and
   [88]Wesley. [89]Richard Baxter styled him "the glory of the Church of
   England," and said that "the frame of his spirit was so heavenly, his
   deportment so humble and obliging, his discourse of spiritual things so
   weighty, with such apt words and delightful air, that it charmed all
   that had any spiritual relish." This character well befits the author
   of a hymn so deeply devotional and truly spiritual as the one here
   given.

   Massie, Richard, an Englishman, was born at Chester June 18, 1800, the
   son of Rev. R. Massie. He translated Martin Luther's Spiritual Songs,
   1854. His Lyra Domestica, London, 1860, was translated from
   [90]Spitta's Psaltery and Harp. In 1864 he published a second volume
   containing more of Spitta's hymns and other translations from the
   German. He died March 11, 1887. He belonged to the Church of England.

   Matheson, George, an able and greatly honored minister of the Church of
   Scotland, was born March 27, 1842. He entered Glasgow University in
   1857, when he was but fifteen years of age. He spent nine years at the
   university--five years in the arts and four years in the study of
   divinity. He was licensed to preach in 1866. Dr. Matheson, as is well
   known, was entirely blind during the greater portion of his life. He
   was probably born with defective sight--at least his mother discovered
   this fact when he was eighteen months old. In his early boyhood, by
   using strong glasses and a strong light, he managed to read; but his
   sight continued to fail, and when he entered the university, at the age
   of fifteen and one-half years, he was almost blind and had to depend
   upon the sight of others. He died August 28, 1906. He was never
   married. His life was full of literary activity. His contributions to
   the literature of theology are among the ablest and most widely read
   volumes that have appeared from the English press since 1874, when he
   published his first volume. Considering the limitations under which he
   had to do his work, his industry and productiveness were marvelous; and
   the strength and quality of his work were as notable as the number and
   frequency of his publications. Among his twenty-five published volumes
   one was titled Sacred Songs, 1890 (third edition, 1904). About a dozen
   of Dr. Matheson's songs have found a place in Church hymnals, but only
   one has gained universal popularity. This song of resignation, love,
   and trust is one that only a great sufferer could write.

   McDonald, William, a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, was
   born at Belmont, Me., in 1820. He joined the Miami Conference in 1843;
   served various pastoral charges in the North and West. Dr. McDonald was
   a prominent member of the National Holiness Association. For several
   years he was the editor of the Christian Witness, published in Boston.
   From 1870 till his death he did much evangelistic work. He was an able
   and worthy man, interested in Church music, and the publisher of
   several small volumes of hymns for social worship. He died in 1901.

   Medley, Samuel, a Baptist minister, was born in Hertfordshire, England,
   June 23, 1738; was surrounded by pious influences in early life, but
   became a careless and wicked youth; joined the navy, and was severely
   wounded. Some one about this time chanced to read to him a sermon by
   [91]Dr. Isaac Watts, which led to his conversion. After his recovery he
   entered the ministry. For the last twenty-seven years of his life he
   was the popular and influential pastor of a large Baptist Church in
   Liverpool. He died July 17, 1799. His hymns, two hundred and thirty in
   number, were collected and published the following year under the title
   of Medley's Hymns. "The charm of Medley's hymns consists less in their
   poetry than in the warmth and occasional pathos with which they give
   expression to Christian experience."

   Messenger, John Alexander, is the name that appears in D'Aubigne's
   History of the Reformation as the translator of a stanza of one of
   Luther's hymns. The translation was made about 1840. We have no

   be learned that may be inserted in a later edition of this volume.

   Midlane, Albert, an active and earnest English layman, was born in
   Newport, Isle of Wight, January 23, 1825, and was engaged in business
   in that town for many years. He has written over eight hundred hymns
   since 1842, when he published his first hymn. His hymns have been found
   most useful in Sunday school, revival, and mission services. He
   attributes his interest in and contributions to hymnology to the
   suggestion and encouragement of a favorite Sunday school teacher, who
   did much to shape his religious life. He is known as "the poet-preacher
   of the Strict Brethren." He has published, in addition to several small
   volumes of prose, some half dozen volumes of poetry and sacred songs.
   Speaking of his habits of composition, he says:

   Most of my hymns have been written during walks around the ancient and
   historic ruins of Carisbrooke Castle. The twilight hour, so dear to
   thought, and the hushed serenity then pervading nature have often
   allured my soul to deep and uninterrupted meditation, which, in its
   turn, has given birth to lines which, had not these walks been taken,
   would never probably have been penned.

   Dr. Julian quotes from and approves Miller's estimate of Mr. Midlane's
   hymns:

   They are full of spiritual thought, careful in their wording, and often
   very pleasing without reaching the highest form of poetical excellence.
   A marked feature of these hymns is the constant and happy use of
   Scripture phraseology.

   A few years ago a popular subscription was taken up among the parents,
   teachers, and children of England to relieve Mr. Midlane's necessities.
   The most popular of all his hymns is the one found in this collection:

   Miller, Emily Huntington, was born in Brooklyn, Conn., October 22,
   1833, the daughter of Rev. Thomas Huntington, D.D., a Methodist
   minister; was educated at Oberlin College, A.B. 1857. In 1860 she was
   married to Mr. John E. Miller, who died in 1882. She has written much
   for various periodicals, both in prose and verse. From 1867 to 1875 she
   edited the children's magazine called the Little Corporal, which was
   later merged with St. Nicholas. From 1891 to 1898 she was dean of women
   in Northwestern University, from which institution she received in 1909
   the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature (L.H.D.). She is the author
   of some fifteen or twenty volumes of prose and poetry, her books being
   written mostly for young people. Mrs. Miller is a Methodist. Her
   present address is St. Paul, Minn.

   Mills, Henry, a Presbyterian preacher and professor of theology, was
   born at Morristown, N. J., March 12, 1786. He was educated at
   Princeton, graduating in 1802. After teaching a number of years, he was
   ordained pastor of a Presbyterian Church at Woodbridge, N. J., in 1816.
   When the Auburn Theological Seminary was opened in 1821, he was chosen
   Professor of Biblical Criticism and Oriental Languages, a position that
   he held until 1854. A volume of his translations of German hymns was
   published in 1845 under the title Horae Germanicae. He died June 10,
   1867.

   Milman, Henry Hart, an eminent dean of the Church of England and well
   known as a Church historian, was the son of Sir Francis Milman, a court
   physician of note, and was born in London February 10, 1791. He was
   educated at Eton and Oxford, where as a student he took well-nigh all
   the honors open to a student. His prize poem on "Apollo Belvidere,"
   written in 1812, Dean Stanley pronounced "the most perfect of all
   Oxford prize poems." He entered the ministry in 1816; was Professor of
   Poetry at Oxford from 1821 to 1831; became Canon of Westminster in
   1835, and Dean of St. Paul's in 1849. He died September 24, 1868. His
   career as a man of letters, theologian, and Churchman was brilliant.
   His poetic and theological writings are numerous. His History of the
   Jews (1829), History of Christianity (1840), Latin Christianity (1854),
   and other volumes are among the ablest and most valuable of nineteenth
   century contributions to English theological literature. Milman's
   thirteen hymns were first published in [92]Bishop Heber's posthumous
   volume of Hymns, 1827, and later republished in his own Psalms and
   Hymns, 1837. They are all in use among modern Church hymnals.

   Milton, John, one of the greatest of English poets, is known to
   hymnologists as the author of nineteen versions of various Psalms,
   which appeared in his Poems in English and Latin, second edition, 1673.
   Two or three of them have been extensively used. Milton was born in
   London December 9, 1608; and died in the same city November 8, 1674. He
   was educated at Cambridge. After graduating he traveled extensively for
   those days. He was a Puritan in religion and a Republican in politics;
   was in public service under Cromwell, and narrowly escaped death or
   banishment at the Restoration. In 1652 he became totally blind; but his
   poetic vision seemed to be only quickened thereby, and he wrote in
   Paradise Lost "things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme."

   Monod, Theodore, pastor of the French Reformed Church in Paris, son of
   Rev. F. Monod, was born in Paris November 6, 1836. He was educated for
   the ministry partly in America, being a student for some years at
   Western Theological Seminary, Allegheny, Pa. In 1860 he entered upon
   his work in Paris, where his influence as an evangelical preacher has
   extended beyond the French Reformed Church, in which he has been a
   leading pastor during the past half century. Only a man with an
   evangelical religious experience could write a hymn like this:

   Monsen, John Samuel Bewley, a clergyman of the Church of England, was
   born at Londonderry, Ireland, March 2, 1811, and educated at Trinity
   College, Dublin, receiving the B.A. degree in 1832. Taking holy orders
   in 1834, he served in several offices of the Church of England. His
   death, April 9, 1875, was caused by his falling from the roof of his
   church, which was at the time in process of erection. He wrote a large
   number of hymns, some three hundred in all being published in the six
   different volumes which he issued between 1837 and 1873. About eighty
   of his hymns are said to be in common use in England. "While only a few
   of his hymns" says Dr. Julian, "are of enduring excellence, they are,
   as a whole, bright, joyous, and musical." The three here given are of a
   high order of excellence.

   Montgomery, James, the poet, holds an enviable place among English
   hymnists. He was the son of a Moravian minister; was born at Irvine,
   Ayrshire, Scotland, November 4, 1771; was religiously instructed at
   home, and while attending a Moravian school at Fulneck, England, made a
   public profession of religion by uniting with the Moravian Church. As
   he grew up, however, the pleasures of the world led him astray. The
   influence of early education preserved him from gross sins, but he was
   not at peace with God. After many years of doubt and dissatisfaction,
   he was led to look to the Saviour of his youth, and found rest. At his
   own request he was readmitted into the Moravian congregation at Fulneck
   when forty-three years of age. He expressed his feelings at the time in
   the following lines:


   People of the living God,

   I have sought the world around,

   Paths of sin and sorrow trod,

   Peace and comfort nowhere found.

   Now to you my spirit turns--

   Turns a fugitive unblest;

   Brethren, where your altar burns,

   O receive me into rest.

   Montgomery was an editor by profession, and for publishing what were
   then called libelous articles was twice fined and imprisoned in the
   Castle of York--once in 1795 for three months, and once in the
   following year for six months. While imprisoned he wrote his first book
   of poems, entitled Prison Amusements. In addition to several poetical
   works, he published three volumes of hymns: Songs of Zion: Being
   Imitations of Psalms, 1822; The Christian Psalmist, 1825; Original
   Hymns for Public, Private, and Social Devotion, 1853. From 1833 till
   his death he received a royal pension of two hundred pounds a year. He
   died quietly in his sleep on April 30, 1854, at his home, in Sheffield.
   Nineteen of Montgomery's hymns appear in this book:

   According to thy gracious word      234
   Angels from the realms of glory     113
   Behold the Christian warrior stand  397

   Moore, Thomas, the noted Irish poet, was born in Dublin May 28, 1779;
   began to write poetry at quite an early age; graduated at Trinity
   College, in his native city, in 1798, and the following year moved to
   London and began the study of law. From 1800 until his death, February
   26, 1852, he published works in prose and poetry too numerous to
   hiention. His Sacred Songs was published in 1816. It contained
   thirty-two lyrics, twelve of which have found a place in various hymn
   books, and these more largely in America than in England. "Of all the
   song writers that ever warbled or chanted or sung," says Professor
   Wilson, "the best, in our estimation, is verily none other than Thomas
   Moore." He was a musician as well as a poet, and often sung his own
   songs to the delight of the social circles aniong the great and noble,
   where he was ever a welcome and favored visitor. His religious life was
   anything else but that of a Christian; but his songs are nevertheless
   among the sweetest, tenderest, and most admired in the hymn book.

   Mote, Edward, an English Baptist minister, was born in London January
   21, 1797. He went astray, he tells us, from his youth, but was happily
   converted in 1813 under the preaching of the Rev. J. Hyatt, one of Lady
   Huntingdon's preachers, and joined the Church of which Rev. Alexander
   Fletcher was pastor, but two years later united with the Baptist
   Church. He engaged in business as a cabinetmaker for some years, but
   employed part of his time writing for the press, and at length entered
   the ministry. From 1852 until his death, November 13, 1874, he was
   pastor of the Baptist Church at Horsham, Essex. Mr. Mote was the editor
   of Hymns of Praise, London, 1836, to which he contributed nearly one
   hundred of his own compositions.

   educated at Rugby and Oxford, whence he received both the B.A. (1851)
   and M.A. (1856) degrees. He filled various clerical offices in the
   Church of England. He died April 25, 1885. Among his published volumes
   are the following: Hymns and Lyrics for the Seasons and Saints' Days of
   the Church, 1867, and Cantica Sanctorum; or, Hymns for the Black Letter
   Saints' Days in the English and Scottish Calendars, 1880. His hymns
   include translations from the Latin, Greek, and German. About fifty of
   his hymns are found in different Church hymnals.

   Muhlenberg, William Augustus, an eminent Episcopal minister, was born

   Muhlenberg, D.D., who was at first a Lutheran clergyman, but entered
   Congress and became Speaker of the House of Representatives in the
   first Congress; and was the grandson of Rev. Henry M. Muhlenberg, D.D.,
   who was the revered patriarch of the Lutheran Church in America. He was
   graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1814, and was ordained
   priest in the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1820. Subsequently he
   established St. Paul's College at Flushing, Long Island. From 1846 to
   1859 he was recter of the Church of the Holy Communion, in New York
   City. In 1855 he founded St. Luke's Hospital in New York City, and was
   its pastor and superintendent until his death. He also founded in 1865
   St. Johnland, a home for the needy. Dr. Muhlenberg was one of the
   committee that edited Hymns Suited to the Feasts and Fasts of the
   Church, 1826. He died April 6, 1871.

   Neale, John Mason, an eminent English clergyman and author, the son of
   Rev. Cornelius Neale, was born in London January 24, 1818; was
   graduated at Cambridge in 1840, and the following year entered the
   ministry; was appointed warden of Sackville College, Sussex, an
   institution for aged women, in 1846, which office he continued to fill
   until his death, in 1866. He was the author of numerous published
   volumes, many of them evincing his antiquarian and ritualistic tastes.
   Among his works are fifteen volumes of hymns and translations. He is
   perhaps the most successful of all modern translators of hymns from the
   Latin and Greek. In translating the hymns of the Greek Church
   especially Dr. Neale's work is not only more extensive than, but
   incomparably superior to, that of any other translator. Indeed, this
   field is one which he occupies almost alone. The two original hymns and
   seven translations by Dr. Neale in this volume are scarcely surpassed
   for poetic merit by any hymns in the entire collection.

   Needham, John, was an English Baptist minister of the eighteenth

   Devotional and Moral, on Various Subjects Collected Chiefly from the
   Holy Scriptures, and Suited to the Christian State and Worship. From
   this book compilers have selected a few good hymns.

   Neumark, Georg, a German poet, was born in Thuringia March 16, 1621.
   After graduating at a gymnasium, he was for a time a family tutor. In
   1643 he was matriculated at the university at Königsberg, where he
   remained five years. In 1652 he was appointed court poet at Weimar,
   where he wrote many secular poems. He was also a hymn writer and
   musician. Only a few of his thirty-four hymns survive, the one given

   Newman, John Henry, a distinguished cardinal of the Roman Catholic
   Church, was born in London February 21, 1801; was graduated at Oxford
   in 1820, and for several years was a tutor in the college. He was a
   leader of the High-Church party in the Church of England from the
   first, and had great influence among the young men at Oxford. He was
   ordained to the ministry in the Church of England in 1824, but in 1845
   left that communion and united with the Roman Catholic. He was made a
   cardinal in 1879. He died in London August 11, 1890. He was the most
   prominent and influential English Roman Catholic of the nineteenth
   century. His collected works include many well-known volumes on
   doctrinal and ecclesiastical subjects. His translations of Latin hymns
   and his original hymns are found in Lyra Apostolica, 1836, and in
   Verses on Various Occasions, 1868. Only a few are in common use.

   Newton, John, the child of many prayers, the profligate youth, the
   wicked sailor boy, the contrite penitent, the happy Christian, the
   consecrated minister, the eminent divine, the sweet singer, was born in
   London July 24, 1725. His mother, a devotedly pious woman, died when he
   was only seven years of age. His only "schooling" was from his eighth
   to his tenth year. He was engaged in the African slave trade for
   several years, and was even himself held as a slave at one time in
   Sierra Leone. He became an infidel, but was converted in a storm at sea
   while returning from Africa. He married a noble and pious woman in
   1750. He became a minister in the Established Church in 1758, but was
   not ordained until 1764, when be obtained the curacy of Olney, near
   Cambridge. He remained here for nearly sixteen years, being intimately
   associated with the poet Cowper, who was joint author with him of the
   [93]Olney Hymns, 1779. Soon after the appearance of this volume he
   moved to London, where he did faithful and successful work for many
   years as rector of St. Mary Woolnoth. He attained an honored old age,
   dying December 21, 1807. Newton wrote his own epitaph, which he
   requested might be put upon a plain marble tablet near the vestry door
   of his church in London:

   JOHN NEWTON, Clerk,
   Once an Infidel and Libertine,
   A servant of slaves in Africa,
   Was, by the rich mercy of our Lord and Saviour
   JESUS CHRIST,
   Preserved, restored, and pardoned,
   And appointed to preach the Faith
   He had long labored to destroy,
   Near 16 years at Olney in Bucks
   And . . . years in this church
   On Feb. 1, 1750, he married
   MARY
   Daughter of the late George Catlett
   Of Catham, Kent.
   He resigned her to the Lord who gave her
   On 15th of December, 1790.

   North, Frank Mason, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, was
   born in New York, December 3, 1850. He was graduated at Wesleyan
   University in 1872, and entered the ministry the same year. After
   filling important stations in the Methodist Episcopal Church for twenty
   years, he became in 1892 Corresponding Secretary of the New York City
   Church Extension and Missionary Society, since which date he has also
   been editor of the Christian City, published in New York City. Dr.
   North's home mission hymn found here (No. 423) is one of the best in
   the entire Hymnal.

   Olivers, Thomas, one of [94]Mr. Wesley's itinerant ministers, was born
   in Tregoman, Wales, in 1725. Early in life he was left an orphan.
   Distant relatives brought him up in an indifferent manner. He was sent
   to school for a time, and his religious education was not altogether
   neglected. As he grew older he became very profane, and at length ran
   away from his master, a shoemaker, to whom he was apprenticed. The
   drinking vagabond--for such he was--in his wicked career arrived at
   Bristol, where Whitefield had an appointment to preach. He went to hear
   him, and was converted. "When the sermon began," he says, "I was one of
   the most abandoned and profligate young men living; before it was ended
   I was a new creature." From that time onward he lived a new life,
   joined the Methodists, and in 1753 became one of Wesley's itinerant
   preachers. Clear, strong, and sometimes fiery, he was the man for the
   times, and for forty-six years made full proof of his ministry. Most of
   his prose writings relate to the Calvinistic controversies of that day.
   Wesley said he was fully a "match" for Toplady. For some years he aided
   Wesley in editing the Arminian Magazine. He wrote only four or five
   hymns, but they are all of high order. He died March 7, 1799.

   Palmer, Ray, an eminent Congregational minister, son of Judge Thomas
   Palmer, was born at Little Compton, R. I., November 12, 1808. At
   thirteen years of age he became a clerk in a dry goods store in Boston,
   where he identified himself with the Park Street Congregational Church,
   whose pastor, Dr. S. E. Dwight, discerning the promise of great
   usefulness in the boy, took a deep interest in him, inducing him to go
   to Phillips Academy, Andover, where he prepared for Yale College, from
   which institution he was graduated in 1820. The next year he lived in
   New York City, taking up the study of theology privately and supporting
   himself by teaching in a woman's college. He taught in a young ladies'
   institute at New Haven during 1832-34, continuing his theological
   studies and entering the ministry at the close of this period. From
   1835 to 1850 he was pastor of the Congregational Church at Bath, Me.,
   and from 1850 to 1865 he was pastor of the First Congregational Church
   of Albany, N. Y. For thirteen years (1865-78) he lived in New York City
   and filled the office of Corresponding Secretary of the American
   Congregational Union. He resigned this office in 1878 and retired to
   private life, making his home in Newark, N. J., until his death, March
   29, 1887. Between 1829 and 1881 he published eleven volumes, among them
   Hymns and Sacred Pieces, 1865, and Hymns of My Holy Hours and Other
   Pieces, 1868. About forty of Dr. Palmer's hymns have found a place in
   the various Church hymnals. He is regarded by many as the greatest hymn
   writer that America has produced, and his hymn beginning "My faith
   looks up to thee" as the greatest hymn of American origin. "He has
   written more and better hymns than any other American," says Dr.
   Duffield, author of English Hymns. "In their tender spirit of
   reverential worship, the beauty of their poetical conceptions, the
   choiceness of their diction, and the gracefulness of their expression
   the hymns of Ray Palmer are unsurpassed by any similar compositions in
   the language," says W. H. Parker in his Psalmody of the Church. "The
   best of his hymns, by their combination of thought, poetry, and
   devotion, are superior to almost all others of American origin." So
   writes Prof. F. M. Bird In Julian's Dictionary of Hymnology.

   Come, Holy Ghost, in love         184

   Park, Roswell, an Episcopal clergyman and educator, was born at
   Lebanon, Conn., October 1, 1807. He received a military education,
   graduating at West Point in 1831, and served several years in the
   United States Engineer Corps. In 1842 he began to study theology, and
   soon after entered the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church. In
   1852 he became President of Racine College (Wisconsin). In 1863 he
   founded a school in Chicago, where he died, July 16, 1869. He was the

   Perronet, Edward, an Independent English clergyman, was born in 1726.
   He was the son of Rev. Vincent Perronet, vicar of Shoreham, who was a
   friend and supporter of the Wesleys, and lived to be ninety-one years
   old; and [95]John Wesley makes frequent and affectionate allusions in
   his Journal to his visits to the white-haired patriarch and saint.
   Edward Perronet was educated in the Church of England, but became a
   Wesleyan preacher when quite a young man, and continued such until
   1756, when the question arose among the Methodists concerning
   separation from the Church of England, which the Wesleys strenuously
   opposed and Perronet as strongly favored and urged. He went so far as
   to administer the Lord's Supper to the "societies," and wrote a
   scathing satire on the Church of England titled The Miter, a Satyricall
   Poem. The Wesleys were much irritated by this production, and succeeded
   in suppressing and destroying all but about thirty copies. Perronet
   then joined the Lady Huntingdon Connection, and later became a
   Dissenter. His home was at Canterbury for several years previous to his
   death, which occurred January 2, 1792. He was too independent in spirit
   to call any man master, but he was always loyal and true to Christ.

   Pierpont, John, a Unitarian preacher, was born in Litchfield, Conn.,
   April 6, 1785; graduated at Yale College in 1804. After spending some
   years as a teacher, lawyer, and merchant, he became a minister when
   about thirty-three years old, and in 1819 was installed as pastor of
   the Hollis Street Unitarian Church, in Boston, where he remained
   twenty-one years. His strong antislavery and temperance utterances
   brought him under fire. From 1845 to 1849 he was pastor of the
   Unitarian Church at Troy, N. Y., and from 1849 to 1859, of the
   Unitarian Church at Medford, Mass. He was for a while a chaplain in the
   army during the Civil War, but was later in the government employ at
   Washington. He died August 27, 1866. His Poems and Hymns was published
   in 1840; second edition, 1854. About twenty of his hymns are found in
   Church hymnals.

   to a position of influence in the Church. He was a noted scholar, the
   author of numerous works in both prose and poetry. He was a member of
   the Commission on the revision of the Old Testament. His hymns are few
   in number but elegant in style, fervent in spirit, and popular with
   hymnists. Dr. Plumptree became Dean of Wells in 1881. He died February

   year. She was a devotedly pious woman. She taught school in Portland,
   in Ipswich, Mass., and in Richmond, Va. She was married in 1845 to Rev.
   George L. Prentiss, D.D., an eminent Presbyterian divine and professor
   in Union Theological Seminary, of New York City. She was never in
   robust health, but did much literary work, publishing several volumes.
   Her Stepping Heavenward (1869) is one of the most popular books ever

   she became a devout member of the Roman Catholic Church. Possessed of
   more than ordinary intellectual powers, she was especially skilled in
   music and languages. Three of her hymns are given in this collection:

   Rawson, George, an English Congregational layman, was born June 5,
   1807, in Leeds, where he practiced many years as a solicitor. He
   contributed to various books. His knowledge of music and his gifts as a

   for assistance in compiling the Leeds Hymn Book, 1853. In 1858 he
   assisted Dr. Green and other Baptist ministers in the preparation of
   Psalms and Hymns for the Use of the Baptist Denomination. His Hymns,

   Reed, Andrew, an English Independent minister, was born in London
   November 27, 1787; was graduated from Hackney College, and soon
   afterwards became pastor of a Church in East London, where he remained
   for fifty years, devoting much of his time to philanthropic work. In
   1834, on a visit to America, he received from Yale College the degree
   of D.D. He published a Supplement to Watts in 1817, a revised and
   enlarged edition of which appeared in 1841, containing twenty-seven
   hymns by himself and nineteen by his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth Holmes Reed.
   He died at Hackney, London, February 25, 1862. Dr. Reed is best known
   in England as the founder of the London Orphan Asylum, the Asylum for
   Fatherless Children, The Asylum for Idiots, the Infant Orphan Asylum,
   and the Hospital for Incurables. If the value of every song is to be
   determined by the intrinsic merits of the hymn, plus the life and
   character of the man who wrote it, it must follow that the hymns of the
   man who founded and worked for all these philanthropic and beneficent
   institutions are among the most valuable hymns in the entire
   collection. Mrs. Reed's hymn beginning "O do not let the word depart"
   is quite as popular and useful as anything her husband wrote.

   Richter, Christian Frederic, was born at Sorau, in Silesia, October 5,
   1676; was graduated from the University of Halle, and became identified
   with the celebrated orphanage there. He was a student of medicine, as
   well as of theology. A Christian physician and scientist, he took his
   religion into everything that he did. "He made many chemical
   experiments, for which he prepared himself by special prayer, and
   invented many compounds which came into extensive use under the name of
   the 'Halle medicines.'" Among the holy men and gifted writers of hymns
   and other forms of devotional literature who made famous the earlier
   school of German Pietists at Halle Richter was one of the most noted.
   Many of the thirty-three hymns that he wrote are not only deeply
   spiritual, but are possessed of genuine poetic merit. Richter died
   October 5, 1711.

   Rinkart, Martin, a German minister, musician, and poet, was born at
   Eilenburg, Saxony, April 23, 1586. He was educated at the Latin school
   of Eilenburg and at the University of Leipzig, which he entered in
   1602. He was the beloved pastor of a Church in his native town for many
   years, and died there December 8, 1649. "The greater part of Rinkart's
   professional life was passed amid the horrors of the Thirty Years' War.
   Eilenburg, being a small walled town, became a refuge for fugitives
   from all around, and, being so overcrowded, not unnaturally suffered
   from pestilence and famine." His duties as a clergyman at that time
   were very arduous. His memory is cherished in his native land, and his
   most famous hymn, "Nun Danket," is widely used.

   Robert IX., King of France (972-1031), is the reputed author of the
   hymn, to which his name is here attached, but his claim to the
   authorship of it is very slender. There are at least four men for whom
   the authorship of the famous Latin hymn, "Veni Sancte Spiritus," is
   claimed, and no conclusive evidence exists that any one of them wrote
   it. The other three alleged authors are: Hermannus Contractus,
   1013-1054; Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, consecrated in
   1207; and Pope Innocent III. This hymn, therefore, will be most
   properly designated as of unknown authorship. One of the best of the
   many excellent translations of it is that here given by Dr. Ray Palmer.

   Robinson, George, is an English hymn writer of whom little is known. In
   1842 the Rev. J. Leifchild published in London a volume of Original
   Hymns by various authors. In a list of contributors "G. Robinson" is
   credited with the authorship of five hymns, among them the hymn
   accredited to him in this book. Nothing more seems to be known of this
   author. It is to be hoped that other information may be obtained that
   may appear in later editions of this volume. Suffice it in the meantime
   that we know two most important facts about him, gathered from this
   short hymn--viz., that his views of the atonement are evangelical and
   sound, and his Christian catholicity quite in accord with the growing
   spirit of fraternity and brotherhood that characterizes the best type
   of modern Christianity.

   Robinson, Robert, the author of "Come, thou Fount of every blessing,"
   an English Baptist minister, was born in Swaffham, Norfolk, England,
   September 27, 1735. He received a good grammar school education. At the
   age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a London hairdresser, but the
   Lord was preparing him for a higher calling. He was converted among the
   Methodists in his twentieth year, and became a lay preacher among them,
   but soon left them and became an Independent. In less than a year,
   however, he became pastor of the Baptist Church at Cambridge, where he
   remained as an "open communion" Baptist until the year of his death. He
   died June 9, 1790, being succeeded in the pastorate of the Church by
   Rev. Robert Hall. He was a very popular preacher and author of several
   able works, among them A Plea for the Divinity of Our Lord Jesus
   Christ, 1776, a volume which "dignitaries and divines of the Church of
   England united with Nonconformists in lauding as an exceptionally able,
   scholarly, and pungently written book," His History of Baptism and the
   Baptists appeared in 1790. A few months before he died he retired to
   Birmingham, where he seems to have had friendly fellowship with Dr.
   Priestley, the noted Unitarian divine. This led some Unitarians to
   infer and to declare that before his death he came into sympathy with
   their views. But this inference is unwarranted.

   Roscoe, William, an English lawyer, banker, author, a member of the
   Unitarian Church, was born in Liverpool March 8, 1753; and died June
   30, 1831. He was educated as a lawyer, and practiced until 1796, when
   he gave up the profession of law for that of literature. His Life of
   Lorenzo de Medici was published in 1796, and the Life and Pontificate
   of Leo the Tenth in 1805. He was one of the compilers of a hymn book
   titled A Selection of Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Worship,
   1818. To this book he contributed nine hymns. Three of Mr. Roscoe's
   children were hymn writers. A son (William Stanley) and two daughters
   (Mary Ann and Jane) have written valuable hymns.

   Rothe, Johann Andreas, a German clergyman, the son of Rev. Aegidius
   Rothe, was born at Lissa May 12, 1688; educated at the University of
   Leipzig, taking the degree of M.A. in 1712. Soon after this he was
   licensed to preach. In 1722 [96]Count Zinzendorf gave him the pastorate
   at Berthelsdorf, where he remained many years. Herrnhut was a part of
   his parish. In 1737 he resigned this pastorate and became a Lutheran
   minister. He died July 6, 1758.

   Scheffler, Johann Angelus, an eminent mystic of the seventeenth
   century, better known as "Angelus Silesius," was the son of Stanislaus
   Scheffler, a Polish nobleman, who was compelled to leave his fatherland
   because of his adherence to Lutheranism. He was born in 1624 at
   Breslau, Silesia. He was early enamored of the writings of the mystics,
   and became a disciple of Jacob Boehme. He entered the medical
   profession, and in 1649 received the appointment of private physician
   to the Duke of Wurtemberg-Oels. The Lutheran clergy regarded Scheffler
   as a heretic, and, finding no sympathy in them, he went to the Roman
   Catholic Church. He now became private physician to the Emperor
   Ferdinand III., but soon abandoned his profession and entered the
   priesthood, returning to Breslau, where he died July 9, 1677. Most of
   his hymns were written before he became a Roman Catholic. Of
   twenty-five hymns by him in common use, we have here only one, a
   translation by [97]John Wesley.

   Schmolke, Benjamin, a Lutheran pastor, hymn writer, and poet, was born
   December 21, 1672. He was educated at the Gymnasium of Lauban and the
   University of Leipzig. He was married in 1702, and the same year became
   one of the pastors of the Lutheran Church at Schweidnitz, where he
   remained until the time of his death. "Schmolke was well known in his
   own district as a popular and useful preacher, a diligent pastor, and a
   man of wonderful tact and discretion." He was also a great poet. His
   original hymns greatly widened his influence and increased his
   popularity. His poetic writings were numerous and manifested a deep,
   genuine, and warm-hearted piety, and have been used extensively in
   Germany. He died February 12, 1737.

   Scott, Thomas, an English Presbyterian clergyman, son of Rev. Thomas
   Scott, an Independent minister, and brother of Elizabeth Scott, also
   well known as a hymn writer, was born at Norwich in 1705, and succeeded
   Mr. Baxter as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Ipswich in 1737. He
   died in 1775. He was the author of a translation in verse of the book
   of Job (1771) and of a volume of Lyric Poems (1773). "Doctrinally,"
   says Julian, "Scott may be described as an evangelical Arian."

   native city. The leading events of his career as a poet and novelist
   are so well known that they do not need to be repeated here. Two of his
   hymns appear in this Hymnal, and are every way worthy of the genius of
   the author. Scott died at Abbotsford September 21, 1832.

   Scriven, Joseph, the author of "What a Friend we have in Jesus," was
   born at Dublin, Ireland, in 1820; was graduated from Trinity College,
   Dublin; moved to Canada in 1845, where he led a humble but useful life
   till his death at Port Hope, October 10, 1886. Mr. Ira D. Sankey, in
   his Story of the Gospel Hymns, says that the young lady to whom he was
   to be married was accidentally drowned on the eve of their wedding day,
   which sad event led him to consecrate his life and property to the
   service of Christ. It is said that no service was too lowly for him to
   render if it could be done without compensation and without observation
   for one of the least of Christ's disciples. His hymn is one of the most
   popular of all modern hymns.

   Union College, Schenectady, N. Y., class of 1834, and also of the
   Theological School at Cambridge, Mass., 1837. Among his poetic writings
   are two fine Christmas songs, one of which appears in this book. Dr.
   Sears died January 14, 1876. "Although a member of the Unitarian body,"
   says Prof. F. M. Bird in Julian's Dictionary, "his views were rather
   Swedenborgian than Unitarian. He held always to the absolute divinity
   of Christ."

   Spitta, Carl Johann Philipp, a German theologian and poet, was born at
   Hanover August 1, 1801. His early years were without special promise,
   and he was apprenticed to a watchmaker. While learning this trade he
   began the study of languages, and in 1821 entered the University of
   Gottingen to study theology. After graduating he was engaged as tutor
   in a private family for some time; but from 1828 till his death he was
   a popular and successful pastor of several Lutheran Churches. He died
   September 28, 1859. His reputation rests principally upon his hymns,
   which are deeply spiritual and very popular in his native land. His
   Psalter and Harfe, Leipzig (first edition, 1833), was translated by
   Richard Massie in 1860.

   Stanley, Arthur Penrhyn, Dean of Westminster, one of the most
   distinguished English Churchmen of the nineteenth century, was the son
   of Rev. Edward Stanley, Bishop of Norwich, and was born at Alderly, in
   Cheshire, December 13, 1815. At the age of fourteen he became a pupil
   of Dr. Arnold, of Rugby, in whose famous school he displayed a strength
   of moral character which was a prophecy of the frank and courageous man
   that was to be. He took well-nigh all the honors at Oxford, where he
   graduated in 1837. Entering the ministry of the Church of England, he
   filled successively various positions of honor and responsibility until
   in 1855 he was appointed Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History at
   Oxford. In 1864 he became Dean of Westminster. His marriage that same
   year to Lady Augusta Bruce, a personal friend and attendant of Queen
   Victoria, increased the freedom and intimacy of his already cordial
   relations with the royal family. He died July 18, 1881. He was a
   Churchman of broad and liberal views. His catholicity of spirit was one
   of his most notable characteristics. His contributions to theological
   literature are numerous and well known. His Life of Dr. Arnold, of
   Rugby, 1844, is one of the most successful volumes of biography in the
   English language. Among his historical writings his lectures on the
   Eastern Church, 1861, Jewish Church (two volumes), 1863-65, and the
   Church of Scotland, 1868, are accounted as of highest value. He is the
   author of about a dozen hymns, and of several translations. These,
   although of a high order of excellence, do not take rank with his prose
   writings, which for choice English diction, scholarly erudition, and
   Christian catholicity are not surpassed, perhaps, by anything in the
   religious literature of England in the nineteenth century.

   Steele, Anne, the daughter of the Rev. William Steele, a Baptist
   minister in Hampshire, England, was born in 1717, and died in 1778. She
   was a very talented lady. Although an invalid for many years and a
   great sufferer, her life was useful and happy. Her published hymns are
   found in nearly all collections, and have been a blessing to many
   people. Many of them are good, and a few deserve the highest praise.
   The following appropriate lines are inscribed upon her tomb:


   Silent the lyre, and dumb the tuneful tongue,

   That sung on earth her great Redeemer's praise;

   But now in heaven she joins the angelic song,

   In more harmonious, more exalted lays.

   Her poetical writings were published in two volumes under the name
   "Theodosia:" Poems on Subjects Chiefly Devotional, London, 1760. A
   third volume, titled Miscellaneous Pieces in Verse and Prose, was
   published two years after her death. Julian's Dictionary names
   seventy-five of her hymns as being in common use.

   E. Stowe, a professor in the seminary. Mrs. Stowe's volume titled Uncle
   Tom's Cabin, which was first published in 1852 as a serial in the
   National Era and later in book form, is one of the most widely known
   and historic volumes in the entire range of American literature. It is
   a work of fiction which, by means of the pathetic picture which it
   draws of the ills of slave life and the cruelties, either actual or
   possible, involved in slave ownership, did much to precipitate the
   American Civil War (1861-65). Mrs. Stowe published more than forty
   volumes in all, many of them being works of fiction. Her Religious
   Poems appeared in 1867. Three of her hymns, including the one here
   given, were first published in the Plymouth Collection (1855), a volume
   of hymns edited by her brother, Henry Ward Beecher. She died July 1,

   Tate, Nahum, the English poet, was the son of an Irish clergyman, and
   was born at Dublin in 1652. After his graduation at the University of
   Dublin he settled in London and entered upon a literary career. He soon
   won reputation as a poet, publishing successive volumes from time to
   time. In 1692 he became Poet Laureate. In 1696 he published, in
   connection with [100]Rev. Nicholas Brady (1659-1726), Chaplain in
   Ordinary, a New Version of the Psalms of David Fitted to the Tunes Used
   in the Church. This version supplanted, by royal and episcopal
   authority, the "old version" by Sternhold, Hopkins, and others, and is
   to this day the authorized version of the Church of England found in
   the Prayer Book. It is not known which of the Psalms were translated by
   Brady and which by Tate; but as Tate was Poet Laureate, he is supposed
   to have done the greater part of the work. In addition to this joint
   work, he published several volumes of poetry. He died August 12, 1715.

   of an Independent Church in Sheffield, but in less time than a year he
   was obliged to give up the work on account of ill health. Subsequently
   he accepted a position as tutor in his Alma Mater; but his career was

   twenty-eight years of age. His best-known hymn is that beginning: "I'm
   but a stranger here; heaven is my home."

   Tennyson, Alfred, the English poet, was the son of a clergyman. He was
   born in Somersby, Lincolnshire, August 6, 1809. He was educated at
   Trinity College, Cambridge. His first volume of poetry appeared while
   he was an undergraduate. Upon the death of Wordsworth, in 1850, he was
   appointed Poet Laureate. Many regard him as the greatest Poet Laureate
   England has ever had. He was raised to the peerage in 1884, with the
   title, Baron Tennyson d'Eyncourt. He died October 6, 1892, and was
   buried in Westminster Abbey. Lord Tennyson was not a hymn writer, yet
   three of his poems are so used in this book. Biographies of this great
   poet are so numerous and so accessible to all, and the important facts
   of his life and of his contributions to modern English literature are
   so well known as to render it unnecessary to write of him at length
   here.

   Tersteegen, Gerhard, a pious and useful mystic of the eighteenth
   century, was born at Mörs, Germany, November 25, 1697. He was carefully
   educated in his childhood, and then apprenticed (1715) to his older
   brother, a shopkeeper. He was religiously inclined from his youth, and
   upon coming of age he secured a humble cottage near Mühlheim, where he
   led a life of seclusion and self-denial for many years. At about thirty
   years of age he began to exhort and preach in private and public
   gatherings. His influence became very great, such was his reputation
   for piety and his success in talking, preaching, and writing concerning
   spiritual religion. He wrote one hundred and eleven hymns, most of
   which appeared in his [101]Spiritual Flower Garden (1731). He died
   April 3, 1769.

   Theodulph is said to have been a native of Italy. The exact date of his
   birth is not known. He came to France in the time of Charlemagne, about
   781, and was made Bishop of Orleans in 785. He was imprisoned by Louis
   I. at Angers in 818. There are differing traditions concerning him
   after this period.

   Thomas of Celano is so called from Celano, a town on the borders of
   Lake Fucino, Italy. He was born the latter part of the twelfth century.
   He joined the order of Friars founded by St. Francis of Assisi soon
   after its organization in 1208. He had charge successively of the
   Franciscan convents of Worms, Metz, and Cologne. At the death of St.
   Francis, in 1226, he returned to Assisi, and by appointment of Pope
   Gregory IX. wrote the life of St. Francis. The year of his death is not
   known. His Dies Irae, the greatest of all the Latin hymns, has been
   attributed to [102]Bernard of Clairvaux, Gregory the Great, and others.
   The preponderance of evidence, however, seems to be in favor of the
   authorship of Thomas of Celano. His celebrated hymn has had various
   renderings into English, among the best of which are the following:

   Day of wrath! O day of (Irons)     747
   Day of wrath, O dreadful (Stanley) 599
   The day of wrath, that (W. Scott)  603

   Thomson, Mary Ann, wife of Mr. John Thomson, Librarian of the Free
   Library, Philadelphia, was born in London, England, December 5, 1834.
   She has written about forty hymns, which have appeared mostly in the
   Churchman, New York, and in the Living Church, Chicago. Four of her
   hymns are found in the Protestant Episcopal Hymnal, 1892. Of the origin
   of the missionary hymn by Mrs. Thomson which is found in our Hymnal she
   writes as follows:

   I wrote the greater part of the hymn, "O Zion, haste," in the year
   1868. I had written many hymns before, and one night, while I was
   sitting up with one of my children who was ill of typhoid fever, I
   thought I should like to write a missionary hymn to the tune of the
   hymn beginning "Hark, hark, my soul, angelic songs are swelling," as I
   was fond of that tune; but as I could not then get a refrain I liked, I
   left the hymn unfinished, and about three years later I finished it by
   writing the refrain which now forms part of it. By some mistake 1891 is
   given instead of 1871 as the date of the hymn in the (Episcopal)
   Hymnal. I do not think it is ever sung to the tune for which I wrote
   it. Rev. John Anketell told me, and I am sure he is right, that it is
   better for a hymn to have a tune of its own, and I feel much indebted
   to the composer of the tune "Tidings" for writing so inspiring a tune
   to my words.

   O Zion, haste, thy mission high 654

   Thring, Godfrey, an English clergyman, Prebendary of Wells Cathedral,
   son of Rev. J. G. D. Thring, was born at Alford March 25, 1823;
   graduated at Oxford, 1845; served different charges as curate and
   rector, 1846-67; Rural Dean, 1867-76; Prebendary of Wells Cathedral
   from 1876 till his death, September 13, 1903. He has written many
   hymns, about twenty-five of which are found in different Church hymnals
   in England and America. He published Hymns Congregational and Others,
   1866; Hymns and Verses, 1866; Hymns and Sacred Lyrics, 1874; Church of
   England Hymn Book, 1880 (second edition, 1882). "His hymns," says Dr.
   Julian, "are mainly objective, and are all of them of a strong and
   decided character. In some of his finer hymns his tone is high and his
   structure massive; in several others his plaintiveness is very tender,
   whilst very varied, and his rhythm is almost always perfect. The
   prominent features throughout are a clear vision, a firm faith, a
   positive reality, and an exulting hopefulness."

   Toplady, Augustus Montague, the author of "Rock of Ages," was born at
   Farnham, Surrey, November 4, 1740. His father was an officer in the
   British army. His mother was a woman of remarkable piety. He prepared
   for the university at Westminster School, and subsequently was
   graduated at Trinity College, Dublin. While on a visit in Ireland in
   his sixteenth year he was awakened and converted at a service held in a
   barn in Codymain. The text was Ephesians ii. 13: "But now, in Christ
   Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of
   Christ." The preacher was an illiterate but warm-hearted layman named
   Morris. Concerning this experience Toplady wrote: "Strange that I, who
   had so long sat under the means of grace in England, should be brought
   nigh unto God in an obscure part of Ireland, amidst a handful of God's
   people met together in a barn, and under the ministry of one who could
   hardly spell his name. Surely this is the Lord's doing, and it is
   marvelous." In 1758, through the influence of sermons preached by Dr.
   Manton on the seventeenth chapter of John, he became an extreme
   Calvinist in his theology, which brought him later into conflict with
   [103]Mr. Wesley and the Methodists. He was ordained to the ministry in
   the Church of England in 1762, and in 1768 he became vicar of
   Broadhembury, a small living in Devonshire, which he held until his
   death. The last two or three years of his life he passed in London,
   where he preached in a chapel on Orange Street. His last sickness was
   of such a character that he was able to make a repeated and emphatic
   dying testimony. A short time before his death he asked his physician
   what he thought. The reply was that his pulse showed that his heart was
   beating weaker every day. Toplady replied with a smile: "Why, that is a
   good sign that my death is fast approaching; and, blessed be God, I can
   add that my heart beats stronger and stronger every day for glory." To
   another friend he said: "O, my dear sir, I cannot tell you the comforts
   I feel in my soul; they are past expression. . . . My prayers are all
   converted into praise." He died of consumption August 11, 1778. His
   volume of Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Worship was published
   in 1776. Of the four hundred and nineteen hymns which it contained,
   several were his own productions.

   Tuttiett, Lawrence, a clergyman of the Church of England, was born at
   Colyton, Devonshire, in 1825; educated at King's College, London;
   entered the ministry in 1848; vicar of Lea Marston, Warwickshire,
   1854-60; incumbent of Episcopal Church of St. Andrews, Scotland,
   1870-80; became prebendary in St. Ninian's Cathedral, Perth, 1880. He
   died May 21, 1897. Among his published volumes are Hymns for Churchmen,
   1854, and Hymns for the Children of the Church, 1862. "Mr. Tuttiett's
   hymns," says Dr. Julian, "are characterized by smoothness of rhythm,
   directness of aim, simplicity of language, and deep earnestness."

   Twells, Henry, a clergyman in the Church of England, was born at
   Birmingham March 13, 1823. He was educated at St. Peter's College,
   Cambridge, taking the degree of B.A. in 1848. He took orders in 1849,
   and occupied various positions of service and honor in the ministry. He
   was subvicar at Stratford-on-Avon in 1851-54, and in 1884 he became
   honorary canon of Peterborough Cathedral. A few of his hymns were
   contributed to Hymns Ancient and Modern. He died January 19, 1900. His
   biographer says of him:

   He was a preacher of power, a builder of churches, a helper of
   parochial missions, a defender of country parsons, and an altogether
   friendly and wholesome sort of man. He died as he lived, in quietness
   and peace. Shortly before his death he asked for the gathering of his
   household and the singing of "Now thank we all our God" and "When all
   thy mercies, O my God."

   Unknown. Some of our finest hymns are of unknown origin. The authors
   had such humble opinion of their work as to feel that it was not worth
   while to attach their names to their own productions. True worth and
   greatness are often unconscious of themselves. Of many of our greatest
   hymns of known authorship it is recorded that when their authors wrote
   them they had no thought whatever of writing anything of interest or
   value to others, and least of all anything that would be used in public
   worship; but, on the contrary, they were simply writing to give
   expression to their own religious experiences, feelings, and
   aspirations. (See notes under Nos. 272, 334, 460, 498, and 702.) A hymn
   of unknown authorship stands absolutely upon its merits, and it is
   therefore an even higher tribute to the merits of a hymn to admit it to
   a hymnal if its authorship be unknown than is the case where the
   authorship is known. After all, the song, and not the singer, is the
   precious thing to remember. As Mrs. Ellen H. Gates has said:


   Though they may forget the singer,

   They will not forget the song.

   That song alone can hope to live forever that has its real and true
   elements of immortality not in its author but in itself, in its own
   power to awaken the spirit of devotion and inspire adoration and
   praise. In the following list of hymns we place not only those whose
   authorship is absolutely unknown, but also those hymns which, although
   accredited on circumstantial evidence to the hymn-writers whose names
   are given, are nevertheless of uncertain authorship. Some of the hymns
   in this list are translations by well-known writers from the Latin or
   other languages, the authorship of the originals alone being unknown.

   Vokes, Mrs., is a hymn writer concerning whom very little is known.
   Some of her hymns are found in a Selection of Missionary and Devotional
   Hymns, published in 1797 by Rev. J. Griffin, an English Congregational
   minister, and several of these are reproduced in J. Dobell's New
   Selection of Seven Hundred Evangelical Hymns, 1806. In [105]W. B.
   Collyer's Collection, 1812, there are seven hymns signed "Mrs. Vokes."
   While the hymn beginning "Soon may the last glad song arise" is
   generally accredited to Mrs. Vokes, Dr. Julian, our greatest authority
   in hymnology, says he has been unable to find any definite and
   satisfactory evidence that she wrote it. We find the name of this
   writer spelled "Voke" in some volumes.

   Walford, William W., a blind preacher of England, is the author of the
   hymn beginning "Sweet hour of prayer." This hymn first appeared in
   print in the New York Observer September 13, 1845. The contributor who
   furnished the hymn says:

   During my residence at Coleshill, Warwickshire, England, I became
   acquainted with W. W. Walford, the blind preacher, a man of obscure
   birth and connections and no education, but of strong mind and most
   retentive memory. In the pulpit he never failed to select a lesson well
   adapted to his subject, giving chapter and verse with unerring
   precision, and scarcely ever misplacing a word in his repetition of the
   Psalms, every part of the New Testament, the prophecies, and some of
   the histories, so as to have the reputation of knowing the whole Bible
   by heart."

   Rev. Thomas Salmon, who was settled as the pastor of the Congregational
   Church at Coleshill in 1838, remained until 1842, and then removed to
   the United States, is believed to have been the contributor who says of
   the hymn: "I rapidly copied the lines with my pencil as he uttered
   them, and send them for insertion in the Observer if you think them
   worthy of preservation."

   Ware, Henry, a Unitarian minister and professor of theology, was born
   at Hingham, Mass., April 21, 1794; graduated at Harvard College in
   1812, and taught school for two or three years in Exeter Academy; was
   licensed to preach in the Unitarian Church in 1815; became pastor of
   the Second Unitarian Church of Boston in 1817, and in 1829, his health
   being impaired, Ralph Waldo Emerson was called in to be his assistant
   pastor. In 1830 he became Professor of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral
   Theology in the Cambridge Theological School, continuing there until
   1842, when he resigned. He died at Framingham September 25, 1843. Four
   years after his death his works were collected and publish in four
   volumes. He wrote a large number of hymns, about a dozen or more of
   which are possessed of more than ordinary excellence and are in common
   use, particularly among Unitarians.

   Waring, Anna Lvetitia, the daughter of Elijah Waring and niece of
   Samuel Miller Waring, the hymn writer, was born at Neath, in Southern
   Wales, in 1820. As late as 1893 she was living at Clifton, near
   Bristol, England. Her [106]Hymns and Meditations were published in
   London in 1853. This book was republished in Philadelphia in 1859 by
   "The Association of Friends for the Diffusion of Religious and Useful
   Knowledge," and again in Boston in 1863. The volume contains only
   thirty-two pieces, and three of these are in this Hymnal. "The tone of
   spiritual thought and feeling in most of the pieces is very lofty and
   very pure. The ideas of a Christian life which are wrought into the
   poetry are always both strong and tender, vigorous and gentle, brave
   and trustful." We hope to obtain additional facts concerning Miss
   Waring for insertion in later editions of this volume.

   Warner, Anna Bartlett, daughter of Henry W. Warner and sister of Susan
   Warner (1819-85), the authoress, was born in 1820 at Martlaer, West
   Point, New York. She is the author of some fifteen or twenty volumes.
   She edited Hymns of the Church Militant, 1858. Her first volume, Say
   and Seal, 1859, prepared in association with her sister, contained one
   of the most popular hymns for young people ever written in America,
   beginning:


   Jesus loves me, this I know,

   For the Bible tells me so.

   In 1869 she published Wayfaring Hymns, Original and Translated. The
   titles of her successive volumes (most of which have been published
   under the pen name of "Amy Lothrop") may be found in any biography of
   American authors. She resides at Martlaer's Rock, West Point, N. Y.

   Watts, Isaac, may be considered the father of English hymnody. The
   beginning of the eighteenth century marks a distinct period in the
   history of hymnology. The apostle of the new departure was Dr. Isaac
   Watts. He was the first to see the real need, and in large measure he
   succeeded in supplying it. (See note under No. 167.) He was born at
   Southampton July 17, 1674. He was a precocious child; learned to read
   almost as soon as he could articulate, and wrote verses when a little
   boy. He was firmly attached to the principles of the Nonconformists,
   for which his father had suffered imprisonment, and was therefore
   compelled to decline the advantages of the great English universities,
   which at that time received only Church of England students. He availed
   himself, however, of the privilege of attending a Dissenting academy in
   London, taught by Mr. Thomas Rowe, where he applied himself to study
   with uncommon diligence and success. During his school days it was his
   habit frequently to attempt poetry both in English and in Latin,
   according to the custom of the time. In this manner he was
   unconsciously preparing himself for a long, brilliant, and useful
   career. In 1705 he published his first volume of poems, Horae Lyricae,
   which was received with approbation in Great Britain and America, and
   gave the author, in the opinion of the learned Dr. Johnson, an
   honorable place among English poets. His [107]Hymns and Spiritual Songs
   appeared in 1707; [108]Psalms, in 1719; and [109]Divine Songs for
   Children, in 1720. One characteristic of Watts's hymns is majesty. He
   is bold, massive, tremendous. This was not his only style of writing;
   some of his hymns are very pathetic. For example, "When I survey the
   wondrous cross" and "Alas! and did my Saviour bleed." Grandeur was his
   forte, but he could be as simple as a child and as tender as a mother.
   The same hand that wrote


   Wide as the world is thy command,

   Vast as eternity thy love,

   also wrote the familiar little cradle song,


   Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber;

   Holy angels guard thy bed.

   He became pastor of an Independent Church in London in 1702. He was so
   feeble that much of the time the work of the parish was done by an
   assistant, but he held the place nominally until his death. Dr. Watts
   never married. In 1713 he was invited to the elegant and hospitable
   home of Sir Thomas Abney. Years later he wrote to Lady Huntingdon:
   "This day thirty years I came hither to the house of my good friend,
   Sir Thomas Abney, intending to spend but one single week under his
   friendly roof; and I have extended my visit to exactly the length of
   thirty years." He wrote many works in prose as well as in poetry,
   amounting altogether to fifty-two publications. He lived to be
   seventy-five years of age, and was for many years before his death
   recognized as a patriarch among the Dissenting clergy. He died November
   25, 1748. Westminster Abbey, that vast inausoleum of England's heroes,
   statesmen, poets, and saints, has been honored with a memorial of this
   great, good man. Underneath a bust of the poet the artist has
   sculptured Watts sitting at a table writing, while behind and above him
   an angel is whispering heavenly thoughts. The design is artistic and
   very appropriate. This Hymnal contains fifty-three hymns by Dr. Watts.

   Wells, Marcus Morris, is the author of one of our most popular modern
   hymns on the Holy Spirit and also the composer of the tune to which it
   is universally sung. Beyond the published date of his birth (1815) and
   his death (1895) and the statement that he was a lawyer living in the
   State of New York, we have no facts concerning him. It is hoped that
   some facts may be learned about him which may be incorporated in later
   editions of this volume. The date assigned to the hymn by Mr. Ira D.
   Sankey is 1858. It is to be regretted that we have not other hymns and
   tunes from one who can write devotional poetry and music such as that
   represented by the single hymn and tune which we have here from his
   pen.

   Wesley, Charles, has been called "the poet of Methodism," but this
   designation is too narrow for him. He might more properly be called the
   poet of Christendom, for the entire Christian world is indebted to him
   for many of its most valuable hymns. For the first place among English
   hymn writers he has never had but one competitor. Hymnologists have
   sometimes instituted a comparison between the hymns of Wesley and those
   of [110]Watts. Some have given the preference to one, and some to the
   other. We must remember that these men were not rivals. They were too
   good, too great, and too unlike to be antagonists. They were both
   princes--aye, kings--of song, but each in his own realm. Watts's great
   theme was divine majesty, and no one approaches him in excellence upon
   this subject. Wesley's grandest theme was love--the love of God--and
   here he had no rival. Charles Wesley was born in Epworth, England,
   December 18, 1707. He was educated at Westminster School and Oxford
   University, where he took his degree in 1728. It was while a student at
   Christ Church College that Wesley and a few associates, by strict
   attention to duty and exemplary conduct, won for themselves the
   derisive epithet of "Methodists." He was ordained a priest in the
   Church of England in 1735, and that same year he sailed with his
   brother [111]John as a missionary to Georgia, but soon returned to
   England. He was not converted, according to his own statement, until
   Whitsunday, May 21, 1738. (See note under No. 1.) On that day he
   received a conscious knowledge of sins forgiven, and this event was the
   real beginning of his mission as the singer of Methodism. He tells his
   own experience beautifully in the hymn beginning:


   And can it be that I should gain

   An interest in the Saviour's blood?

   Charles Wesley's hymns may be generally classified as follows: Hymns of
   Christian experience ("O for a thousand tongues to sing" is an
   example); invitation hymns (of which "Come, sinners, to the gospel
   feast" is a good specimen); sanctification hymns ("O for a heart to
   praise my God" is one of them); funeral hymns ("Rejoice for a brother
   deceased"); and hymns on the love of God, a subject on which he never
   became weary. "Wrestling Jacob" represents the last class. But it is
   preëminently in portraying the various phases of experimental
   religion--conviction of sin, penitence, saving faith, pardon,
   assurance, entire sanctification--that Charles Wesley is quite without
   a peer among hymn writers. His songs have been one of the most potent
   forces in Methodism since its organization. Nor was he a singer alone,
   but as an itinerant preacher he was a busy and earnest colaborer with
   his brother John. After his marriage, in 1749, his itinerant labors
   were largely restricted to London and Bristol. He died March 29, 1788.
   "After all," says Dr. John Julian, the greatest authority in English
   Hymnology, "it was Charles Wesley who was the great hymn writer of the
   Wesley family, and perhaps, taking quantity and quality into
   consideration, the great hymn writer of all ages." Of the six thousand
   and five hundred hymns by Charles Wesley (all of which were written
   after his conversion), this collection contains one hundred and
   twenty-one. (See page 451 for a complete list of the poetical
   publications of John and Charles Wesley.)

   Wesley, John, is so well known as the founder of Methodism that we need
   give here only the leading dates and events in his life. He was born at
   the Epworth rectory June 28, 1703; went to Oxford University in 1720;
   was ordained deacon in 1725; was made Fellow of Lincoln College in
   1726; was his father's curate, 1727-29; returned to Oxford in 1729, and
   became leader of the holy club, sneeringly called "Methodists," which
   had been organized during his absence by his brother Charles; went to
   Georgia as a missionary in 1735, and while here published his first
   hymn book (1736-37) at Charleston, S. C. He returned to England at the
   end of two years, saying: "I went to America to convert the Indians,
   but O who shall convert me? Who is he that will deliver me from this
   evil heart of unbelief?" He had been impressed by the piety and faith
   of the Moravians in a storm while crossing the ocean, and they now
   became his spiritual guides. While attending one of their prayer
   meetings on May 24, 1738, he obtained the conscious knowledge of sins
   forgiven and of his acceptance with God. From this time until his
   death, March 2, 1791, he was unremitting in his labors as a preacher of
   that religion which he had experienced and as an organizer of converted
   men for the work of evangelization. As a revivalist and Christian
   reformer his work is known and read of all men. Nearly all of the
   Wesleyan hymns, even those found in volumes issued jointly by the two
   brothers, are commonly accredited to [112]Charles Wesley. As, however,
   John Wesley states that he and his brother agreed among themselves not
   to distinguish their hymns, it cannot be definitely known that John
   Wesley is not himself the author of some of the hymns accredited to
   Charles Wesley. He is known to be the author of numerous translations
   from the German, and these are among the most successful translations
   and finest hymns in the entire range of English hymnology, being marked
   by deep spirituality and lofty devotional thought. His translations
   were the result in part of a visit to the Moravian settlement at
   Herrnhut, in Germany. (See page 451 for a complete list of the poetical
   publications of John and Charles Wesley.) Of the following seventeen
   hymns, all but three are translations:

   Come, Saviour, Jesus   Bourignon   379
   Commit thou all thy    Gerhardt    435
   Give to the winds thy  Gerhardt    437
   High on his everlast   Spangenberg 221
   How happy is the       Original    624
   I thank thee, uncreat  Scheffler   367
   I thirst, thou wounded Zinzendorf  335
   Into thy gracious      Dessler     305
   Jesus, thy blood and   Zinzendorf  148
   Jesus, thy boundless   Gerhardt    333
   My soul before thee    Richter     273
   Now I have found the   Rothe       302
   O thou, to whose       Zinzendorf  359
   Shall I, for fear of   Winkler     225
   Thou hidden love of    Tersteegen  345
   To God, the Father     Original    722
   We lift our hearts to  Original    45

   Wesley, Samuel, the son of Rev. John Wesley and the father of [113]John
   and [114]Charles Wesley, was born in 1662. While an academy student
   Wesley expected to enter the ministry of the Dissenters. The change in
   his opinions was a little remarkable. Some one had written severely
   against the Dissenters, and Mr. Samuel Wesley was appointed to reply.
   This led him to a course of reading which in the end resulted
   differently from what was expected. He left the Dissenters and attached
   himself to the Established Church. Entering Exeter College, Oxford, as
   a servitor, he was graduated in 1688. Ordained soon after, he served as
   curate in several places. In 1696 he dedicated his Life of Christ, an
   Heroic Poem, to Queen Mary, who presented him with the living at
   Epworth, where he remained until his death, April 22, 1735. In 1689, he
   married Susanna Annesley, whose fame has gone wherever Christian
   motherhood is honored. They had nineteen children, nine of whom died in
   infancy. He published The Old and New Testaments Attempted in Verse in
   1716, and had just finished at the time of his death a volume of
   learned Dissertations on the Book of Job. His oldest son, Samuel
   Wesley, Jr., was also a hymn writer of some note. On December 1, 1730,
   he wrote the following: "I hear my son John has the honor of being
   styled 'the father of the holy club.' If it be so, I must be the
   grandfather of it; and I need not say that I had rather any of my sons
   should be so dignified and distinguished than to have the title of 'His
   Holiness.'"

   West, Robert Athow, an English-American Methodist layman, editor, and
   author, was born at Thetford, England, in 1809; came to this country in
   1843; was the official reporter of the important and historic session
   of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1844.
   Mr. West was a member of a committee of seven appointed by the General
   Conference of 1848 to prepare a standard edition of the hymn book which
   appeared later as Hymns for the Use of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
   1849. To this volume he contributed two hymns, one of which is that
   found in this collection. From 1846 to 1849 he edited the Columbia
   Magazine (New York). In 1858 he became editor of the New York
   Commercial Advertiser. He also published Sketches of Wesleyan
   Preachers, 1848, and A Father's Letters to His Daughter, 1865. He died
   at Georgetown, D. C., February 1, 1865.

   White, Henry Kirke, a gifted English poet who died early in life, was
   born in Nottingham, England, March 21, 1785. Very early he manifested a
   remarkable love for books and a decided talent for composition. But his
   parents were poor, and he was apprenticed in early boyhood to a
   stocking weaver, from which uncongenial servitude he escaped as soon as
   he could and began the study of law; but later he was converted and
   felt called to the ministry. The story of his conversion from deism to
   Christianity is briefly but beautifully told in the poem titled "The
   Star of Bethlehem." He entered St. John's College, Cambridge, in 1805
   as a servitor; but died October 19, 1806, in the second year of his
   college course, when only twenty-one years of age. In 1803 he published
   a small volume of poems. Some of them are very fine, but no doubt he
   would have produced others far better if he had lived to the ordinary
   age of man. His rare poetic genius, his victory over skepticism and
   subsequent faith and piety, his hard struggle with poverty and early
   death invest the story of his life with more than ordinary pathos. His
   hymns, ten in number, appeared in [115]Collyer's Collection, 1812.

   Whittier, John Greenleaf, commonly known as the "Quaker Poet," was born
   at Haverhill, Mass., December 17, 1807; and died at Hampton Falls, N.
   H., September 7, 1892. Beginning life as a farmer boy and village
   shoemaker, and with only a limited education, he entered the profession
   of journalism in 1828, becoming that year editor of the American
   Manufacturer, published in Boston, and in 1830 editor of the New
   England Review. In 1836 he became Secretary of the American
   Anti-Slavery Society and editor of its official organ, the Freeman. In
   Boston, Hartford, Haverhill, Philadelphia, and Washington he pursued
   his profession successfully for about twenty years, after which,
   beginning with 1847, he became the corresponding editor of the National
   Era in Washington, D. C. He was a strong advocate for the freedom of
   the slaves, and his pen both as journalist and poet was ever at the
   call of the cause that was so near to his heart. The Quaker poet was as
   much opposed to war as he was to slavery. With the rigid and narrow
   type of Calvinistic theology that so long dominated New England he had
   no sympathy, but felt that a part of his mission as a poet was to
   rebuke and refute a theology which he felt to be a caricature upon the
   heart and character of God. Many of his poems are described as
   "rhetoric on fire with emotion." In his religious poems he always
   magnified the goodness and love of God for man and man's love for and
   service of his fellow-man as that which proves far better than creeds
   and ceremonies could that one possesses the Christian character.
   Whittier's poems are pervaded by the ethical and religious element more
   largely, perhaps, than is true of the writings of any other great
   English poet of modern times. From 1824 to the year of his death (1892)
   he wrote and published poems singly in periodicals and collectively in
   book form. From these poems about seventy-five hymns have been made by
   selecting verses of religious and devotional sentiments. Our Hymnal
   contains seven of his hymns:

   Dear Lord and Father of mankind     543
   I bow my forehead in the dust       472
   It may not be our lot to wield      398
   O Love! O Life! Our faith and sight 479
   Our thought of thee is glad with    712
   We may not climb the heavenly       128
   When on my day of life the night    589

   Williams, Helen Maria, was born in the North of England in 1762. She
   published a volume of poems when only twenty-one years old, and in 1786
   her Poems appeared in two small volumes. She visited Paris in 1788, and
   lived there for some years with a sister who had married a French
   Protestant. This was during the period of the Revolution and the Reign
   of Terror. She was an outspoken republican in her sympathies, and was
   imprisoned by Robespierre because of some of her utterances in advocacy
   of the Girondist cause, being released from prison only after his
   death, in 1794. Her Letters from France (1790 and 1795) were published
   in England, America, and France. They dealt with political, religious,
   and literary questions, and showed her to be a woman of more than
   ordinary intellectual strength. She published many volumes between 1786
   and 1823, when her last volume appeared, titled Poems on Various
   Occasions, being a collection of all her previously published poems.
   She lived partly in England, but mostly in France, though the closing
   years of her life were spent in Holland in the home of a nephew who
   lived at Amsterdam and was pastor of the reformed Church there. Her
   death occurred at Paris December 14, 1827.

   Williams, William, has been called "the [116]Watts of Wales." He was
   born in 1717. His "awakening" was due to an open-air sermon by the
   famous Welsh preacher, Howell Harris. Williams received deacon's orders
   in the Established Church, but subsequently became a preacher in the
   Calvinistic Methodist connection. As an evangelistic preacher he was
   popular and successful, abounding in labors and exercising a wide
   influence among the Welsh. He died January 11, 1791.

   Willis, Nathaniel Parker, the well-known American poet and man of
   letters, was born at Portland, Me., January 20, 1807; graduated at Yale
   in 1827; followed a literary life with great success, publishing many
   volumes, one of poems; died at his beautiful home, "Idlewild," near
   Newburg-on-the-Hudson, January 29, 1867. He published a volume of
   Sacred Poems in 1843. His sister, Mrs. Parton, was a writer widely
   known under the nom de plume of "Fanny Fern."

   Winchester, Caleb Thomas, an educator and author, the son of Rev.
   George F. Winchester, was born at Montville, Conn., January 18, 1847;
   graduated at Wesleyan University with the A.D. degree in 1869, in which
   institution he has been Professor of English Literature since 1873. He
   has delivered courses of lectures at Amherst, Princeton, Johns Hopkins,
   and other universities. He received the honorary degree of Doctor of
   Literature from Dickinson College in 1892. He is the author of several
   scholarly volumes, among them Some Principles of Literary Criticism,
   1899; Life of John Wesley, 1906; A Group of English Essayists, 1910. He
   was a member of the Joint Commission that prepared this Hymnal. He is a
   member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He resides at Middletown,
   Conn., the seat of Wesleyan University.

   Winckler, John Joseph, a German Pietist, was born at Luckau, in Saxony,
   December 23, 1670. He was at first a pastor at Magdeburg, then a
   chaplain in the Protestant army, accompanying the troops to Holland and
   Italy, and at length returned to Magdeburg and became chief minister of
   the cathedral. He was no less eminent for his mental culture than for
   his piety. He was a preacher and writer who had the courage of his
   convictions, and this quality is notably manifest in the hymn by him
   found in this collection. He died August 11, 1722.

   Winkworth, Catherine, an English poetess unusually gifted as a
   translator of hymns, was a member of the Church of England. She was
   born in London September 13, 1829. Much of her early life was spent
   near Manchester, the family moving later to Clifton, near Bristol. She
   made a specialty of translations from the German. She was the author of
   the following books: Lyra Germanica ([117]first series, 1855;
   [118]second series, 1858); The Chorale Book for England, 1863;
   [119]Christian Singers of Germany, 1869. She died suddenly of heart
   disease at Monnetier, Savoy, July, 1878. Dr. James Martineau said: "Her
   translations contained in these volumes are invariably faithful and,
   for the most part, both terse and delicate; and an admirable art is
   applied to the management of complex and difficult versification."
   "Miss Winkworth," says Dr. Julian, "although not the earliest of modern
   translators of German into English, is certainly the foremost in rank
   and popularity." She possessed great intellectual and social gifts, and
   was deeply interested in the higher education of women. Six of her
   translations have a place in this volume.

   Faith is a living power from heaven 286
   Fear not, O little flock, the foe   445
   Leave God to order all thy ways     476
   Now God be with us, for the night   58
   Now thank we all our God            30
   Whate'er my God ordains is right    487

   Wolcott, Samuel, a Congregational clergyman, was born at South Windsor,
   Conn., July 2, 1813; graduated at Yale in 1833 and at Andover
   Theological Seminary in 1837; was missionary in Syria in 1840-42, after
   which time he served as pastor in various towns and cities, including
   Providence, R. I., Chicago, Ill., and Cleveland, Ohio, and later served
   for some time as Secretary of the Ohio Home Missionary Society. He then
   retired from active work, and died February 24, 1886. Although he did
   not begin writing hymns until late in life, he wrote altogether some
   two hundred hymns, about a dozen of which are found in modern Church
   hymnals.

   Woodhull, Alfred Alexander, a physician, the son of Rev. George S.
   Woodhull, a Presbyterian minister, was born at Cranbury, N. J., March
   25, 1810; graduated at Princeton in 1828, and soon after began the
   study of medicine. He received the degree of M.D. from the University
   of Pennsylvania. After a year as a resident physician in a hospital in
   Philadelphia, he began the practice of his profession at Marietta, Pa.,
   removing in 1835 to Princeton, where within a year he contracted a
   fever which occasioned his death October 5, 1836. He was a member of
   the Presbyterian Church. Although but twenty-six years of age, he had
   so secured the confidence of his fellows, both as a Christian man and a
   skilled physician, that his death was greatly lamented.

   Wordsworth, Christopher, a bishop of the Church of England, was born
   October 30, 1807, at Lambeth, England, his father, Christopher
   Wordsworth, being rector of the parish. He distinguished himself in
   athletics as well as in scholarship at Winchester. Entering Trinity
   College, Cambridge, in 1826, he won numerous university honors,
   graduating in 1830, after which he served as fellow, lecturer, and
   public orator in the college. In 1836 he became Headmaster of Harrow
   School, working in the school during his incumbency a moral reform
   which filled many students in the school with enthusiastic admiration.
   He was appointed a canon of Westminster in 1844, which offee he
   continued to fill during the nineteen years of his residence in
   Berkshire as the rector of a quiet country parish, living four months
   of each year in London, as was made necessary by his canonry. He was
   appointed Bishop of Lincoln in 1869, which office he held for fifteen
   years, resigning only a few months before his death, March 20, 1885.
   He, was a nephew of the poet William Wordsworth, with whom his
   relations were most intimate. He was a voluminous author, among his
   works being a Commentary on the Whole Bible (1856-70), a Church History
   (1881-83), and a volume of hymns titled The Holy Year, 1862. "This
   last-named volume," says Prebendary Overton, in Julian's Dictionary,
   "contains hymns not only for every season of the Church's year, but for
   every phase of that season, as indicated in the Book of Common Prayer.
   Like the Wesleys, he looked upon hymns as a valuable means of stamping
   permanently upon the memory the great doctrines of the Christian
   Church. He held it to be the first duty of a hymn writer to teach sound
   doctrine, and thus to save souls." Of Bishop Wordsworth's one hundred
   and twenty-seven hymns, about fifty are in common use.

   Father of all, from land and sea     566
   Hark! the sound of holy voices       613
   Holy, holy, holy, Lord               77
   O day of rest and gladness           68
   O Lord of heaven and earth and sea   692
   The day is gently sinking to a close 61

   Wreford, John Reynell, an English Unitarian minister, was born December
   12, 1800, at Barnstaple; educated at Manchester College, and in 1826
   became pastor of a Church in Birmingham. In 1831, on account of the
   failure of his voice, he withdrew from the active work of the ministry
   and, in canjunction with Rev. Hugh Hutton, established a school at
   Edgbaston. He wrote a History of Presbyterian Nonconformity in
   Birmingham, 1832, and Lays of Loyalty, 1837. He contributed fifty-five
   hymns to Rev. J. R. Beard's Collection, 1837. His most popular and
   valuable hymn is the one given in this book. The last years of his life
   were spent in retirement at Bristol, where he died in 1891.

   Xavier, Francis, a noted Jesuitic missionary of the Roman Catholic
   Church, was born of a noble family at the Castle of Xavier, near
   Pampeluna, in Spain, April 7, 1506. While at the University of Paris he
   came under the influence of Ignatius Loyola, the founder of the order
   of Jesuits. He was of an ardent and earnest religious temperament, full
   of zeal and courage. He was one of the greatest missionary spirits that
   ever lived, visiting India, Travancore, Ceylon, Malacca, Japan, and
   dying on his way to China December 22, 1552. He was in due time
   canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. While it is not certain that
   Xavier wrote the hymn here accredited to him, it must be said that the
   tradition that he wrote it is of long standing. Not only does Edward
   Caswall, the translator, accredit it to him, but both the editor and
   the assistant editor of Julian's Dictionary also decide in favor of his
   probable authorship. "The Latin form," says Mearns, "is probably by
   Xavier or by some German Jesuit." "This hymn," says Julian, "breathes
   Xavier's abnegation of self in every word, his spirit in every line."

   My God, I love thee not because 483

   Zinzendorf, Count Nicolaus Ludwig, the founder of the religious
   community of Herrnhut and the apostle of the United Brethren, was born
   at Dresden May 26, 1700. It is not often that noble blood and worldly
   wealth are allied with true piety and missionary zeal. Such, however,
   was the case with Count Zinzendorf. Spener, the father of Pietism, was
   his godfather; and Franke, the founder of the famous Orphan House, in
   Halle, was for several years his tutor. In 1731 Zinzendorf resigned all
   public duties and devoted himself to missionary work. He traveled
   extensively on the Continent, in Great Britain, and in America,
   preaching "Christ, and him crucified," and organizing societies of
   Moravian brethren. [120]John Wesley is said to have been under
   obligation to Zinzendorf for some ideas on singing, organization of
   classes, and Church government. Zinzendorf was the author of some two
   thousand hymns. Many of them are of little worth, but a few are very
   valuable, full of gospel sweetness and holy fervor. He died at Herrnhut
   May 6, 1760.

   I thirst, thou wounded Lamb of God   335
