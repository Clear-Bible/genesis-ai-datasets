Introductory Notice

   The genius of Lactantius suffers a sad transformation when unclothed of
   vernacular and stripped of the idiomatic graces of his style. But the
   intelligent reader will be sure to compare this translation with the
   Latinity of the original, and to recur to it often for the enjoyment of
   its charming rhetoric, and of the high sentiment it so nobly enforces
   and adorns. This volume will be the favourite of the series with many.
   The writings of the Christian Tully alone make up more than half of its
   contents; and it is supremely refreshing to reach, at last, an author
   who chronicles the triumph of the Gospel [1] over "Herod and Pontius
   Pilate;" over the heathen in their "rage," and the people in their
   "vain imaginings;" over "the kings of the earth who stood up, and the
   rulers who were gathered together against the Lord and against His
   Christ."

   I love the writings of Lactantius, and two of his sayings are always
   uppermost when I recall his name. They touch me like plaintive but
   inspiring music. Let me quote them entire: [2] --

   1. "Si vita est optanda sapienti profecto nullam aliam ob causam vivere
   optaverim, quam ut aliquid efficiam quod vita dignum sit."

   2. "Satis me vixisse arbitrabor, et officium hominis implesse, si labor
   meus aliquos homines ab erroribus liberatos, ad iter coeleste
   direxerit."

   The Minor Writers to be found in this volume are not unworthy of their
   place. They are chiefly valuable as an appendix to preceding volumes,
   [3] and illustrative of their contents.

   But this series is enriched beyond its original by the Bryennios
   Manuscript and the completed form of the pseudo-Clementine Epistle,
   edited by Professor Riddle. The same hand has annotated the Apostolic
   Constitutions, so called; and the student has in his brief but learned
   notes all the light which has been shed by modern scholarship on these
   invaluable relics of antiquity, since the days of the truly illustrious
   Bishop Beveridge. These, and the liturgical pseudepigraphic treasures
   of early Christianity I have gathered here, to distinguish them from
   the mere Apocrypha, which will largely make up the one remaining volume
   of the series.

   Of the Liturgies, I have said what seemed necessary as an introduction,
   in the proper place. [4] They are debased by mediæval alloy. In their
   English dress, and in the nudity of their appearance, without adequate
   notes and elucidations, they are therefore far from attractive
   specimens of liturgical literature. But it would have been beyond my
   province to say much where the original editors have said nothing, and
   I have contented myself with such comments only as seemed requisite to
   remind the student how to "take forth the precious from the vile."

  INTRODUCTORY NOTICE

        To

LACTANTIUS.

   [a.d. 260--330.] Reaching, at last, the epoch of Constantine, perhaps
   the reader will share my own feelings, as those of--


   "One who long, in thickets and in brakes

   Entangled, winds now this way, and now that,

   His devious course uncertain, seeking home,

   But finds at last a greensward smooth and large,

   Courageous, and refreshed for future toil."

   How strange it seems, after three centuries since John the Baptist
   suffered, to gain a moment when kings are not actually persecuting
   Christ in His servants!

   How marvelous the change must have been in the experience of the
   primitive faithful; the Roman Emperor not ashamed of Jesus, and setting
   up the cross on the standards of his legions! Tertullian, De Fuga, and
   the troubles of Cyprian about The Lapsed, are matters of the past. As
   in a moment, God has changed the world for His people, and their perils
   become as suddenly reversed. The world's favor begins to be the trial
   of faith, as its hatred before. The mild contemplative attitude of the
   Church at this period is something surprising. It accepts with little
   exultation this miracle of the Master; but so long has it been
   habituated to persecution, that it finds much of its discipline, and
   not less of its prevailing spirit, neutralized by its very triumph. No
   more the martyr's heroic testimony and his crown beyond this life; no
   such call for the celibate as had been enforced before in tomes of the
   Christian literature; and what need now of Antony's invitation to the
   desert and the cell? But, on the other hand, these ascetic forms of
   heroic faith were all that were now left to minister to the
   martyr-spirit, and to perpetuate the habits enforced upon the early
   believers. The hermitage and the monastery assumed a new
   attractiveness, and became dear to sentiment, as to principle before.
   We must not be surprised, then, at the tendencies of the age now
   rapidly developed; but let us rejoice for a moment in the times of
   refreshing from the Lord now at last vouchsafed to that "little flock"
   to which He had promised the kingdom.

   The "conversion of Constantine," as it is called, introduced the most
   marvelous revolution in human empire, in practical thought, and in the
   laws and manners of mankind, ever known in the history of the world. It
   is amazing how little the men of the epoch itself glorified their own
   introduction to "marvelous light," and how very little the Church has
   left us, to tell the story of its emotions when first it found itself
   at rest from fiery persecutions, or when came forth from the Emperor
   the Edict of Milan for the legal observance of "the Day of the Sun."
   [5] What a day that Easter was, when, emerging from the catacombs and
   other dens and caves of the earth, the Church herself seemed as one
   risen from the dead!

   We may be sure there were tears of joy and warm embraces among kindred
   long torn asunder by their common exposures to fire and sword. We
   cannot imagine, indeed, all, that was in the hearts of those Christian
   families that now kept holyday together in the face of the world, and
   sang fearlessly in holy places their anthem, "Christ is risen from the
   dead." But a moment's thought we ought to give, as we pass into a stage
   of history entirely fresh and new, to the power of God thus manifested.
   The miracle thus wrought by the ascended Christ needs no aid from the
   supposed "vision of Constantine" to make it a supernatural exhibition
   of His glory who is "King of kings and Lord of lords."

   Arnobius wrote to the minds of perplexed Pilates asking "What is truth"
   in a new spirit, and not indisposed to wash their own hands of the
   blood of Jesus, though not prepared to believe and be baptized. His
   pupil finds a better sort of Pilate in the Emperor and in his period.
   Constantine is a pagan still at heart, but he is convinced of the truth
   that Christ has a kingdom "not of this world;" and he must have this
   credit, above the Antonines, that he recognized in the Chris tians not
   only his best and most loyal subjects, but men of a character
   altogether superior [6] to that of the heathen, who had so long been
   the councillors of the empire. He was one, also, who accepted "the
   logic of events," and who came to terms with the inevitable in time to
   turn it to his own advantage.

   I think Constantine had read the Apologies addressed to the Antonines
   [7] by Justin Martyr, and was at first disposed only to accept the plea
   for Christians so far forth as Justin had urged it. Going so far, he
   was led beyond his positive convictions to measures of policy which
   identified him with the Church. That the Church was distrustful of him,
   and doubted how long the Imperial favor might be relied upon, is also
   apparent. This doubt accounts, in some degree, for the great moderation
   of the Church in accepting benefits from him, and in withholding notes
   of triumph. She instinctively foresaw Julians in the way, and expected
   reactionary periods. She forbore to baptize the Emperor, and encouraged
   his disposition to postpone. It was as when "the wolf of Benjamin" was
   introduced to the disciples: "they were afraid of him, and believed not
   that he was a disciple."

   Lactantius, moved, perhaps, by Hosius or Eusebius, undertakes the
   instruction of the Emperor, while seeming only to copy the example of
   Justin writing to Antoninus Pius. The Institutes, it is true, had been
   begun at an earlier date; but he economizes, for a new purpose, the
   material, in which, perhaps, he had only purposed to follow up the work
   of his teacher, in language better fitted to the polite, for refuting
   heathenism. I cannot doubt that he aimed, in pure Latinity, to win the
   Emperor and his court to a deeper and purer conviction of divine truth:
   to more than a feeble and possibly superstitious idea that it was
   useless to contend with it, and that the gods of the empire were
   impotent to protect themselves against Christian progress and its
   masterly exposures of their shame and nothingness.

   In language which has given him the title of the Christian Cicero,
   Lactantius employs Cicero himself as a defender of the truth;
   correcting him, indeed, and overruling his mistakes, rebuking his
   pusillanimity, and justly censuring him, (1) in philosophy, for
   declaring it no rule of action, however ennobling its precepts; and (2)
   in religion, for not venturing to profess conclusions to which his
   reasonings necessarily tend. All this is admirably adapted to carry on
   the work of Christian Fathers and Apologists under the change of times.
   He and Arnobius furnish but a supplement to the real teachers of the
   Church, and are not to be always depended on in statements of doctrine.
   They write like earnest converts, but not like theologians; yet,
   although their loose expressions are often inconsistent one with
   another, it is manifest that their design is to support orthodoxy as it
   had been defined by abler expounders. I think the large respect which
   Lactantius pays to the testimony of the Sibyls was addressed to the
   class with which he had to deal. Constantine was greatly influenced by
   such testimonies, if we may judge from his own liberal quotations [8]
   and his comments on the Pollio of Virgil, to which, as a Christian
   oracle, our author may have introduced him. In short, the day had come
   in which it could no longer be said with strict propriety of phrase,
   "Not many mighty, not many noble, are called;" and Lactantius accepted,
   as his mission, the enforcement, before such a class, of despised
   truths which the great had persecuted in vain for centuries. He drew
   them thus to the conclusion that God had indeed "chosen the foolish
   things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the
   world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the
   world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things
   which are not, to bring to naught things that are." Such was the
   prophecy of St. Paul, and the Labarum uplifted by Cæsar's legions
   proclaimed the fulfillment.

   I have little doubt that Lactantius was of heathen parentage, and was
   converted late in life. To his eternal honor he was not a "fair-weather
   Christian," but boldly confessed the faith amid the fires of the last
   and most terrible of the great persecutions. Its probable date suggests
   that his treatise on the persecutors may have been a far-reaching
   effort to dissuade the Cæsars of a later age from trying to restore
   "the gods to Latium." I confess my own partiality to our author, and
   the interest with which his writings continue to impress me, even now.
   In youth (Consule Planco) I brought to his pages an enthusiastic
   appreciation of the genius which had adorned the very dawn of Christian
   civilization by works of literary merit not inferior to those of the
   Augustan age. The crabbed Latinity of Tertullian has charms, indeed, of
   its own sort: it was the shaggy raiment of the ascetic and the
   confessor, "always bearing about in his own body the dying of the Lord
   Jesus." It befitted the age and the man, and those awful realities with
   which Christians had then to deal. Not words, but things, were their
   one concern. It is pleasant to find, however, that Christianity is not
   incapable of meeting all sorts and conditions of men; and Lactantius'
   was doubtless the instrument of Providence in bearing the testimony of
   Jesus, "even before kings," in language which promised to Roman letters
   the new and commanding development imparted to its language by
   Christianity, which has made it imperishable, and more truly "eternal"
   than Rome itself.

   The following is the Introductory Notice of the reverend translator:
   [9] --


   Lactantius has always held a very high place among the Christian
   Fathers, not only on account of the subject-matter of his writings, but
   also on account of the varied erudition, the sweetness of expression,
   and the grace and elegance of style, by which they are characterized.
   It appears, therefore, more remarkable that so little is known with
   certainty respecting his personal history. We are unable to fix with
   precision either the place or time of his birth, and even his name has
   been the subject of much discussion. It is known that he was a pupil of
   Arnobius, who gave lectures in rhetoric at Sicca in Africa. Hence it
   has been supposed that Lactantius was a native of Africa, while others
   have maintained that he was born in Italy, and that his birthplace
   probably was Firmium, on the Adriatic. He was probably born about the
   middle of the third century, since he is spoken of as far advanced in
   life about a.d. 315. He is usually denominated "Lucius Cælius Firmianus
   Lactantius;" but the name Cæcilius is sometimes substituted for Cælius,
   and it is uncertain whether Firmianus is a family name or a local [10]
   designation. Some have even supposed that be received the name of
   Lactantius from the milky softness of his style.

   He attained to great eminence as a teacher of rhetoric, and his fame
   far outstripped the reputation of his master Arnobius. Such, indeed,
   was his celebrity, that he was invited by the Emperor Diocletian to
   settle at Nicomedia, and there practise his art. He appears, however to
   have met with so little success in that city, as to have been reduced
   to extreme indigence. Abandoning his profession as a pleader, he
   devoted himself to literary composition. It was probably at this period
   that he embraced the Christian faith, and we may perhaps be justified
   in supposing some connection between his poverty and his change of
   religion. [11] He was afterwards called to settle in Gaul, probably
   about a.d. 315, and the Emperor Constantine entrusted to him the
   education of his son Crispus. He is believed to have died at Trèves
   about a.d. 325.

   His principal work is The Christian Institutions, or an Introduction to
   True Religion, in seven books, designed to supersede [12] the less
   complete treatises of Minucius Felix, Tertullian, and Cyprian. In these
   books, each of which has a distinct title, and constitutes a separate
   essay, he demonstrates the falsehood of the pagan religion, shows the
   vanity of the heathen philosophy, and undertakes the defense of the
   Christian religion against its adversaries. He also sets forth the
   nature of righteousness, gives instructions concerning the true worship
   of God, and treats of the punishment of the wicked, and the reward of
   the righteous in everlasting happiness.

   To the Institutions is appended an epitome dedicated to Pentadius. The
   authorship of this abridgment has been questioned in modem times; but
   it is expressly assigned to Lactantius by Hieronymus. The greater part
   of the work was wanting in the earlier editions, and it was not until
   the beginning of the eighteenth century that it was discovered nearly
   entire. [13]

   The treatise on The Anger of God is directed mainly against the tenets
   of the Epicureans and Stoics, who maintained that the deeds of men
   could produce no emotions of pleasure or anger in the Deity. Lactantius
   holds that the love of the good necessarily implies the hatred of evil;
   and that the tenets of these philosophers, as tending to overthrow the
   doctrine of future rewards and punishments, are subversive of the
   principles of true religion.

   In the treatise on The Workmanship of God, or The Formation of Man, the
   author dwells upon the wonderful construction of the human frame, and
   the adaptation of means to ends therein displayed, as proofs of the
   wisdom and goodness of God. The latter part of the book contains
   speculations concerning the nature and origin of the soul.

   In the treatise [14] on the Deaths of Persecutors, an argument for the
   truth of the Christian religion is derived from the fact, that those
   emperors who had been most distinguished as persecutors of the
   Christians, were special objects of divine vengeance.

   To these treatises are usually appended some poetical works which have
   been attributed to Lactantius, but it is very questionable whether any
   of them were really written by him.

   The poem on the Phoenix appears to be of a comparatively modern date.

   That on Easter [15] is believed to have been composed by Venantius
   Honorianus Clementianus Fortunatus in the sixth century.

   The poem on the Passion of the Lord, though much admired both in its
   language and style of thought, bears the impress of a later age. [16]

   There is also a collection of A Hundred Enigmas, [17] which has been
   attributed to Lactantius; but there is good reason to suppose that they
   are not the production of his pen. Heumann endeavored to prove that
   Symposium is the title of the work, and that no such person as
   Symposius [18] ever existed. But this opinion is untenable. It is true
   that Hieronymus speaks of Lactantius as the author of a Symposium, but
   there are no grounds for supposing that the work was of a light and
   trifling character: it was probably a serious dialogue.

   The style of Lactantius has been deservedly praised for the dignity,
   elegance, and clearness of expression by which it is characterized, and
   which have gained for him the appellation of the Christian Cicero. His
   writings everywhere give evidence of his varied and extensive
   erudition, and contain much valuable information respecting the systems
   of the ancient philosophers. But his claims as a theologian are open to
   question; for he holds peculiar opinions on many points, and he appears
   more successful as an opponent of error than as a maintainer of the
   truth. Lactantius has been charged with a leaning to Manicheism, [19]
   but the charge appears to be unfounded.

   The translation has been made from Migne's edition, from which most of
   the notes have been taken. The quotations from Virgil have been given
   in the words of Conington's translation, [20] and those from Lucretius
   in the words of Munro.

    preface.--of what great value the knowledge of the truth is and always has
    been.

   Men of great and distinguished talent, when they had entirely devoted
   themselves to learning, holding in contempt all actions both private
   and public, applied to the pursuit of investigating the truth whatever
   labour could be bestowed upon it; thinking it much more excellent to
   investigate and know the method of human and divine things, than to be
   entirely occupied with the heaping up of riches or the accumulation of
   honours. For no one can be made better or more just by these things,
   since they are frail and earthly, and pertain to the adorning of the
   body only. Those men were indeed most deserving of the knowledge of the
   truth, which they so greatly desired to know, that they even preferred
   it to all things. For it is plain that some gave up their property, and
   altogether abandoned the pursuit of pleasures, that, being disengaged
   and without impediment, they might follow the simple truth, and it
   alone. And so greatly did the name and authority of the truth prevail
   with them, that they proclaimed that the reward of the greatest good
   was contained in it. But they did not obtain the object of their wish,
   and at the same time lost their labour and industry; because the truth,
   that is the secret of the Most High God, who created all things, cannot
   be attained by our own ability and perceptions. Otherwise there would
   be no difference between God and man, if human thought could reach to
   the counsels and arrangements of that eternal majesty. And because it
   was impossible that the divine method of procedure should become known
   to man by his own efforts, God did not suffer man any longer to err in
   search of the light of wisdom, and to wander through inextricable
   darkness without any result of his labour, but at length opened his
   eyes, and made the investigation of the truth His own gift, so that He
   might show the nothingness of human wisdom, and point out to man
   wandering in error the way of obtaining immortality.

   But since few make use of this heavenly benefit and gift, because the
   truth lies hidden veiled in obscurity; and it is either an object of
   contempt to the learned because it has not suitable defenders, or is
   hated by the unlearned on account of its natural severity, which the
   nature of men inclined to vices cannot endure: for because there is a
   bitterness mingled with virtues, while vices are seasoned with
   pleasure, offended by the former and soothed by the latter, they are
   borne headlong, and deceived by the appearance of good things, they
   embrace evils for goods,--I have believed that these errors should be
   encountered, that both the learned may be directed to true wisdom, and
   the unlearned to true religion. And this profession is to be thought
   much better, more useful and glorious, than that of oratory, in which
   being long engaged, we trained young men not to virtue, but altogether
   to cunning wickedness. [21] Certainly we shall now much more rightly
   discuss respecting the heavenly precepts, by which we may be able to
   instruct the minds of men to the worship of the true majesty. Nor does
   he deserve so well respecting the affairs of men, who imparts the
   knowledge of speaking well, as he who teaches men to live in piety and
   innocence; on which account the philosophers were in greater glory
   among the Greeks than the orators. For they, the philosophers, were
   considered teachers of right living, which is far more excellent, since
   to speak well belongs only to a few, but to live well belongs to all.
   Yet that practice in fictitious suits has been of great advantage to
   us, so that we are now able to plead the cause of truth with greater
   copiousness and ability of speaking; for although the truth may be
   defended without eloquence, as it often has been defended by many, yet
   it needs to be explained, and in a measure discussed, with distinctness
   and elegance of speech, in order that it may flow with greater power
   into the minds of men, being both provided with its own force, and
   adorned with the brilliancy of speech.

    Chap. i.-- of religion and wisdom.

   We undertake, therefore, to discuss religion and divine things. For if
   some of the greatest orators, veterans as it were of their profession,
   having completed the works of their pleadings, at last gave themselves
   up to philosophy, and regarded that as a most just rest from their
   labours, if they tortured their minds in the investigation of those
   things which could not be found out, so that they appear to have sought
   for themselves not so much leisure as occupation, and that indeed with
   much greater trouble than in their former pursuit; how much more justly
   shall I betake myself as to a most safe harbour, to that pious, true,
   and divine wisdom, in which all things are ready for utterance,
   pleasant to the hearing, easy to be understood, honourable to be
   undertaken! And if some skilful men and arbiters of justice composed
   and published Institutions of civil law, by which they might lull the
   strifes and contentions of discordant citizens, how much better and
   more rightly shall we follow up in writing the divine Institutions, in
   which we shall not speak about rain-droppings, or the turning of
   waters, or the preferring of claims, but we shall speak of hope, of
   life, of salvation, of immortality, and of God, that we may put an end
   to deadly superstitions and most disgraceful errors.

   And we now commence this work under the auspices of your name, O mighty
   Emperor Constantine, who were the first of the Roman princes to
   repudiate errors, and to acknowledge and honour the majesty of the one
   and only true God. [22] For when that most happy day had shone upon the
   world, in which the Most High God raised you to the prosperous height
   of power, you entered upon a dominion which was salutary and desirable
   for all, with an excellent beginning, when, restoring justice which had
   been overthrown and taken away, you expiated the most shameful deed of
   others. In return for which action God will grant to you happiness,
   virtue, and length of days, that even when old you may govern the state
   with the same justice with which you began in youth, and may hand down
   to your children the guardianship of the Roman name, as you yourself
   received it from your father. For to the wicked, who still rage against
   the righteous in other parts of the world, the Omnipotent will also
   repay the reward of their wickedness with a severity proportioned to
   its tardiness; for as He is a most indulgent Father towards the godly,
   so is He a most upright Judge against the ungodly. And in my desire to
   defend His religion and divine worship, to whom can I rather appeal,
   whom can I address, but him by whom justice and wisdom have been
   restored to the affairs of men?

   Therefore, leaving the authors of this earthly philosophy, who bring
   forward nothing certain, let us approach the right path; for if I
   considered these to be sufficiently suitable guides to a good life, I
   would both follow them myself, and exhort others to follow them. But
   since they disagree among one another with great contention, and are
   for the most part at variance with themselves, it is evident that their
   path is by no means straightforward; since they have severally marked
   out distinct ways for themselves according to their own will, and have
   left great confusion to those who are seeking for the truth. But since
   the truth is revealed from heaven to us who have received the mystery
   of true religion, and since we follow God, the teacher of wisdom and
   the guide to truth, we call together all, without any distinction
   either of sex or of age, to heavenly pasture. For there is no more
   pleasant food for the soul than the knowledge of truth, [23] to the
   maintaining and explaining of which we have destined seven books,
   although the subject is one of almost boundless and immeasurable
   labour; so that if any one should wish to dilate upon and follow up
   these things to their full extent, he would have such an exuberant
   supply of subjects, that neither books would find any limit, nor speech
   any end. But on this account we will put together all things briefly,
   because those things which we are about to bring forward are so plain
   and lucid, that it seems to be more wonderful that the truth appears so
   obscure to men, and to those especially who are commonly esteemed wise,
   or because men will only need to be trained by us,--that is, to be
   recalled from the error in which they are entangled to a better course
   of life.

   And if, as I hope, we shall attain to this, we will send them to the
   very fountain of learning, which is most rich and abundant, by copious
   draughts of which they may appease the thirst conceived within, and
   quench their ardour. And all things will be easy, ready of
   accomplishment, and clear to them, if only they are not annoyed at
   applying patience in reading or hearing to the perception of the
   discipline of wisdom. [24] For many, pertinaciously adhering to vain
   superstitions, harden themselves against the manifest truth, not so
   much deserving well of their religions, which they wrongly maintain, as
   they deserve ill of themselves; who, when they have a straight path,
   seek devious windings; who leave the level ground that they may glide
   over a precipice; who leave the light, that, blind and enfeebled, they
   may lie in darkness. We must provide for these, that they may not fight
   against themselves, and that they may be willing at length to be freed
   from inveterate errors. And this they will assuredly do if they shall
   at any time see for what purpose they were born; for this is the cause
   of their perverseness,--namely, ignorance of themselves: and if any
   one, having gained the knowledge of the truth, shall have shaken off
   this ignorance, he will know to what object his life is to be directed,
   and how it is to be spent. And I thus briefly define the sum of this
   knowledge, that neither is any religion to be undertaken without
   wisdom, nor any wisdom to be approved of without religion.

    Chap. II.--That there is a providence in the affairs of men.

   Having therefore undertaken the office of explaining the truth, I did
   not think it so necessary to take my commencement from that inquiry
   which naturally seems the first, whether there is a providence which
   consults for all things, or all things were either made or are governed
   by chance; which sentiment was introduced by Democritus, and confirmed
   by Epicurus. But before them, what did Protagoras effect, who raised
   doubts respecting the gods; or Diagoras afterwards, who excluded them;
   and some others, who did not hold the existence of gods, except that
   there was supposed to be no providence? These, however, were most
   vigorously opposed by the other philosophers, and especially by the
   Stoics, who taught that the universe could neither have been made
   without divine intelligence, nor continue to exist unless it were
   governed by the highest intelligence. But even Marcus Tullius, although
   he was a defender of the Academic system, discussed at length and on
   many occasions respecting the providence which governs affairs,
   confirming the arguments of the Stoics, and himself adducing many new
   ones; and this he does both in all the books of his own philosophy, and
   especially in those which treat of the nature of the gods. [25]

   And it was no difficult task, indeed, to refute the falsehoods of a few
   men who entertained perverse sentiments by the testimony of communities
   and tribes, who on this one point had no disagreement. For there is no
   one so uncivilized, and of such an uncultivated disposition, who, when
   he raises his eyes to heaven, although he knows not by the providence
   of what God all this visible universe is governed, does not understand
   from the very magnitude of the objects, from their motion, arrangement,
   constancy, usefulness, beauty, and temperament, that there is some
   providence, and that that which exists with wonderful method must have
   been prepared by some greater intelligence. And for us, assuredly, it
   is very easy to follow up this part as copiously as it may please us.
   But because the subject has been much agitated among philosophers, and
   they who take away providence appear to have been sufficiently answered
   by men of sagacity and eloquence, and because it is necessary to speak,
   in different places throughout this work which we have undertaken,
   respecting the skill of the divine providence, let us for the present
   omit this inquiry, which is so closely connected with the other
   questions, that it seems possible for us to discuss no subject, without
   at the same time discussing the subject of providence.

    Chap. III.--Whether the universe is governed by the power of one god or of
    many.

   Let the commencement of our work therefore be that inquiry which
   closely follows and is connected with the first: Whether the universe
   is governed by the power of one God or of many. There is no one, who
   possesses intelligence and uses reflection, who does not understand
   that it is one Being who both created all things and governs them with
   the same energy by which He created them. For what need is there of
   many to sustain the government of the universe? unless we should happen
   to think that, if there were more than one, each would possess less
   might and strength. And they who hold that there are many gods, do
   indeed effect this; for those gods must of necessity be weak, since
   individually, without the aid of the others, they would be unable to
   sustain the government of so vast a mass. But God, who is the Eternal
   Mind, is undoubtedly of excellence, complete and perfect in every part.
   And if this is true, He must of necessity be one. For power or
   excellence, which is complete, retains its own peculiar stability. But
   that is to be regarded as solid from which nothing can be taken away,
   that as perfect to which nothing can be added.

   Who can doubt that he would be a most powerful king who should have the
   government of the whole world? And not without reason, since all things
   which everywhere exist would belong to him, since all resources from
   all quarters would be centred in him alone. But if more than one divide
   the government of the world, undoubtedly each will have less power and
   strength, since every one must confine himself within his prescribed
   portion. [26] In the same manner also, if there are more gods than one,
   they will be of less weight, others having in themselves the same
   power. But the nature of excellence admits of greater perfection in him
   in whom the whole is, than in him in whom there is only a small part of
   the whole. But God, if He is perfect, as He ought to be, cannot but be
   one, because He is perfect, so that all things may be in Him. Therefore
   the excellences and powers of the gods must necessarily be weaker,
   because so much will be wanting to each as shall be in the others; and
   so the more there are, so much the less powerful will they be. Why
   should I mention that this highest power and divine energy is
   altogether incapable of division? For whatever is capable of division
   must of necessity be liable to destruction also. But if destruction is
   far removed from God, because He is incorruptible and eternal, it
   follows that the divine power is incapable of division. Therefore God
   is one, if that which admits of so great power can be nothing else: and
   yet those who deem that there are many gods, say that they have divided
   their functions among themselves; but we will discuss all these matters
   at their proper places. In the meantime, I affirm this, which belongs
   to the present subject. If they have divided their functions among
   themselves, the matter comes back to the same point, that any one of
   them is unable to supply the place of all. He cannot, then, be perfect
   who is unable to govern all things while the others are unemployed. And
   so is comes to pass, that for the government of the universe there is
   more need of the perfect excellence of one than of the imperfect powers
   of many. But he who imagines that so great a magnitude as this cannot
   be governed by one Being, is deceived. For he does not comprehend how
   great are the might and power of the divine majesty, if he thinks that
   the one God, who had power to create the universe, is also unable to
   govern that which He has created. But if he conceives in his mind how
   great is the immensity of that divine work, when before it was nothing,
   yet that by the power and wisdom of God it was made out of nothing--a
   work which could only be commenced and accomplished by one--he will now
   understand that that which has been established by one is much more
   easily governed by one.

   Some one may perhaps say that so immense a work as that of the universe
   could not even have been fabricated except by many. But however many
   and however great he may consider them,--whatever magnitude, power,
   excellence, and majesty he may attribute to the many,--the whole of
   that I assign to one, and say that it exists in one: so that there is
   in Him such an amount of these properties as can neither be conceived
   nor expressed. And since we fail in this subject, both in perception
   and in words--for neither does the human breast admit the light of so
   great understanding, nor is the mortal tongue capable of explaining
   such great subjects--it is right that we should understand and say this
   very same thing. I see, again, what can be alleged on the other hand,
   that those many gods are such as we hold the one God to be. But this
   cannot possibly be so, because the power of these gods individually
   will not be able to proceed further, the power of the others meeting
   and hindering them. For either each must be unable to pass beyond his
   own limits, or, if he shall have passed beyond them, he must drive
   another from his boundaries. They who believe that there are many gods,
   do not see that it may happen that some may be opposed to others in
   their wishes, from which circumstance disputing and contention would
   arise among them; as Homer represented the gods at war among
   themselves, since some desired that Troy should be taken, others
   opposed it. The universe, therefore, must be ruled by the will of one.
   For unless the power over the separate parts be referred to one and the
   same providence, the whole itself will not be able to exist; since each
   takes care of nothing beyond that which belongs peculiarly to him, just
   as warfare could not be carried on without one general and commander.
   But if there were in one army as many generals as there are legions,
   cohorts, divisions, [27] and squadrons, first of all it would not be
   possible for the army to be drawn out in battle array, since each would
   refuse the peril; nor could it easily be governed or controlled,
   because all would use their own peculiar counsels, by the diversity of
   which they would inflict more injury than they would confer advantage.
   So, in this government of the affairs of nature, unless there shall be
   one to whom the care of the whole is referred, all things will be
   dissolved and fall to decay.

   But to say that the universe is governed by the will of many, is
   equivalent to a declaration that there are many minds in one body,
   since there are many and various offices of the members, so that
   separate minds may be supposed to govern separate senses; and also the
   many affections, by which we are accustomed to be moved either to
   anger, or to desire, or to joy, or to fear, or to pity, so that in all
   these affections as many minds may be supposed to operate; and if any
   one should say this, he would appear to be destitute even of that very
   mind, which is one. But if in one body one mind possesses the
   government of so many things, and is at the same time occupied with the
   whole, why should any one suppose that the universe cannot be governed
   by one, but that it can be governed by more than one? And because those
   maintainers of many gods are aware of this, they say that they so
   preside over separate offices and parts, that there is still one chief
   ruler. The others, therefore, on this principle, will not be gods, but
   attendants and ministers, whom that one most mighty and omnipotent
   appointed to these offices, and they themselves will be subservient to
   his authority and command. If, therefore, all are not equal to one
   another, all are not gods; for that which serves and that which rules
   cannot be the same. For if God is a title of the highest power, He must
   be incorruptible, perfect, incapable of suffering, and subject to no
   other being; therefore they are not gods whom necessity compels to obey
   the one greatest God. But because they who hold this opinion are not
   deceived without cause, we will presently lay open the cause of this
   error. Now, let us prove by testimonies the unity of the divine power.

    Chap. IV.--That the one god was foretold even by the prophets.

   The prophets, who were very many, proclaim and declare the one God;
   for, being filled with the inspiration of the one God, they predicted
   things to come, with agreeing and harmonious voice. But those who are
   ignorant of the truth do not think that these prophets are to be
   believed; for they say that those voices are not divine, but human.
   Forsooth, because they proclaim one God, they were either madmen or
   deceivers. But truly we see that their predictions have been fulfilled,
   and are in course of fulfilment daily; and their foresight, agreeing as
   it does to one opinion, teaches that they were not under the impulse of
   madness. For who possessed of a frenzied mind would be able, I do not
   say to predict the future, but even to speak coherently? Were they,
   therefore, who spoke such things deceitful? What was so utterly foreign
   to their nature as a system of deceit, when they themselves restrained
   others from all fraud? For to this end were they sent by God, that they
   should both be heralds of His majesty, and correctors of the wickedness
   of man.

   Moreover, the inclination to feign and speak falsely belongs to those
   who covet riches, and eagerly desire gains,--a disposition which was
   far removed from those holy men. For they so discharged the office
   entrusted to them, that, disregarding all things necessary for the
   maintenance of life, they were so far from laying up store for the
   future, that they did not even labour for the day, content with the
   unstored food which God had supplied; and these not only had no gains,
   but even endured torments and death. For the precepts of righteousness
   are distasteful to the wicked, and to those who lead an unholy life.
   Wherefore they, whose sins were brought to light and forbidden, most
   cruelly tortured and slew them. They, therefore, who had no desire for
   gain, had neither the inclination nor the motive for deceit. Why should
   I say that some of them were princes, or even kings, [28] upon whom the
   suspicion of covetousness and fraud could not possibly fall, and yet
   they proclaimed the one God with the same prophetic foresight as the
   others?

    Chap. V.--Of the testimonies of poets and philosophers.

   But let us leave the testimony of prophets, lest a proof derived from
   those who are universally disbelieved should appear insufficient. Let
   us come to authors, and for the demonstration of the truth let us cite
   as witnesses those very persons whom they are accustomed to make use of
   against us,--I mean poets and philosophers. From these we cannot fail
   in proving the unity of God; not that they had ascertained the truth,
   but that the force of the truth itself is so great, that no one can be
   so blind as not to see the divine brightness presenting itself to his
   eyes. The poets, therefore, however much they adorned the gods in their
   poems, and amplified their exploits with the highest praises, yet very
   frequently confess that all things are held together and governed by
   one spirit or mind. Orpheus, who is the most ancient of the poets, and
   coeval with the gods themselves,--since it is reported that he sailed
   among the Argonauts together with the sons of Tyndarus and
   Hercules,--speaks of the true and great God as the first-born, [29]
   because nothing was produced before Him, but all things sprung from
   Him. He also calls Him Phanes [30] because when as yet there was
   nothing He first appeared and came forth from the infinite. And since
   he was unable to conceive in his mind the origin and nature of this
   Being, he said that He was born from the boundless air: "The
   first-born, Phaethon, son of the extended air;" for he had nothing more
   to say. He affirms that this Being is the Parent of all the gods, on
   whose account He framed the heaven, and provided for His children that
   they might have a habitation and place of abode in common: "He built
   for immortals an imperishable home." Thus, under the guidance of nature
   and reason, he understood that there was a power of surpassing
   greatness which framed heaven and earth. For he could not say that
   Jupiter was the author of all things, since he was born from Saturn;
   nor could he say that Saturn himself was their author, since it was
   reported that he was produced from the heaven; but he did not venture
   to set up the heaven as the primeval god, because he saw that it was an
   element of the universe, and must itself have had an author. This
   consideration led him to that first-born god, to whom he assigns and
   gives the first place.

   Homer was able to give us no information relating to the truth, for he
   wrote of human rather than divine things. Hesiod was able, for he
   comprised in the work of one book the generation of the gods; but yet
   he gave us no information, for he took his commencement not from God
   the Creator, but from chaos, which is a confused mass of rude and
   unarranged matter; whereas he ought first to have explained from what
   source, at what time, and in what manner, chaos itself had begun to
   exist or to have consistency. Without doubt, as all things were placed
   in order, arranged, and made by some artificer, so matter itself must
   of necessity have been formed by some being. Who, then, made it except
   God, to whose power all things are subject? But he shrinks from
   admitting this, while he dreads the unknown truth. For, as he wished it
   to appear, it was by the inspiration of the Muses that he poured forth
   that song on Helicon; but he had come after previous meditation and
   preparation.

   Maro was the first of our poets to approach the truth, who thus speaks
   respecting the highest God, whom he calls Mind and Spirit: [31] --


   "Know first, the heaven, the earth, the main,

   The moon's pale orb, the starry train,

   Are nourished by a Soul,

   A Spirit, whose celestial flame

   Glows in each member of the frame,

   And stirs the mighty whole."

   And lest any one should happen to be ignorant what that Spirit was
   which had so much power, he has declared it in another place, saying:
   [32] "For the Deity pervades all lands, the tracts of sea and depth of
   heaven; the flocks, the herds, and men, and all the race of beasts,
   each at its birth, derive their slender lives from Him."

   Ovid also, in the beginning of his remarkable work, without any
   disguising of the name, admits that the universe was arranged by God,
   whom he calls the Framer of the world, the Artificer of all things.
   [33] But if either Orpheus or these poets of our country had always
   maintained what they perceived under the guidance of nature, they would
   have comprehended the truth, and gained the same learning which we
   follow. [34]

   But thus far of the poets. Let us come to the philosophers, whose
   authority is of greater weight, and their judgment more to be relied
   on, because they are believed to have paid attention, not to matters of
   fiction, but to the investigation of the truth. Thales of Miletus, who
   was one of the number of the seven wise men, and who is said to have
   been the first of all to inquire respecting natural causes, said that
   water was the element from which all things were produced, and that God
   was the mind which formed all things from water. Thus he placed the
   material of all things in moisture; he fixed the beginning and cause of
   their production in God. Pythagoras thus defined the being of God, "as
   a soul passing to and fro, and diffused through all parts of the
   universe, and through all nature, from which all living creatures which
   are produced derive their life." Anaxagoras said that God was an
   infinite mind, which moves by its own power. Antisthenes maintained
   that the gods of the people were many, but that the God of nature was
   one only; that is, the Fabricator of the whole universe. Cleanthes and
   Anaximenes assert that the air is the chief deity; and to this opinion
   our poet has assented: [35] "Then almighty father Æther descends in
   fertile showers into the bosom of his joyous spouse; and great himself,
   mingling with her great body, nourishes all her offspring." Chrysippus
   speaks of God as a natural power endowed with divine reason, and
   sometimes as a divine necessity. Zeno also speaks of Him as a divine
   and natural law. The opinion of all these, however uncertain it is, has
   reference to one point,--to their agreement in the existence of one
   providence. For whether it be nature, or æther, or reason, or mind, or
   a fatal necessity, or a divine law, or if you term it anything else, it
   is the same which is called by us God. Nor does the diversity of titles
   prove an obstacle, since by their very signification they all refer to
   one object. Aristotle, although he is at variance with himself, and
   both utters and holds sentiments opposed to one another, yet upon the
   whole bears witness that one Mind presides over the universe. Plato,
   who is judged the wisest of all, plainly and openly maintains the rule
   of one God; nor does he name Him Æther, or Reason, or Nature, but, as
   He truly is, God, and that this universe, so perfect and wonderful, was
   fabricated by Him. And Cicero, following and imitating him in many
   instances, frequently acknowledges God, and calls Him supreme, in those
   books which he wrote on the subject of laws; and he adduces proof that
   the universe is governed by Him, when he argues respecting the nature
   of the gods in this way: "Nothing is superior to God: the world must
   therefore be governed by Him. Therefore God is obedient or subject to
   no nature; consequently He Himself governs all nature." But what God
   Himself is he defines in his Consolation: [36] "Nor can God Himself, as
   He is comprehended by us, be comprehended in any other way than as a
   mind free and unrestrained, far removed from all mortal materiality,
   perceiving and moving all things."

   How often, also, does Annæus Seneca, who was the keenest Stoic of the
   Romans, follow up with deserved praise the supreme Deity! For when he
   was discussing the subject of premature death, he said "You do not
   understand the authority and majesty of your Judge, the Ruler of the
   world, and the God of heaven and of all gods, on whom those deities
   which we separately worship and honour are dependent." Also in his
   Exhortations: "This Being, when He was laying the first foundations of
   the most beautiful fabric, and was commencing this work, than which
   nature has known nothing greater or better, that all things might serve
   their own rulers, although He had spread Himself out through the whole
   body, yet He produced gods as ministers of His kingdom." And how many
   other things like to our own writers did he speak on the subject of
   God! But these things I put off for the present, because they are more
   suited to other parts of the subject. At present it is enough to
   demonstrate that men of the highest genius touched upon the truth, and
   almost grasped it, had not custom, infatuated by false opinions,
   carried them back; by which custom they both deemed that there were
   other gods, and believed that those things which God made for the use
   of man, as though they were endowed with perception, were to be held
   and worshipped as gods.

    Chap. VI.--Of divine testimonies, and of the sibyls and their predictions.

   Now let us pass to divine testimonies; but I will previously bring
   forward one which resembles a divine testimony, both on account of its
   very great antiquity, and because he whom I shall name was taken from
   men and placed among the gods. According to Cicero, Caius Cotta the
   pontiff, while disputing against the Stoics concerning superstitions,
   and the variety of opinions which prevail respecting the gods, in order
   that he might, after the custom of the Academics, make everything
   uncertain, says that there were five Mercuries; and having enumerated
   four in order, says that the fifth was he by whom Argus was slain, and
   that on this account he fled into Egypt, and gave laws and letters to
   the Egyptians. The Egyptians call him Thoth; and from him the first
   month of their year, that is, September, received its name among them.
   He also built a town, which is even now called in Greek Hermopolis (the
   town of Mercury), and the inhabitants of Phenæ honour him with
   religious worship. And although he was a man, yet he was of great
   antiquity, and most fully imbued with every kind of learning, so that
   the knowledge of many subjects and arts acquired for him the name of
   Trismegistus. [37] He wrote books, and those in great numbers, relating
   to the knowledge of divine things, in which be asserts the majesty of
   the supreme and only God, and makes mention of Him by the same names
   which we use--God and Father. And that no one might inquire His name,
   he said that He was without name, and that on account of His very unity
   He does not require the peculiarity of a name. These are his own words:
   "God is one, but He who is one only does not need a name; for He who is
   self-existent is without a name." God, therefore, has no name, because
   He is alone; nor is there any need of a proper name, except in cases
   where a multitude of persons requires a distinguishing mark, so that
   you may designate each person by his own mark and appellation. But God,
   because He is always one, has no peculiar name.

   It remains for me to bring forward testimonies respecting the sacred
   responses and predictions, which are much more to be relied upon. For
   perhaps they against whom we are arguing may think that no credence is
   to be given to poets, as though they invented fictions, nor to
   philosophers, inasmuch as they were liable to err, being themselves but
   men. Marcus Varro, than whom no man of greater learning ever lived,
   even among the Greeks, much less among the Latins, in those books
   respecting divine subjects which he addressed to Caius Cæsar the chief
   pontiff, when he was speaking of the Quindecemviri, [38] says that the
   Sibylline books were not the production of one Sibyl only, but that
   they were called by one name Sibylline, because all prophetesses were
   called by the ancients Sibyls, either from the name of one, the
   Delphian priestess, or from their proclaiming the counsels of the gods.
   For in the Æolic dialect they used to call the gods by the word Sioi,
   not Theoi; and for counsel they used the word bule, not boule;--and so
   the Sibyl received her name as though Siobule. [39] But he says that
   the Sibyls were ten in number, and he enumerated them all under the
   writers, who wrote an account of each: that the first was from the
   Persians, and of her Nicanor made mention, who wrote the exploits of
   Alexander of Macedon;--the second of Libya, and of her Euripides makes
   mention in the prologue of the Lamia;--the third of Delphi, concerning
   whom Chrysippus speaks in that book which he composed concerning
   divination;--the fourth a Cimmerian in Italy, whom Nævius mentions in
   his books of the Punic war, and Piso in his annals;--the fifth of
   Erythræa, whom Apollodorus of Erythræa affirms to have been his own
   countrywoman, and that she foretold to the Greeks when they were
   setting out for Ilium, both that Troy was doomed to destruction, and
   that Homer would write falsehoods;--the sixth of Samos, respecting whom
   Eratosthenes writes that he had found a written notice in the ancient
   annals of the Samians. The seventh was of Cumæ, by name Amalthæa, who
   is termed by some Herophile, or Demophile, and they say that she
   brought nine books to the king Tarquinius Priscus, and asked for them
   three hundred philippics, and that the king refused so great a price,
   and derided the madness of the woman; that she, in the sight of the
   king, burnt three of the books, and demanded the same price for those
   which were left; that Tarquinias much more considered the woman to be
   mad; and that when she again, having burnt three other books, persisted
   in asking the same price, the king was moved, and bought the remaining
   books for the three hundred pieces of gold: and the number of these
   books was afterwards increased, after the rebuilding of the Capitol;
   because they were collected from all cities of Italy and Greece, and
   especially from those of Erythræa, and were brought to Rome, under the
   name of whatever Sibyl they were. Further, that the eighth was from the
   Hellespont, born in the Trojan territory, in the village of Marpessus,
   about the town of Gergithus; and Heraclides of Pontus writes that she
   lived in the times of Solon and Cyrus;--the ninth of Phrygia, who gave
   oracles at Ancyra;--the tenth of Tibur, by name Albunea, who is
   worshipped at Tibur as a goddess, near the banks of the river Anio, in
   the depths of which her statue is said to have been found, holding in
   her hand a book. The senate transferred her oracles into the Capitol.

   The predictions of all these Sibyls [40] are both brought forward and
   esteemed as such, except those of the Cumæan Sibyl, whose books are
   concealed by the Romans; nor do they consider it lawful for them to be
   inspected by any one but the Quindecemviri. And there are separate
   books the production of each, but because these are inscribed with the
   name of the Sibyl they are believed to be the work of one; and they are
   confused, nor can the productions of each be distinguished and assigned
   to their own authors, except in the case of the Erythræan Sibyl, for
   she both inserted her own true name in her verse, and predicted that
   she would be called Erythræan, though she was born at Babylon. But we
   also shall speak of the Sibyl without any distinction, wherever we
   shall have occasion to use their testimonies. All these Sibyls, then,
   proclaim one God, and especially the Erythræan, who is regarded among
   the others as more celebrated and noble; since Fenestella, a most
   diligent writer, speaking of the Quindecemviri, says that, after the
   rebuilding of the Capitol, Caius Curio the consul proposed to the
   senate that ambassadors should be sent to Erythræ to search out and
   bring to Rome the writings of the Sibyl; and that, accordingly, Publius
   Gabinius, Marcus Otacilius, and Lucius Valerius were sent, who conveyed
   to Rome about a thousand verses written out by private persons. We have
   shown before that Varro made the same statement. Now in these verses
   which the ambassadors brought to Rome, are these testimonies respecting
   the one God:--


   1. "One God, who is alone, most mighty, uncreated."

   This is the only supreme God, who made the heaven, and decked it with
   lights.


   2. "But there is one only God of pre-eminent power, who made the
   heaven, and sun, and stars, and moon, and fruitful earth, and waves of
   the water of the sea."

   And since He alone is the framer of the universe, and the artificer of
   all things of which it consists or which are contained in it, it
   testifies that He alone ought to be worshipped:--


   3. "Worship Him who is alone the ruler of the world, who alone was and
   is from age to age."

   Also another Sibyl, whoever she is, when she said that she conveyed the
   voice of God to men, thus spoke:--


   4. "I am the one only God, and there is no other God."

   I would now follow up the testimonies of the others, were it not that
   these are sufficient, and that I reserve others for more befitting
   opportunities. But since we are defending the cause of truth before
   those who err from the truth and serve false religions, what kind of
   proof ought we to bring forward [41] against them, rather than to
   refute them by the testimonies of their own gods?

   The number was afterwards increased to ten, and subsequently to
   fifteen. It appears probable that this last change was made by Sulla.

    chap. VII.--Concerning the testimonies of apollo and the gods.

   Apollo, indeed, whom they think divine above all others, and especially
   prophetic, giving responses at Colophon,--I suppose because, induced by
   the pleasantness of Asia, he had removed from Delphi,--to some one who
   asked who He was, or what God was at all, replied in twenty-one verses,
   of which this is the beginning:--


   "Self-produced, untaught, without a mother, unshaken,

   A name not even to be comprised in word, dwelling in fire,

   This is God; and we His messengers are a slight portion of God."

   Can any one suspect that this is spoken of Jupiter, who had both a
   mother and a name? Why should I say that Mercury, that thrice greatest,
   of whom I have made mention above, not only speaks of God as "without a
   mother," as Apollo does, but also as "without a father," because He has
   no origin from any other source but Himself? For He cannot be produced
   from any one, who Himself produced all things. I have, as I think,
   sufficiently taught by arguments, and confirmed by witnesses, that
   which is sufficiently plain by itself, that there is one only King of
   the universe, one Father, one God.

   But perchance some one may ask of us the same question which Hortensius
   asks in Cicero: If God is one only, [42] what solitude can be happy? As
   though we, in asserting that He is one, say that He is desolate and
   solitary. Undoubtedly He has ministers, whom we call messengers. And
   that is true, which I have before related, that Seneca said in his
   Exhortations that God produced ministers of His kingdom. But these are
   neither gods, nor do they wish to be called gods or to be worshipped,
   inasmuch as they do nothing but execute the command and will of God.
   Nor, however, are they gods who are worshipped in common, whose number
   is small and fixed. But if the worshippers of the gods think that they
   worship those beings whom we call the ministers of the Supreme God,
   there is no reason why they should envy us who say that there is one
   God, and deny that there are many. If a multitude of gods delights
   them, we do not speak of twelve, or three hundred and sixty-five as
   Orpheus did; but we convict them of innumerable errors on the other
   side, in thinking that they are so few. Let them know, however, by what
   name they ought to be called, lest they do injury to the true God,
   whose name they set forth, while they assign it to more than one. Let
   them believe their own Apollo, who in that same response took away from
   the other gods their name, as he took away the dominion from Jupiter.
   For the third verse shows that the ministers of God ought not to be
   called gods, but angels. He spoke falsely respecting himself, indeed;
   for though he was of the number of demons, he reckoned himself among
   the angels of God, and then in other responses he confessed himself a
   demon. For when he was asked how he wished to be supplicated, he thus
   answered:--


   "O all-wise, all-learned, versed in many pursuits, hear, O demon."

   And so, again, when at the entreaty of some one he uttered an
   imprecation against the Sminthian Apollo, he began with this verse:--


   "O harmony of the world, bearing light, all-wise demon."

   What therefore remains, except that by his own confession he is subject
   to the scourge of the true God and to everlasting punishment? For in
   another response he also said:--


   "The demons who go about the earth and about the sea

   Without weariness, are subdued beneath the scourge of God."

   We speak on the subject of both in the second book. In the meantime it
   is enough for us, that while he wishes to honour and place himself in
   heaven, he has confessed, as the nature of the matter is, in what
   manner they are to be named who always stand beside God.

   Therefore let men withdraw themselves from errors; and laying aside
   corrupt superstitions, let them acknowledge their Father and Lord,
   whose excellence cannot be estimated, nor His greatness perceived, nor
   His beginning comprehended. When the earnest attention of the human
   mind and its acute sagacity and memory has reached Him, all ways being,
   as it were, summed up and exhausted, [43] it stops, it is at a loss, it
   fails; nor is there anything beyond to which it can proceed. But
   because that which exists must of necessity have had a beginning, it
   follows that since there was nothing before Him, He was produced from
   Himself before all things. Therefore He is called by Apollo
   "self-produced," by the Sibyl "self-created," "uncreated," and
   "unmade." And Seneca, an acute man, saw and expressed this in his
   Exhortations. "We," he said, "are dependent upon another." Therefore we
   look to some one to whom we owe that which is most excellent in us.
   Another brought us into being, another formed us; but God of His own
   power made Himself.

    Chap. viii.--that god is without a body, nor does he need difference of sex
    for procreation.

   It is proved, therefore, by these witnesses, so numerous and of such
   authority, that the universe is governed by the power and providence of
   one God, whose energy and majesty Plato in the Timæus asserts to be so
   great, that no one can either conceive it in his mind, or give
   utterance to it in words, on account of His surpassing and incalculable
   power. And then can any one doubt whether any thing can be difficult or
   impossible for God, who by His providence designed, by His energy
   established, and by His judgment completed those works so great and
   wonderful, and even now sustains them by His spirit, and governs them
   by His power, being incomprehensible and unspeakable, and fully known
   to no other than Himself? Wherefore, as I often reflect on the subject
   of such great majesty, they who worship the gods sometimes appear so
   blind, so incapable of reflection, so senseless, so little removed from
   the mute animals, as to believe that those who are born from the
   natural intercourse of the sexes could have had anything of majesty and
   divine influence; since the Erythræan Sibyl says: "It is impossible for
   a God to be fashioned from the loins of a man and the womb of a woman."
   And if this is true, as it really is, it is evident that Hercules,
   Apollo, Bacchus, Mercury, and Jupiter, with the rest, were but men,
   since they were born from the two sexes. But what is so far removed
   from the nature of God as that operation which He Himself assigned to
   mortals for the propagation of their race, and which cannot be affected
   without corporeal substance?

   Therefore, if the gods are immortal and eternal, what need is there of
   the other sex, when they themselves do not require succession, since
   they are always about to exist? For assuredly in the case of mankind
   and the other animals, there is no other reason for difference of sex
   and procreation and bringing forth, except that all classes of living
   creatures, inasmuch as they are doomed to death by the condition of
   their mortality, may be preserved by mutual succession. But God, who is
   immortal, has no need of difference of sex, nor of succession. Some one
   will say that this arrangement is necessary, in order that He may have
   some to minister to Him, or over whom He may bear rule. What need is
   there of the female sex, since God, who is almighty, is able to produce
   sons without the agency of the female? For if He has granted to certain
   minute creatures [44] that they


   "Should gather offspring for themselves with their mouth from leaves
   and sweet herbs,"

   why should any one think it impossible for God Himself to have
   offspring except by union with the other sex? No one, therefore, is so
   thoughtless as not to understand that those were mere mortals, whom the
   ignorant and foolish regard and worship as gods. Why, then, some one
   will say, were they believed to be gods? Doubtless because they were
   very great and powerful kings; and since, on account of the merits of
   their virtues, or offices, or the arts which they discovered, they were
   beloved by those over whom they had ruled, they were consecrated to
   lasting memory. And if any one doubts this, let him consider their
   exploits and deeds, the whole of which both ancient poets and
   historians have handed down.

    Chap. IX.--Of hercules and his life and death. [45]

   Did not Hercules, who is most renowned for his valour, and who is
   regarded as an Africanus among the gods, by his debaucheries, lusts,
   and adulteries, pollute the world, which he is related to have
   traversed and purified? And no wonder, since he was born from an
   adulterous intercourse with Alcmena.

   What divinity could there have been in him, who, enslaved to his own
   vices, against all laws, treated with infamy, disgrace, and outrage,
   both males and females? Nor, indeed, are those great and wonderful
   actions which he performed to be judged such as to be thought worthy of
   being attributed to divine excellence. For what! is it so magnificent
   if he overcame a lion and a boar; if he shot down birds with arrows; if
   he cleansed a royal stable; if he conquered a virago, and deprived her
   of her belt; if he slew savage horses together with their master? These
   are the deeds of a brave and heroic man, but still a man; for those
   things which he overcame were frail and mortal. For there is no power
   so great, as the orator says, which cannot be weakened and broken by
   iron and strength. But to conquer the mind, and to restrain anger, is
   the part of the bravest man; and these things he never did or could do:
   for one who does these things I do not compare with excellent men, but
   I judge him to be most like to a god.

   I could wish that he had added something on the subject of lust,
   luxury, desire, and arrogance, so as to complete the excellence of him
   whom he judged to be like to a god. For he is not to be thought braver
   who overcomes a lion, than he who overcomes the violent wild beast shut
   up within himself, viz. anger; or he who has brought down most
   rapacious birds, than he who restrains most covetous desires; or he who
   subdues a warlike Amazon, than he who subdues lust, the vanquisher [46]
   of modesty and fame; or he who cleanses a stable from dung, than he who
   cleanses his heart from vices, which are more destructive evils because
   they are peculiarly his own, than those which might have been avoided
   and guarded against. From this it comes to pass, that he alone ought to
   be judged a brave man who is temperate, moderate, and just. But if any
   one considers what the works of God are, he will at once judge all
   these things, which most trifling men admire, to be ridiculous. For
   they measure them not by the divine power of which they are ignorant,
   but by the weakness of their own strength. For no one will deny this,
   that Hercules was not only a servant to Eurystheus, a king, which to a
   certain extent may appear honourable, but also to an unchaste woman,
   Omphale, who used to order him to sit at her feet, clothed with her
   garments, and executing an appointed task. Detestable baseness! But
   such was the price at which pleasure was valued. What! some one will
   say, do you think that the poets are to be believed? Why should I not
   think so? For it is not Lucilius who relates these things, or Lucian,
   who spared not men nor gods, but these especially who sting the praises
   of the gods.

   Whom, then, shall we believe, if we do not credit those who praise
   them? Let him who thinks that these speak falsely produce other authors
   on whom we may rely, who may teach us who these gods are, in what
   manner and from what source they had their origin, what is their
   strength, what their number, what their power, what there is in them
   which is admirable and worthy of adoration--what mystery, in short,
   more to be relied on, and more true. He will produce no such
   authorities. Let us, then, give credence to those who did not speak for
   the purpose of censure, but to proclaim their praise. He sailed, then,
   with the Argonauts, and sacked Troy, being enraged with Laomedon on
   account of the reward refused to him, by Laomedon, for the preservation
   of his daughter, from which circumstance it is evident at what time he
   lived. He also, excited by rage and madness, slew his wife, together
   with his children. Is this he whom men consider a god? But his heir
   Philoctetes did not so regard him, who applied a torch to him when
   about to be burnt, who witnessed the burning and wasting of his limbs
   and sinews, who buried his bones and ashes on Mount OEta, in return for
   which office he received his arrows.

    Chap. X.--Of the life and actions of Æsculapius, apollo, neptune, mars,
    castor and pollux, mercury and bacchus.

   What other action worthy of divine honours, except the healing of
   Hippolytus, did Æsculapius perform, whose birth also was not without
   disgrace to Apollo? His death was certainly more renowned, because he
   earned the distinction of being struck with lightning by a god.
   Tarquitius, in a dissertation concerning illustrious men, says that he
   was born of uncertain parents, exposed, and found by some hunters; that
   he was nourished by a dog, and that, being delivered to Chiron, he
   learned the art of medicine. He says, moreover, that he was a
   Messenian, but that he spent some time at Epidaurus. Tully also says
   that he was buried at Cynosuræ. What was the conduct of Apollo, his
   father? Did he not, on account of his impassioned love, most
   disgracefully tend the flock of another, and build walls for Laomedon,
   having been hired together with Neptune for a reward, which could with
   impunity be withheld from him? And from him first the perfidious king
   learned to refuse to carry out whatever contract he had made with gods.
   And he also, while in love with a beautiful boy, offered violence to
   him, and while engaged in play, slew him.

   Mars, when guilty of homicide, and set free from the charge of murder
   by the Athenians through favour, lest he should appear to be too fierce
   and savage, committed adultery with Venus. Castor and Pollux, while
   they are engaged in carrying off the wives of others, ceased to be
   twin-brothers. For Idas, being excited with jealousy on account of the
   injury, transfixed one of the brothers with his sword. And the poets
   relate that they live and die alternately: so that they are now the
   most wretched not only of the gods, but also of all mortals, inasmuch
   as they are not permitted to die once only. And yet Homer, differing
   from the other poets, simply records that they both died. For when he
   represented Helen as sitting by the side of Priam on the walls of Troy,
   and recognising all the chieftains of Greece, but as looking in vain
   for her brothers only, he added to his speech a verse of this kind:--


   "Thus she; unconscious that in Sparta they,

   Their native land, beneath the sod were laid."

   What did Mercury, a thief and spendthrift, leave to contribute to his
   fame, except the memory of his frauds? Doubtless he was deserving of
   heaven, because he taught the exercises of the palæstra, and was the
   first who invented the lyre. [47] It is necessary that Father Liber
   should be of chief authority, and of the first rank in the senate of
   the gods, because he was the only one of them all, except Jupiter, who
   triumphed, led an army, and subdued the Indians. But that very great
   and unconquered Indian commander was most shamefully overpowered by
   love and lust. For, being conveyed to Crete with his effeminate
   retinue, he met with an unchaste woman on the shore; and in the
   confidence inspired by his Indian victory, he wished to give proof of
   his manliness, lest he should appear too effeminate. And so he took to
   himself in marriage that woman, the betrayer of her father, and the
   murderer of her brother, after that she had been deserted and
   repudiated by another husband; and he made her Libera, and with her
   ascended into heaven.

   What was the conduct of Jupiter, the father of all these, who in the
   customary prayer is styled [48] Most Excellent and Great? Is he not,
   from his earliest childhood, proved to be impious, and almost a
   parricide, since he expelled his father from his kingdom, and banished
   him, and did not await his death though he was aged and worn out, such
   was his eagerness for rule? And when he had taken his father's throne
   by violence and arms, he was attacked with war by the Titans, which was
   the beginning of evils to the human race; and when these had been
   overcome and lasting peace procured, he spent the rest of his life in
   debaucheries and adulteries. I forbear to mention the virgins whom he
   dishonoured. For that is wont to be judged endurable. I cannot pass by
   the cases of Amphitryon and Tyndarus, whose houses he filled to
   overflowing with disgrace and infamy. But he reached the height of
   impiety and guilt in carrying off the royal boy. For it did not appear
   enough to cover himself with infamy in offering violence to women,
   unless he also outraged his own sex. This is true adultery, which is
   done against nature. Whether he who committed these crimes can be
   called Greatest is a matter of question, undoubtedly he is not the
   Best; to which name corrupters, adulterers, and incestuous persons have
   no claim; unless it happens that we men are mistaken in terming those
   who do such things wicked and abandoned, and in judging them most
   deserving of every kind of punishment. But Marcus Tullius was foolish
   in upbraiding Caius Verres with adulteries, for Jupiter, whom he
   worshipped, committed the same; and in upbraiding Publius Clodius with
   incest with his sister, for he who was Best and Greatest had the same
   person both as sister and wife.

    Chap. xi.--of the origin, life, reign, name and death of jupiter, and of
    saturn and uranus. [49]

   Who, then, is so senseless as to imagine that he reigns in heaven who
   ought not even to have reigned on earth? It was not without humour that
   a certain poet wrote of the triumph of Cupid: in which book he not only
   represented Cupid as the most powerful of the gods, but also as their
   conqueror. For having enumerated the loves of each, by which they had
   come into the power and dominion of Cupid, he sets in array a
   procession, in which Jupiter, with the other gods, is led in chains
   before the chariot of him, celebrating a triumph. This is elegantly
   pictured by the poet, but it is not far removed from the truth. For he
   who is without virtue, who is overpowered by desire and wicked lusts,
   is not, as the poet feigned, in subjection to Cupid, but to everlasting
   death. But let us cease to speak concerning morals; let us examine the
   matter, in order that men may understand in what errors they are
   miserably engaged. The common people imagine that Jupiter reigns in
   heaven; both learned and unlearned are alike persuaded of this. For
   both religion itself, and prayers, and hymns, and shrines, and images
   demonstrate this. And yet they admit that he was also descended from
   Saturn and Rhea. How can he appear a god, or be believed, as the poet
   says, to be the author of men and all things, when innumerable
   thousands of men existed before his birth--those, for instance, who
   lived during the reign of Saturn, and enjoyed the light sooner than
   Jupiter? I see that one god was king in the earliest times, and another
   in the times that followed. It is therefore possible that there may be
   another hereafter. For if the former kingdom was changed, why should we
   not expect that the latter may possibly be changed, unless by chance it
   was possible for Saturn to produce one more powerful than himself, but
   impossible for Jupiter so to do? And yet the divine government is
   always unchangeable; or if it is changeable, which is an impossibility,
   it is undoubtedly changeable at all times.

   Is it possible, then, for Jupiter to lose his kingdom as his father
   lost it? It is so undoubtedly. For when that deity had spared neither
   virgins nor married women, he abstained from Thetis only in consequence
   of an oracle which foretold that whatever son should be born from her
   would be greater than his father. And first of all there was in him a
   want of foreknowledge not befitting a god; for had not Themis related
   to him future events, he would not have known them of his own accord.
   But if he is not divine, he is not indeed a god; for the name of
   divinity is derived from god, as humanity is from man. Then there was a
   consciousness of weakness; but he who has feared, must plainly have
   feared one greater than himself. But he who does this assuredly knows
   that he is not the greatest, since something greater can exist. He also
   swears most solemnly by the Stygian marsh: "Which is set forth the sole
   object of religious dread to the gods above." What is this object of
   religious dread? Or by whom is it set forth? Is there, then, some
   mighty power which may punish the gods who commit perjury? What is this
   great dread of the infernal marsh, if they are immortal? Why should
   they fear that which none are about to see, except those who are bound
   by the necessity of death? Why, then, do men raise their eyes to the
   heaven? Why do they swear by the gods above, when the gods above
   themselves have recourse to the infernal gods, and find among them an
   object of veneration and worship? But what is the meaning of that
   saying, that there are fates whom all the gods and Jupiter himself
   obey? If the power of the Parcæ is so great, that they are of more
   avail than all the heavenly gods, and their ruler and lord himself, why
   should not they be rather said to reign, since necessity compels all
   the gods to obey their laws and ordinances? Now, who can entertain a
   doubt that he who is subservient to anything cannot be greatest? For if
   he were so, he would not receive fates, but would appoint them. Now I
   return to another subject which I had omitted. In the case of one
   goddess only he exercised self-restraint, though he was deeply
   enamoured of her; but this was not from any virtue, but through fear of
   a successor. But this fear plainly denotes one who is both mortal and
   feeble, and of no weight: for at the very hour of his birth he might
   have been put to death, as his elder brother had been put to death; and
   if it had been possible for him to have lived, he would never have
   given up the supreme power to a younger brother. But Jupiter himself
   having been preserved by stealth, and stealthily nourished, was called
   Zeus, or Zen, [50] not, as they imagine, from the fervor of heavenly
   fire, or because he is the giver of life, or because he breathes life
   into living creatures, which power belongs to God alone; for how can he
   impart the breath of life who has himself received it from another
   source? But he was so called because he was the first who lived of the
   male children of Saturn. Men, therefore, might have had another god as
   their ruler, if Saturn had not been deceived by his wife. But it will
   be said the poets feigned these things. Whoever entertains this opinion
   is in error. For they spoke respecting men; but in order that they
   might embellish those whose memory they used to celebrate with praises,
   they said that they were gods. Those things, therefore, which they
   spoke concerning them as gods were feigned, and not those which they
   spoke concerning them as men; and this will be manifest from an
   instance which we will bring forward. When about to offer violence to
   Danae, he poured into her lap a great quantity of golden coins. This
   was the price which he paid for her dishonour. But the poets who spoke
   about him as a god, that they might not weaken the authority of his
   supposed majesty, feigned that he himself descended in a shower of
   gold, making use of the same figure with which they speak of showers of
   iron when they describe a multitude of darts and arrows. He is said to
   have carried away Ganymede by an eagle; it is a picture of the poets.
   But he either carried him off by a legion, which has an eagle for its
   standard; or the ship on board of which he was placed had its tutelary
   deity in the shape of an eagle, just as it had the effigy of a bull
   when he seized Europa and conveyed her across the sea. In the same
   manner, it is related that he changed Io, the daughter of Inachus, into
   a heifer. And in order that she might escape the anger of Juno, just as
   she was, now covered with bristly hair, and in the shape of a heifer,
   she is said to have swam over the sea, and to have come into Egypt; and
   there, having recovered her former appearance, she became the goddess
   who is now called Isis. By what argument, then, can it be proved that
   Europa did not sit on the bull, and that Io was not changed into a
   heifer? Because there is a fixed day in the annals on which the voyage
   of Isis is celebrated; from which fact we learn that she did not swim
   across the sea, but sailed over. Therefore they who appear to
   themselves to be wise because they understand that there cannot be a
   living and earthly body in heaven, reject the whole story of Ganymede
   as false, and perceive that the occurrence took place on earth,
   inasmuch as the matter and the lust itself is earthly. The poets did
   not therefore invent these transactions, for if they were to do so they
   would be most worthless; but they added a certain colour to the
   transactions. [51] For it was not for the purpose of detraction that
   they said these things, but from a desire to embellish them. Hence men
   are deceived; especially because, while they think that all these
   things are feigned by the poets, they worship that of which they are
   ignorant. For they do not know what is the limit of poetic licence, how
   far it is allowable to proceed in fiction, since it is the business of
   the poet with some gracefulness to change and transfer actual
   occurrences into other representations by oblique transformations. But
   to feign the whole of that which you relate, that is to be foolish and
   deceitful rather than to be a poet.

   But grant that they feigned those things which are believed to be
   fabulous, did they also feign those things which are related about the
   female deities and the marriages of the gods? Why, then, are they so
   represented, and so worshipped? unless by chance not the poets only,
   but painters also, and statuaries, speak falsehoods. For if this is the
   Jupiter who is called by you a god, if it is not he who was born from
   Saturn and Ops, no other image but his alone ought to have been placed
   in all the temples. What meaning have the effigies of women? What the
   doubtful sex? in which, if this Jupiter is represented, the very stones
   will confess that he is a man. They say that the poets have spoken
   falsely, and yet they believe them: yes, truly they prove by the fact
   itself that the poets did not speak falsely; for they so frame the
   images of the gods, that, from the very diversity of sex, it appears
   that these things which the poets say are true. For what other
   conclusion does the image of Ganymede and the effigy of the eagle admit
   of, when they are placed before the feet of Jupiter in the temples, and
   are worshipped equally with himself, except that the memory of impious
   guilt and debauchery remains for ever? Nothing, therefore, is wholly
   invented by the poets: something perhaps is transferred and obscured by
   oblique fashioning, under which the truth was enwrapped and concealed;
   as that which was related about the dividing of the kingdoms by lot.
   For they say that the heaven fell to the share of Jupiter, the sea to
   Neptune, and the infernal regions to Pluto. Why was not the earth
   rather taken as the third portion, except that the transaction took
   place on the earth? Therefore it is true that they so divided and
   portioned out the government of the world, that the empire of the east
   fell to Jupiter, a part of the west was allotted to Pluto, who had the
   surname of Agesilaus; because the region of the east, from which light
   is given to mortals, seems to be higher, but the region of the west
   lower. Thus they so veiled the truth under a fiction, that the truth
   itself detracted nothing from the public persuasion. It is manifest
   concerning the share of Neptune; for we say that his kingdom resembled
   that unlimited authority possessed by Mark Antony, to whom the senate
   had decreed the power of the maritime coast, that he might punish the
   pirates, and tranquillize the whole sea. Thus all the maritime coasts,
   together with the islands, fell to the lot of Neptune. How can this be
   proved? Undoubtedly ancient stories attest it. Euhemerus, an ancient
   author, who was of the city of Messene, collected the actions of
   Jupiter and of the others, who are esteemed gods, and composed a
   history from the titles and sacred inscriptions which were in the most
   ancient temples, and especially in the sanctuary of the Triphylian
   Jupiter, where an inscription indicated that a golden column had been
   placed by Jupiter himself, on which column he wrote an account of his
   exploits, that posterity might have a memorial of his actions. This
   history was translated and followed by Ennius, whose words are these:
   "Where Jupiter gives to Neptune the government of the sea, that he
   might reign in all the islands and places bordering on the sea."

   The accounts of the poets, therefore, are true, but veiled with an
   outward covering and show. It is possible that Mount Olympus may have
   supplied the poets with the hint for saying that Jupiter obtained the
   kingdom of heaven, because Olympus is the common name both of the
   mountain and of heaven. But the same history informs us that Jupiter
   dwelt on Mount Olympus, when it says: "At that time Jupiter spent the
   greatest part of his life on Mount Olympus; and they used to resort to
   him thither for the administration of justice, if any matters were
   disputed. Moreover, if any one had found out any new invention which
   might be useful for human life, he used to come thither and display it
   to Jupiter." The poets transfer many things after this manner, not for
   the sake of speaking falsely against the objects of their worship, but
   that they may by variously coloured figures add beauty and grace to
   their poems. But they who do not understand the manner, or the cause,
   or the nature of that which is represented by figure, attack the poets
   as false and sacrilegious. Even the philosophers were deceived by this
   error; for because these things which are related about Jupiter
   appeared unsuited to the character of a god, they introduced two
   Jupiters, one natural, the other fabulous. They saw, on the one hand,
   that which was true, that he, forsooth, concerning whom the poets
   speak, was man; but in the case of that natural Jupiter, led by the
   common practise of superstition, they committed an error, inasmuch as
   they transferred the name of a man to God, who, as we have already
   said, because He is one only, has no need of a name. But it is
   undeniable that he is Jupiter who was born from Ops and Saturn. It is
   therefore an empty persuasion on the part of those who give the name of
   Jupiter to the Supreme God. For some are in the habit of defending
   their errors by this excuse; for, when convinced of the unity of God,
   since they cannot deny this, they affirm that they worship Him, but
   that it is their pleasure that He should be called Jupiter. But what
   can be more absurd than this? For Jupiter is not accustomed to be
   worshipped without the accompanying worship of his wife and daughter.
   From which his real nature is evident; nor is it lawful for that name
   to be transferred thither, [52] where there is neither any Minerva nor
   Juno. Why should I say that the peculiar meaning of this name does not
   express a divine, but human power? For Cicero explains the names
   Jupiter and Juno as being derived from giving help; [53] and Jupiter is
   so called as if he were a helping father,--a name which is ill adapted
   to God: for to help is the part of a man conferring some aid upon one
   who is a stranger, and in a case where the benefit is small. No one
   implores God to help him, but to preserve him, to give him life and
   safety, which is a much greater and more important matter than to help.

   And since we are speaking of a father, no father is said to help his
   sons when he begets or brings them up. For that expression is too
   insignificant to denote the magnitude of the benefit derived from a
   father. How much more unsuitable is it to God, who is our true Father,
   by whom we exist, and whose we are altogether, by whom we are formed,
   endued with life, and enlightened, who bestows upon us life, gives us
   safety, and supplies us with various kinds of food! He has no
   apprehension of the divine benefits who thinks that he is only aided by
   God. Therefore he is not only ignorant, but impious, who disparages the
   excellency of the supreme power under the name of Jupiter. Wherefore,
   if both from his actions and character we have proved that Jupiter was
   a man, and reigned on earth, it only remains that we should also
   investigate his death. Ennius, in his sacred history, having described
   all the actions which he performed in his life, at the close thus
   speaks: Then Jupiter, when he had five times made a circuit of the
   earth, and bestowed governments upon all his friends and relatives, and
   left laws to men, provided them with a settled mode of life and corn,
   and given them many other benefits, and having been honoured with
   immortal glory and remembrance, left lasting memorials to his friends,
   and when his age [54] was almost spent, he changed [55] his life in
   Crete, and departed to the gods. And the Curetes, his sons, took charge
   of him, and honoured him; and his tomb is in Crete, in the town of
   Cnossus, and Vesta is said to have founded this city; and on his tomb
   is an inscription in ancient Greek characters, "Zan Kronou," which is
   in Latin, "Jupiter the son of Saturn." This undoubtedly is not handed
   down by poets, but by writers of ancient events; and these things are
   so true, that they are confirmed by some verses of the Sibyls, to this
   effect:--


   "Inanimate demons, images of the dead,

   Whose tombs the ill-fated Crete possesses as a boast."

   Cicero, in his treatise concerning the Nature of the Gods, having said
   that three Jupiters were enumerated by theologians, adds that the third
   was of Crete, the son of Saturn, and that his tomb is shown in that
   island. How, therefore, can a god be alive in one place, and dead in
   another; in one place have a temple, and in another a tomb? Let the
   Romans then know that their Capitol, that is the chief head of their
   objects of public veneration, is nothing but an empty monument.

   Let us now come to his father who reigned before him, and who perhaps
   had more power in himself, because he is said to be born from the
   meeting of such great elements. Let us see what there was in him worthy
   of a god, especially that he is related to have had the golden age,
   because in his reign there was justice in the earth. I find something
   in him which was not in his son. For what is so befitting the character
   of a god, as a just government and an age of piety? But when, on the
   same principle, I reflect that he is a son, I cannot consider him as
   the Supreme God; for I see that there is something more ancient than
   himself,--namely, the heaven and the earth. But I am in search of a God
   beyond whom nothing has any existence, who is the source and origin of
   all things. He must of necessity exist who framed the heaven itself,
   and laid the foundations of the earth. But if Saturn was born from
   these, as it is supposed, how can he be the chief God, since he owes
   his origin to another? Or who presided over the universe before the
   birth of Saturn? But this, as I recently said, is a fiction of the
   poets. For it was impossible that the senseless elements, which are
   separated by so long an interval, should meet together and give birth
   to a son, or that he who was born should not at all resemble his
   parents, but should have a form which his parents did not possess.

   Let us therefore inquire what degree of truth lies hid under this
   figure. Minucius Felix, in his treatise which has the title of
   Octavius, [56] alleged these proofs: "That Saturn, when he had been
   banished by his son, and had come into Italy, was called the son of
   Coelus (heaven), because we are accustomed to say that those whose
   virtue we admire, or those who have unexpectedly arrived, have fallen
   from heaven; and that he was called the son of earth, because we name
   those who are born from unknown parents sons of earth." These things,
   indeed, have some resemblance to the truth, but are not true, because
   it is evident that even during his reign he was so esteemed. He might
   have argued thus: That Saturn, being a very powerful king, in order
   that the memory of his parents might be preserved, gave their names to
   the heaven and earth, whereas these were before called by other names,
   for which reason we know that names were applied both to mountains and
   rivers. For when the poets speak of the offspring of Atlas, or of the
   river Inachus, they do not absolutely say that men could possibly be
   born from inanimate objects; but they undoubtedly indicate those who
   were born from those men, who either during their lives or after their
   death gave their names to mountains or rivers. For that was a common
   practise among the ancients, and especially among the Greeks. Thus we
   have heard that seas received the names of those who had fallen into
   them, as the Ægean, the Icarian, and the Hellespont. In Latium, also,
   Aventinus gave his name to the mountain on which he was buried; and
   Tiberinus, or Tiber, gave his name to the river in which he was
   drowned. No wonder, then, if the names of those who had given birth to
   most powerful kings were attributed to the heaven and earth. Therefore
   it appears that Saturn was not born from heaven, which is impossible,
   but from that man who bore the name of Uranus. And Trismegistus attests
   the truth of this; for when he said that very few had existed in whom
   there was perfect learning, he mentioned by name among these his
   relatives, Uranus, Saturn, and Mercury. And because he was ignorant of
   these things, he gave another account of the matter; how he might have
   argued, I have shown. Now I will say in what manner, at what time, and
   by whom this was done; for it was not Saturn who did this, but Jupiter.
   Ennius thus relates in his sacred history: "Then Pan leads him to the
   mountain, which is called the pillar of heaven. Having ascended
   thither, he surveyed the lands far and wide, and there on that mountain
   he builds an altar to Coelus; and Jupiter was the first who offered
   sacrifice on that altar. In that place he looked up to heaven, by which
   name we now call it, and that which was above the world which was
   called the firmament, [57] and he gave to the heaven its name from the
   name of his grandfather; and Jupiter in prayer first gave the name of
   heaven to that which was called firmament, [58] and he burnt entire the
   victim which he there offered in sacrifice." Nor is it here only that
   Jupiter is found to have offered sacrifice. Cæsar also, in Aratus,
   relates that Aglaosthenes says that when he was setting out from the
   island of Naxos against the Titans, and was offering sacrifice on the
   shore, an eagle flew to Jupiter as an omen, and that the victor
   received it as a good token, and placed it under his own protection.
   But the sacred history testifies that even beforehand an eagle had sat
   upon his head, and portended to him the kingdom. To whom, then, could
   Jupiter have offered sacrifice, except to his grandfather Coelus, who,
   according to the saying of Euhemerus, [59] died in Oceania, and was
   buried in the town of Aulatia?

    Chap. xii.--that the stoics transfer the figments of the poets to a
    philosophical system.

   Since we have brought to light the mysteries of the poets, and have
   found out the parents of Saturn, let us return to his virtues and
   actions. He was, they say, just in his rule. First, from this very
   circumstance he is not now a god, inasmuch as he has ceased to be. In
   the next place, he was not even just, but impious not only towards his
   sons, whom he devoured, but also towards his father, whom he is said to
   have mutilated. And this may perhaps have happened in truth. But men,
   having regard to the element which is called the heaven, reject the
   whole fable as most foolishly invented; though the Stoics, (according
   to their custom) endeavour to transfer it to a physical system, whose
   opinion Cicero has laid down in his treatise concerning the Nature of
   the Gods. They held, he says, that the highest and ethereal nature of
   heaven, that is, of fire, which by itself produced all things, was
   without that part of the body which contained the productive organs.
   Now this theory might have been suitable to Vesta, if she were called a
   male. For it is on this account that they esteem Vesta to be a virgin,
   inasmuch as fire is an incorruptible element; and nothing can be born
   from it, since it consumes all things, whatever it has seized upon.
   Ovid in the Fasti says: [60] "Nor do you esteem Vesta to be anything
   else than a living flame; and you see no bodies produced from flame.
   Therefore she is truly a virgin, for she sends forth no seed, nor
   receives it, and loves the attendants of virginity."

   This also might have been ascribed to Vulcan, who indeed is supposed to
   be fire, and yet the poets did not mutilate him. It might also have
   been ascribed to the sun, in whom is the nature and cause of the
   productive powers. For without the fiery heat of the sun nothing could
   be born, or have increase; so that no other element has greater need of
   productive organs than heat, by the nourishment of which all things are
   conceived, produced, and supported. Lastly, even if the case were as
   they would have it, why should we suppose that Coelus was mutilated,
   rather than that he was born without productive organs? For if he
   produces by himself, it is plain that he had no need of productive
   organs, since he gave birth to Saturn himself; but if he had them, and
   suffered mutilation from his son, the origin of all things and all
   nature would have perished. Why should I say that they deprive Saturn
   himself not only of divine, but also of human intelligence, when they
   affirm that Saturn is he who comprises the course and change of the
   spaces and seasons, and that he has that very name in Greek? For he is
   called Cronos, which is the same as Chronos, that is, a space of time.
   But he is called Saturn, because he is satiated with years. These are
   the words of Cicero, setting forth the opinion of the Stoics: "The
   worthlessness of these things any one may readily understand. For if
   Saturn is the son of Coelus, how could Time have been born from Coelus,
   or Coelus have been mutilated by Time, or afterwards could Time have
   been despoiled of his sovereignty by his son Jupiter? Or how was
   Jupiter born from Time? Or with what years could eternity be satiated,
   since it has no limit?" [61]

    Chap. xiii.--how vain and trifling are the interpretations of the stoics
    respecting the gods, and in them concerning the origin of jupiter,
    concerning saturn and Ops.

   If therefore these speculations of the philosophers are trifling, what
   remains, except that we believe it to be a matter of fact that, being a
   man, he suffered mutilation from a man? Unless by chance any one
   esteems him as a god who feared a co-heir; whereas, if he had possessed
   any divine knowledge, he ought not to have mutilated his father, but
   himself, to prevent the birth of Jupiter, who deprived him of the
   possession of his kingdom. And he also, when he had married his sister
   Rhea, whom in Latin we call Ops, is said to have been warned by an
   oracle not to bring up his male children, because it would come to pass
   that he should be driven into banishment by a son. And being in fear of
   this, it is plain that he did not devour his sons, as the fables
   report, but put them to death; although it is written in sacred history
   that Saturn and Ops, and other men, were at that time accustomed to eat
   human flesh, but that Jupiter, who gave to men laws and civilization,
   was the first who by an edict prohibited the use of that food. Now if
   this is true, what justice can there possibly have been in him? But let
   us suppose it to be a fictitious story that Saturn devoured his sons,
   only true after a certain fashion; must we then suppose, with the
   vulgar, that he has eaten his sons, who has carried them out to burial?
   But when Ops had brought forth Jupiter, she stole away the infant, and
   secretly sent him into Crete to be nourished. Again, I cannot but blame
   his want of foresight. For why did he receive an oracle from another,
   and not from himself? Being placed in heaven, why did he not see the
   things which were taking place on earth? Why did the Corybantes with
   their cymbals escape his notice? Lastly, why did there exist any
   greater force which might overcome his power? Doubtless, being aged, he
   was easily overcome by one who was young, and despoiled of his
   sovereignty. He was therefore banished and went into exile; and after
   long wanderings came into Italy in a ship, as Ovid relates in his
   Fasti:--


   "The cause of the ship remains to be explained. The scythe-bearing god
   came to the Tuscan river in a ship, having first traversed the world."

   Janus received him wandering and destitute; and the ancient coins are a
   proof of this, on which there is a representation of Janus with a
   double face, and on the other side a ship; as the same poet adds:--


   "But pious posterity represented a ship on the coin, bearing testimony
   to the arrival of the stranger god."

   Not only therefore all the poets, but the writers also of ancient
   histories and events, agree that he was a man, inasmuch as they handed
   down to memory his actions in Italy: of Greek writers, Diodorus and
   Thallus; of Latin writers, Nepos, Cassius, and Varro. For since men
   lived in Italy after a rustic fashion, [62] --


   "He brought the race to union first,

   Erewhile on mountain tops dispersed,

   And gave them statutes to obey,

   And willed the land wherein he lay

   Should Latium's title bear."

   Does any one imagine him to be a god, who was driven into banishment,
   who fled, who lay hid? No one is so senseless. For he who flees, or
   lies hid, must fear both violence and death. Orpheus, who lived in more
   recent times than his, openly relates that Saturn reigned on earth and
   among men:--


   "First Cronus ruled o'er men on earth,

   And then from Cronus sprung the mighty king,

   The widely sounding Zeus."

   And also our own Maro says: [63]


   "This life the golden Saturn led on earth;"

   and in another place: [64] --


   "That was the storied age of gold,

   So peacefully, serenely rolled

   The years beneath his reign."

   The poet did not say in the former passage that he led this life in
   heaven, nor in the latter passage that he reigned over the gods above.
   From which it appears that he was a king on earth; and this he declares
   more plainly in another place: [65] --


   "Restorer of the age of gold,

   In lands where Saturn ruled of old."

   Ennius, indeed, in his translation of Euhemerus says that Saturn was
   not the first who reigned, but his father Uranus. In the beginning, he
   says, Coelus first had the supreme power on the earth. He instituted
   and prepared that kingdom in conjunction with his brothers. There is no
   great dispute, if there is doubt, on the part of the greatest
   authorities respecting the son and the father. But it is possible that
   each may have happened: that Uranus first began to be pre-eminent in
   power among the rest, and to have the chief place, but not the kingdom;
   and that afterwards Saturn acquired greater resources, and took the
   title of king.

    Chap. xiv.--what the sacred history of euhemerus and ennius teaches
    concerning the gods.

   Now, since the sacred history differs in some degree from those things
   which we have related, let us open those things which are contained in
   the true writings, that we may not, in accusing superstitions, appear
   to follow and approve of the follies of the poets. These are the words
   of Ennius: "Afterwards Saturn married Ops. Titan, who was older than
   Saturn, demands the kingdom for himself. Upon this their mother Vesta,
   and their sisters Ceres and Ops, advise Saturn not to give up the
   kingdom to his brother. Then Titan, who was inferior in person to
   Saturn, on that account, and because he saw that his mother and sisters
   were using their endeavours that Saturn might reign, yielded the
   kingdom to him. He therefore made an agreement with Saturn, that if any
   male children should be born to him, he would not bring them up. He did
   so for this purpose, that the kingdom might return to his own sons.
   Then, when a son was first born to Saturn, they slew him. Afterwards
   twins were born, Jupiter and Juno. Upon this they present Juno to the
   sight of Saturn, and secretly hide Jupiter, and give him to Vesta to be
   brought up, concealing him from Saturn. Ops also brings forth Neptune
   without the knowledge of Saturn, and secretly hides him. In the same
   manner Ops brings forth twins by a third birth, Pluto and Glauca. Pluto
   in Latin is Dispater; others call him Orcus. Upon this they show to
   Saturn the daughter Glauca, and conceal and hide the son Pluto. Then
   Glauca dies while yet young." This is the lineage of Jupiter and his
   brothers, as these things are written, and the relationship is handed
   down to us after this manner from the sacred narrative. Also shortly
   afterwards he introduces these things: "Then Titan, when he learned
   that sons were born to Saturn, and secretly brought up, secretly takes
   with him his sons, who are called Titans, and seizes his brother Saturn
   and Ops, and encloses them within a wall, and places over them a
   guard."

   The truth of this history is taught by the Erythræan Sibyl, who speaks
   almost the same things, with a few discrepancies, which do not affect
   the subject-matter itself. Therefore Jupiter is freed from the charge
   of the greatest wickedness, according to which he is reported to have
   bound his father with fetters; for this was the deed of his uncle
   Titan, because he, contrary to his promise and oath, had brought up
   male children. The rest of the history is thus put together. It is said
   that Jupiter, when grown up, having heard that his father and mother
   had been surrounded with a guard and imprisoned, came with a great
   multitude of Cretans, and conquered Titan and his sons in an
   engagement, and rescued his parents from imprisonment, restored the
   kingdom to his father, and thus returned into Crete. Then, after these
   things, they say that an oracle was given to Saturn, bidding him to
   take heed lest his son should expel him from the kingdom; that he, for
   the sake of weakening the oracle and avoiding the danger, laid an
   ambush for Jupiter to kill him; that Jupiter, having learned the plot,
   claimed the kingdom for himself afresh, and banished Saturn; and that
   he, when he had been tossed over all lands, followed by armed men whom
   Jupiter had sent to seize or put him to death, scarcely found a place
   of concealment in Italy.

    Chap. xv.--how they who were men obtained the name of gods.

   Now, since it is evident from these things that they were men, it is
   not difficult to see in what manner they began to be called gods. [66]
   For if there were no kings before Saturn or Uranus, on account of the
   small number of men who lived a rustic life without any ruler, there is
   no doubt but in those times men began to exalt the king himself, and
   his whole family, with the highest praises and with new honours, so
   that they even called them gods; whether on account of their wonderful
   excellence, men as yet rude and simple really entertained this opinion,
   or, as is commonly the case, in flattery of present power, or on
   account of the benefits by which they were set in order and reduced to
   a civilized state. Afterwards the kings themselves, since they were
   beloved by those whose life they had civilized, after their death left
   regret of themselves. Therefore men formed images of them, that they
   might derive some consolation from the contemplation of their
   likenesses; and proceeding further through love of their worth, [67]
   they began to reverence the memory of the deceased, that they might
   appear to be grateful for their services, and might attract their
   successors to a desire of ruling well. And this Cicero teaches in his
   treatise on the Nature of the Gods, saying "But the life of men and
   common intercourse led to the exalting to heaven by fame and goodwill
   men who were distinguished by their benefits. On this account Hercules,
   on this Castor and Pollux, Æsculapius and Liber" were ranked with the
   gods. And in another passage: "And in most states it may be understood,
   that for the sake of exciting valour, or that the men most
   distinguished for bravery might more readily encounter danger on
   account of the state, their memory was consecrated with the honour paid
   to the immortal gods." It was doubtless on this account that the Romans
   consecrated their Cæsars, and the Moors their kings. Thus by degrees
   religious honours began to be paid to them; while those who had known
   them, first instructed their own children and grandchildren, and
   afterwards all their posterity, in the practice of this rite. And yet
   these great kings, on account of the celebrity of their name, were
   honoured in all provinces.

   But separate people privately honoured the founders of their nation or
   city with the highest veneration, whether they were men distinguished
   for bravery, or women admirable for chastity; as the Egyptians honoured
   Isis, the Moors Juba, the Macedonians Cabirus, the Carthaginians
   Uranus, the Latins Faunus, the Sabines Sancus, the Romans Quirinus. In
   the same manner truly Athens worshipped Minerva, Samos Juno, Paphos
   Venus, Lemnos Vulcan, Naxos Liber, and Delos Apollo. And thus various
   sacred rites have been undertaken among different peoples and
   countries, inasmuch as men desire to show gratitude to their princes,
   and cannot find out other honours which they may confer upon the dead.
   Moreover, the piety of their successors contributed in a great degree
   to the error; for, in order that they might appear to be born from a
   divine origin, they paid divine honours to their parents, and ordered
   that they should be paid by others. Can any one doubt in what way the
   honours paid to the gods were instituted, when he reads in Virgil the
   words of Æneas giving commands to his friends: [68] --


   "Now with full cups libation pour

   To mighty Jove, whom all adore,

   Invoke Anchises' blessed soul."

   And he attributes to him not only immortality, but also power over the
   winds: [69] --


   "Invoke the winds to speed our flight,

   And pray that he we hold so dear

   May take our offerings year by year,

   Soon as our promised town we raise,

   In temples sacred to his praise."

   In truth, Liber and Pan, and Mercury and Apollo, acted in the same way
   respecting Jupiter, and afterwards their successors did the same
   respecting them. The poets also added their influence, and by means of
   poems composed to give pleasure, raised them to the heaven; as is the
   case with those who flatter kings, even though wicked, with false
   panegyrics. And this evil originated with the Greeks, whose levity
   being furnished [70] with the ability and copiousness of speech,
   excited in an incredible degree mists of falsehoods. And thus from
   admiration of them they first undertook their sacred rites, and handed
   them down to all nations. On account of this vanity the Sibyl thus
   rebukes them:--


   "Why trustest thou, O Greece, to princely men?

   Why to the dead dost offer empty gifts?

   Thou offerest to idols; this error who suggested,

   That thou shouldst leave the presence of the mighty God,

   And make these offerings?"

   Marcus Tullius, who was not only an accomplished orator, but also a
   philosopher, since he alone was an imitator of Plato, in that treatise
   in which he consoled himself concerning the death of his daughter, did
   not hesitate to say that those gods who were publicly worshipped were
   men. And this testimony of his ought to be esteemed the more weighty,
   because he held the priesthood of the augurs, and testifies that he
   worships and venerates the same gods. And thus within the compass of a
   few verses he has presented us with two facts. For while he declared
   his intention of consecrating the image of his daughter in the same
   manner in which they were consecrated by the ancients, he both taught
   that they were dead, and showed the origin of a vain superstition.
   "Since, in truth," he says, "we see many men and women among the number
   of the gods, and venerate their shrines, held in the greatest honour in
   cities and in the country, let us assent to the wisdom of those to
   whose talents and inventions we owe it that life is altogether adorned
   with laws and institutions, and established on a firm basis. And if any
   living being was worthy of being consecrated, assuredly it was this. If
   the offspring of Cadmus, or Amphitryon, or Tyndarus, was worthy of
   being extolled by fame to the heaven, the same honour ought undoubtedly
   to be appropriated to her. And this indeed I will do; and with the
   approbation of the gods, I will place you the best and most learned of
   all women in their assembly, and will consecrate you to the estimation
   of all men." Some one may perhaps say that Cicero raved through
   excessive grief. But, in truth, the whole of that speech, which was
   perfect both in learning and in its examples, and in the very style of
   expression, gave no indications of a distempered mind, but of constancy
   and judgment; and this very sentence exhibits no sign of grief. For I
   do not think that he could have written with such variety, and
   copiousness, and ornament, had not his grief been mitigated by reason
   itself, and the consolation of his friends and length of time. Why
   should I mention what he says in his books concerning the Republic, and
   also concerning glory? For in his treatise on the Laws, in which work,
   following the example of Plato, he wished to set forth those laws which
   he thought that a just and wise state would employ, he thus decreed
   concerning religion: [71] "Let them reverence the gods, both those who
   have always been regarded as gods of heaven, and those whose services
   to men have placed them in heaven: Hercules, Liber, Æsculapius, Castor,
   Pollux, and Quirinus." Also in his Tusculan Disputations, [72] when he
   said that heaven was almost entirely filled with the human race, he
   said: "If, indeed, I should attempt to investigate ancient accounts,
   and to extract from them those things which the writers of Greece have
   handed down, even those who are held in the highest rank as gods will
   be found to have gone from us into heaven. Inquire whose sepulchres are
   pointed out in Greece: remember, since you are initiated, what things
   are handed down in the mysteries; and then at length you will
   understand how widely this persuasion is spread." He appealed, as it is
   plain, to the conscience of Atticus, that it might be understood from
   the very mysteries that all those who are worshipped were men; and when
   he acknowledged this without hesitation in the case of Hercules, Liber,
   Æsculapius, Castor and Pollux, he was afraid openly to make the same
   admission respecting Apollo and Jupiter their fathers, and likewise
   respecting Neptune, Vulcan, Mars, and Mercury, whom he termed the
   greater gods; and therefore he says that this opinion is widely spread,
   that we may understand the same concerning Jupiter and the other more
   ancient gods: for if the ancients consecrated their memory in the same
   manner in which he says that he will consecrate the image and the name
   of his daughter, those who mourn may be pardoned, but those who believe
   it cannot be pardoned. For who is so infatuated as to believe that
   heaven is opened to the dead at the consent and pleasure of a senseless
   multitude? Or that any one is able to give to another that which he
   himself does not possess? Among the Romans, Julius was made a god,
   because it pleased a guilty man, Antony; Quirinus was made a god,
   because it seemed good to the shepherds, though one of them was the
   murderer of his twin brother, the other the destroyer of his country.
   But if Antony had not been consul, in return for his services towards
   the state Caius Cæsar would have been without the honour even of a dead
   man, and that, too, by the advice of his father-in-law Piso, and of his
   relative Lucius Cæsar, who opposed the celebration of the funeral, and
   by the advice of Dolabella the consul, who overthrew the column in the
   forum, that is, his monuments, and purified the forum. For Ennius
   declares that Romulus was regretted by his people, since he represents
   the people as thus speaking, through grief for their lost king: "O
   Romulus, Romulus, say what a guardian of your country the gods produced
   you? You brought us forth within the regions of light. O father, O
   sire, O race, descended from the gods." On account of this regret they
   more readily believed Julius Proculus uttering falsehoods, who was
   suborned by the fathers to announce to the populace that he had seen
   the king in a form more majestic than that of a man; and that he had
   given command to the people that a temple should be built to his
   honour, that he was a god, and was called by the name of Quirinus. By
   which deed he at once persuaded the people that Romulus had gone to the
   gods, and freed the senate from the suspicion of having slain the king.

    Chap. xvi.-- by what argument it is proved that those who are distinguished
    by a difference of sex cannot be gods. [73]

   I might be content with those things which I have related, but there
   still remain many things which are necessary for the work which I have
   undertaken. For although, by destroying the principal part of
   superstitions, I have taken away the whole, yet it pleases me to follow
   up the remaining parts, and more fully to refute so inveterate a
   persuasion, that men may at length be ashamed and repent of their
   errors. This is a great undertaking, and worthy of a man. "I proceed to
   release the minds of men from the ties of superstitions," as Lucretius
   [74] says; and he indeed was unable to effect this, because he brought
   forward nothing true. This is our duty, who both assert the existence
   of the true God and refute false deities. They, therefore, who
   entertain the opinion that the poets have invented fables about the
   gods, and yet believe in the existence of female deities, and worship
   them, are unconsciously brought back to that which they had
   denied--that they have sexual intercourse, and bring forth. For it is
   impossible that the two sexes can have been instituted except for the
   sake of generation. But a difference of sex being admitted, they do not
   perceive that conception follows as a consequence. And this cannot be
   the case with a God. But let the matter be as they imagine; for they
   say that there are sons of Jupiter and of the other gods. Therefore new
   gods are born, and that indeed daily, for gods are not surpassed in
   fruitfulness by men. It follows that all things are full of gods
   without number, since forsooth none of them dies. For since the
   multitude of men is incredible, and their number not to be
   estimated--though, as they are born, they must of necessity die--what
   must we suppose to be the case with the gods who have been born through
   so many ages, and have remained immortal? How is it, then, that so few
   are worshipped? Unless we think by any means that there are two sexes
   of the gods, not for the sake of generation, but for mere
   gratification, and that the gods practise those things which men are
   ashamed to do, and to submit to. But when any are said to be born from
   any, it follows that they always continue to be born, if they are born
   at any time; or if they ceased at any time to be born, it is befitting
   that we should know why or at what time they so ceased. Seneca, in his
   books of moral philosophy, not without some pleasantry, asks, "What is
   the reason why Jupiter, who is represented by the poets as most
   addicted to lust, ceased to beget children? Was it that he was become a
   sexagenarian, and was restrained by the Papian law? [75] Or did he
   obtain the privileges conferred by having three children? Or did the
   sentiment at length occur to him, What you have done to another, you
   may expect from another;' and does he fear lest any one should act
   towards him as he himself did to Saturn?" But let those who maintain
   that they are gods, see in what manner they can answer this argument
   which I shall bring forward. If there are two sexes of the gods,
   conjugal intercourse follows; and if this takes place, they must have
   houses, for they are not without virtue and a sense of shame, so as to
   do this openly and promiscuously, as we see that the brute animals do.
   If they have houses, it follows that they also have cities; and for
   this we have the authority of Ovid, who says, "The multitude of gods
   occupy separate places; in this front the powerful and illustrious
   inhabitants of heaven have placed their dwellings." If they have
   cities, they will also have fields. Now who cannot see the
   consequence,--namely, that they plough and cultivate their lands? And
   this is done for the sake of food. Therefore they are mortal. And this
   argument is of the same weight when reversed. For if they have no
   lands, they have no cities; and if they have no cities, they are also
   without houses. And if they have no houses, they have no conjugal
   intercourse; and if they are without this, they have no female sex. But
   we see that there are females among the gods also. Therefore there are
   not gods. If any one is able, let him do away with this argument. For
   one thing so follows the other, that it is impossible not to admit
   these last things. But no one will refute even the former argument. Of
   the two sexes the one is stronger, the other weaker. For the males are
   more robust, the females more feeble. But a god is not liable to
   feebleness; therefore there is no female sex. To this is added that
   last conclusion of the former argument, that there are no gods, since
   there are females also among the gods.

    Chap. xvii.--concerning the same opinion of the stoics, and concerning the
    hardships and disgraceful conduct of the gods.

   On these accounts the Stoics form a different conception of the gods;
   and because they do not perceive what the truth is, they attempt to
   join them with the system of natural things. And Cicero, following
   them, brought forward this opinion respecting the gods and their
   religions. Do you see then, he says, how an argument has been drawn
   from physical subjects which have been well and usefully found out, to
   the existence of false and fictitious gods? And this circumstance gave
   rise to false opinions and turbulent errors, and almost old-womanly
   superstitions. For both the forms of the gods, and their ages, and
   clothing and ornaments, are known to us; and moreover their races, and
   marriages, and all their relationships, and all things reduced to the
   similitude of human infirmity. What can be said more plain, more true?
   The chief of the Roman philosophy, and invested with the most
   honourable priesthood, refutes the false and fictitious gods, and
   testifies that their worship consists of almost old-womanly
   superstitions: he complains that men are entangled in false opinions
   and turbulent errors. For the whole of his third book respecting the
   Nature of the Gods altogether overthrows and destroys all religion.
   What more, therefore, is expected from us? Can we surpass Cicero in
   eloquence? By no means; but confidence was wanting to him, being
   ignorant of the truth, as he himself simply acknowledges in the same
   work. For he says that he can more easily say what is not, than what
   is; that is, that he is aware that the received system is false, but is
   ignorant of the truth. [76] It is plain, therefore, that those who are
   supposed to be gods were but men, and that their memory was consecrated
   after their death. And on this account also different ages and
   established representations of form are assigned to each, because their
   images were fashioned in that dress and of that age at which death
   arrested each.

   Let us consider, if you please, the hardships of the unfortunate gods.
   Isis lost her son; Ceres her daughter; Latona, expelled and driven
   about over the earth, with difficulty found a small island [77] where
   she might bring forth. The mother of the gods both loved a beautiful
   youth, and also mutilated him when found in company with a harlot; and
   on this account her sacred rites are now celebrated by the Galli [78]
   as priests. Juno violently persecuted harlots, because she was not able
   to conceive by her brother. [79] Varro writes, that the island Samos
   was before called Parthenia, because Juno there grew up, and there also
   was married to Jupiter. Accordingly there is a most noble and ancient
   temple of hers at Samos, and an image fashioned in the dress of a
   bride; and her annual sacred rites are celebrated after the manner of a
   marriage. If, therefore, she grew up, if she was at first a virgin and
   afterwards a woman, he who does not understand that she was a human
   being confesses himself a brute. Why should I speak of the lewdness of
   Venus, who ministered to the lusts of all, not only gods, but also men?
   For from her infamous debauchery with Mars she brought forth Harmonia;
   from Mercury she brought forth Hermaphroditus, who was born of both
   sexes; from Jupiter Cupid; from Anchises Æneas; from Butes Eryx; from
   Adonis she could bring forth no offspring, because he was struck by a
   boar, and slain, while yet a boy. And she first instituted the art of
   courtesanship, as is contained in the sacred history; and taught women
   in Cyprus to seek gain by prostitution, which she commanded for this
   purpose, that she alone might not appear unchaste and a courter of men
   beyond other females. Has she, too, any claim to religious worship, on
   whose part more adulteries are recorded than births? But not even were
   those virgins who are celebrated able to preserve their chastity
   inviolate. For from what source can we suppose that Erichthonius was
   born? Was it from the earth, as the poets would have it appear? But the
   circumstance itself cries out. For when Vulcan had made arms for the
   gods, and Jupiter had given him the option of asking for whatever
   reward he might wish, and had sworn, according to his custom, by the
   infernal lake, that he would refuse him nothing which he might ask,
   then the lame artificer demanded Minerva in marriage. Upon this the
   excellent and mighty Jupiter, being bound by so great an oath, was not
   able to refuse; he, however, advised Minerva to oppose and defend her
   chastity. Then in that struggle they say that Vulcan shed his seed upon
   the earth, from which source Erichthonius was born: and that this name
   was given to him from eridos and chthsno's, that is, from the contest
   and the ground. Why, then, did she, a virgin, entrust that boy shut up
   with a dragon and sealed to three virgins born from Cecrops? An evident
   case of incest, as I think, which can by no means be glossed over.
   Another, when she had almost lost her lover, who was torn to pieces by
   his madened horses, called in the most excellent physician Æsculapius
   for the treatment of the youth; and when he was healed,


   "Trivia kind her favourite hides,

   And to Egeria's care confides,

   To live in woods obscure and lone,

   And lose in Virbius' name his own." [80]

   What is the meaning of this so diligent and anxious care? Why this
   secret abode? Why this banishment, either to so great a distance, or to
   a woman, or into solitude? Why, in the next place, the change of name?
   Lastly, why such a determined hatred of horses? What do all these
   things imply, but the consciousness of dishonour, and a love by no
   means consistent with a virgin? There was evidently a reason why she
   undertook so great a labour for a youth so faithful, who had refused
   compliance with the love of his stepmother.

    Chap. xviii.--on the consecration of gods, on account of the benefits which
    they conferred upon men.

   In this place also they are to be refuted, who not only admit that gods
   have been made from men, but even boast of it as a subject of praise,
   either on account of their valour, as Hercules, or of their gifts, as
   Ceres and Liber, or of the arts which they discovered, as Æsculapius or
   Minerva. But how foolish these things are, and how unworthy of being
   the causes why men should contaminate themselves with inexpiable guilt,
   and become enemies to God, in contempt of whom they undertake offerings
   to the dead, I will show from particular instances. They say that it is
   virtue [81] which exalts man to heaven,--not, however, that concerning
   which philosophers discuss, which consists in goods of the soul, but
   this connected with the body, which is called fortitude; and since this
   was pre-eminent in Hercules, it is believed to have deserved
   immortality. Who is so foolishly senseless as to judge strength of body
   to be a divine or even a human good, when it has been assigned in
   greater measure to cattle, and it is often impaired by one disease, or
   is lessened by old age itself, and altogether fails? And so Hercules,
   when he perceived that his muscles were disfigured by ulcers, neither
   wished to be healed nor to grow old, that he might not at any time
   appear to have less strength or comeliness than he once had. [82] They
   supposed that he ascended into heaven from the funeral pile on which he
   had burnt himself alive; and those very qualities which they most
   foolishly admired, they expressed by statues and images, and
   consecrated, so that they might for ever remain as memorials of the
   folly of those who had believed that gods owed their origin to the
   slaughter of beasts. But this, perchance, may be the fault of the
   Greeks, who always esteemed most trifling things as of the greatest
   consequence. What is the case of our own countrymen? Are they more
   wise? For they despise valour in an athlete, because it produces no
   injury; but in the case of a king, because it occasions widely-spread
   disasters, they so admire it as to imagine that brave and warlike
   generals are admitted to the assembly of the gods, and that there is no
   other way to immortality than to lead armies, to lay waste the
   territory of others, to destroy cities, to overthrow towns, to put to
   death or enslave free peoples. Truly the greater number of men they
   have cast down, plundered, and slain, so much the more noble and
   distinguished do they think themselves; and ensnared by the show of
   empty glory, they give to their crimes the name of virtue. I would
   rather that they should make to themselves gods from the slaughter of
   wild beasts, than approve of an immortality so stained with blood. If
   any one has slain a single man, he is regarded as contaminated and
   wicked, nor do they think it lawful for him to be admitted to this
   earthly abode of the gods. But he who has slaughtered countless
   thousands of men, has inundated plains with blood, and infected rivers,
   is not only admitted into the temple, but even into heaven. In Ennius
   Africanus thus speaks: "If it is permitted any one to ascend to the
   regions of the gods above, the greatest gate of heaven is open to me
   alone." Because, in truth, he extinguished and destroyed a great part
   of the human race. Oh how great the darkness in which you were
   involved, O Africanus, or rather O poet, in that you imagined the
   ascent to heaven to be open to men through slaughters and bloodshed!
   And Cicero also assented to this delusion. It is so in truth, he said,
   O Africanus, for the same gate was open to Hercules; as though he
   himself had been doorkeeper in heaven at the time when this took place.
   I indeed cannot determine whether I should think it a subject of grief
   or of ridicule, when I see grave and learned, and, as they appear to
   themselves, wise men, involved in such miserable waves of errors. If
   this is the virtue which renders us immortal, I for my part should
   prefer to die, rather than to be the cause of destruction to as many as
   possible. If immortality can be obtained in no other way than by
   bloodshed, what will be the result if all shall agree to live in
   harmony? And this may undoubtedly be realized, if men would cast aside
   their pernicious and impious madness, and live in innocence and
   justice. Shall no one, then, be worthy of heaven? Shall virtue perish,
   because it will not be permitted men to rage against their fellow-men?
   But they who reckon the overthrow of cities and people as the greatest
   glory will not endure public tranquillity: they will plunder and rage;
   and by the infliction of outrageous injuries will disturb the compact
   of human society, that they may have an enemy whom they may destroy
   with greater wickedness than that with which they attacked.

   Now let us proceed to the remaining subjects. The conferring of
   benefits gave the name of gods to Ceres and Liber. I am able to prove
   from the sacred writings that wine and corn were used by men before the
   offspring of Coelus and Saturnus. But let us suppose that they were
   introduced by these. Can it appear to be a greater thing to have
   collected corn, and having bruised it, to have taught men to make
   bread; or to have pressed grapes gathered from the vine, and to have
   made wine, than to have produced and brought forth from the earth corn
   itself, or the vine? God, indeed, may have left these things to be
   drawn out by the ingenuity of man; yet all things must belong to Him,
   who gave to man both wisdom to discover, and those very things which
   might be discovered. The arts also are said to have gained immortality
   for their inventors, as medicine for Æsculapius, the craft of the smith
   for Vulcan. Therefore let us worship those also who taught the art of
   the fuller and of the shoemaker. But why is not honour paid to the
   discoverer of the potter's art? Is it that those rich men despise
   Samian vessels? There are also other arts, the inventors of which
   greatly profited the life of man. Why have not temples been assigned to
   them also? But doubtless it is Minerva who discovered all, and
   therefore workmen offer prayers to her. Such, then, was the low
   condition [83] from which Minerva ascended to heaven. Is there truly
   any reason why any one should leave the worship of Him who created [84]
   the earth with its living creatures, and the heaven with its stars, for
   the adoration of her who taught men to set up the woof? What place does
   he hold who taught the healing of wounds in the body? Can he be more
   excellent than Him who formed the body itself, and the power of
   sensibility and of life? Finally, did he contrive and bring to light
   the herbs themselves, and the other things in which the healing art
   consists?

    Chap. xix.--that it is impossible for any one to worship the true god
    together with false deities.

   But some one will say that this supreme Being, who made all things, and
   those also who conferred on men particular benefits, are entitled to
   their respective worship. First of all, it has never happened that the
   worshipper of these has also been a worshipper of God. Nor can this
   possibly happen. For if the honour paid to Him is shared by others, He
   altogether ceases to be worshipped, since His religion requires us to
   believe that He is the one and only God. The excellent poet exclaims,
   that all those who refined life by the invention of arts are in the
   lower regions, and that even the discoverer himself of such a medicine
   and art was thrust down by lightning to the Stygian waves, that we may
   understand how great is the power of the Almighty Father, who can
   extinguish even gods by His lightnings. But ingenious men perchance
   thus reasoned with themselves: Because God cannot be struck with
   lightning, it is manifest that the occurrence never took place; nay,
   rather, because it did take place, it is manifest that the person in
   question was a man, and not a god. For the falsehood of the poets does
   not consist in the deed, but in the name. For they feared evil, if, in
   opposition to the general persuasion, they should acknowledge that
   which was true. But if this is agreed upon among themselves, that gods
   were made from men, why then do they not believe the poets, if at any
   time they describe their banishments and wounds, their deaths, and
   wars, and adulteries? From which things it may be understood that they
   could not possibly become gods, since they were not even good men, and
   during their life they performed those actions which bring forth
   everlasting death.

    Chap. xx.--of the gods peculiar to the Romans, and their sacred rites.

   I now come to the superstitions peculiar to the Romans, since I have
   spoken of those which are common. The wolf, the nurse of Romulus, was
   invested with divine honours. And I could endure this, if it had been
   the animal itself whose figure she bears. Livy relates that there was
   an image of Larentina, and indeed not of her body, but of her mind and
   character. For she was the wife of Faustulus, and on account of her
   prostitution she was called among the shepherds wolf, [85] that is,
   harlot, from which also the brothel [86] derives its name. The Romans
   doubtless followed the example of the Athenians in representing her
   figure. For when a harlot, by name Leæna, had put to death a tyrant
   among them, because it was unlawful for the image of a harlot to be
   placed in the temple, they erected the effigy of the animal whose name
   she bore. Therefore, as the Athenians erected a monument from the name,
   so did the Romans from the profession of the person thus honoured. A
   festival was also dedicated to her name, and the Larentinalia were
   instituted. Nor is she the only harlot whom the Romans worship, but
   also Faula, who was, as Verrius writes, the paramour of Hercules. Now
   how great must that immortality be thought which is attained even by
   harlots! Flora, having obtained great wealth by this practice, made the
   people her heir, and left a fixed sum of money, from the annual
   proceeds of which her birthday might be celebrated by public games,
   which they called Floralia. And because this appeared disgraceful to
   the senate, in order that a kind of dignity might be given to a
   shameful matter, they resolved that an argument should be taken from
   the name itself. They pretended that she was the goddess who presides
   over flowers, and that she must be appeased, that the crops, together
   with the trees or vines, might produce a good and abundant blossom. The
   poet followed up this idea in his Fasti, and related that there was a
   nymph, by no means obscure, who was called Chloris, and that, on her
   marriage with Zephyrus, she received from her husband as a wedding gift
   the control over all flowers. These things are spoken with propriety,
   but to believe them is unbecoming and shameful. And when the truth is
   in question, ought disguises of this kind to deceive us? Those games,
   therefore, are celebrated with all wantonness, as is suitable to the
   memory of a harlot. For besides licentiousness of words, in which all
   lewdness is poured forth, women are also stripped of their garments at
   the demand of the people, and then perform the office of mimeplayers,
   and are detained in the sight of the people with indecent gestures,
   even to the satiating of unchaste eyes.

   Tatius consecrated an image of Cloacina, which had been found in the
   great sewer; and because he did not know whose likeness it was, he gave
   it a name from the place. Tullus Hostilius fashioned and worshipped
   Fear and Pallor. What shall I say respecting him, but that he was
   worthy of having his gods always at hand, as men commonly wish? The
   conduct of Marcus Marcellus concerning the consecration of Honour and
   Valour differs from this in goodness of the names, but agrees with it
   in reality. The senate acted with the same vanity in placing Mind [87]
   among the gods; for if they had possessed any intelligence, they would
   never have undertaken sacred rites of this kind. Cicero says that
   Greece undertook a great and bold design in consecrating the images of
   Cupids and Loves in the gymnasia: it is plain that he flattered
   Atticus, and jested with his friend. For that ought not to have been
   called a great design, or a design at all, but the abandoned and
   deplorable wickedness of unchaste men, who exposed their children, whom
   it was their duty to train to an honourable course, to the lust of
   youth, and wished them to worship gods of profligacy, in those places
   especially where their naked bodies were exposed to the gaze of their
   corruptors, and at that age which, through its simplicity and
   incautiousness, can be enticed and ensnared before it can be on its
   guard. What wonder, if all kinds of profligacy flowed from this nation,
   among whom vices themselves have the sanction of religion, and are so
   far from being avoided, that they are even worshipped? And therefore,
   as though he surpassed the Greeks in prudence, he subjoined to this
   sentence as follows: "Vices ought not to be consecrated, but virtues."
   But if you admit this, O Marcus Tullius, you do not see that it will
   come to pass that vices will break in together with virtues, because
   evil things adhere to those which are good, and have greater influence
   on the minds of men; and if you forbid these to be consecrated, the
   same Greece will answer you that it worships some gods that it may
   receive benefits, and others that it may escape injuries.

   For this is always the excuse of those who regard their evils as gods,
   as the Romans esteem Blight and Fever. If, therefore, vices are not to
   be consecrated, in which I agree with you, neither indeed are virtues.
   For they have no intelligence or perception of themselves; nor are they
   to be placed within walls or shrines made of clay, but within the
   breast; and they are to be enclosed within, lest they should be false
   if placed without man. Therefore I laugh at that illustrious law of
   yours which you set forth in these words: "But those things on account
   of which it is given to man to ascend into heaven--I speak of mind,
   virtue, piety, faith--let there be temples for their praises." But
   these things cannot be separated from man. For if they are to be
   honoured, they must necessarily be in man himself. But if they are
   without man, what need is there to honour those things which you do not
   possess? For it is virtue, which is to be honoured, and not the image
   of virtue; and it is to be honoured not by any sacrifice, or incense,
   or solemn prayer, but only by the will and purpose. For what else is it
   to honour virtue, but to comprehend it with the mind, and to hold it
   fast? And as soon as any one begins to wish for this, he attains it.
   This is the only honour of virtue; for no other religion and worship is
   to be held but that of the one God. To what purport is it, then, O
   wisest man, to occupy with superfluous buildings places which may turn
   out to the service of men? To what purport is it to establish priests
   for the worship of vain and senseless objects? To what purport to
   immolate victims? To what purport to bestow such great expenditure on
   the forming or worshipping of images? The human breast is a stronger
   and more uncorrupted temple: let this rather be adorned, let this be
   filled with the true deities. For they who thus worship the
   virtues--that is, who pursue the shadows and images of virtues--cannot
   hold the very things which are true. Therefore there is no virtue in
   any one when vices bear rule; there is no faith when each individual
   carries off all things for himself; there is no piety when avarice
   spares neither relatives nor parents, and passion rushes to poison and
   the sword: no peace, no concord, when wars rage in public, and in
   private enmities prevail even to bloodshed; no chastity when unbridled
   lusts contaminate each sex, and the whole body in every part. Nor,
   however, do they cease to worship those things which they flee from and
   hate. For they worship with incense and the tips of their fingers those
   things which they ought to have shrunk from with their inmost feelings;
   and this error is altogether derived from their ignorance of the
   principal and chief good.

   When their city was occupied by the Gauls, and the Romans, who were
   besieged in the Capitol, had made military engines from the hair of the
   women, they dedicated a temple to the Bald Venus. They do not therefore
   understand how vain are their religions, even from this very fact, that
   they jeer at them by these follies. They had perhaps learned from the
   Lacedæmonians to invent for themselves gods from events. For when they
   were besieging the Messenians, and they (the Messenians) had gone out
   secretly, escaping the notice of the besiegers, and had hastened to
   plunder Lacedæmon, they were routed and put to flight by the Spartan
   women. But the Lacedæmonians, having learned the stratagem of the
   enemy, followed. The women in arms went out to a distance to meet them;
   and when they saw that their husbands were preparing themselves for
   battle, supposing them to be Messenians, they laid bare their persons.
   But the men, recognising their wives, and excited to passion by the
   sight, rushed to promiscuous intercourse, for there was not time for
   discrimination. In like manner, the youths who had on a former occasion
   been sent by the same people, having intercourse with the virgins, from
   whom the Partheniæ were born, in memory of this deed erected a temple
   and statue to armed Venus. And although this originated in a shameful
   cause, yet it seems better to have consecrated Venus as armed than
   bald. At the same time an altar was erected also to Jupiter Pistor (the
   baker), because he had admonished them in a dream to make all the corn
   which they had into bread, and throw it into the camp of the enemy; and
   when this was done, the siege was ended, since the Gauls despaired of
   being able to reduce the Romans by want.

   What a derision of religious rites is this! I were a defender of these,
   what could I complain of so greatly as that the name of gods had come
   into such contempt as to be mocked by the most disgraceful names? Who
   would not laugh at the goddess Fornax, or rather that learned men
   should be occupied with celebrating the Fornacalia? Who can refrain
   from laughter on hearing of the goddess Muta? They say that she is the
   goddess from whom the Lares were born, and they call her Lara, or
   Larunda. What advantage can she, who is unable to speak, afford to a
   worshipper? Caca also is worshipped, who informed Hercules of the theft
   of his oxen, having obtained immortality through the betrayal of her
   brother; and Cunina, who protects infants in the cradle, and keeps off
   witchcraft; and Stercutus, who first introduced the method of manuring
   the land; and Tutinus, before whom brides sit, as an introduction to
   the marriage rites; and a thousand other fictions, so that they who
   regarded these as objects of worship may be said to be more foolish
   than the Egyptians, who worship certain monstrous and ridiculous
   images. These however, have some delineation of form. What shall I say
   of those who worship a rude and shapeless stone under the name of
   Terminus? This is he whom Saturnus is said to have swallowed in the
   place of Jupiter; nor is the honour paid to him undeservedly. For when
   Tarquinius wished to build the Capitol, and there were the chapels of
   many gods on that spot, he consulted them by augury whether they would
   give way to Jupiter; and when the rest gave way, Terminus alone
   remained. From which circumstance the poet speaks of the immoveable
   stone of the Capitol. Now from this very fact how great is Jupiter
   found to be, to whom a stone did not give way, with this confidence,
   perhaps, because it had rescued him from the jaws of his father!
   Therefore, when the Capitol was built, an aperture was left in the roof
   above Terminus himself, that, since he had not given way, he might
   enjoy the free heaven; but they did not themselves enjoy this, who
   imagined that a stone enjoyed it. And therefore they make public
   supplications to him, as to the god who is the guardian of boundaries;
   and he is not only a stone, but sometimes also a stock. What shall I
   say of those who worship such objects, unless--that they above all
   others are stones and stocks?

    Chap. xxi.--of certain deities peculiar to barbarians, and their sacred
    rites; and in like manner concerning the romans.

   We have spoken of the gods themselves who are worshipped; we must now
   speak a few words respecting their sacrifices and mysteries. Among the
   people of Cyprus, Teucer sacrificed a human victim to Jupiter, and
   handed down to posterity that sacrifice which was lately abolished by
   Hadrian when he was emperor. There was a law among the people of
   Tauris, a fierce and inhuman nation, by which it was ordered that
   strangers should be sacrificed to Diana; and this sacrifice was
   practised through many ages. The Gauls used to appease Hesus and Teutas
   with human blood. Nor, indeed, were the Latins free from this cruelty,
   since Jupiter Latialis is even now worshipped with the offering of
   human blood. What benefit do they who offer such sacrifices implore
   from the gods? Or what are such deities able to bestow on the men by
   whose punishments they are propitiated? But this is not so much a
   matter of surprise with respect to barbarians, whose religion agrees
   with their character. But are not our countrymen, who have always
   claimed for themselves the glory of gentleness and civilization, found
   to be more inhuman by these sacrilegious rites? For these ought rather
   to be esteemed impious, who, though they are embellished with the
   pursuits of liberal training, turn aside from such refinement, than
   those who, being ignorant and inexperienced, glide into evil practices
   from their ignorance of those which are good. And yet it is plain that
   this rite of immolating human victims is ancient, since Saturn was
   honoured in Latium with the same kind of sacrifice; not indeed that a
   man was slain at the altar, but that he was thrown from the Milvian
   bridge into the Tiber. And Varro relates that this was done in
   accordance with an oracle; of which oracle the last verse is to this
   effect: "And offer heads to Ades, and to the father a man." [88] And
   because this appears ambiguous, both a torch and a man are accustomed
   to be thrown to him. But it is said that sacrifices of this kind were
   put an end to by Hercules when he returned from Spain; the custom still
   continuing, that instead of real men, images made from rushes were cast
   forth, as Ovid informs us in his Fasti: [89] "Until the Tirynthian came
   into these lands, gloomy sacrifices were annually offered in the
   Leucadian manner: he threw into the water Romans made of straw; do you,
   after the example of Hercules, cast [90] in the images of human
   bodies."

   The Vestal virgins make these sacred offerings, as the same poet says:
   [91] "Then also a virgin is accustomed to cast from the wooden bridge
   the images of ancient men made from rushes."

   For I cannot find language to speak of the infants who were immolated
   to the same Saturn, on account of his hatred of Jupiter. To think that
   men were so barbarous, so savage, that they gave the name of sacrifice
   to the slaughter of their own children, that is, to a deed foul, and to
   be held in detestation by the human race; since, without any regard to
   parental affection, they destroyed tender and innocent lives, at an age
   which is especially pleasing to parents, and surpassed in brutality the
   savageness of all beasts, which--savage as they are--still love their
   offspring! O incurable madness! What more could those gods do to them,
   if they were most angry, than they now do when propitious, when they
   defile their worshippers with parricide, visit them with bereavements,
   and deprive them of the sensibilities of men? What can be sacred to
   these men? Or what will they do in profane places, who commit the
   greatest crimes amidst the altars of the gods? Pescennius Festus
   relates in the books of his History by a Satire, that the Carthaginians
   were accustomed to immolate human victims to Saturn; and when they were
   conquered by Agathocles, the king of the Sicilians, they imagined that
   the god was angry with them; and therefore, that they might more
   diligently offer an expiation, they immolated two hundred sons of their
   nobles: "So great the ills to which religion could prompt, which has
   ofttimes produced wicked and impious deeds." What advantage, then, did
   the men propose by that sacrifice, when they put to death so large a
   part of the state, as not even Agathocles had slain when victorious?

   From this kind of sacrifices those public rites are to be judged signs
   of no less madness; some of which are in honour of the mother of the
   gods, in which men mutilate themselves; others are in honour of Virtus,
   whom they also call Bellona, in which the priests make offsprings not
   with the blood of another victim, but with their own. [92] For, cutting
   their shoulders, and thrusting forth drawn swords in each hand, they
   run, they are beside themselves, they are frantic. Quintilian therefore
   says excellently in his Fanatic: "If a god compels this, he does it in
   anger." Are even these things sacred? Is it not better to live like
   cattle, than to worship deities so impious, profane, and sanguinary?
   But we will discuss at the proper time the source from which these
   errors and deeds of such great disgrace originated. In the meantime,
   let us look also to other matters which are without guilt, that we may
   not seem to select the worse parts through the desire of finding fault.
   In Egypt there are sacred rites in honour of Isis, since she either
   lost or found her little son. For at first her priests, having made
   their bodies smooth, beat their breasts, and lament, as the goddess
   herself had done when her child was lost. Afterwards the boy is brought
   forward, as if found, and that mourning is changed into joy. Therefore
   Lucan says, "And Osiris never sufficiently sought for." For they always
   lose, and they always find him. Therefore in the sacred rites there is
   a representation of a circumstance which really occurred; and which
   assuredly declares, if we have any intelligence, that she was a mortal
   woman, and almost desolate, had she not found one person. And this did
   not escape the notice of the poet himself; for he represents Pompey
   when a youth as thus speaking, on hearing the death of his father: "I
   will now draw forth the deity Isis from the tomb, and send her through
   the nations; and I will scatter through the people Osiris covered with
   wood." This Osiris is the same whom the people call Serapis. For it is
   customary for the names of the dead who are deified to be changed, that
   no one, as I believe, may imagine them to be men. For Romulus after his
   death became Quirinus, and Leda became Nemesis, and Circe Marica; and
   Ino, when she had leapt into the sea, was called Leucothea; and the
   mother Matuta; and her son Melicerta was called Palæmon and Portumnus.
   And the sacred rites of the Eleusinian Ceres are not unlike these. For
   as in those which have been mentioned the boy Osiris is sought with the
   wailing of his mother, so in these Proserpine is carried away to
   contract an incestuous marriage with her uncle; and because Ceres is
   said to have sought for her in Sicily with torches lighted from the top
   of Etna, on this account her sacred rites are celebrated with the
   throwing of torches.

   At Lampsacus the victim to he offered to Priapus is an ass, and the
   cause of the sacrifice of this animal is thus set forth in the
   Fasti:--When all the deities had assembled at the festival of the Great
   Mother, and when, satiated with feasting, they were spending the night
   in sport, they say that Vesta had laid herself on the ground for rest,
   and had fallen asleep, and that Priapus upon this formed a design
   against her honour as she slept; but that she was aroused by the
   unseasonable braying of the ass on which Silenus used to ride, and that
   the design of the insidious plotter was frustrated. On this account
   they say that the people of Lampsacus were accustomed to sacrifice an
   ass to Priapus, as though it were in revenge; but among the Romans the
   same animal was crowned at the Vestalia (festival of Vesta) with
   loaves, [93] in honour of the preservation of her chastity. What is
   baser, what more disgraceful, than if Vesta is indebted to an ass for
   the preservation of her purity? But the poet invented a fable. But was
   that more true which is related by those [94] who wrote "Phenomena,"
   when they speak concerning the two stars of Cancer, which the Greeks
   call asses? That they were asses which carried across father Liber when
   he was unable to cross a river, and that he rewarded one of them with
   the power of speaking with human voice; and that a contest arose
   between him and Priapus; and Priapus, being worsted in the contest, was
   enraged, and slew the victor. This truly is much more absurd. But poets
   have the licence of saying what they will. I do not meddle with a
   mystery so odious; nor do I strip Priapus of his disguise, lest
   something deserving of ridicule should be brought to light. It is true
   the poets invented these fictions, but they must have been invented for
   the purpose of concealing some greater depravity. Let us inquire what
   this is. But in fact it is evident. For as the bull is sacrificed to
   Luna, [95] because he also has horns as she has; and as "Persia
   propitiates with a horse Hyperion surrounded with rays, that a slow
   victim may not be offered to the swift god;" so in this case no more
   suitable victim could be found than that which resembled him to whom it
   is offered.

   At Lindus, which is a town of Rhodes, there are sacred rites in honour
   of Hercules, the observance of which differs widely from all other
   rites; for they are not celebrated with words of good omen [96] (as the
   Greeks term it), but with revilings and cursing. And they consider it a
   violation of the sacred rites, if at any time during the celebration of
   the solemnities a good word shall have escaped from any one even
   inadvertently. And this is the reason assigned for this practice, if
   indeed there can be any reason in things utterly senseless. When
   Hercules had arrived at the place, and was suffering hunger, he saw a
   ploughman at work, and began to ask him to sell one of his oxen. But
   the ploughman replied that this was impossible, because his hope of
   cultivating the land depended altogether upon those two bullocks.
   Hercules, with his usual violence, because he was not able to receive
   one of them, killed both. But the unhappy man, when he saw that his
   oxen were slain, avenged the injury with revilings,--a circumstance
   which afforded gratification to the man of elegance and refinement. For
   while he prepares a feast for his companions, and while he devours the
   oxen of another man, he receives with ridicule and loud laughter the
   bitter reproaches with which the other assails him. But when it had
   been determined that divine honours should be paid to Hercules in
   admiration of his excellence, an altar was erected in his honour by the
   citizens, which he named, from the circumstance, the yoke of oxen; [97]
   and at this altar two yoked oxen were sacrificed, like those which he
   had taken from the ploughman. And he appointed the same man to be his
   priest, and directed him always to use the same revilings in offering
   sacrifice, because he said that he had never feasted more pleasantly.
   Now these things are not sacred, but sacrilegious, in which that is
   said to be enjoined, which, if it is done in other things, is punished
   with the greatest severity. What, moreover, do the rites of the Cretan
   Jupiter himself show, except the manner in which he was withdrawn from
   his father, or brought up? There is a goat belonging to the nymph
   Amalthea, which gave suck to the infant; and of this goat Germanicus
   Cæsar thus speaks, in his poem translated from Aratus: [98] --


   "She is supposed to be the nurse of Jupiter; if in truth the infant
   Jupiter pressed the faithful teats of the Cretan goat, which attests
   the gratitude of her lord by a bright constellation."

   Musæus relates that Jupiter, when fighting against the Titans, used the
   hide of this goat as a shield, from which circumstance he is called by
   the poets shield-bearer. [99] Thus, whatever was done in concealing the
   boy, that also is done by way of representation in the sacred rites.
   Moreover, the mystery of his mother also contains the same story which
   Ovid sets forth in the Fasti:--


   "Now the lofty Ida resounds with tinklings, that the boy may cry in
   safety with infant mouth. Some strike their shields with stakes, some
   beat their empty helmets. This is the employment of the Curetes, this
   of the Corybantes. The matter was concealed, and imitations of the
   ancient deed remain; the attendant goddesses shake instruments of
   brass, and hoarse hides. Instead of helmets they strike cymbals, and
   drums instead of shields; the flute gives Phrygian strains, as it gave
   before."

   Sallust rejected this opinion altogether, as though invented by the
   poets, and wished to give an ingenious explanation of the reasons for
   which the Curetes are said to have nourished Jupiter; and he speaks to
   this purport: Because they were the first to understand the worship of
   the deity, that therefore antiquity, which exaggerates all things, made
   them known as the nourishers of Jupiter. How much this learned man was
   mistaken, the matter itself at once declares. For if Jupiter holds the
   first place, both among the gods and in religious rites, if no gods
   were worshipped by the people before him, because they who are
   worshipped were not yet born; it appears that the Curetes, on the
   contrary, were the first who did not understand the worship of the
   deity, since all error was introduced by them, and the memory of the
   true God was taken away. They ought therefore to have understood from
   the mysteries and ceremonies themselves, that they were offering
   prayers to dead men. I do not then require that any one should believe
   the fictions of the poets. If any one imagines that these speak
   falsely, let him consider the writings of the pontiffs themselves, and
   weigh whatever there is of literature pertaining to sacred rites: he
   will perhaps find more things than we bring forward, from which he may
   understand that all things which are esteemed sacred are empty, vain,
   and fictitious. But if any one, having discovered wisdom, shall lay
   aside his error, he will assuredly laugh at the follies of men who are
   almost without understanding: I mean those who either dance with
   unbecoming gestures, or run naked, anointed, and crowned with chaplets,
   either wearing a mask or besmeared with mud. What shall I say about
   shields now putrid with age? When they carry these, they think that
   they are carrying gods themselves on their shoulders. For Furius
   Bibaculus is regarded among the chief examples of piety, who, though he
   was prætor, nevertheless carried the sacred shield, [100] preceded by
   the lictors, though his office as proetor gave him an exemption from
   this duty. He was therefore not Furius, but altogether mad, [101] who
   thought that he graced his prætorship by this service. Deservedly then,
   since these things are done by men not unskilful and ignorant, does
   Lucretius exclaim:--


   "O foolish minds of men! O blinded breasts! In what darkness of life
   and in how great dangers is passed this term of life, whatever be its
   duration!"

   Who that is possessed of any sense would not laugh at these mockeries,
   when he sees that men, as though bereft of intelligence, do those
   things seriously, which if any one should do in sport, he would appear
   too full of sport and folly?

    Chap. xxii.--who was the author of the vanities before described in italy
    among the romans, and who among other nations.

   The author and establisher of these vanities among the Romans was that
   Sabine king who especially engaged [102] the rude and ignorant minds of
   men with new superstitions: and that he might do this with some
   authority, he pretended that he had meetings by night with the goddess
   Egeria. There was a very dark cavern in the grove of Aricia, from which
   flowed a stream with a never failing spring. Hither he was accustomed
   to withdraw himself without any witnesses, that he might be able to
   pretend that, by the admonition of the goddess his wife, he delivered
   to the people those sacred rites which were most acceptable to the
   gods. It is evident that he wished to imitate the craftiness of Minos,
   who concealed himself in the cave of Jupiter, and, after a long delay
   there, brought forward laws, as though delivered to him by Jupiter,
   that he might bind men to obedience not only by the authority of his
   government, but also by the sanction of religion. Nor was it difficult
   to persuade shepherds. Therefore he instituted pontiffs, priests,
   Salii, and augurs; he arranged the gods in families; and by these means
   he softened the fierce spirits of the new people and called them away
   from warlike affairs to the pursuit of peace. But though he deceived
   others, he did not deceive himself. For after many years, in the
   consulship of Cornelius and Bebius, in a field belonging to the scribe
   Petilius, under the Janiculum, two stone chests were found by men who
   were digging, in one of which was the body of Numa, in the other seven
   books in Latin respecting the law of the pontiffs, and the same number
   written in Greek respecting systems of philosophy, in which he not only
   annulled the religious rites which he himself had instituted, but all
   others also. When this was referred to the senate, it was decreed that
   these books should be destroyed. Therefore Quintus Petilius, the prætor
   who had jurisdiction in the city, burnt them in an assembly of the
   people. This was a senseless proceeding; for of what advantage was it
   that the books were burnt, when the cause on account of which they were
   burnt--that they took away the authority due to religion--was itself
   handed down to memory? Every one then in the senate was most foolish;
   for the books might have been burnt, and yet the matter itself have
   been unknown. Thus, while they wish to prove even to posterity with
   what piety they defended religious institutions, they lessened the
   authority of the institutions themselves by their testimony.

   But as Pompilius was the institutor of foolish superstitions among the
   Romans, so also, before Pompilius, Faunus was in Latium, who both
   established impious rites to his grandfather Saturnus, and honoured his
   father Picus with a place among the gods, and consecrated his sister
   Fatua Fauna, who was also his wife; who, as Gabius Bassus relates, was
   called Fatua because she had been in the habit of foretelling their
   fates to women, as Faunus did to men. And Varro writes that she was a
   woman of such great modesty, that, as long as she lived, no male except
   her husband saw her or heard her name. On this account women sacrifice
   to her in secret, and call her the Good Goddess. And Sextus Claudius,
   in that book which he wrote in Greek, relates that it was the wife of
   Faunus who, because, contrary to the practice and honour of kings, she
   had drunk a jar of wine, and had become intoxicated, was beaten to
   death by her husband with myrtle rods. But afterwards, when he was
   sorry for what he had done, and was unable to endure his regret for
   her, he paid her divine honours. For this reason they say that a
   covered jar of wine is placed at her sacred rites. Therefore Faunus
   also left to posterity no slight error, which all that are intelligent
   see through. For Lucilius in these verses derides the folly of those
   who imagine that images are gods: "The terrestrial [103] Lamiæ, which
   Faunus and Numa Pompilius and others instituted; at and these he
   trembles, he places everything in this. As infant boys believe that
   every statue of bronze is a living man, so these imagine that all
   things feigned are true: they believe that statues of bronze contain a
   heart. It is a painter's gallery; [104] there is nothing true; all
   things are fictitious." The poet, indeed, compares foolish men to
   infants. But I say that they are much more senseless than infants. For
   they (infants) suppose that images are men, whereas these take them for
   gods: the one through their age, the others through folly, imagine that
   which is not true: at any rate, the one soon ceased to be deceived; the
   foolishness of the others is permanent, and always increases. Orpheus
   was the first who introduced the rites of father Liber into Greece; and
   he first celebrated them on a mountain of Boeotia, very near to Thebes,
   where Liber was born; and because this mountain continually resounded
   with the strains of the lyre, it was called Cithæron. [105] Those
   sacred rites are even now called Orphic, in which he himself was
   lacerated and torn in pieces; and he lived about the same time with
   Faunus. But which of them was prior in age admits of doubt, since
   Latinus and Priam reigned during the same years, as did also their
   fathers Faunus and Laomedon, in whose reign Orpheus came with the
   Argonauts to the coast of the Trojans.

   Let us therefore advance further, and inquire who was really the first
   author of the worship of the gods. Didymus, [106] in the books of his
   commentary on Pindar, says that Melisseus, king of the Cretans, was the
   first who sacrificed to the gods, and introduced new rites and parades
   of sacrifices. He had two daughters, Amalthæa and Melissa, who
   nourished the youthful Jupiter with goats' milk and honey. Hence that
   poetic fable derived its origin, that bees flew to the child, and
   filled his mouth with honey. Moreover, he says that Melissa was
   appointed by her father the first priestess of the Great Mother; from
   which circumstance the priests of the same Mother are still called
   Melissæ. But the sacred history testifies that Jupiter himself, when he
   had gained possession of power, arrived at such insolence that he built
   temples in honour of himself in many places. For when he went about to
   different lands, on his arrival in each region, he united to himself
   the kings or princes of the people in hospitality and friendship; and
   when he was departing from each, he ordered that a shrine should be
   dedicated to himself in the name of his host, as though the remembrance
   of their friendship and league could thus be preserved. Thus temples
   were founded in honour of Jupiter Atabyrius and Jupiter Labrandius; for
   Atabyrius and Labrandius were his entertainers and assistants in war.
   Temples were also built to Jupiter Laprius, to Jupiter Molion, to
   Jupiter Casius, and others, after the same manner. This was a very
   crafty device on his part, that he might both acquire divine honour for
   himself, and a perpetual name for his entertainers in conjunction with
   religious observances. Accordingly they were glad, and cheerfully
   submitted to his command, and observed annual rites and festivals for
   the sake of handing down their own name. Æneas did something like this
   in Sicily, when he gave the name of his host [107] Acestes to a city
   which he had built, that Acestes might afterwards joyfully and
   willingly love, increase, and adorn it. In this manner Jupiter spread
   abroad through the world the observance of his worship, and gave an
   example for the imitation of others. Whether, then, the practice of
   worshipping the gods proceeded from Melisseus, as Didymus related, or
   from Jupiter also himself, as Euhemerus says, the time is still agreed
   upon when the gods began to be worshipped. Melisseus, indeed, was much
   prior in time, inasmuch as he brought up Jupiter his grandson. It is
   therefore possible that either before, or while Jupiter was yet a boy,
   he taught the worship of the gods, namely, the mother of his
   foster-child, and his grandmother Tellus, who was the wife of Uranus,
   and his father Saturnus; and he himself, by this example and
   institution, may have exalted Jupiter to such pride, that he afterwards
   ventured to assume divine honours to himself.

    Chap. xxiii.--of the ages of vain superstitions, and the times at which they
    commenced.

   Now, since we have ascertained the origin of vain superstitions, it
   remains that we should also collect the times during which they whose
   memory is honoured lived. Theophilus, [108] in his book written to
   Autolycus respecting the times, [109] says that Thallus relates in his
   history, that Belus, who is worshipped by the Babylonians and
   Assyrians, is found to have lived 322 years before the Trojan war; that
   Belus, moreover, was contemporary with Saturnus, and that they both
   grew up at one time;--which is so true, that it may be inferred by
   reason itself. For Agamemnon, who carried on the Trojan war, was the
   fourth [110] in descent from Jupiter; and Achilles and Ajax were of the
   third [111] descent from him; and Ulysses was related in the same
   degree. Priam, indeed, was distant by a long series of descents. But
   according to some authorities, Dardanus and Iasius were sons of
   Coritus, not of Jupiter. For if it had been so, Jupiter could not have
   formed that unchaste connection with Ganymede, his own descendant.
   Therefore, if you divide the years which are in agreement, the number
   will be found in harmony with the parents of those whom I have named
   above. Now, from the destruction of the Trojan city fourteen hundred
   and seventy years are made up. From this calculation of times, it is
   manifest that Saturnus has not been born more than eighteen hundred
   years, and he also was the father of all the gods. Let them not glory,
   then, in the antiquity of their sacred rites, since both their origin
   and system and times have been ascertained. There still remain some
   things which may be of great weight for the disproving of false
   religions; but I have determined now to bring this book to an end, that
   it may not exceed moderate limits. For those things must be followed up
   more fully, that, having refuted all things which seem to oppose the
   truth, we may be able to instruct in true religion men who, through
   ignorance of good things, wander in uncertainty. But the first step
   towards wisdom is to understand what is false; the second, to ascertain
   what is true. Therefore he who shall have profited by this first
   discussion of mine, in which we have exposed false things, will be
   excited to the knowledge of the truth, than which no pleasure is more
   gratifying to man; and he will now be worthy of the wisdom of heavenly
   training, who shall approach with willingness and preparation to the
   knowledge of the other subjects.

  Book II.

  Of the Origin of Error.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. i.--that forgetfulness of reason makes men ignorant of the true god,
    whom they worship in adversity and despise in prosperity.

   Although I have shown in the first book that the religious ceremonies
   of the gods are false, because those in whose honour the general
   consent of men throughout the world by a foolish persuasion undertook
   various and dissimilar rites were mortals, and when they had completed
   their term of life, yielded to a divinely appointed necessity and died,
   yet, lest any doubt should be left, this second book shall lay open the
   very fountain of errors, and shall explain all the causes by which men
   were deceived, so that at first they believed that they were gods, and
   afterwards with an inveterate persuasion persevered in the religious
   observances which they had most perversely undertaken. For I desire, O
   Emperor Constantine, now that I have proved the emptiness of these
   things, and brought to light the impious vanity of men, to assert the
   majesty of the one God, undertaking the more useful and greater duty of
   recalling men from crooked paths, and of bringing them back into favour
   with themselves, that they may not, as some philosophers do, so greatly
   despise themselves, nor think that they are weak and useless, and of no
   account, and altogether born in vain. For this notion drives many to
   vicious pursuits. For while they imagine that we are a care to no God,
   or that we are about to have no existence after death, they altogether
   give themselves to the indulgence of their passions; and while they
   think that it is allowed them, they eagerly apply themselves to the
   enjoyment of pleasures, by which they unconsciously run into the snares
   of death; for they are ignorant as to what is reasonable conduct on the
   part of man: for if they wished to understand this, in the first place
   they would acknowledge their Lord, and would follow after virtue and
   justice; they would not subject their souls to the influence of
   earth-born fictions, nor would they seek the deadly fascinations of
   their lusts; in short, they would value themselves highly, and would
   understand that there is more in man than appears; and that they cannot
   retain their power and standing unless men lay aside depravity, and
   undertake the worship of their true Parent. I indeed, as I ought, often
   reflecting on the sum of affairs, am accustomed to wonder that the
   majesty of the one God, which keeps together and rules all things, has
   come to be so forgotten, that the only befitting object of worship is,
   above all others, the one which is especially neglected; and that men
   have sunk to such blindness, that they prefer the dead to the true and
   living God, and those who are of the earth, and buried in the earth, to
   Him who was the Creator of the earth itself.

   And yet this impiety of men might meet with some indulgence if the
   error entirely arose from ignorance of the divine name. But since we
   often see that the worshippers of other gods themselves confess and
   acknowledge the Supreme God, what pardon can they hope for their
   impiety, who do not acknowledge the worship of Him whom man cannot
   altogether be ignorant of? For both in swearing, and in expressing a
   wish, and in giving thanks, they do not name Jupiter, or a number of
   gods, but God; [112] so entirely does the truth of its own accord break
   forth by the force of nature even from unwilling breasts. And this,
   indeed, is not the case with men in their prosperity. For then most of
   all does God escape the memory of men, when in the enjoyment of His
   benefits they ought to honour His divine beneficence. But if any
   weighty necessity shall press them, then they remember God. If the
   terror of war shall have resounded, if the pestilential force of
   diseases shall have overhung them, if long-continued drought shall have
   denied nourishment to the crops, if a violent tempest or hail shall
   have assailed them, they betake themselves to God, aid is implored from
   God, God is entreated to succour them. If any one is tossed about on
   the sea, the wind being furious, it is this God whom he invokes. If any
   one is harassed by any violence, he implores His aid. If any one,
   reduced to the last extremity of poverty, begs for food, he appeals to
   God alone, and by His divine and matchless name [113] alone he seeks to
   gain the compassion of men. Thus they never remember God, unless it be
   while they are in trouble. When fear has left them, and the dangers
   have withdrawn, then in truth they quickly hasten to the temples of the
   gods: they pour libations to them, they sacrifice to them, they crown
   [114] them with garlands. But to God, whom they called upon in their
   necessity itself, they do not give thanks even in word. Thus from
   prosperity arises luxury; and from luxury, together with all other
   vices, there arises impiety towards God.

   From what cause can we suppose this to arise? Unless we imagine that
   there is some perverse power which is always hostile to the truth,
   which rejoices in the errors of men, whose one and only task it is
   perpetually to scatter darkness, and to blind the minds of men, lest
   they should see the light,--lest, in short, they should look to heaven,
   and observe the nature [115] of their own body, the origin [116] of
   which we shall relate at the proper place; but now let us refute
   fallacies. For since other animals look down to the ground, with bodies
   bending forward, because they have not received reason and wisdom,
   whereas an upright position and an elevated countenance have been given
   to us by the Creator God, it is evident that these ceremonies paid to
   the gods are not in accordance with the reason of man, because they
   bend down the heaven-sprung being to the worship of earthly objects.
   For that one and only Parent of ours, when He created man,--that is, an
   animal intelligent and capable of exercising reason,--raised him from
   the ground, and elevated him to the contemplation of his Creator. As an
   ingenious poet [117] has well represented it:--


   "And when other animals bend forward and look to the earth, He gave to
   man an elevated countenance, and commanded him to look up to the
   heaven, and to raise his countenance erect to stars."

   From this circumstance the Greeks plainly derived the name anthropos,
   [118] because he looks upward. They therefore deny themselves, and
   renounce the name of man, who do not look up, but downward: unless they
   think that the fact of our being upright is assigned to man without any
   cause. God willed that we should look up to heaven, and undoubtedly not
   without reason. For both the birds and almost all of the dumb creation
   see the heaven, but it is given to us in a peculiar manner to behold
   the heaven as we stand erect, that we may seek religion there; that
   since we cannot see God with our eyes, we may with our mind contemplate
   Him, whose throne is there: and this cannot assuredly be done by him
   who worships brass and stone, which are earthly things. But it is most
   incorrect that the nature of the body, which is temporary, should be
   upright, but that the soul itself, which is eternal, should be abject;
   whereas the figure and position have no other signification, except
   that the mind of man ought to look in the same direction as his
   countenance, and that his soul ought to be as upright as his body, so
   that it may imitate that which it ought to rule. But men, forgetful
   both of their name and nature, cast down their eyes from the heaven,
   and fix them upon the ground, and fear the works of their own hands, as
   though anything could be greater than its own artificer.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. ii.--what was the first cause of making images; of the true likeness
    of god, and the true worship of him.

   What madness is it, then, either to form those objects which they
   themselves may afterwards fear, or to fear the things which they have
   formed? But, they say, we do not fear the images themselves, but those
   beings after whose likeness they were formed, and to whose names they
   are dedicated. You fear them doubtless on this account, because you
   think that they are in heaven; for if they are gods, the case cannot be
   otherwise. Why, then, do you not raise your eyes to heaven, and,
   invoking their names, offer sacrifices in the open air? Why do you look
   to walls, and wood, and stone, rather than to the place where you
   believe them to be? What is the meaning of temples [119] and altars?
   what, in short, of the images themselves, which are memorials either of
   the dead or absent? For the plan of making likenesses was invented by
   men for this reason, that it might be possible to retain the memory of
   those who had either been removed by death or separated by absence. In
   which of these classes, then, shall we reckon the gods? If among the
   dead, who is so foolish as to worship them? If among the absent, then
   they are not to be worshipped, if they neither see our actions nor hear
   our prayers. But if the gods cannot be absent,--for, since they are
   divine, they see and hear all things, in whatever part of the universe
   they are,--it follows that images are superfluous, since the gods are
   present everywhere, and it is sufficient to invoke with prayer the
   names of those who hear us. But if they are present, they cannot fail
   to be at hand at their own images. It is entirely so, as the people
   imagine, that the spirits of the dead wander [120] about the tombs and
   relics of their bodies. But after that the deity has begun to be near,
   there is no longer need of his statue.

   For I ask, if any one should often contemplate the likeness of a man
   who has settled in a foreign land, that he may thus solace himself for
   him who is absent, would he also appear to be of sound mind, if, when
   the other had returned and was present, he should persevere in
   contemplating the likeness, and should prefer the enjoyment of it,
   rather than the sight of the man himself? Assuredly not. For the
   likeness of a man appears to be necessary at that time when he is far
   away; and it will become superfluous when he is at hand. But in the
   case of God, whose spirit and influence are diffused everywhere, and
   can never be absent, it is plain that an image is always superfluous.
   But they fear lest their religion should be altogether vain and empty
   if they should see nothing present which they may adore, and therefore
   they set up images; and since these are representations of the dead,
   they resemble the dead, for they are entirely destitute of perception.
   But the image of the ever-living God ought to be living and endued with
   perception. But if it received this name [121] from resemblance, how
   can it be supposed that these images resemble God, which have neither
   perception nor motion? Therefore the image of God is not that which is
   fashioned by the fingers of men out of stone, or bronze, or other
   material, but man himself, since he has both perception and motion, and
   performs many and great actions. Nor do the foolish men understand,
   that if images could exercise perception and motion, they would of
   their own accord adore men, by whom they have been adorned and
   embellished, since they would be either rough and unpolished stone, or
   rude and unshapen wood, [122] had they not been fashioned by man.

   Man, therefore, is to be regarded as the parent of these images; for
   they were produced by his instrumentality, and through him they first
   had shape, figure, and beauty. Therefore he who made them is superior
   to the objects which were made. And yet no one looks up to the Maker
   Himself, or reverences Him: he fears the things which he has made, as
   though there could be more power in the work than in the workman.
   Seneca, therefore, rightly says in his moral treatises: They worship
   the images of the gods, they supplicate them with bended knee, they
   adore them, they sit or stand beside them through the whole day, they
   offer to them contributions, [123] they slay victims; and while they
   value these images so highly, they despise the artificers who made
   them. What is so inconsistent, as to despise the statuary and to adore
   the statue; and not even to admit to your society him who makes your
   gods? What force, what power can they have, when he who made them has
   none? But he was unable to give to these even those powers which he
   had, the power of sight, of hearing, of speech, and of motion. Is any
   one so foolish as to suppose that there is anything in the image of a
   god, in which there is nothing even of a man except the mere
   resemblance? But no one considers these things; for men are imbued with
   this persuasion, and their minds have thoroughly imbibed the deception
   [124] of folly. And thus beings endowed with sense adore objects which
   are senseless, rational beings adore irrational objects, those who are
   alive adore inanimate objects, those sprung from heaven adore earthly
   objects. It delights me, therefore, as though standing on a lofty
   watch-tower, from which all may hear, to proclaim aloud that saying of
   Persius: [125] --


   "O souls bent down to the earth, and destitute of heavenly things?"

   Rather look to the heaven, to the sight of which God your Creator
   raised you. He gave to you an elevated countenance; you bend it down to
   the earth; you depress to things below those lofty minds, which are
   raised together with their bodies to their parent, as though it
   repented you that you were not born quadrupeds. It is not befitting
   that the heavenly being should make himself equal to things which are
   earthly, and incline to the earth. Why do you deprive yourselves of
   heavenly benefits, and of your own accord fall prostrate upon the
   ground? For you do wretchedly roll yourselves [126] on the ground, when
   you seek here below that which you ought to have sought above. For as
   to those vain [127] and fragile productions, the work of man's hands,
   from whatever kind of material they are formed, what are they but
   earth, out of which they were produced? Why, then, do you subject
   yourselves to lower objects? why do you place the earth above your
   heads? For when you lower yourselves to the earth, and humiliate
   yourselves, you sink of your own accord to hell, and condemn yourselves
   to death; for nothing is lower and more humble than the earth, except
   death and hell. And if you wished to escape these, you would despise
   the earth lying beneath your feet, preserving the position of your
   body, which you received upright, in order that you might be able to
   direct your eyes and your mind to Him who made it. But to despise and
   trample upon the earth is nothing else than to refrain from adoring
   images, because they are made of earth; also not to desire riches, and
   to despise the pleasures of the body, because wealth, and the body
   itself, which we make use of as a lodging, is but earth. Worship a
   living being, that you may live; for he must necessarily die who has
   subjected [128] himself and his soul to the dead.

   faithful set apart for the worship of God, but to the places used by
   the heathens for their rites and sacrifices. [For three centuries
   templa was the word among Christians for the idolatrous places.] That
   buildings were set apart by Christians from the earliest ages for their
   religious assemblies, is gathered from the express testimony of
   Tertullian, Cyprian, and other early writers. They were called
   ecclesiæ; churches, not temples. [For kuriako`n, dominicum, basilica,

    Chap. iii.--that cicero and other men of learning erred in not turning away
    the people from error.

   But what does it avail thus to address the vulgar and ignorant, when we
   see that learned and prudent men, though they understand the vanity of
   these ceremonies, nevertheless through some perverseness persist in the
   worship of those very objects which they condemn? Cicero was well aware
   that the deities which men worshipped were false. For when he had
   spoken many things which tended to the overthrow of religious
   ceremonies, he said nevertheless that these matters ought not to be
   discussed by the vulgar, lest such discussion should extinguish the
   system of religion which was publicly received. What can you do
   respecting him, who, when he perceives himself to be in error, of his
   own accord dashes himself against the stones, that all the people may
   stumble? or tears out his own eyes, that all may be blind? who neither
   deserves well of others, whom he suffers to be in error, nor of
   himself, since he inclines to the errors of others, and makes no use of
   the benefit of his own wisdom, so as to carry out [129] in action the
   conception of his own mind, but knowingly and consciously thrusts his
   foot into the snare, that he also may be taken with the rest, whom he
   ought, as the more prudent, to have extricated? Nay rather, if you have
   any virtue, Cicero, endeavour to make the people wise: that is a
   befitting subject, on which you may expend all the powers of your
   eloquence. For there is no fear lest speech should fail you in so good
   a cause, when you have often defended even bad ones with copiousness
   and spirit. But truly you fear the prison of Socrates, [130] and on
   that account you do not venture to undertake the advocacy of truth.
   But, as a wise man, you ought to have despised death. And, indeed, it
   would have been much more glorious to die on account of good words than
   on account of revilings. Nor would the renown of your Philippics have
   been more advantageous to you than the dispersion of the errors of
   mankind, and the recalling of the minds of men to a healthy state by
   your disputation.

   But let us make allowance for timidity, which ought not to exist in a
   wise man. Why, then, are you yourself engaged in the same error? I see
   that you worship things of earth made by the hand: you understand that
   they are vain, and yet you do the same things which they do, whom you
   confess to be most foolish. What, therefore, did it profit you, that
   you saw the truth, which you were neither about to defend nor to
   follow? If even they who perceive themselves to be in error err
   willingly, how much more so do the unlearned vulgar, who delight in
   empty processions, and gaze at all things with boyish minds! They are
   delighted with trifling things, and are captivated with the form of
   images; and they are unable to weigh every object in their own minds,
   so as to understand that nothing which is beheld by the eyes of mortals
   ought to be worshipped, because it must necessarily be mortal. Nor is
   it matter of surprise if they do not see God, when they themselves do
   not even see man, whom they believe that they see. For this, which
   falls under the notice of the eyes, [131] is not man, but the
   receptacle of man, the quality and figure of which are not seen from
   the lineaments of the vessel which contains them, but from the actions
   and character. They, therefore, who worship images are mere bodies
   without men, because they have given themselves to corporeal things,
   and do not see anything with the mind more than with the body; whereas
   it is the office of the soul to perceive those things more clearly
   which the eye of the body cannot behold. And that philosopher and poet
   severely accuses those men as humble and abject, who, in opposition to
   the design of their nature, prostrate themselves to the worship of
   earthly things; for he says: [132] --


   "And they abase their souls with fear of the gods, and weigh and press
   them down to earth."

   When he said these things, indeed, his meaning was different--that
   nothing was to be worshipped, because the gods do not regard the
   affairs of men.

   In another place, at length, he acknowledges that the ceremonies and
   worship of the gods is an unavailing office: [133] --


   "Nor is it any piety to be often seen with veiled head to turn to a
   stone, and approach every altar, and fall prostrate on the ground, and
   spread the hands before the shrines of the gods, and sprinkle the
   altars with much blood of beasts, and to offer vow after vow."

   And assuredly if these things are useless, it is not right that sublime
   and lofty souls should be called away and depressed to the earth, but
   that they should think only of heavenly things.

   False religious systems, therefore, have been attacked by more
   sagacious men, because they perceived their falsehood; but the true
   religion was not introduced, because they knew not what and where it
   was. They therefore so regarded it as though it had no existence,
   because they were unable to find it in its truth. And in this manner
   they fell into a much greater error than they who held a religion which
   was false. For those worshippers of fragile images, however foolish
   they may be, inasmuch as they place heavenly things in things which are
   earthly and corruptible, yet retain something of wisdom, and may be
   pardoned, because they hold the chief duty of man, if not in reality,
   yet still in their purpose; since, if not the only, yet certainly the
   greatest difference between men and the beasts consists in religion.
   But this latter class, in proportion to their superior wisdom, in that
   they understood the error of false religion, rendered themselves so
   much the more foolish, because they did not imagine that some religion
   was true. And thus, because it is easier to judge of the affairs of
   others than of their own, while they see the downfall of others, they
   have not observed what was before their own feet. On either side is
   found the greatest folly, and a certain trace [134] of wisdom; so that
   you may doubt which are rather to be called more foolish--those who
   embrace a false religion, or those who embrace none. But (as I have
   said) pardon may be granted to those who are ignorant and do not own
   themselves to be wise; but it cannot be extended to those who, while
   they profess [135] wisdom, rather exhibit folly. I am not, indeed, so
   unjust as to imagine that they could divine, so that they might find
   out the truth by themselves; for I acknowledge that this is impossible.
   But I require from them that which they were able to perform by reason
   [136] itself. For they would act more prudently, if they both
   understood that some form of religion is true, and if, while they
   attacked false religions, they openly proclaimed that men were not in
   possession of that which is true.

   But this consideration may perhaps have influenced them, that if there
   were any true religion, it would exert itself and assert its authority,
   and not permit the existence of anything opposed to it. For they were
   unable to see at all, on what account, or by whom, and in what manner
   true religion was depressed, which partakes of a divine mystery [137]
   and a heavenly secret. And no man can know [138] this by any means,
   unless he is taught. The sum of the matter is this: The unlearned and
   the foolish esteem false religions as true, because they neither know
   the true nor understand the false. [139] But the more sagacious,
   because they are ignorant of the true, either persist in those
   religions which they know to be false, that they may appear to possess
   something; or worship nothing at all, that they may not fall into
   error, whereas this very thing partakes largely of error, under the
   figure of a man to imitate the life of cattle. To understand that which
   is false is truly the part of wisdom, but of human wisdom. Beyond this
   step man cannot proceed, and thus many of the philosophers have taken
   away religious institutions, as I have pointed out; but to know the
   truth is the part of divine wisdom. But man by himself cannot attain to
   this knowledge, unless he is taught by God. Thus philosophers have
   reached the height of human wisdom, so as to understand that which is
   not; but they have failed in attaining the power of saying that which
   really is. It is a well-known saying of Cicero: [140] "I wish that I
   could as easily find out the truth as I can refute false things." And
   because this is beyond the power of man's condition, the capability of
   this office is assigned to us, to whom God has delivered the knowledge
   of the truth; to the explaining of which the four last books shall be
   devoted. Now, in the meantime, let us bring to light false things, as
   we have begun to do.

    Chap. iv.--of images, and the ornaments of temples, and the contempt in
    which they are held even by the heathens themselves.

   What majesty, then, can images have, which were altogether in the power
   of puny man, either that they should be formed into something else, or
   that they should not be made at all? On which account Priapus thus
   speaks in Horace: [141]


   "Formerly I was the trunk of a fig-tree, [142] a useless log, when the
   carpenter, at a loss whether he should make a bench or a Priapus,
   decided that it should be a god. Accordingly I am a god, a very great
   terror to thieves and birds."

   Who would not be at ease with such a guardian as this? For thieves are
   so foolish as to fear the figure of Priapus; though the very birds,
   which they imagine to be driven away by fear of his scythe, settle upon
   the images which are skilfully made, that is, which altogether resemble
   men, build their nests there, and defile them. But Flaccus, as a writer
   of satire, ridiculed the folly of men. But they who make the images
   fancy that they are performing a serious business. In short, that very
   great poet, a man of sagacity in other things, in this alone displayed
   folly, not like a poet, but after the manner of an old woman, when even
   in those most highly-finished [143] books he orders this to be done:--


   "And let the guardianship of Priapus of the Hellespont, [144] who
   drives away thieves and birds with his willow scythe, preserve them."

   Therefore they adore mortal things, as made by mortals. For they may be
   broken, or burnt, or be destroyed. For they are often apt to be broken
   to pieces, when houses fall through age, and when, consumed by
   conflagration, they waste away to ashes; and in many instances, unless
   aided by their own magnitude, or protected by diligent watchfulness,
   they become the prey of thieves. What madness is it, then, to fear
   those objects for which either the downfall of a building, or fires, or
   thefts, may be feared! What folly, to hope for protection from those
   things which are unable to protect themselves! What perversity, to have
   recourse to the guardianship of those which, when injured, are
   themselves unavenged, unless vengeance is exacted by their worshippers!
   Where, then, is truth? Where no violence can be applied to religion;
   where there appears to be nothing which can be injured; where no
   sacrilege can be committed.

   But whatever is subjected to the eyes and to the hands, that, in truth,
   because it is perishable, is inconsistent with the whole subject of
   immortality. It is in vain, therefore, that men set off and adorn their
   gods with gold, ivory, and jewels, as though they were capable of
   deriving any pleasure from these things. What is the use of precious
   gifts to insensible objects? Is it the same which the dead have? For as
   they embalm the bodies of the dead, wrap them in spices and precious
   garments, and bury them in the earth, so they honour the gods, who when
   they were made did not perceive it, and when they are worshipped have
   no knowledge of it; for they did not receive sensibility on their
   consecration. Persius was displeased that golden vessels should be
   carried into the temples, since he thought it superfluous that that
   should be reckoned among religious offerings which was not an
   instrument of sanctity, but of avarice. For these are the things which
   it is better to offer as a gift to the god whom you would rightly
   worship:--


   "Written law [145] and the divine law of the conscience, and the sacred
   recesses of the mind, and the breast imbued with nobleness." [146]

   A noble and wise sentiment. But he ridiculously added this: that there
   is this gold in the temples, as there are dolls [147] presented to
   Venus by the virgin; which perhaps he may have despised on account of
   their smallness. For he did not see that the very images and statues of
   the gods, wrought in gold and ivory by the hand of Polycletus,
   Euphranor, and Phidias, were nothing more than large dolls, not
   dedicated by virgins, to whose sports some indulgence may be granted,
   but by bearded men. Therefore Seneca deservedly laughs at the folly
   even of old men. We are not (he says) boys twice, [148] as is commonly
   said, but are always so. But there is this difference, that when men we
   have greater subjects of sport. Therefore men offer to these dolls,
   which are of large size, and adorned as though for the stage, both
   perfumes, and incense, and odours: they sacrifice to these costly and
   fattened victims, which have a mouth, [149] but one that is not
   suitable for eating; to these they bring robes and costly garments,
   though they have no need of clothing; to these they dedicate gold and
   silver, of which they who receive them are as destitute [150] as they
   who have given them.

   And not without reason did Dionysius, the despot of Sicily, when after
   a victory he had become master of Greece, [151] despise, and plunder
   and jeer at such gods, for he followed up his sacrilegious acts by
   jesting words. For when he had taken off a golden robe from the statue
   of the Olympian Jupiter, he ordered that a woollen garment should be
   placed upon him, saying that a golden robe was heavy in summer and cold
   in winter, but that a woollen one was adapted to each season. He also
   took off the golden beard from Æsculapius, saying that it was
   unbecoming and unjust, that while his father Apollo was yet smooth and
   beardless, the son should be seen to wear a beard before his father. He
   also took away the bowls, and spoils, and some little images [152]
   which were held in the extended hands of the statues, and said that he
   did not take them away, but received them: for that it would be very
   foolish and ungrateful to refuse to receive good things, when offered
   voluntarily by those from whom men were accustomed to implore them. He
   did these things with impunity, because he was a king and victorious.
   Moreover, his usual good fortune also followed him; for he lived even
   to old age, and handed down the kingdom in succession to his son. In
   his case, therefore, because men could not punish his sacrilegious
   deeds, it was befitting that the gods should be their own avengers. But
   if any humble person shall have committed any such crime, there are at
   hand for his punishment the scourge, fire, the rack, [153] the cross,
   and whatever torture men can invent in their anger and rage. But when
   they punish those who have been detected in the act of sacrilege, they
   themselves distrust the power of their gods. For why should they not
   leave to them especially the opportunity of avenging themselves, if
   they think that they are able to do so? Moreover, they also imagine
   that it happened through the will of the deities that the sacrilegious
   robbers were discovered and arrested; and their cruelty is instigated
   not so much by anger as by fear, lest they themselves should be visited
   with punishment if they failed to avenge the injury done to the gods.
   And, in truth, they display incredible shallowness in imagining that
   the gods will injure them on account of the guilt of others, who by
   themselves were unable to injure those very persons by whom they were
   profaned and plundered. But, in fact, they have often themselves also
   inflicted punishment on the sacrilegious: that may have occurred even
   by chance, which has sometimes happened, but not always. But I will
   show presently how that occurred. Now in the meantime I will ask, Why
   did they not punish so many and such great acts of sacrilege in
   Dionysius, who insulted the gods openly, and not in secret? Why did
   they not repel this sacrilegious man, possessed of such power, from
   their temples, their ceremonies, and their images? Why, even when he
   had carried off their sacred things, had he a prosperous voyage--as he
   himself, according to his custom, testified in joke? Do you see, he
   said to his companions who feared shipwreck, how prosperous a voyage
   the immortal gods themselves give to the sacrilegious? But perhaps he
   had learnt from Plato that the gods have no [154] power.

   What of Caius Verres? whom his accuser Tully compares to this same
   Dionysius, and to Phalaris, and to all tyrants. Did he not pillage the
   whole of Sicily, carrying away the images of the gods, and the
   ornaments of the temples? It is idle to follow up each particular
   instance: I would fain make mention of one, in which the accuser, with
   all the force of eloquence--in short, with every effort of voice and of
   body--lamented about Ceres of Catina, or of Henna: the one of whom was
   of such great sanctity, that it was unlawful for men to enter the
   secret recesses of her temple; the other was of such great antiquity,
   that all accounts relate that the goddess herself first discovered
   grain in the soil of Henna, and that her virgin daughter was carried
   away from the same place. Lastly, in the times of the Gracchi, when the
   state was disturbed both by seditions and by portents, on its being
   discovered in the Sibylline predictions that the most ancient Ceres
   ought to be appeased, ambassadors were sent to Henna. This Ceres, then,
   either the most holy one, whom it was unlawful for men to behold even
   for the sake of adoration, or the most ancient one, whom the senate and
   people of Rome had appeased with sacrifices and gifts, was carried away
   with impunity by Caius Verres from her secret and ancient recesses, his
   robber slaves having been sent in. The same orator, in truth, when he
   affirmed that he had been entreated by the Sicilians to undertake the
   cause of the province, made use of these words: "That they had now not
   even any gods in their cities to whom they might betake themselves,
   since Verres had taken away the most sacred images from their most
   venerable shrines." As though, in truth, if Verres had taken them away
   from the cities and shrines, he had also taken them from heaven. From
   which it appears that those gods have nothing in them more than the
   material of which they are made. And not without reason did the
   Sicilians have recourse to you, O Marcus Tullius, that is, to a man;
   since they had for three years experienced that those gods had no
   power. For they would have been most foolish if they had fled for
   protection against the injuries of men, to those who were unable to be
   angry with Caius Verres on their own behalf. But, it will be urged,
   Verres was condemned on account of these deeds. Therefore he was not
   punished by the gods, but by the energy of Cicero, by which he either
   crushed his defenders or withstood his influence. [155] Why should I
   say that, in the case of Verres himself, that was not so much a
   condemnation as a respite from labour? So that, as the immortal gods
   had given a prosperous voyage to Dionysius when he was carrying off the
   spoils of gods, so also they appear to have bestowed on Verres quiet
   repose, in which he might with tranquility enjoy the fruits of his
   sacrilege. For when civil wars afterwards raged, being removed from all
   danger and apprehension, under the cloak of condemnation he heard of
   the disastrous misfortunes and miserable deaths of others; and he who
   appeared to have fallen while all retained their position, he alone, in
   truth, retained his position while all fell; until the proscription of
   the triumvirs,--that very proscription, indeed, which carried off
   Tully, the avenger of the violated majesty of the gods,--carried him
   off, satiated at once with the enjoyment of the wealth which he had
   gained by sacrilege, and with life, and worn out by old age. Moreover,
   he was fortunate in this very circumstance, that before his own death
   he heard of the most cruel end of his accuser; the gods doubtless
   providing that this sacrilegious man and spoiler of their worship
   should not die before he had received consolation from revenge.

   of the true God; who suspended the earth [156] on a firm foundation,
   who bespangled the heaven with shining stars; who lighted up the sun,

   rise." [157]

   All these things truly were not the work of Jupiter, who was born
   seventeen hundred years ago; but of the same, "that framer of all
   things, the origin of a better world," [158] who is called God, whose
   beginning cannot be comprehended, and ought not to be made the subject
   of inquiry. It is sufficient for man, to his full and perfect wisdom,
   if he understands the existence of God: the force and sum of which
   understanding is this, that he look up to and honour the common Parent
   of the human race, and the Maker of wonderful things. Whence some
   persons of dull and obtuse mind adore as gods the elements, which are
   both created objects and are void of sensibility; who, when they
   admired the works of God, that is, the heaven with its various lights,
   the earth with its plains and mountains, the seas with their rivers and
   lakes and fountains, struck with admiration of these things, and
   forgetting the Maker Himself, whom they were unable to see, began to
   adore and worship His works. Nor were they able at all to understand
   how much greater and more wonderful He is, who made these things out of
   nothing. And when they see that these things, in obedience to divine
   laws, by a perpetual necessity are subservient to the uses and
   interests of men, they nevertheless regard them as gods, being
   ungrateful towards the divine bounty, so that they preferred their own
   works to their most indulgent God and Father. But what wonder is it if
   uncivilized or ignorant men err, since even philosophers of the Stoic
   sect are of the same opinion, so as to judge that all the heavenly
   bodies which have motion are to be reckoned in the number of gods;
   inasmuch as the Stoic Lucilius thus speaks in Cicero: [159] "This
   regularity, therefore, in the stars, this great agreement of the times
   in such various courses during all eternity, are unintelligible to me
   with out the exercise of mind, reason, and design; and when we see
   these things in the constellations, we cannot but place these very
   objects in the number of the gods." And he thus speaks a little before:
   "It remains," he says, "that the motion of the stars is voluntary; and
   he who sees these things, would act not only unlearnedly, but also
   impiously, if he should deny it." We in truth firmly deny it; and we
   prove that you, O philosophers, are not only unlearned and impious, but
   also blind, foolish, and senseless, who have surpassed in shallowness
   the ignorance of the uneducated. For they regard as gods only the sun
   and moon, but you the stars also.

   Make known to us, therefore, the mysteries of the stars, that we may
   erect altars and temples to each; that we may know with what rites and
   on what day to worship each, with what names and with what prayers we
   should call on them; unless perhaps we ought to worship gods so
   innumerable without any discrimination, and gods so minute in a mass.
   Why should I mention that the argument by which they infer that all the
   heavenly bodies are gods, tends to the opposite conclusion? For if they
   imagine that they are gods on this account, because they have their
   courses fixed and in accordance with reason, they are in error. For it
   is evident from this that they are not gods, because it is not
   permitted them to deviate [160] from their prescribed orbits. But if
   they were gods, they would be borne hither and thither in all
   directions without any necessity, as living creatures on the earth, who
   wander hither and thither as they please, because their wills are
   unrestrained, and each is borne wherever inclination may have led it.
   Therefore the motion of the stars is not voluntary, but of necessity,
   because they obey [161] the laws appointed for them. But when he was
   arguing about the courses of the stars, while he understood from the
   very harmony of things and times that they were not by chance, he
   judged that they were voluntary; as though they could not be moved with
   such order and arrangement, unless they contained within them an
   understanding acquainted with its own duty. Oh, how difficult is truth
   to those who are ignorant of it! how easy to those who know it! If, he
   says, the motions of the stars are not by chance, nothing else remains
   but that they are voluntary; nay, in truth, as it is plain that they
   are not by chance, so is it clear that they are not voluntary. Why,
   then, in completing their courses, do they preserve their regularity?
   Undoubtedly God, the framer of the universe, so arranged and contrived
   them, that they might run through their courses [162] in the heaven
   with a divine and wonderful order, to accomplish the variations of the
   successive seasons. Was Archimedes [163] of Sicily able to contrive a
   likeness and representation of the universe in hollow brass, in which
   he so arranged the sun and moon, that they effected, as it were every
   day, motions unequal and resembling the revolutions of the heavens, and
   that sphere, while it revolved, [164] exhibited not only the approaches
   and withdrawings of the sun, or the increase and waning of the moon,
   but also the unequal courses of the stars, whether fixed or wandering?
   Was it then impossible for God to plan and create the originals, [165]
   when the skill of man was able to represent them by imitation? Would
   the Stoic, therefore, if he should have seen the figures of the stars
   painted and fashioned in that brass, say that they moved by their own
   design, and not by the genius of the artificer? There is therefore in
   the stars design, adapted to the accomplishment of their courses; but
   it is the design of God, who both made and governs all things, not of
   the stars themselves, which are thus moved. For if it had been His will
   that the sun should remain [166] fixed, it is plain that there would be
   perpetual day. Also if the stars had no motions, who doubts that there
   would have been eternal night? But that there might be vicissitudes of
   day and night, it was His will that the stars should move, and move
   with such variety that there might not only be mutual interchanges of
   light and darkness, by which alternate courses [167] of labour and rest
   might be established, but also interchanges of cold and heat, that the
   power and influence of the different seasons might be adapted either to
   the production or the ripening of the crops. And because philosophers
   did not see this skill of the divine power in contriving the movements
   of the stars, they supposed them to be living, as though they moved
   with feet and of their own accord, and not by the divine intelligence.
   But who does not understand why God contrived them? Doubtless lest, as
   the light of the sun was withdrawn, a night of excessive darkness
   should become too oppressive with its foul and dreadful gloom, and
   should be injurious to the living. And so He both bespangled the heaven
   with wondrous variety, and tempered the darkness itself with many and
   minute lights. How much more wisely therefore does Naso judge, than
   they who think that they are devoting themselves to the pursuit of
   wisdom, in thinking that those lights were appointed by God to remove
   the gloom of darkness! He concludes the book, in which he briefly
   comprises the phenomena of nature, with these three verses:--


   "These images, so many in number, and of such a figure, God placed in
   the heaven; and having scattered them through the gloomy darkness, He
   ordered them to give a bright light to the frosty night."

   But if it is impossible that the stars should be gods, it follows that
   the sun and moon cannot be gods, since they differ from the light of
   the stars in magnitude only, and not in their design. And if these are
   not gods, the same is true of the heaven, which contains them all.

    Chap. vI.--that neither the whole universe nor the elements are god, nor are
    they possessed of life.

   In like manner, if the land on which we tread, and which we subdue and
   cultivate for food, is not a god, then the plains and mountains will
   not be gods; and if these are not so, it follows that the whole of the
   earth cannot appear to be God. In like manner, if the water, which is
   adapted to the wants [168] of living creatures for the purpose of
   drinking and bathing, is not a god, neither are the fountains gods from
   which the water flows. And if the fountains are not gods, neither are
   the rivers, which are collected from the fountains. And if the rivers
   also are not gods, it follows that the sea, which is made up of rivers,
   cannot be considered as God. But if neither the heaven, nor the earth,
   nor the sea, which are the parts of the world, can be gods, it follows
   that the world altogether is not God; whereas the same Stoics contend
   that it is both living and wise, and therefore God. But in this they
   are so inconsistent, that nothing is said by them which they do not
   also overthrow. For they argue thus: It is impossible that that which
   produces from itself sensible objects should itself be insensible. But
   the world produces man, who is endowed with sensibility; therefore it
   must also itself be sensible. Also they argue: that cannot be without
   sensibility, a part of which is sensible; therefore, because man is
   sensible, the world, of which man is a part, also possesses
   sensibility. The propositions [169] themselves are true, that that
   which produces a being endowed with sense is itself sensible; and that
   that possesses sense, a part of which is endowed with sense. But the
   assumptions by which they draw their conclusions are false; for the
   world does not produce man, nor is man a part of the world. For the
   same God who created the world, also created man from the beginning:
   and man is not a part of the world, in the same manner in which a limb
   is a part of the body; for it is possible for the world to be without
   man, as it is for a city or house. Now, as a house is the
   dwelling-place of one man, and a city of one people, so also the world
   is the abode [170] of the whole human race; and that which is inhabited
   is one thing, that which inhabits another. But these persons, in their
   eagerness to prove that which they had falsely assumed, that the world
   is possessed of sensibility, and is God, did not perceive the
   consequences of their own arguments. For if man is a part of the world,
   and if the world is endowed with sensibility because man is sensible,
   therefore it follows that, because man is mortal, the world must also
   of necessity be mortal, and not only mortal, but also liable to all
   kinds of disease and suffering. And, on the contrary, if the world is
   God, its parts also are plainly immortal: therefore man also is God,
   because he is, as you say, a part of the world. And if man, then also
   both beasts of burden and cattle, and the other kinds of beasts and of
   birds, and fishes, since these also in the same manner are possessed of
   sensibility, and are parts of the world. But this is endurable; for the
   Egyptians worship even these. But the matter comes to this: that even
   frogs, and gnats, and ants appear to be gods, because these also have
   sensibility, and are parts of the world. Thus arguments drawn from a
   false source always lead to foolish and absurd conclusions. Why should
   I mention that the same philosophers assert that the world was
   constructed [171] for the sake of gods and men as a common dwelling?
   Therefore the world is neither god, nor living, if it has been made:
   for a living creature is not made, but born; and if it has been built,
   it has been built as a house or ship is built. Therefore there is a
   builder of the world, even God; and the world which has been made is
   distinct from Him who made it. Now, how inconsistent and absurd is it,
   that when they affirm that the heavenly fires [172] and the other
   elements of the world are gods, they also say that the world itself is
   God! How is it possible that out of a great heap of gods one God can be
   made up? If the stars are gods, it follows that the world is not God,
   but the dwelling-place of gods. But if the world is God, it follows
   that all the things which are in it are not gods, but members [173] of
   God, which clearly cannot by themselves [174] take the name of God. For
   no one can rightly say that the members of one man are many men; but,
   however, there is no similar comparison between a living being and the
   world. For because a living being is endowed with sensibility, its
   members also have sensibility; nor do they become senseless [175]
   unless they are separated from the body. But what resemblance does the
   world present to this? Truly they themselves tell us, since they do not
   deny that it was made, that it might be, as it were, a common abode for
   gods and men. If, therefore, it has been constructed as an abode, it is
   neither itself God, nor are the elements which are its parts; because a
   house cannot bear rule over itself, nor can the parts of which a house
   consists. Therefore they are refuted not only by the truth, but even by
   their own words. For as a house, made for the purpose of being
   inhabited, has no sensibility by itself, and is subject to the master
   who built or inhabits it; so the world, having no sensibility of
   itself, is subject to God its Maker, who made it for His own use.

    Chap. vii.--of god, and the religious rites of the foolish; of avarice, and
    the authority of ancestors.

   The foolish, therefore, err in a twofold manner: first, in preferring
   the elements, that is, the works of God, to God Himself; secondly, in
   worshipping the figures of the elements themselves under human form.
   For they form the images of the sun and moon after the fashion of men;
   also those of fire, and earth, and sea, which they call Vulcan, Vesta,
   and Neptune. Nor do they openly sacrifice to the elements themselves.
   Men are possessed with so great a fondness for representations, [176]
   that those things which are true are now esteemed of less value: they
   are delighted, in fact, with gold, and jewels, and ivory. The beauty
   and brilliancy of these things dazzle their eyes, and they think that
   there is no religion where these do not shine. And thus, under pretence
   of worshipping the gods, avarice and desire are worshipped. For they
   believe that the gods love whatever they themselves desire, whatever it
   is, on account of which thefts and robberies and murders daily rage, on
   account of which wars overthrow nations and cities throughout the whole
   world. Therefore they consecrate their spoils and plunder to the gods,
   who must undoubtedly be weak, and destitute of the highest excellence,
   if they are subject to desires. For why should we think them celestial
   if they long for anything from the earth, or happy if they are in want
   of anything, or uncorrupted if they take pleasure in those things in
   the pursuit of which the desire of men is not unreservedly condemned?
   They approach the gods, therefore not so much on account of religion,
   which can have no place in badly acquired and corruptible things, as
   that they may gaze upon [177] the gold, and view the brilliancy of
   polished marble or ivory, that they may survey with unwearied
   contemplation garments adorned with precious stones and colours, or
   cups studded with glittering jewels. And the more ornamented are the
   temples, and the more beautiful the images, so much the greater majesty
   are they believed to have: so entirely is their religion confined [178]
   to that which the desire of men admires.

   These are the religious institutions handed down to them by their
   ancestors, which they persist in maintaining and defending with the
   greatest obstinacy. Nor do they consider of what character they are;
   but they feel assured of their excellence and truth on this account,
   because the ancients have handed them down; and so great is the
   authority of antiquity, that it is said to be a crime to inquire into
   it. And thus it is everywhere believed as ascertained truth. In short,
   in Cicero, [179] Cotta thus speaks to Lucilius: "You know, Balbus, what
   is the opinion of Cotta, what the opinion of the pontiff. Now let me
   understand what are your sentiments: for since you are a philosopher, I
   ought to receive from you a reason for your religion; but in the case
   of our ancestors it is reasonable to believe them, though no reason is
   alleged by them." If you believe, why then do you require a reason,
   which may have the effect of causing you not to believe? But if you
   require a reason, and think that the subject demands inquiry, then you
   do not believe; for you make inquiry with this view, that you may
   follow it when you have ascertained it. Behold, reason teaches you that
   the religious institutions of the gods are not true: what will you do?
   Will you prefer to follow antiquity or reason? And this, indeed, was
   not imparted [180] to you by another, but was found out and chosen by
   yourself, since you have entirely uprooted all religious systems. If
   you prefer reason, you must abandon the institutions and authority of
   our ancestors, since nothing is right but that which reason prescribes.
   But if piety advises you to follow your ancestors, then admit that they
   were foolish, who complied with religious institutions invented
   contrary to reason; and that you are senseless, since you worship that
   which you have proved to be false. But since the name of ancestors is
   so greatly objected to us, let us see, I pray, who those ancestors were
   from whose authority it is said to be impious to depart. [181]

   Romulus, when he was about to found the city, called together the
   shepherds among whom he had grown up; and since their number appeared
   inadequate to the founding of the city, he established an asylum. To
   this all the most abandoned men flocked together indiscriminately from
   the neighbouring places, without any distinction of condition. Thus he
   brought together the people from all these; and he chose into the
   senate those who were oldest, and called them Fathers, by whose advice
   he might direct all things. And concerning this senate, Propertius the
   elegiac poet thus speaks:--


   "The trumpet used to call the ancient Quirites to an assembly; [182]
   those hundred in the field often formed the senate. The senate-house,
   which now is raised aloft and shines with the well-robed senate,
   received the Fathers clothed in skins, rustic spirits."

   These are the Fathers whose decrees learned and sagacious men obey with
   the greatest devotion; and all posterity must judge that to be true and
   unchangeable which an hundred old men clothed in skins established at
   their will; who, however, as has been mentioned in the first book,
   [183] were enticed by Pompilius to believe the truth of those sacred
   rites which he himself delivered. Is there any reason why their
   authority should be so highly esteemed by posterity, since during their
   life no one either high or low judged them worthy of affinity? [184]

    Chap. viii.--of the use of reason in religion; and of dreams, auguries,
    oracles, and similar portents.

   It is therefore right, especially in a matter on which the whole plan
   of life turns, that every one should place confidence in himself, and
   use his own judgment and individual capacity for the investigation and
   weighing of the truth, rather than through confidence in others to be
   deceived by their errors, as though he himself were without
   understanding. God has given wisdom to all alike, [185] that they might
   be able both to investigate things which they have not heard, and to
   weigh things which they have heard. Nor, because they preceded us in
   time, did they also outstrip us in wisdom; for if this is given equally
   to all, we cannot be anticipated [186] in it by those who precede us.
   It is incapable of diminution, as the light and brilliancy of the sun;
   because, as the sun is the light of the eyes, so is wisdom the light of
   man's heart. Wherefore, since wisdom--that is, the inquiry after
   truth--is natural to all, they deprive themselves of wisdom, who
   without any judgment approve of the discoveries of their ancestors, and
   like sheep are led by others. But this escapes their notice, that the
   name of ancestors being introduced, they think it impossible that they
   themselves should have more knowledge because they are called
   descendants, or that the others should be unwise because they are
   called ancestors. [187] What, therefore, prevents us from taking a
   precedent [188] from them, that as they handed down to posterity their
   false inventions, so we who have discovered the truth may hand down
   better things to our posterity? There remains therefore a great subject
   of inquiry, the discussion of which does not come from talent, but from
   knowledge: and this must be explained at greater length, that nothing
   at all may be left in doubt. For perhaps some one may have recourse to
   those things which are handed down by many and undoubted authorities;
   that those very persons, whom we have shown to be no gods, have often
   displayed their majesty both by prodigies, and dreams, and auguries,
   and oracles. And, indeed, many wonderful things may be enumerated, and
   especially this, that Accius Navius, a consummate augur, when he was
   warning Tarquinius Priscus to undertake the commencement of nothing new
   without the previous sanction of auguries, [189] and the king,
   detracting from [190] the credit due to his art, told him to consult
   the birds, and then to announce to him whether it was possible for that
   which he himself had conceived in his mind to be accomplished, and
   Navius affirmed that it was possible; then take this whetstone, he
   said, and divide it with a razor. But the other without any hesitation
   took and cut it.

   In the next place is the fact of Castor and Pollux having been seen in
   the Latin war at the lake of Juturna washing off the sweat of their
   horses, when their temple which adjoins the fountain had been open of
   its own accord. In the Macedonian war the same deities, mounted on
   white horses, are said to have presented themselves to Publius Vatienus
   as he went to Rome at night, announcing that King Perseus had been
   vanquished and taken captive on that day, the truth of which was proved
   by letters received from Paulus [191] a few days afterwards. That also
   is wonderful, that the statue of Fortune, in the form [192] of a woman,
   is reported to have spoken more than once; also that the statue of Juno
   Moneta, [193] when, on the capture of Veii, one of the soldiers, being
   sent to remove it, sportively and in jest asked whether she wished to
   remove to Rome, answered that she wished it. Claudia also is set forth
   as an example of a miracle. For when, in accordance with the Sibylline
   books, the Idæan mother was sent for, and the ship in which she was
   conveyed had grounded on a shoal of the river Tiber, and could not be
   moved by any force, they report that Claudia, who had been always
   regarded as unchaste on account of her excess in personal adornment,
   with bended knees entreated the goddess, if she judged her to be
   chaste, to follow her girdle; and thus the ship, which could not be
   moved by all the strong men, [194] was moved by a single woman. It is
   equally wonderful, that during the prevalence of a pestilence,
   Æsculapius, being called from Epidaurus, is said to have released the
   city of Rome from the long-continued plague.

   Sacrilegious persons can also be mentioned, by the immediate punishment
   of whom the gods are believed to have avenged the injury done to them.
   Appius Claudius the censor having, against the advice of the oracle,
   transferred the sacred rites of Hercules to the public slaves, [195]
   was deprived of his eyesight; and the Potitian gens, which abandoned
   [196] its privilege, within the space of one year became extinct.
   Likewise the censor Fulvius, when he had taken away the marble tiles
   from the temple of the Lacinian [197] Juno, to cover the temple of the
   equestrian Fortuna, which he had built at Rome, was deprived of his
   senses, and having lost his two sons who were serving in Illyricum, was
   consumed with the greatest grief of mind. Turullius also, the
   lieutenant of Mark Antony, when he had cut down a grove of Æsculapius
   in Cos, [198] and built a fleet, was afterwards slain at the same place
   by the soldiers of Cæsar. To these examples is added Pyrrhus, who,
   having taken away money from the treasure of the Locrian Proserpine,
   was shipwrecked, and dashed against the shores near to the temple of
   the goddess, so that nothing was found uninjured except that money.
   Ceres of Miletus also gained for herself great veneration among men.
   For when the city had been taken by Alexander, and the soldiers had
   rushed in to plunder her temple, a flame of fire suddenly thrown upon
   them blinded them all.

   There are also found dreams which seem to show the power of the gods.
   For it is said that Jupiter presented himself to Tiberius Atinius, a
   plebeian, in his sleep, and enjoined him to announce to the consuls and
   senate, that in the last Circensian [199] games a public dancer had
   displeased him, because a certain Antonius Maximus had severely
   scourged a slave under the furca [200] in the middle of the circus, and
   had led him to punishment, and that on this account the games ought to
   be repeated. And when he had neglected this command, he is said on the
   same day to have lost his son, and to have been himself seized by a
   severe disease; and that when he again perceived the same image asking
   whether he had suffered sufficient punishment for the neglect of his
   command, he was carried on a litter to the consuls; and having
   explained the whole matter in the senate, he regained strength of body,
   and returned to his house on foot. And that dream also was not less
   wonderful, to which it is said that Augustus Cæsar owed his
   preservation. For when in the civil war with Brutus he was afflicted
   with a severe disease, and had determined to abstain from battle, the
   image of Minerva presented itself to his physician Artorius, advising
   him that Cæsar should not confine himself to the camp on account of his
   bodily infirmity. He was therefore carried on a litter to the army, and
   on the same day the camp was taken by Brutus. Many other examples of a
   similar nature may be brought forward; but I fear that, if I shall
   delay too long in the setting forth of contrary subjects, I may either
   appear to have forgotten my purpose, or may incur the charge of

    Chap. ix.--of the devil, the world, god, providence, man, and his wisdom.

   I will therefore set forth the method of all these things, that
   difficult and obscure subjects may be more easily understood; and I
   will bring to light all these deceptions [201] of the pretended deity,
   led by which men have departed very far from the way of truth. But I
   will retrace the matter far back from its source; that if any,
   unacquainted with the truth and ignorant, shall apply himself to the
   reading of this book, he may be instructed, and may understand what can
   in truth be "the source and origin of these evils;" and having received
   light, may perceive his own errors and those of the whole human race.

   Since God was possessed [202] of the greatest foresight for planning,
   and of the greatest skill for carrying out in action, before He
   commenced this business of the world,--inasmuch as there was in Him,
   and always is, the fountain of full and most complete goodness,--in
   order that goodness might spring as a stream from Him, and might flow
   forth afar, He produced a Spirit like to Himself, who might be endowed
   with the perfections of God the Father. But how He willed that, I will
   endeavour to show in the fourth book. [203] Then He made another being,
   in whom the disposition of the divine origin did not remain. Therefore
   he was infected with his own envy as with poison, and passed from good
   to evil; and at his own will, which had been given to him by God
   unfettered, [204] he acquired for himself a contrary name. From which
   it appears that the source of all evils is envy. For he envied his
   predecessor, [205] who through his stedfastness [206] is acceptable and
   dear to God the Father. This being, who from good became evil by his
   own act, is called by the Greeks diabolus: [207] we call him accuser,
   because he reports to God the faults to which he himself entices us.
   God, therefore, when He began the fabric of the world, set over the
   whole work that first and greatest Son, and used Him at the same time
   as a counsellor and artificer, in planning, arranging, and
   accomplishing, since He is complete both in knowledge, [208] and
   judgment, and power; concerning whom I now speak more sparingly,
   because in another place [209] both His excellence, and His name, and
   His nature must be related by us. Let no one inquire of what materials
   God made these works so great and wonderful: for He made all things out
   of nothing.

   Nor are the poets to be listened to, who say that in the beginning was
   a chaos, that is, a confusion of matter and the elements; but that God
   afterwards divided all that mass, and having separated each object from
   the confused heap, and arranged them in order, He constructed and
   adorned the world. Now it is easy to reply to these persons, who do not
   understand the power of God: for they believe that He can produce
   nothing, except out of materials already existing [210] and prepared;
   in which error philosophers also were involved. For Cicero, while
   discussing the nature of the gods, [211] thus speaks: "First of all,
   therefore, it is not probable [212] that the matter [213] from which
   all things arose was made by divine providence, but that it has, and
   has had, a force and nature of its own. As therefore the builder, when
   he is about to erect any building, does not himself make the materials,
   but uses those which are already prepared, and the statuary [214] also
   uses the wax; so that divine providence ought to have had materials at
   hand, not of its own production, but already prepared for use. But if
   matter was not made by God, then neither was the earth, and water, and
   air, and fire, made by God." Oh, how many faults there are in these ten
   lines! First, that he who in almost all his other disputations and
   books was a maintainer of the divine providence, and who used very
   acute arguments in assailing those who denied the existence of a
   providence, now himself, as a traitor or deserter, endeavoured to take
   away providence; in whose case, if you wish to oppose [215] him,
   neither consideration nor labour is required: it is only necessary to
   remind him of his own words. For it will be impossible for Cicero to be
   more strongly refuted by any one than by Cicero himself. But let us
   make this concession to the custom and practice of the Academics, [216]
   that men are permitted to speak with great freedom, and to entertain
   what sentiments they may wish. Let us examine the sentiments
   themselves. It is not probable, he says, that matter was made by God.
   By what arguments do you prove this? For you gave no reason for its
   being improbable. Therefore, on the contrary, it appears to me
   exceedingly probable; nor does it appear so without reason, when I
   reflect that there is something more in God, whom you verily reduce to
   the weakness of man, to whom you allow nothing else but the mere
   workmanship. In what respect, then, will that divine power differ from
   man, if God also, as man does, stands in need of the assistance of
   another? But He does stand in need of it, if He can construct nothing
   unless He is furnished with materials by another. But if this is the
   case, it is plain that His power is imperfect, and he who prepared the
   material [217] must be judged more powerful. By what name, therefore,
   shall he be called who excels God in power?--since it is greater to
   make that which is one's own, than to arrange those things which are
   another's. But if it is impossible that anything should be more
   powerful than God, who must necessarily be of perfect strength, power,
   and intelligence, it follows that He who made the things which are
   composed of matter, made matter also. For it was neither possible nor
   befitting that anything should exist without the exercise of God's
   power, or against His will. But it is probable, he says, that matter
   has, and always has had, a force and nature of its own. [218] What
   force could it have, without any one to give it? what nature, without
   any one to produce it? If it had force, it took that force from some
   one. But from whom could it take it, unless it were from God? Moreover,
   if it had a nature, which plainly is so called from being produced, it
   must have been produced. But from whom could it have derived its
   existence, except God? For nature, from which you say that all things
   had their origin, if it has no understanding, can make nothing. But if
   it has the power of producing and making, then it has understanding,
   and must be God. For that force can be called by no other name, in
   which there is both the foresight [219] to plan, and the skill and
   power to carry into effect. Therefore Seneca, the most intelligent of
   all the Stoics, says better, who saw "that nature was nothing else but
   God." Therefore he says, "Shall we not praise God, who possesses
   natural excellence?" For He did not learn it from any one. Yes, truly,
   we will praise Him; for although it is natural to Him, He gave it to
   Himself, [220] since God Himself is nature. When, therefore, you assign
   the origin of all things to nature, and take it from God, you are in
   the same difficulty:--


   "You pay your debt by borrowing, [221] Geta."

   For while simply changing the name, you clearly admit that it was made
   by the same person by whom you deny that it was made.

   There follows a most senseless comparison. "As the builder," he says,
   "when he is about to erect any building, does not himself make the
   materials, but uses those which are already prepared, and the statuary
   also the wax; so that divine providence ought to have had materials at
   hand, not of its own production, but already prepared for use." Nay
   rather it ought not; for God will have less power if He makes from
   materials already provided, which is the part of man. The builder will
   erect nothing without wood, for he cannot make the wood itself; and not
   to be able to do this is the part of human weakness. But God Himself
   makes the materials for Himself, because He has the power. For to have
   the power is the property of God; for if He is not able, He is not God.
   Man produces his works out of that which already exists, because
   through his mortality he is weak, and through his weakness his power is
   limited and moderate; but God produces His works out of that which has
   no existence, because through His eternity He is strong, and through
   His strength His power is immense, which has no end or limit, like the
   life of the Maker Himself. What wonder, then, if God, when He was about
   to make the world, first prepared the material from which to make it,
   and prepared it out of that which had no existence? Because it is
   impossible for God to borrow anything from another source, inasmuch as
   all things are in Himself and from Himself. For if there is anything
   before Him, and if anything has been made, but not by Him, He will
   therefore lose both the power and the name of God. But it may be said
   matter was never made, like God, who out of matter made this world. In
   that case, it follows that two eternal principles are established, and
   those indeed opposed to one another, which cannot happen without
   discord and destruction. For those things which have a contrary force
   and method must of necessity come into collision. In this manner it
   will be impossible that both should be eternal, if they are opposed to
   one another, because one must overpower the other. Therefore the nature
   of that which is eternal cannot be otherwise than simple, so that all
   things descended from that source as from a fountain. Therefore either
   God proceeded from matter, or matter from God. Which of these is more
   true, is easily understood. For of these two, one is endued with
   sensibility, the other is insensible. The power of making anything
   cannot exist, except in that which has sensibility, intelligence,
   reflection, and the power of motion. Nor can anything be begun, or
   made, or completed, unless it shall have been foreseen by reason how it
   shall be made before it exists, and how it shall endure [222] after it
   has been made. In short, he only makes anything who has the will to
   make it, and hands to complete that which he has willed. But that which
   is insensible always lies inactive and torpid; nothing can originate in
   that source where there is no voluntary motion. For if every animal is
   possessed of reason, it is certain that it cannot be produced from that
   which is destitute of reason, nor can that which is not present in the
   original source [223] be received from any other quarter. Nor, however,
   let it disturb any one, that certain animals appear to be born from the
   earth. For the earth does not give birth to these of itself, but the
   Spirit of God, without which nothing is produced. Therefore God did not
   arise from matter, because a being endued with sensibility can never
   spring from one that is insensible, a wise one from one that is
   irrational, one that is incapable of suffering from one that can
   suffer, an incorporeal being from a corporeal one; but matter is rather
   from God. For whatever consists of a body solid, and capable of being
   handled, admits of an external force. That which admits of force is
   capable of dissolution; that which is dissolved perishes; that which
   perishes must necessarily have had an origin; that which had an origin
   had a source [224] from which it originated, that is, some maker, who
   is intelligent, foreseeing, and skilled in making. There is one
   assuredly, and that no other than God. And since He is possessed of
   sensibility, intelligence, providence, power, and vigour, He is able to
   create and make both animated and inanimate objects, because He has the
   means of making everything. But matter cannot always have existed, for
   if it had existed it would be incapable of change. For that which
   always was, does not cease always to be; and that which had no
   beginning must of necessity be without an end. Moreover, it is easier
   for that which had a beginning to be without an end, than for that
   which had no beginning, to have an end. Therefore if matter was not
   made, nothing can be made from it. But if nothing can be made from it,
   then matter itself can have no existence. For matter is that out of
   which something is made. But everything out of which anything is made,
   inasmuch as it has received the hand of the artificer, is destroyed,
   [225] and begins to be some other thing. Therefore, since matter had an
   end, at the time when the world was made out of it, it also had a
   beginning. For that which is destroyed [226] was previously built up;
   that which is loosened was previously bound up; that which is brought
   to an end was begun. If, then, it is inferred from its change and end,
   that matter had a beginning, from whom could that beginning have been,
   except from God? God, therefore, is the only being who was not made;
   and therefore He can destroy other things, but He Himself cannot be
   destroyed. That which was in Him will always be permanent, because He
   has not been produced or sprung from any other source; nor does His
   birth depend on any other object, which being changed may cause His
   dissolution. He is of Himself, as we said in the first book; [227] and
   therefore He is such as He willed that He should be, incapable of
   suffering, unchangeable, incorruptible, blessed, and eternal.

   But now the conclusion, with which Tully finished the sentiment, is
   much more absurd. [228] "But if matter," he says, "was not made by God,
   the earth indeed, and water, and air, and fire, were not made by God."
   How skilfully he avoided the danger! For he stated the former point as
   though it required no proof, whereas it was much more uncertain than
   that on account of which the statement was made. If matter, he says,
   was not made by God, the world was not made by God. He preferred to
   draw a false inference from that which is false, than a true one from
   that which is true. And though uncertain things ought to be proved from
   those which are certain, he drew a proof from an uncertainty, to
   overthrow that which was certain. For, that the world was made by
   divine providence (not to mention Trismegistus, who proclaims this; not
   to mention the verses of the Sibyls, who make the same announcement;
   not to mention the prophets, [229] who with one impulse and with
   harmonious [230] voice bear witness that the world was made, [231] and
   that it was the workmanship of God), even the philosophers almost
   universally agree; for this is the opinion of the Pythagoreans, the
   Stoics, and the Peripatetics, who are the chief of every sect. [232] In
   short, from those first seven wise men, [233] even to Socrates and
   Plato, it was held as an acknowledged and undoubted fact; until many
   ages afterwards [234] the crazy Epicurus lived, who alone ventured to
   deny that which is most evident, doubtless through the desire of
   discovering novelties, that he might found a sect in his own name. And
   because he could find out nothing new, that he might still appear to
   disagree with the others, he wished to overthrow old opinions. But in
   this all the philosophers who snarled [235] around him, refuted him. It
   is more certain, therefore, that the world was arranged by providence,
   than that matter was collected [236] by providence. Wherefore he ought
   not to have supposed that the world was not made by divine providence,
   because its matter was not made by divine providence; but because the
   world was made by divine providence, he ought to have concluded that
   matter also was made by the Deity. For it is more credible that matter
   was made by God, because He is all-powerful, than that the world was
   not made by God, because nothing can be made without mind,
   intelligence, and design. But this is not the fault of Cicero, but of
   the sect. For when he had undertaken a disputation, by which he might
   take away the nature of the gods, respecting which philosophers prated,
   in his ignorance of the truth he imagined that the Deity must
   altogether be taken away. He was able therefore to take away the gods,
   for they had no existence. But when he attempted to overthrow the
   divine providence, which is in the one God, because he had begun to
   strive against the truth, his arguments failed, and he necessarily fell
   into this pitfall, from which he was unable to withdraw himself. Here,
   then, I hold him firmly fixed; I hold him fastened to the spot, since
   Lucilius, who disputed on the other side, was silent. Here, then, is
   the turning-point; [237] on this everything depends. Let Cotta
   disentangle himself, if he can, from this difficulty; [238] let him
   bring forward arguments by which he may prove that matter has always
   existed, which no providence made. Let him show how anything ponderous
   and heavy either could exist without an author or could be changed, and
   how that which always was ceased to be, so that that which never was
   might begin to be. And if he shall prove these things, then, and not
   till then, will I admit that the world itself was not established by
   divine providence, and yet in making this admission I shall hold him
   fast by another snare. For he will turn round again to the same point,
   to which he will be unwilling to return, so as to say that both the
   matter of which the world consists, and the world which consists of
   matter, existed by nature; though I contend that nature itself is God.
   For no one can make wonderful things, that is, things existing with the
   greatest order, except one who has intelligence, foresight, and power.
   And thus it will come to be seen that God made all things, and that
   nothing at all can exist which did not derive its origin from God.

   But the same, as often as he follows the Epicureans, [239] and does not
   admit that the world was made by God, is wont to inquire by what hands,
   by what machines, by what levers, by what contrivance, He made this
   work of such magnitude. He might see, if he could have lived at that
   time in which God made it. But, that man might not look into the works
   of God, He was unwilling to bring him into this world until all things
   were completed. But he could not be brought in: for how could he exist
   while the heaven above was being built, and the foundations of the
   earth beneath were being laid; when humid things, perchance, either
   benumbed with excessive stiffness were becoming congealed, or seethed
   with fiery heat and rendered solid were growing hard? Or how could he
   live when the sun was not yet established, and neither corn nor animals
   were produced? Therefore it was necessary that man should be last made,
   when the finishing [240] hand had now been applied to the world and to
   all other things. Finally, the sacred writings teach that man was the
   last work of God, and that he was brought into this world as into a
   house prepared and made ready; for all things were made on his account.
   The poets also acknowledge the same. Ovid, having described the
   completion of the world, and the formation of the other animals, added:
   [241] --


   "An animal more sacred than these, and more capacious of a lofty mind,
   was yet wanting, and which might exercise dominion over the rest. Man
   was produced."

   So impious must we think it to search into those things which God
   wished to be kept secret! But his inquiries were not made through a
   desire of hearing or learning, but of refuting; for he was confident
   that no one could assert that. As though, in truth, it were to be
   supposed that these things were not made by God, because it cannot be
   plainly seen in what manner they were created! If you had been brought
   up in a well-built and ornamented house, and had never seen a workshop,
   [242] would you have supposed that that house was not built by man,
   because you did not know how it was built? You would assuredly ask the
   same question about the house which you now ask about the world--by
   what hands, with what implements, man had contrived such great works;
   and especially if you should see large stones, immense blocks, [243]
   vast columns, the whole work lofty and elevated, would not these things
   appear to you to exceed the measure of human strength, because you
   would not know that these things were made not so much by strength as
   by skill and ingenuity?

   But if man, in whom nothing is perfect, nevertheless effects more by
   skill than his feeble strength would permit, what reason is there why
   it should appear to you incredible, when it is alleged that the world
   was made by God, in whom, since He is perfect, wisdom can have no
   limit, and strength no measure? His works are seen by the eyes; but how
   He made them is not seen even by the mind, because, as Hermes says, the
   mortal cannot draw nigh to (that is, approach nearer, and follow up
   with the understanding) the immortal, the temporal [244] to the
   eternal, the corruptible to the incorruptible. And on this account the
   earthly animal is as yet incapable of perceiving [245] heavenly things,
   because it is shut in and held as it were in custody by the body, so
   that it cannot discern all things with free and unrestrained
   perception. Let him know, therefore, how foolishly he acts, who
   inquires into things which are indescribable. For this is to pass the
   limits of one's own condition, and not to understand how far it is
   permitted man to approach. In short, when God revealed the truth to
   man, He wished us only to know those things which it concerned man to
   know for the attainment of life; but as to the things which related to
   a profane and eager curiosity [246] He was silent, that they might be
   secret. Why, then, do you inquire into things which you cannot know,
   and if you knew them you would not be happier. It is perfect wisdom in
   man, if he knows that there is but one God, and that all things were
   made by Him.

    Chap. X.--Of the World, and Its Parts, the Elements and Seasons.

   Now, having refuted those who entertain false sentiments respecting the
   world and God its Maker, let us return to the divine workmanship of the
   world, concerning which we are informed in the sacred [247] writings of
   our holy religion. Therefore, first of all, God made the heaven, and
   suspended it on high, that it might be the seat of God Himself, the
   Creator. Then He founded the earth, and placed it under the heaven, as
   a dwelling-place for man, with the other races of animals. He willed
   that it should be surrounded and held together by water. But He adorned
   and filled His own dwelling-place with bright lights; He decked it with
   the sun, and the shining orb of the moon, and with the glittering signs
   of the twinkling stars; but He placed on the earth the darkness, which
   is contrary to these. For of itself the earth contains no light, unless
   it receives it from the heaven, in which He placed perpetual light, and
   the gods above, and eternal life; and, on the contrary, He placed on
   the earth darkness, and the inhabitants of the lower regions, and
   death. For these things are as far removed from the former ones, as
   evil things are from good, and vices from virtues. He also established
   two parts of the earth itself opposite to one another, and of a
   different character,--namely, the east and the west; and of these the
   east is assigned to God, because He Himself is the fountain of light,
   and the enlightener [248] of all things, and because He makes us rise
   to eternal life. But the west is ascribed to that disturbed and
   depraved mind, because it conceals the light, because it always brings
   on darkness, and because it makes men die and perish in their sins. For
   as light belongs to the east, and the whole course of life depends upon
   the light, so darkness belongs to the west: but death and destruction
   are contained in darkness. [249] Then He measured out in the same way
   the other parts,--namely, the south and the north, which parts are
   closely united with the two former. For that which is more glowing with
   the warmth of the sun, is nearest to and closely united with the east;
   but that which is torpid with colds and perpetual ice belongs to the
   same division as the extreme west. For as darkness is opposed to light,
   so is cold to heat. As, therefore, heat is nearest to light, so is the
   south to the east; and as cold is nearest to darkness, so is the
   northern region to the west. And He assigned to each of these parts its
   own time,--namely, the spring to the east, the summer to the southern
   region, the autumn belongs to the west, and the winter to the north. In
   these two parts also, the southern and the northern, is contained a
   figure of life and death, because life consists in heat, death in cold.
   And as heat arises from fire, so does cold from water. And according to
   the division of these parts He also made day and night, to complete by
   alternate succession with each other the courses [250] and perpetual
   revolutions of time, which we call years. The day, which the first east
   supplies, must belong to God, as all things do, which are of a better
   character. But the night, which the extreme west brings on, belongs,
   indeed, to him whom we have said to be the rival of God.

   And even in the making of these God had regard to the future; for He
   made them so, that a representation of true religion and of false
   superstitions might be shown from these. For as the sun, which rises
   daily, although it is but one,--from which Cicero would have it appear
   that it was called Sol, [251] because the stars are obscured, and it
   alone is seen,--yet, since it is a true light, and of perfect fulness,
   and of most powerful heat, and enlightens all things with the brightest
   splendour; so God, although He is one only, is possessed of perfect
   majesty, and might, and splendour. But night, which we say is assigned
   to that depraved adversary of God, [252] shows by a resemblance the
   many and various superstitions which belong to him. For although
   innumerable stars appear to glitter and shine, [253] yet, because they
   are not full and solid lights, and send forth no heat, nor overpower
   the darkness by their multitude, therefore these two things are found
   to be of chief importance, which have power differing from and opposed
   to one another--heat and moisture, which God wonderfully designed for
   the support and production of all things. For since the power of God
   consists in heat and fire, if He had not tempered its ardour and force
   by mingling matter of moisture and cold, nothing could have been born
   or have existed, but whatever had begun to exist must immediately have
   been destroyed by conflagration. From which also some philosophers and
   poets said that the world was made up of a discordant concord; but they
   did not thoroughly understand the matter. Heraclitus said that all
   things were produced from fire; Thales of Miletus from water. Each saw
   something of the truth, and yet each was in error: for if one element
   only had existed, water could not have been produced from fire, nor, on
   the other hand, could fire from water; but it is more true that all
   things were produced from a mingling of the two. Fire, indeed, cannot
   be mixed with water, because they are opposed to each other; and if
   they came into collision, the one which proved superior must destroy
   the other. But their substances may be mingled. The substance of fire
   is heat; of water, moisture. Rightly therefore does Ovid say: [254] --


   "For when moisture and heat have become mingled, they conceive, and all
   things arise from these two. And though fire is at variance with water,
   moist vapour produces all things, and discordant concord [255] is
   adapted to production."

   For the one element is, as it were, masculine; the other, as it were,
   feminine: the one active, the other passive. And on this account it was
   appointed by the ancients that marriage contracts should be ratified by
   the solemnity [256] of fire and water, because the young of animals are
   furnished with a body by heat and moisture, and are thus animated to
   life.

   For, since every animal consists of soul [257] and body, the material
   of the body is contained in moisture, that of the soul in heat: which
   we may know from the offspring of birds; for though these are full of
   thick moisture, unless they are cherished by creative [258] heat, the
   moisture cannot become a body, nor can the body be animated with life.
   Exiles also were accustomed to be forbidden the use of fire and water:
   for as yet it seemed unlawful to inflict capital punishment on any,
   however guilty, inasmuch as they were men. When, therefore, the use of
   those things in which the life of men consists was forbidden, it was
   deemed to be equivalent to the actual infliction of death on him who
   had been thus sentenced. Of such importance were these two elements
   considered, that they believed them to be essential for the production
   of man, and for the sustaining of his life. One of these is common to
   us with the other animals, the other has been assigned to man alone.
   For we, being a heavenly and immortal race, [259] make use of fire,
   which is given to us as a proof of immortality, since fire is from
   heaven; and its nature, inasmuch as it is moveable and rises upward,
   contains the principle of life. But the other animals, inasmuch as they
   are altogether mortal, make use of water only, which is a corporeal and
   earthly element. And the nature of this, because it is moveable, and
   has a downward inclination, shows a figure of death. Therefore the
   cattle do not look up to heaven, nor do they entertain religious
   sentiments, since the use of fire is removed from them. But from what
   source or in what manner God lighted up or caused [260] to flow these
   two principal elements, fire and water, He who made them alone can
   know. [261]

    Chap. XI.--Of Living Creatures, of Man; Prometheus, Deucalion, the ParcÆ.

   Therefore, having finished the world, He commanded that animals of
   various kinds and of dissimilar forms should be created, both great and
   smaller. And they were made in pairs, that is, one of each sex; from
   the offspring of which both the air and the earth and the seas were
   filled. And God gave nourishment to all these by their kinds [262] from
   the earth, that they might be of service to men: some, for instance,
   were for food, others for clothing; but those which are of great
   strength He gave, that they might assist in cultivating the earth,
   whence they were called beasts of burthen. [263] And thus, when all
   things had been settled with a wonderful arrangement, He determined to
   prepare for Himself an eternal kingdom, and to create innumerable
   souls, on whom He might bestow immortality. Then He made for Himself a
   figure endowed with perception and intelligence, that is, after the
   likeness of His own image, than which nothing can be more perfect: He
   formed man out of the dust of the ground, from which he was called man,
   [264] because He was made from the earth. Finally, Plato says that the
   human form [265] was godlike; as does the Sibyl, who says,--


   "Thou art my image, O man, possessed of right reason." [266]

   The poets also have not given a different account respecting this
   formation of man, however they may have corrupted it; for they said
   that man was made by Prometheus from clay. They were not mistaken in
   the matter itself, but in the name of the artificer. For they had never
   come into contact with a line of the truth; but the things which were
   handed down by the oracles of the prophets, and contained in the sacred
   book [267] of God; those things collected from fables and obscure
   opinion, and distorted, as the truth is wont to be corrupted by the
   multitude when spread abroad by various conversations, everyone adding
   something to that which he had heard,-- those things they comprised in
   their poems; and in this, indeed, they acted foolishly, in that they
   attributed so wonderful and divine a work to man. For what need was
   there that man should be formed of clay, when he might be generated in
   the same way in which Prometheus himself was born from Iapetus? For if
   he was a man, he was able to beget a man, but not to make one. But his
   punishment on Mount Caucasus declares that he was not of the gods. But
   no one reckoned his father Iapetus or his uncle [268] Titan as gods,
   because the high dignity of the kingdom was in possession of Saturn
   only, by which he obtained divine honours, together with all his
   descendants. This invention of the poets admits of refutation by many
   arguments. It is agreed by all that the deluge took place for the
   destruction of wickedness, and for its removal from the earth. Now,
   both philosophers and poets, and writers of ancient history, assert the
   same, and in this they especially agree with the language of the
   prophets. If, therefore, the flood took place for the purpose of
   destroying wickedness, which had increased through the excessive
   multitude of men, how was Prometheus the maker of man, when his son
   Deucalion is said by the same writers to have been the only one who was
   preserved on account of his righteousness? How could a single descent
   [269] and a single generation have so quickly filled the world with
   men? But it is plain that they have corrupted this also, as they did
   the former account; since they were ignorant both at what time the
   flood happened on the earth, and who it was that deserved on account of
   his righteousness to be saved when the human race perished, and how and
   with whom he was saved: all of which are taught by the inspired [270]
   writings. It is plain, therefore, that the account which they give
   respecting the work of Prometheus is false.

   But because I had said [271] that the poets are not accustomed to speak
   that which is altogether untrue, but to wrap up in figures and thus to
   obscure their accounts, I do not say that they spoke falsely in this,
   but that first of all Prometheus made the image of a man of rich and
   soft clay, and that he first originated the art of making statues and
   images; inasmuch as he lived in the times of Jupiter, during which
   temples began to be built, and new modes of worshipping the gods
   introduced. And thus the truth was corrupted by falsehood; and that
   which was said to have been made by God began also to be ascribed to
   man, who imitated the divine work. But the making of the true and
   living man from clay is the work of God. And this also is related by
   Hermes, [272] who not only says that man was made by God, after the
   image of God, but he even tried to explain in how skilful a manner He
   formed each limb in the human body, since there is none of them which
   is not as available for the necessity of use as for beauty. But even
   the Stoics, when they discuss the subject of providence, attempt to do
   this; and Tully followed them in many places. But, however, he briefly
   treats of a subject so copious and fruitful, which I now pass over on
   this account, because I have lately written a particular book on this
   subject to my disciple Demetrianus. But I cannot here omit that which
   some erring philosophers say, that men and the other animals arose from
   the earth without any author; whence that expression of Virgil: [273]
   --


   "And the earth-born [274] race of men raised its head from the hard
   fields."

   And this opinion is especially entertained by those who deny the
   existence of a divine providence. For the Stoics attribute the
   formation of animals to divine skill. But Aristotle freed himself from
   labour and trouble, by saying that the world always existed, and
   therefore that the human race, and the other things which are in it,
   had no beginning, but always had been, and always would be. But when we
   see that each animal separately, which had no previous existence,
   begins to exist, and ceases to exist, it is necessary that the whole
   race must at some time have begun to exist, and must cease at some time
   because it had a beginning.

   For all things must necessarily be comprised in three periods of
   time--the past, the present, and the future. The commencement [275]
   belongs to the past, existence to the present, dissolution to the
   future. And all these things are seen in the case of men individually:
   for we begin when we are born; and we exist while we live; and we cease
   when we die. On which account they would have it that there are three
   Parcæ: [276] one who warps the web of life for men; the second, who
   weaves it; the third, who cuts and finishes it. But in the whole race
   of men, because the present time only is seen, yet from it the past
   also, that is, the commencement, and the future, that is, the
   dissolution, are inferred. For since it exists, it is evident that at
   some time it began to exist, for nothing can exist without a beginning;
   and because it had a beginning, it is evident that it will at some time
   have an end. For that cannot, as a whole, be immortal, which consists
   of mortals. For as we all die individually, it is possible that, by
   some calamity, all may perish simultaneously: either through the
   unproductiveness of the earth, which sometimes happens in particular
   cases; or through the general spread of pestilence, which often
   desolates separate cities and countries; or by the conflagration of the
   world, as is said to have happened in the case of Phaethon; or by a
   deluge, as is reported in the time of Deucalion, when the whole race
   was destroyed with the exception of one man. And if this deluge
   happened by chance, it might assuredly have happened that he who was
   the only survivor should perish. But if he was reserved by the will of
   divine providence, as it cannot be denied, to recruit mankind, it is
   evident that the life and the destruction of the human race are in the
   power of God. And if it is possible for it to die altogether, because
   it dies in parts, it is evident that it had an origin at some time; and
   as the liability to decay [277] bespeaks a beginning, so also it gives
   proof of an end. And if these things are true, Aristotle will be unable
   to maintain that the world also itself had no beginning. But if Plato
   and Epicurus extort this from Aristotle, yet Plato and Aristotle, who
   thought that the world would be everlasting, will, notwithstanding
   their eloquence, be deprived of this also by Epicurus, because it
   follows, that, as it had a beginning, it must also have an end. But we
   will speak of these things at greater length in the last book. Now let
   us revert to the origin of man.

    Chap. XII.--That Animals Were Not Produced Spontaneously, But by a Divine
    Arrangement, of Which God Would Have Given Us the Knowledge, If It Were
    Advantageous for Us to Know It.

   They say that at certain changes of the heaven, and motions of the
   stars, there existed a kind of maturity [278] for the production of
   animals; and thus that the new earth, retaining the productive seed,
   brought forth of itself certain vessels [279] after the likeness of
   wombs, respecting which Lucretius [280] says,--


   "Wombs grew attached to the earth by roots;"

   and that these, when they had become mature, being rent by the
   compulsion of nature, produced tender animals; afterwards, that the
   earth itself abounded with a kind of moisture which resembled milk, and
   that animals were supported by this nourishment. How, then, were they
   able to endure or avoid the force of the cold or of heat, or to be born
   at all, since the sun would scorch them or the cold contract them? But,
   they say, at the beginning of the world there was no winter nor summer,
   but a perpetual spring of an equable temperature. [281] Why, then, do
   we see that none of these things now happens? Because, they say, it was
   necessary that it should once happen, that animals might be born; but
   after they began to exist, and the power of generation was given to
   them, the earth ceased to bring forth, and the condition of time [282]
   was changed. Oh, how easy it is to refute falsehoods! In the first
   place, nothing can exist in this world which does not continue
   permanent, as it began. For neither were the sun and moon and stars
   then uncreated; nor, having been created, were they without their
   motions; nor did that divine government, which manages and rules their
   courses, fail to begin its exercise together with them. In the next
   place, if it is as they say, there must of necessity be a providence,
   and they fall into that very condition which they especially avoid. For
   while the animals were yet unborn, it is plain that some one provided
   that they should be born, that the world might not appear gloomy [283]
   with waste and desolation. But, that they might be produced from the
   earth without the office of parents, provision must have been made with
   great judgment; and in the next place, that the moisture condensed from
   the earth might be formed into the various figures of bodies; and also
   that, having received from the vessels with which they were covered the
   power of life and sensation, they might be poured forth, as it were,
   from the womb of mothers, is a wonderful and indescribable [284]
   provision. But let us suppose that this also happened by chance; the
   circumstances which follow assuredly cannot be by chance,--that the
   earth should at once flow with milk, and that the temperature of the
   atmosphere should be equable. And if these things plainly happened,
   that the newly born animals might have nourishment, or be free from
   danger, it must be that some one provided these things by some divine
   counsel.

   But who is able to make this provision except God? Let us, however, see
   whether the circumstance itself which they assert could have taken
   place, that men should be born from the earth. If any one considers
   during how long a time and in what manner an infant is reared, he will
   assuredly understand that those earth-born children could not possibly
   have been reared without some one to bring them up. For they must have
   lain for many months cast forth, until their sinews were strengthened,
   so that they had power to move themselves and to change their place,
   which can scarcely happen within the space of one year. Now see whether
   an infant could have lain through many months in the same manner and in
   the same place where it was cast forth, without dying, overwhelmed and
   corrupted by that moisture of the earth which it supplied for the sake
   of nourishment, and by the excrements of its own body mixed together.
   Therefore it is impossible but that it was reared by some one; unless,
   indeed, all animals are born not in a tender condition, but grown up:
   and it never came into their mind to say this. Therefore the whole of
   that method is impossible and vain; if that can be called method by
   which it is attempted that there shall be no method. For he who says
   that all things are produced of their own accord, and attributes
   nothing to divine providence, he assuredly does not assert, but
   overthrows method. But if nothing can be done or produced without
   design, it is plain that there is a divine providence, to which that
   which is called design peculiarly belongs. Therefore God, the Contriver
   of all things, made man. And even Cicero, though ignorant of the sacred
   writings, saw this, who in his treatise on the Laws, in the first book,
   [285] handed down the same thing as the prophets; and I add his words:
   "This animal, foreseeing, sagacious, various, acute, gifted with
   memory, full of method and design, which we call man, was produced by
   the supreme Deity under remarkable circumstances; for this alone of so
   many kinds and natures of animals, partakes of judgment and reflection,
   when all other animals are destitute of them." Do you see that the man,
   although far removed from the knowledge of the truth, yet, inasmuch as
   he held the image of wisdom, understood that man could not be produced
   except by God? But, however, there is need of divine [286] testimony,
   lest that of man should be insufficient. The Sibyl testifies that man
   is the work of God:--


   "He who is the only God being the invincible Creator, He Himself fixed
   [287] the figure of the form of men, He Himself mixed the nature of all
   belonging to the generation of life."

   The sacred writings contain statements to the same effect. Therefore
   God discharged the office of a true father. He Himself formed the body;
   He Himself infused the soul with which we breathe. Whatever we are, it
   is altogether His work. In what manner He effected this He would have
   taught us, if it were right for us to know; as He taught us other
   things, which have conveyed to us the knowledge both of ancient error
   and of true light.

    Chap. XIII.--Why Man is of Two Sexes; What is His First Death, and What the
    Second and of the Fault and Punishment of Our First Parents.

   When, therefore, He had first formed the male after His own likeness,
   then He also fashioned woman after the image of the man himself, that
   the two by their union might be able to perpetuate their race, and to
   fill the whole earth with a multitude. But in the making of man himself
   He concluded and completed the nature of those two materials which we
   have spoken of as contrary to each other, fire and water. For having
   made the body, He breathed into it a soul from the vital source of His
   own Spirit, which is everlasting, that it might bear the similitude of
   the world itself, which is composed of opposing elements. For he [288]
   consists of soul and body, that is, as it were, of heaven and earth:
   since the soul by which we live, has its origin, as it were, out of
   heaven from God, the body out of the earth, of the dust of which we
   have said that it was formed. Empedocles--whom you cannot tell whether
   to reckon among poets or philosophers, for he wrote in verse respecting
   the nature of things, as did Lucretius and Varro among the
   Romans--determined that there were four elements, that is, fire, air,
   water, and earth; perhaps following Trismegistus, who said that our
   bodies were composed of these four elements by God, for he said that
   they contained in themselves something of fire, something of air,
   something of water, and something of earth, and yet that they were
   neither fire, nor air, nor water, nor earth. And these things indeed
   are not false; for the nature of earth is contained in the flesh, that
   of moisture in the blood, that of air in the breath, that of fire in
   the vital heat. But neither can the blood be separated from the body,
   as moisture is from the earth; nor the vital heat from the breath, as
   fire from the air: so that of all things only two elements are found,
   the whole nature of which is included in the formation of our body.
   Man, therefore, was made from different and opposite substances, as the
   world itself was made from light and darkness, from life and death; and
   he has admonished us that these two things contend against each other
   in man: so that if the soul, which has its origin from God, gains the
   mastery, it is immortal, and lives in perpetual light; if, on the other
   hand, the body shall overpower the soul, and subject it to its
   dominion, it is in everlasting darkness and death. [289] And the force
   of this is not that it altogether annihilates [290] the souls of the
   unrighteous, but subjects them to everlasting punishment. [291]

   We term that punishment the second death, which is itself also
   perpetual, as also is immortality. We thus define the first death:
   Death is the dissolution of the nature of living beings; or thus: Death
   is the separation of body and soul. But we thus define the second
   death: Death is the suffering of eternal pain; or thus: Death is the
   condemnation of souls for their deserts to eternal punishments. This
   does not extend to the dumb cattle, whose spirits, not being composed
   of God, [292] but of the common air, are dissolved by death. Therefore
   in this union of heaven and earth, the image of which is developed
   [293] in man, those things which belong to God occupy the higher part,
   namely the soul, which has dominion over the body; but those which
   belong to the devil occupy the lower [294] part, manifestly the body:
   for this, being earthly, ought to be subject to the soul, as the earth
   is to heaven. For it is, as it were, a vessel which this heavenly
   spirit may employ as a temporary dwelling. The duties of both are--for
   the latter, which is from heaven and from God, to command; but for the
   former, which is from the earth and the devil, to obey. And this,
   indeed, did not escape the notice of a dissolute man, Sallust, [295]
   who says: "But all our power consists in the soul and body; we use the
   soul to command, the body rather to obey." It had been well if he had
   lived in accordance with his words; for he was a slave to the most
   degrading pleasures, and he destroyed the efficacy of his sentiment by
   the depravity of his life. But if the soul is fire, as we have shown,
   it ought to mount up to heaven as fire, that it may not be
   extinguished; that is, it ought to rise to the immortality which is in
   heaven. And as fire cannot burn and be kept alive unless it be
   nourished [296] by some rich fuel [297] in which it may have
   sustenance, so the fuel and food of the soul is righteousness alone, by
   which it is nourished unto life. After these things, God, having made
   man in the manner in which I have pointed out, placed him in paradise,
   [298] that is, in a most fruitful and pleasant garden, which He planted
   in the regions of the East with every kind of wood and tree, that he
   might be nourished by their various fruits; and being free from all
   labours, [299] might devote himself entirely to the service of God his
   Father.

   Then He gave to him fixed commands, by the observance of which he might
   continue immortal; or if he transgressed them, be punished with death.
   It was enjoined that he should not taste of one tree only which was in
   the midst of the garden, [300] in which He had placed the knowledge of
   good and evil. Then the accuser, envying the works of God, applied all
   his deceits and artifices to beguile [301] the man, that he might
   deprive him of immortality. And first he enticed the woman by fraud to
   take the forbidden fruit, and through her instrumentality he also
   persuaded the man himself to transgress the law of God. Therefore,
   having obtained the knowledge of good and evil, he began to be ashamed
   of his nakedness, and hid himself from the face of God, which he was
   not before accustomed to do. Then God drove out the man from the
   garden, having passed sentence upon the sinner, that he might seek
   support for himself by labour. And He surrounded [302] the garden
   itself with fire, to prevent the approach of the man until He execute
   the last judgment on earth; and having removed death, recall righteous
   men, His worshippers, to the same place; as the sacred writers teach,
   and the Erythræan Sibyl, when she says: "But they who honour the true
   God inherit everlasting life, themselves inhabiting together paradise,
   the beautiful garden, for ever." But since these are the last things,
   [303] we will treat of them in the last part of this work. Now let us
   explain those which are first. Death therefore followed man, according
   to the sentence of God, which even the Sibyl teaches in her verse,
   saying: "Man made by the very hands of God, whom the serpent
   treacherously beguiled that he might come to the fate of death, and
   receive the knowledge of good and evil." Thus the life of man became
   limited in duration; [304] but still, however, long, inasmuch as it was
   extended to a thousand [305] years. And when Varro was not ignorant of
   this, handed down as it is in the sacred writings, and spread abroad by
   the knowledge of all, he endeavoured to give reasons why the ancients
   were supposed to have lived a thousand years. For he says that among
   the Egyptians months are accounted [306] as years: so that the circuit
   of the sun through the twelve signs of the zodiac does not make a year,
   but the moon, which traverses that sign-bearing circle in the space of
   thirty days; which argument is manifestly false. For no one then
   exceeded the thousandth year. But now they who attain to the hundredth
   year, which frequently happens, undoubtedly live a thousand and two
   hundred months. And competent [307] authorities report that men are
   accustomed to reach one hundred and twenty years. [308] But because
   Varro did not know why or when the life of man was shortened, he
   himself shortened it, since he knew that it was possible for man to
   live a thousand and four hundred months.

   [288] i.e., man.

   [289] It was necessary to remove ambiguity from the heathen, to whom
   the word death conveys no such meaning. In the sacred writings the
   departure of the soul from the body is often spoken of as sleep, or
   rest. Thus Lazarus is said to sleep. 1 Thess. iv. 14, "Them that sleep
   in Jesus will God bring with Him,"--an expression of great beauty and
   propriety as applied to Christians. On the other hand, the prophets
   speak of "the shadow of death."

    Chap. XIV.--Of Noah the Inventor of Wine, Who First Had Knowledge of the
    Stars, and of the Origin of False Religions.

   But afterwards God, when He saw the earth filled with wickedness and
   crimes, determined to destroy mankind with a deluge; but, however, for
   renewing the multitude, He chose one man, who, [309] when all were
   corrupted, stood forth pre-eminent, as a remarkable example of
   righteousness. He, when six hundred years old, built an ark, as God had
   commanded him, in which he himself was saved, together with his wife
   and three sons, and as many daughters-in-law, when the water had
   covered all the loftiest mountains. Then when the earth was dry, God,
   execrating the wickedness of the former age, that the length of life
   might not again be a cause of meditating evils, gradually diminished
   the age of man by each successive generation, and placed a limit at a
   hundred and twenty years, [310] which it might not be permitted to
   exceed. But he, when he went forth from the ark, as the sacred writings
   inform us, diligently cultivated the earth, and planted a vineyard with
   his own hand. From which circumstance they are refuted who regard
   Bacchus as the author of wine. For he not only preceded Bacchus, but
   also Saturn and Uranus, by many generations. And when he had first
   taken the fruit from the vineyard, having become merry, he drank even
   to intoxication, and lay naked. And when one of his sons, whose name
   was Cham, [311] had seen this, he did not cover his father's nakedness,
   but went out and told the circumstance to his brothers also. But they,
   having taken a garment, entered with their faces turned backwards, and
   covered their father. [312] And when their father became aware of what
   had been done he disowned and sent away his son. But he went into
   exile, and settled in a part of that land which is now called Arabia;
   and that land was called from him Chanaan, and his posterity
   Chanaanites. This was the first nation which was ignorant of God, since
   its prince and founder did not receive from his father the worship of
   God, being cursed by him; [313] and thus he left to his descendants
   ignorance of the divine nature. [314]

   From this nation all the nearest people flowed as the multitude
   increased. But the descendants of his father were called Hebrews, among
   whom the religion of the true God was established. [315] But from these
   also in after times, when their number was multiplied exceedingly,
   since the small extent of their settlements could not contain them,
   then young men, either sent by their parents or of their own accord, by
   the compulsion of poverty, leaving their own lands to seek for
   themselves new settlements, were scattered in all directions, and
   filled all the islands and the whole earth; and thus being torn away
   from the stem of their sacred root, they established for themselves at
   their own discretion new customs and institutions. But they who
   occupied Egypt were the first of all who began to look up to and adore
   the heavenly bodies. And because they did not shelter themselves in
   houses on account of the quality of the atmosphere, and the heaven is
   not overspread with any clouds in that country, they observed the
   courses of the stars, and their obscurations, [316] while in their
   frequent adorations they more carefully and freely beheld them. Then
   afterwards, induced by certain prodigies, they invented monstrous
   figures of animals, that they might worship them; the authors of which
   we will presently disclose. But the others, who were scattered over the
   earth, admiring the elements of the world, began to worship the heaven,
   the sun, the earth, the sea, without any images and temples, and
   offered sacrifices to them in the open air, until in process of time
   they erected temples and statues to the most powerful kings, and
   originated the practice of honouring them with victims and odours; and
   thus wandering from the knowledge of God, they began to be heathens.
   They err, therefore, who contend that the worship of the gods was from
   the beginning of the world, and that heathenism was prior to the
   religion of God: for they think that this was discovered afterwards,
   because they are ignorant of the source and origin of the truth. Now
   let us return to the beginning of the world.

   [310] Lactantius understands the hundred and twenty years (mentioned
   Gen. vi. 3) as the limit of human life, and regards it as a mark of
   severity on God's part. But Chrysostom, Jerome, Augustine, and most
   commentators, regard it rather as a sign of God's patience and
   long-suffering, in giving them that space for repentance. And this
   appears to be confirmed by the Apostle Peter, 1 Ep. iii. 20, "When once
   the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was

   be Canaan." The curse was not uttered in a spirit of vengeance or
   impatience on account of the injury received, but by the prophetic
   impulse of the Divine Spirit. [The prophet fixes on the descendant of
   Ham, whose impiety was foreseen, and to whom it brought a curse so
   signal.]

    Chap. XV.--Of the Corruption of Angels, and the Two Kinds of Demons.

   When, therefore, the number of men had begun to increase, God in His
   forethought, lest the devil, to whom from the beginning He had given
   power over the earth, should by his subtilty either corrupt or destroy
   men, as he had done at first, sent angels for the protection and
   improvement [317] of the human race; and inasmuch as He had given these
   a free will, He enjoined them above all things not to defile themselves
   with contamination from the earth, and thus lose the dignity of their
   heavenly nature. [318] He plainly prohibited them from doing that which
   He knew that they would do, that they might entertain no hope of
   pardon. Therefore, while they abode among men, that most deceitful
   ruler [319] of the earth, by his very association, gradually enticed
   them to vices, and polluted them by intercourse with women. Then, not
   being admitted into heaven on account of the sins into which they had
   plunged themselves, they fell to the earth. Thus from angels the devil
   makes them to become his satellites and attendants. But they who were
   born from these, because they were neither angels nor men, but bearing
   a kind of mixed [320] nature, were not admitted into hell, as their
   fathers were not into heaven. Thus there came to be two kinds of
   demons; one of heaven, the other of the earth. The latter are the
   wicked [321] spirits, the authors of all the evils which are done, and
   the same devil is their prince. Whence Trismegistus calls him the ruler
   of the demons. But grammarians say that they are called demons, as
   though doemones, [322] that is, skilled and acquainted with matters:
   for they think that these are gods. They are acquainted, indeed, with
   many future events, but not all, since it is not permitted them
   entirely to know the counsel of God; and therefore they are accustomed
   to accommodate [323] their answers to ambiguous results. The poets both
   know them to be demons, and so describe them. Hesiod thus speaks:--


   "These are the demons according to the will of Zeus, Good, living on
   the earth, the guardians of mortal men."

   And this is said for this purpose, because God had sent them as
   guardians to the human race; but they themselves also, though they are
   the destroyers of men, yet wish themselves to appear as their
   guardians, that they themselves may be worshipped, and God may not be
   worshipped. The philosophers also discuss the subject of these beings.
   For Plato attempted even to explain their natures in his "Banquet;" and
   Socrates said that there was a demon continually about him, who had
   become attached to him when a boy, by whose will and direction his life
   was guided. The art also and power of the Magi altogether consists in
   the influences [324] of these; invoked by whom they deceive the sight
   of men with deceptive illusions, [325] so that they do not see those
   things which exist, and think that they see those things which do not
   exist. These contaminated and abandoned spirits, as I say, wander over
   the whole earth, and contrive a solace for their own perdition by the
   destruction of men. Therefore they fill every place with snares,
   deceits, frauds, and errors; for they cling to individuals, and occupy
   whole houses from door to door, and assume to themselves the name of
   genii; for by this word they translate demons in the Latin language.
   They consecrate these in their houses, to these they daily pour out
   [326] libations of wine, and worship the wise demons as gods of the
   earth, and as averters of those evils which they themselves cause and
   impose. And these, since spirits are without substance [327] and not to
   be grasped, insinuate themselves into the bodies of men; and secretly
   working in their inward parts, they corrupt the health, hasten
   diseases, terrify their souls with dreams, harass their minds with
   phrenzies, that by these evils they may compel men to have recourse to
   their aid.

    Chap. XVI.--That Demons Have No Power Over Those Who are Established in the
    Faith.

   And the nature of all these deceits [328] is obscure to those who are
   without the truth. For they think that those demons profit them when
   they cease to injure, whereas they have no power except to injure.
   [329] Some one may perchance say that they are therefore to be
   worshipped, that they may not injure, since they have the power to
   injure. They do indeed injure, but those only by whom they are feared,
   whom the powerful and lofty hand of God does not protect, who are
   uninitiated in the mystery [330] of truth. But they fear the righteous,
   [331] that is, the worshippers of God, adjured by whose name they
   depart [332] from the bodies of the possessed: for, being lashed by
   their words as though by scourges, they not only confess themselves to
   be demons, but even utter their own names--those which are adored in
   the temples--which they generally do in the presence of their own
   worshippers; not, it is plain, to the disgrace of religion, but [333]
   to the disgrace of their own honour, because they cannot speak falsely
   to God, by whom they are adjured, nor to the righteous, by whose voice
   they are tortured. Therefore ofttimes having uttered the greatest
   howlings, they cry out that they are beaten, and are on fire, and that
   they are just on the point of coming forth: so much power has the
   knowledge of God, and righteousness! Whom, therefore, can they injure,
   except those whom they have in their own power? In short, Hermes
   affirms that those who have known God are not only safe from the
   attacks of demons, but that they are not even bound by fate. "The only
   protection," he says, "is piety, for over a pious man neither evil
   demon nor fate has any power: for God rescues the pious man from all
   evil; for the one and only good thing among men is piety." And what
   piety is, he testifies in another place, in these words: "For piety is
   the knowledge of God." Asclepius also, his disciple, more fully
   expressed the same sentiment in that finished discourse which he wrote
   to the king. Each of them, in truth, affirms that the demons are the
   enemies and harassers of men, and on this account Trismegistus calls
   them wicked angels; so far was he from being ignorant that from
   heavenly beings they were corrupted, and began to be earthly.

    Chap. XVII.--That Astrology, Soothsaying, and Similar Arts are the Invention
    of Demons.

   These were the inventors of astrology, and soothsaying, and divination,
   and those productions which are called oracles, and necromancy, and the
   art of magic, and whatever evil practices besides these men exercise,
   either openly or in secret. Now all these things are false of
   themselves, as the Erythræan Sibyl testifies:--


   "Since all these things are erroneous,

   Which foolish men search after day by day."

   But these same authorities by their countenance [334] cause it to be
   believed that they are true. Thus they delude the credulity of men by
   lying divination, because it is not expedient for them to lay open the
   truth. These are they who taught men to make images and statues; who,
   in order that they might turn away the minds of men from the worship of
   the true God, cause the countenances of dead kings, fashioned and
   adorned with exquisite beauty, to be erected and consecrated, and
   assumed to themselves their names, as though they were assuming some
   characters. But the magicians, and those whom the people truly call
   enchanters, [335] when they practice their detestable arts, call upon
   them by their true names, those heavenly names which are read in the
   sacred writings. Moreover, these impure and wandering spirits, that
   they may throw all things into confusion, and overspread the minds of
   men with errors, interweave and mingle false things with true. For they
   themselves feigned that there are many heavenly beings, and one king of
   all, Jupiter; because there are many spirits of angels in heaven, and
   one Parent and Lord of all, God. But they have concealed the truth
   under false names, and withdrawn it from sight.

   For God, as I have shown in the beginning, [336] does not need a name,
   since He is alone; nor do the angels, inasmuch as they are immortal,
   either suffer or wish themselves to be called gods: for their one and
   only duty is to submit to the will of God, and not to do anything at
   all except at His command. For we say that the world is so governed by
   God, as a province is by its ruler; and no one would say that his
   attendants [337] are his sharers in the administration of the province,
   although business is carried on by their service. And yet these can
   effect something contrary to the commands of the ruler, through his
   ignorance; which is the result of man's condition. But that guardian of
   the world and ruler of the universe, who knows all things, from whose
   divine eyes nothing is concealed, [338] has alone with His Son the
   power over all things; nor is there anything in the angels except the
   necessity of obedience. Therefore they wish no honour to be paid to
   them, since all their honour is in God. But they who have revolted from
   the service of God, because they are enemies of the truth, and
   betrayers [339] of God attempt to claim for themselves the name and
   worship of gods; not that they desire any honour (for what honour is
   there to the lost?), nor that they may injure God, who cannot be
   injured, but that they may injure men, whom they strive to turn away
   from the worship and knowledge of the true Majesty, that they may not
   be able to obtain immortality, which they themselves have lost through
   their wickedness. Therefore they draw on darkness, and overspread the
   truth with obscurity, that men may not know their Lord and Father. And
   that they may easily entice them, they conceal themselves in the
   temples, and are close at hand at all sacrifices; and they often give
   prodigies, that men, astonished by them, may attach to images a belief
   in their divine power and influence. Hence it is that the stone was cut
   by the augur with a razor; that Juno of Veii answered that she wished
   to remove to Rome; that Fortuna Muliebris [340] announced the
   threatening danger; that the ship followed the hand of Claudia; that
   Juno when plundered, and the Locrian Proserpine, and the Milesian
   Ceres, punished the sacrilegious; that Hercules exacted vengeance from
   Appius, and Jupiter from Atinius, and Minerva from Cæsar. Hence it was
   that the serpent sent for from Epidaurus freed the city of Rome from
   pestilence. For the chief of the demons was himself carried thither in
   his own form, without any dissembling; if indeed the ambassadors who
   were sent for that purpose brought with them a serpent of immense size.

   But they especially deceive in the case of oracles, the juggleries of
   which the profane [341] cannot distinguish from the truth; and
   therefore they imagine that commands, [342] and victories, and wealth,
   and prosperous issues of affairs, are bestowed by them,--in short, that
   the state has often been freed from imminent dangers by their
   interposition; [343] which dangers they have both announced, and when
   appeased with sacrifices, have averted. But all these things are
   deceits. For since they have a presentiment [344] of the arrangements
   of God, inasmuch as they have been His ministers, they interpose
   themselves in these matters, that whatever things have been
   accomplished or are in the course of accomplishment by God, they
   themselves may especially appear to be doing or to have done; and as
   often as any advantage is hanging over any people or city, according to
   the purpose of God, either by prodigies, or dreams, or oracles, they
   promise that they will bring it to pass, if temples, honours, and
   sacrifices are given to them. And on the offering of these, when the
   necessary [345] result comes to pass, they acquire for themselves the
   greatest veneration. Hence temples are vowed, and new images
   consecrated; herds of victims are slain; and when all these things are
   done, yet the life and safety of those who have performed them are not
   the less sacrificed. But as often as dangers threaten, they profess
   that they are angry on account of some light and trifling cause; as
   Juno was with Varro, because he had placed a beautiful boy on the
   carriage [346] of Jupiter to guard the dress, and on this account the
   Roman name was almost destroyed at Cannæ. But if Juno feared a second
   Ganymede, why did the Roman youth suffer punishment? Or if the gods
   regard the leaders only, and neglect the rest of the multitude, why did
   Varro alone escape who acted thus, and why was Paulus, who was
   innocent, [347] slain? Assuredly nothing then happened to the Romans by
   "the fates of the hostile Juno," [348] when Hannibal by craft and
   valour despatched two armies of the Roman people. For Juno did not
   venture either to defend Carthage, where were her arms and chariot, or
   to injure the Romans; for


   "She had heard that sons of Troy

   Were born her Carthage to destroy." [349]

   But these are the delusions of those who, concealing themselves under
   the names of the dead, lay snares for the living. Therefore, whether
   the impending danger can be avoided, they wish it to appear that they
   averted it, having been appeased; or if it cannot be avoided, they
   contrive that it may appear to have happened through disregard [350] of
   them. Thus they acquire to themselves authority and fear from men, who
   are ignorant of them. By this subtilty and by these arts they have
   caused the knowledge of the true and only God to fail [351] among all
   nations. For, being destroyed by their own vices, they rage and use
   violence that they may destroy others. Therefore these enemies of the

    Chap. XVIII.--Of the Patience and Vengeance of God, the Worship of Demons,
    and False Religions.

   Some one will say, Why then does God permit these things to be done,
   and not apply a remedy to such disastrous errors? That evils may be at
   variance with good; that vices may be opposed to virtues; that He may
   have some whom He may punish, and others whom He may honour. For He has
   determined at the last times to pass judgment on the living and the
   dead, concerning which judgment I shall speak in the last book. He
   delays, [352] therefore, until the end of the times shall come, when He
   may pour out His wrath with heavenly power and might, as


   "Prophecies of pious seers

   Ring terror in the 'wildered ears." [353]

   But now He suffers men to err, and to be impious even towards Himself,
   just, and mild, and patient as He is. For it is impossible that He in
   whom is perfect excellence should not also be of perfect patience.
   Whence some imagine, that God is altogether free from anger, because He
   is not subject to affections, which are perturbations of the mind; for
   every animal which is liable to affections and emotions is frail. But
   this persuasion altogether takes away truth and religion. But let this
   subject of discussing the anger of God be laid aside for the present;
   because the matter is very copious, and to be more widely treated in a
   work devoted to the subject. Whoever shall have worshipped and followed
   these most wicked spirits, will neither enjoy heaven nor the light,
   which are God's; but will fall into those things which we have spoken
   of as being assigned in the distribution of things to the prince of the
   evil ones himself,--namely, into darkness, and hell, and everlasting
   punishment.

   I have shown that the religious rites of the gods are vain in a
   threefold manner: In the first place, because those images which are
   worshipped are representations of men who are dead; and that is a wrong
   and inconsistent thing, that the image of a man should be worshipped by
   the image of God, for that which worships is lower and weaker than that
   which is worshipped: then that it is an inexpiable crime to desert the
   living in order that you may serve memorials of the dead, who can
   neither give life nor light to any one, for they are themselves without
   it: and that there is no other God but one, to whose judgment and power
   every soul is subject. In the second place, that the sacred images
   themselves, to which most senseless men do service, are destitute of
   all perception, since they are earth. But who cannot understand that it
   is unlawful for an upright animal to bend itself that it may adore the
   earth? which is placed beneath our feet for this purpose, that it may
   be trodden upon, and not adored by us, who have been raised from it,
   and have received an elevated position beyond the other living
   creatures, that we may not turn ourselves again downward, nor cast this
   heavenly countenance to the earth, but may direct our eyes to that
   quarter to which the condition of their nature has directed, and that
   we may adore and worship nothing except the single deity of our only
   Creator and Father, who made man of an erect figure, that we may know
   that we are called forth to high and heavenly things. In the third
   place, because the spirits which preside over the religious rites
   themselves, being condemned and cast off by God, wallow [354] over the
   earth, who not only are unable to afford any advantage to their
   worshippers, since the power of all things is in the hands of one
   alone, but even destroy them with deadly attractions and errors; since
   this is their daily business, to involve men in darkness, that the true
   God may not be sought by them. Therefore they are not to be worshipped,
   because they lie under the sentence of God. For it is a very great
   crime to devote [355] one's self to the power of those whom, if you
   follow righteousness, you are able to excel in power, and to drive out
   and put to flight by adjuration of the divine name. But if it appears
   that these religious rites are vain in so many ways as I have shown, it
   is manifest that those who either make prayers to the dead, [356] or
   venerate the earth, or make over [357] their souls to unclean spirits,
   do not act as becomes men, and that they will suffer punishment for
   their impiety and guilt, who, rebelling against God, the Father of the
   human race, have undertaken inexpiable rites, and violated every sacred
   law.

    Chap. XIX.--Of the Worship of Images and Earthly Objects.

   Whoever, therefore, is anxious to observe the obligations to which man
   is liable, and to maintain a regard for his nature, let him raise
   himself from the ground, and, with mind lifted up, let him direct his
   eyes to heaven: let him not seek God under his feet, nor dig up from
   his footprints an object of veneration, for whatever lies beneath man
   must necessarily be inferior to man; but let him seek it aloft, let him
   seek it in the highest place: for nothing can be greater than man,
   except that which is above man. But God is greater than man: therefore
   He is above, and not below; nor is He to be sought in the lowest, but
   rather in the highest region. Wherefore it is undoubted that there is
   no religion wherever there is an image. [358] For if religion consists
   of divine things, and there is nothing divine except in heavenly
   things; it follows that images are without religion, because there can
   be nothing heavenly in that which is made from the earth. And this,
   indeed, may be plain to a wise man from the very name. [359] For
   whatever is an imitation, that must of necessity be false; nor can
   anything receive the name of a true object which counterfeits the truth
   by deception and imitation. But if all imitation is not particularly a
   serious matter, but as it were a sport and jest, then there is no
   religion in images, but a mimicry of religion. That which is true is
   therefore to be preferred to all things which are false; earthly things
   are to be trampled upon, that we may obtain heavenly things. For this
   is the state of the case, that whosoever shall prostrate his soul,
   which has its origin from heaven, to the shades [360] beneath, and the
   lowest things, must fall to that place to which he has cast himself.
   Therefore he ought to be mindful of his nature and condition, and
   always to strive and aim at things above. And whoever shall do this, he
   will be judged altogether wise, he just, he a man: he, in short, will
   be judged worthy of heaven whom his Parent will recognise not as
   abject, nor cast down to the earth after the manner of the beasts,
   [361] but rather standing and upright as He made him.

    Chap. XX.--Of Philosophy and the Truth.

   A great and difficult portion of the work which I have undertaken,
   unless I am deceived, has been completed; and the majesty of heaven
   supplying the power of speaking, we have driven away inveterate errors.
   But now a greater and more difficult contest with philosophers is
   proposed to us, the height of whose learning and eloquence, as some
   massive structure, is opposed to me. For as in the former [362] case we
   were oppressed by a multitude, and almost by the universal agreement of
   all nations, so in this subject we are oppressed by the authority of
   men excelling in every kind of praise. But who can be ignorant that
   there is more weight in a smaller number of learned men than in a
   greater number of ignorant persons? [363] But we must not despair that,
   under the guidance of God and the truth, these also may be turned aside
   from their opinion; nor do I think that they will be so obstinate as to
   deny that they behold with sound and open eyes the sun as he shines in
   his brilliancy. Only let that be true which they themselves are
   accustomed to profess, that they are possessed with the desire of
   investigation, and I shall assuredly succeed in causing them to believe
   that the truth which they have long sought for has been at length
   found, and to confess that it could not have been found by the
   abilities of man.

  Book III.

  Of the False Wisdom of Philosophers.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. I.--A Comparison of the Truth with Eloquence: Why the Philosophers Did
    Not Attain to It. Of the Simple Style of the Scriptures.

   Since it is supposed that the truth still lies hidden in
   obscurity--either through the error and ignorance of the common people,
   who are the slaves of various and foolish superstitions, or through the
   philosophers, who by the perverseness of their minds confuse rather
   than throw light upon it--I could wish that the power of eloquence had
   fallen to my lot, though not such as it was in Marcus Tullius, for that
   was extraordinary and admirable, but in some degree approaching it;
   [364] that, being supported as much by the strength of talent as it has
   weight by its own force, the truth might at length come forth, and
   having dispelled and refuted public errors, and the errors of those who
   are considered wise, might introduce among the human race a brilliant
   light. And I could wish that this were so, for two reasons: either that
   men might more readily believe the truth when adorned with
   embellishments, since they even believe falsehood, being captivated by
   the adornment of speech and the enticement of words; or, at all events,
   that the philosophers themselves might be overpowered by us, most of
   all by their own arms, in which they are accustomed to pride themselves
   and to place confidence.

   But since God has willed this to be the nature of the case, that simple
   and undisguised truth should be more clear, because it has sufficient
   ornament of itself, and on this account it is corrupted when
   embellished [365] with adornings from without, but that falsehood
   should please by means of a splendour not its own, because being
   corrupt of itself it vanishes and melts away, unless it is set off
   [366] and polished with decoration sought from another source; I bear
   it with equanimity that a moderate degree of talent has been granted to
   me. But it is not in reliance upon eloquence, but upon the truth, that
   I have undertaken this work,--a work, perhaps, too great to be
   sustained by my strength; which, however, even if I should fail, the
   truth itself will complete, with the assistance of God, whose office
   this is. For when I know that the greatest orators have often been
   overcome by pleaders of moderate ability, because the power of truth is
   so great that it defends itself even in small things by its own
   clearness: why should I imagine that it will be overwhelmed in a cause
   of the greatest importance by men who are ingenious and eloquent, as I
   admit, but who speak false things; and not that it should appear bright
   and illustrious, if not by our speech, which is very feeble, and flows
   from a slight fountain, but by its own light? Nor, if there have been
   philosophers worthy of admiration on account of their literary
   erudition, should I also yield to them the knowledge and learning of
   the truth, which no one can attain to by reflection or disputation. Nor
   do I now disparage the pursuit of those who wished to know the truth,
   because God has made the nature of man most desirous of arriving at the
   truth; but I assert and maintain this against them, that the effect did
   not follow their honest and well-directed will, because they neither
   knew what was true in itself, nor how, nor where, nor with what mind it
   is to be sought. And thus, while they desire to remedy the errors of
   men, they have become entangled in snares and the greatest errors. I
   have therefore been led to this task of refuting philosophy by the very
   order of the subject which I have undertaken.

   For since all error arises either from false religion or from wisdom,
   [367] [368] in refuting error it is necessary to overthrow both. For
   inasmuch as it has been handed down to us in the sacred writings that
   the thoughts of philosophers are foolish, this very thing is to be
   proved by fact and by arguments, that no one, induced by the honourable
   name of wisdom, or deceived by the splendour of empty eloquence, may
   prefer to give credence to human rather than to divine things. Which
   things, indeed, are related in a concise and simple manner. For it was
   not befitting that, when God was speaking to man, He should confirm His
   words by arguments, as though He would not otherwise [369] be regarded
   with confidence: but, as it was right, He spoke as the mighty Judge of
   all things, to whom it belongs not to argue, but to pronounce sentence.
   He Himself, as God, is truth. But we, since we have divine testimony
   for everything, will assuredly show by how much surer arguments truth
   may be defended, when even false things are so defended that they are
   accustomed to appear true. Wherefore there is no reason why we should
   give so much honour to philosophers as to fear their eloquence. For
   they might speak well as men of learning; but they could not speak
   truly, because they had not learned the truth from Him in whose power
   it was. Nor, indeed, shall we effect anything great in convicting them
   of ignorance, which they themselves very often confess. Since they are
   not believed in that one point alone in which alone they ought to have
   been believed, I will endeavour to show that they never spoke so truly
   as when they uttered their opinion respecting their own ignorance.

    Chap. II.--Of Philosophy, and How Vain Was Its Occupation in Setting Forth
    the Truth.

   Now, since the falsehood of superstitions [370] has been shown in the
   two former books, and the origin itself of the whole error has been set
   forth, it is the business of this book to show the emptiness and
   falsehood of philosophy also, that, all error being removed, the truth
   may be brought to light and become manifest. Let us begin, therefore,
   from the common name of philosophy, that when the head itself is
   destroyed, an easier approach may be open to us for demolishing the
   whole body; if indeed that can be called a body, the parts and members
   of which are at variance with one another, and are not united together
   by any connecting link, [371] but, as it were, dispersed and scattered,
   appear to palpitate rather than to live. Philosophy is (as the name
   indicates, and they themselves define it) the love of wisdom. By what
   argument, then, can I prove that philosophy is not wisdom, rather than
   by that derived from the meaning of the name itself? For he who devotes
   himself to wisdom is manifestly not yet wise, but devotes himself to
   the subject that he may be wise. In the other arts it appears what this
   devotedness effects, and to what it tends: for when any one by learning
   has attained to these, he is now called, not a devoted follower of the
   profession, but an artificer. But it is said it was on account of
   modesty that they called themselves devoted to wisdom, and not wise.
   Nay, in truth, Pythagoras, who first invented this name, since he had a
   little more wisdom than those of early times, who regarded themselves
   as wise, understood that it was impossible by any human study to attain
   to wisdom, and therefore that a perfect name ought not to be applied to
   an incomprehensible and imperfect subject. And, therefore, when he was
   asked what was his profession, [372] he answered that he was a
   philosopher, that is, a searcher after wisdom. If, therefore,
   philosophy searches after wisdom, it is not wisdom itself, because it
   must of necessity be one thing which searches, and another which is
   searched for; nor is the searching itself correct, because it can find
   nothing.

   But I am not prepared to concede even that philosophers are devoted to
   the pursuit of wisdom, because by that pursuit there is no attaining to
   wisdom. For if the power of finding the truth were connected [373] with
   this pursuit, and if this pursuit were a kind of road to wisdom, it
   would at length be found. But since so much time and talent have been
   wasted in the search for it, and it has not yet been gained, it is
   plain that there is no wisdom there. Therefore they who apply
   themselves to philosophy do not devote themselves to the pursuit of
   wisdom; but they themselves imagine that they do so, because they know
   not where that is which they are searching for, or of what character it
   is. Whether, therefore, they devote themselves to the pursuit of wisdom
   or not, they are not wise, because that can never be discovered which
   is either sought in an improper manner, or not sought at all. Let us
   look to this very thing, whether it is possible for anything to be
   discovered by this kind of pursuit, or nothing.

    Chap. III.--Of What Subjects Philosophy Consists, and Who Was the Chief
    Founder of the Academic Sect.

   Philosophy appears to consist of two subjects, knowledge and
   conjecture, and of nothing more. Knowledge cannot come from the
   understanding, nor be apprehended by thought; because to have knowledge
   in oneself as a peculiar property does not belong to man, but to God.
   But the nature of mortals does not receive knowledge, except that which
   comes from without. For on this account the divine intelligence has
   opened the eyes and ears and other senses in the body, that by these
   entrances knowledge might flow through to the mind. For to investigate
   or wish to know the causes of natural things,--whether the sun is as
   great as it appears to be, or is many times greater than the whole of
   this earth; also whether the moon be spherical or concave; and whether
   the stars are fixed to the heaven, or are borne with free course
   through the air; of what magnitude the heaven itself is, of what
   material it is composed; whether it is at rest and immoveable, or is
   turned round with incredible swiftness; how great is the thickness of
   the earth, or on what foundations it is poised and suspended,--to wish
   to comprehend these things, I say, by disputation and conjectures, is
   as though we should wish to discuss what we may suppose to be the
   character of a city in some very remote country, which we have never
   seen, and of which we have heard nothing more than the name. If we
   should claim to ourselves knowledge in a matter of this kind, which
   cannot be known, should we not appear to be mad, in venturing to affirm
   that in which we may be refuted? How much more are they to be judged
   mad and senseless, who imagine that they know natural things, which
   cannot be known by man! Rightly therefore did Socrates, and the
   Academics [374] who followed him, take away knowledge, which is not the
   part of a disputant, but of a diviner. It remains that there is in
   philosophy conjecture only; for that from which knowledge is absent, is
   entirely occupied by conjecture. For every one conjectures that of
   which he is ignorant. But they who discuss natural subjects, conjecture
   that they are as they discuss them. Therefore they do not know the
   truth, because knowledge is concerned with that which is certain,
   conjecture with the uncertain.

   Let us return to the example before mentioned. Come, let us conjecture
   about the state and character of that city which is unknown to us in
   all respects except in name. It is probable that it is situated on a
   plain, with walls of stone, lofty buildings, many streets, magnificent
   and highly adorned temples. Let us describe, if you please, the customs
   and deportment of the citizens. But when we shall have described these,
   another will make opposite statements; and when he also shall have
   concluded, a third will arise, and others after him; and they will make
   very different conjectures to those of ours. Which therefore of all is
   more true? Perhaps none of them. But all things have been mentioned
   which the nature of the circumstances admits, so that some one of them
   must necessarily be true. But it will not be known who has spoken the
   truth. It may possibly be that all have in some degree erred in their
   description, and that all have in some degree attained to the truth.
   Therefore we are foolish if we seek this by disputation; for some one
   may present himself who may deride our conjectures, and esteem us as
   mad, since we wish to conjecture the character of that which we do not
   know. But it is unnecessary to go in quest of remote cases, from which
   perhaps no one may come to refute us. Come, let us conjecture what is
   now going on in the forum, what in the senate-house. That also is too
   distant. Let us say what is taking place with the interposition of a
   single wall; [375] no one can know this but he who has heard or seen
   it. No one therefore ventures to say this, because he will immediately
   be refuted not by words, but by the presence of the fact itself. But
   this is the very thing which philosophers do, who discuss what is
   taking place in heaven, but think that they do that with impunity,
   because there is no one to refute their errors. But if they were to
   think that some one was about to descend who would prove them to be mad
   and false, they would never discuss those subjects at all which they
   cannot possibly know. Nor, however, is their shamelessness and audacity
   to be regarded as more successful because they are not refuted; for God
   refutes them to whom alone the truth is known, although He may seem to
   connive at their conduct, and He reckons such wisdom of men as the
   greatest folly.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [374] It is evident that the Academy took its rise from the doctrine of
   Socrates. Plato, the disciple of Socrates, founded the Academy. However
   excellent their system may appear to many, the opinion of Carneades the
   Stoic seems just, who said that "the wise man who is about to
   conjecture is about to err, for he who conjectures knows nothing." Thus
   knowledge is taken from them by themselves.--Betul.

   [375] With nothing but an inner wall between.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. IV.--That Knowledge is Taken Away by Socrates, and Conjecture by Zeno.

   Zeno and the Stoics, then, were right in repudiating conjecture. For to
   conjecture that you know that which you do not know, is not the part of
   a wise, but rather of a rash and foolish man. Therefore if nothing can
   be known, as Socrates taught, or ought to be conjectured, as Zeno
   taught, philosophy is entirely removed. Why should I say that it is not
   only overthrown by these two, who were the chiefs of philosophy, but by
   all, so that it now appears to have been long ago destroyed by its own
   arms? Philosophy has been divided into many sects; and they all
   entertain various sentiments. In which do we place the truth? It
   certainly cannot be in all. Let us point out some one; it follows that
   all the others will be without wisdom. Let us pass through them
   separately; in the same manner, whatever we shall give to one we shall
   take away from the others. For each particular sect overturns all
   others, to confirm itself and its own doctrines: nor does it allow
   wisdom to any other, lest it should confess that it is itself foolish;
   but as it takes away others, so is it taken away itself by all others.
   For they are nevertheless philosophers who accuse it of folly. Whatever
   sect you shall praise and pronounce true, that is censured by
   philosophers as false. Shall we therefore believe one which praises
   itself and its doctrine, or the many which blame the ignorance of each
   other? That must of necessity be better which is held by great numbers,
   than that which is held by one only. For no one can rightly judge
   concerning himself, as the renowned poet testifies; [376] for the
   nature of men is so arranged, that they see and distinguish the affairs
   of others better than their own. Since, therefore, all things are
   uncertain, we must either believe all or none: if we are to believe no
   one, then the wise have no existence, because while they separately
   affirm different things they think themselves wise; if all, it is
   equally true that there are no wise men, because all deny the wisdom of
   each individually. Therefore all are in this manner destroyed; and as
   those fabled sparti [377] of the poets, so these men mutually slay one
   another, so that no one remains of all; which happens on this account,
   because they have a sword, but have no shield. If, therefore, the sects
   individually are convicted of folly by the judgment of many sects, it
   follows that all are found to be vain and empty; and thus philosophy
   consumes and destroys itself. And since Arcesilas the founder of the
   Academy understood this, he collected together the mutual censures of
   all, and the confession of ignorance made by distinguished
   philosophers, and armed himself against all. Thus he established a new
   philosophy of not philosophizing. From this founder, therefore, there
   began to be two kinds of philosophy: one the old one, which claims to
   itself knowledge; the other a new one, opposed to the former, and which
   detracts from it. Between these two kinds of philosophy I see that
   there is disagreement, and as it were civil war. On which side shall we
   place wisdom, which cannot be torn asunder? [378] [379] If the nature
   of things can be known, this troop of recruits will perish; if it
   cannot, the veterans will be destroyed: if they shall be equal,
   nevertheless philosophy, the guide of all, will still perish, because
   it is divided; for nothing can be opposed to itself without its own
   destruction. But if, as I have shown, there can be no inner and
   peculiar knowledge in man on account of the frailty of the human
   condition, the party of Arcesilas prevails. But not even will this
   stand firm, because it cannot be the case that nothing at all is known.

    Chap. V.--That the Knowledge of Many Things is Necessary.

   For there are many things which nature itself, and frequent use, and
   the necessity of life, compel us to know. Accordingly you must perish,
   unless you know what things are useful for life, in order that you may
   seek them; and what are dangerous, that you may shun and avoid them.
   Moreover, there are many things which experience finds out. For the
   various courses of the sun and moon, and the motions of the stars, and
   the computation of times, have been discovered, and the nature of
   bodies, and the strength of herbs by students of medicine, and by the
   cultivators of the land the nature of soils, and signs of future rains
   and tempests have been collected. In short, there is no art which is
   not dependent on knowledge. Therefore Arcesilas ought, if he had any
   wisdom, to have distinguished the things which were capable of being
   known, and those which were incapable. But if he had done this, he
   would have reduced himself to the common herd. For the common people
   have sometimes more wisdom, because they are only so far wise as is
   necessary. And if you inquire of them whether they know anything or
   nothing, they will say that they know the things which they know, and
   will confess that they are ignorant of what they are ignorant. He was
   right, therefore, in taking away the systems of others, but he was not
   right in laying the foundations of his own. For ignorance of all things
   cannot be wisdom, the peculiar property of which is knowledge. And
   thus, when he overcame the philosophers, and taught that they knew
   nothing, he himself also lost the name of philosopher, because his
   system is to know nothing. For he who blames others because they are
   ignorant, ought himself to have knowledge; but when he knows nothing,
   what perverseness or what insolence it is, to constitute himself a
   philosopher on account of that very thing for which he takes away the
   others! For it is in their power to answer thus: If you convict us of
   knowing nothing, and therefore of being unwise because we know nothing,
   does it follow that you are not wise, because you confess that you know
   nothing? What progress, therefore, did Arcesilas make, except that,
   having despatched all the philosophers, he pierced himself also with
   the same sword?

    Chap. VI.--Of Wisdom, and the Academics, and Natural Philosophy.

   Does wisdom therefore nowhere exist? Yes, indeed, it was amongst them,
   but no one saw it. Some thought that all things could be known: these
   were manifestly not wise. Others thought that nothing could be known;
   nor indeed were these wise: the former, because they attributed too
   much to man; the latter, because they attributed too little. A limit
   was wanting to each on either side. Where, then, is wisdom? It consists
   in thinking neither that you know all things, which is the property of
   God; nor that you are ignorant of all things, which is the part of a
   beast. For it is something of a middle character which belongs to man,
   that is, knowledge united and combined with ignorance. Knowledge in us
   is from the soul, which has its origin from heaven; ignorance from the
   body, which is from the earth: whence we have something in common with
   God, and with the animal creation. Thus, since we are composed of these
   two elements, the one of which is endowed with light, the other with
   darkness, a part of knowledge is given to us, and a part of ignorance.
   Over this bridge, so to speak, we may pass without any danger of
   falling; for all those who have inclined to either side, either towards
   the left hand or the right, have fallen. But I will say how each part
   has erred. The Academics argued from obscure subjects, against the
   natural philosophers, that there was no knowledge; and satisfied with
   the examples of a few incomprehensible subjects, they embraced
   ignorance as though they had taken away the whole of knowledge, because
   they had taken it away in part. But natural philosophers, on the other
   hand, derived their argument from those things which are open, and
   inferred that all things could be known, and, satisfied with things
   which were manifest, retained knowledge; as if they had defended it
   altogether, because they had defended it in part. And thus neither the
   one saw what was clear, nor the others what was obscure; but each
   party, while they contended with the greatest ardour either to retain
   or to take away knowledge only, did not see that there would be placed
   in the middle that which might guide them to wisdom.

   But Arcesilas, who teaches that there is no knowledge, [380] when he
   was detracting from Zeno, the chief of the Stoics, that he might
   altogether overthrow philosophy on the authority of Socrates, undertook
   this opinion to affirm that nothing could be known. And thus he
   disproved the judgment of the philosophers, who had thought that the
   truth was drawn forth, [381] and found out by their talents,--namely,
   because that wisdom was mortal, and, having been instituted a few ages
   before, had now attained to its greatest increase, so that it was now
   necessarily growing old and perishing, the Academy [382] suddenly
   arose, the old age, as it were, of philosophy, which might despatch it
   now withering. And Arcesilas rightly saw that they are arrogant, or
   rather foolish, who imagine that the knowledge of the truth can be
   arrived at by conjecture. But no one can refute one speaking falsely,
   unless he who shall have previously known what is true; but Arcesilas,
   endeavouring to do this without a knowledge of the truth, introduced a
   kind of philosophy which we may call unstable or inconstant. [383] For,
   that nothing may be known, it is necessary that something be known. For
   if you know nothing at all, the very knowledge that nothing can be
   known will be taken away. Therefore he who pronounces as a sentiment
   that nothing is known, professes, as it were, some conclusion already
   arrived at and known: therefore it is possible for something to be
   known.

   Of a similar character to this is that which is accustomed to be
   proposed in the schools as an example of the kind of fallacy called
   asystaton; that some one had dreamt that he should not believe dreams.
   For if he did believe them, then it follows that he ought not to
   believe them. But if he did not believe them, then it follows that he
   ought to believe them. Thus, if nothing can be known, it is necessary
   that this fact must be known, that nothing is known. But if it is known
   that nothing can be known, the statement that nothing can be known must
   as a consequence be false. Thus there is introduced a tenet opposed to
   itself, and destructive of itself. But the evasive [384] man wished to
   take away learning from the other philosophers, that he might conceal
   it at his home. For truly he is not for taking it from himself who
   affirms anything that he may take it from others: but he does not
   succeed; for it shows itself, and betrays its plunderer. How much more
   wisely and truly he would act, if he should make an exception, and say
   that the causes and systems of heavenly things only, or natural things,
   because they are hidden, cannot be known, for there is no one to teach
   them; and ought not to be inquired into, for they cannot be found out
   by inquiry! For if he had brought forward this exception, he would both
   have admonished the natural philosophers not to search into those
   things which exceeded the limit of human reflection; and would have
   freed himself from the ill-will arising from calumny, and would
   certainly have left us something to follow. But now, since he has drawn
   us back from following others, that we may not wish to know more than
   we are capable of knowing, he has no less drawn us back from himself
   also. For who would wish to labour lest he should know anything? or to
   undertake learning of this kind that he may even lose ordinary
   knowledge? For if this learning exists, it must necessarily consist of
   knowledge; if it does not exist, who is so foolish as to think that
   that is worthy of being learned, in which either nothing is learned, or
   something is even unlearned? Wherefore, if all things cannot be known,
   as the natural philosophers thought, nor nothing, as the Academics
   taught, philosophy is altogether extinguished.

    Chap. VII.--Of Moral Philosophy, and the Chief Good.

   Let us now pass to the other part of philosophy, which they themselves
   call moral, in which is contained the method of the whole of
   philosophy, since in natural philosophy there is only delight, in this
   there is utility also. And since it is more dangerous to commit a fault
   in arranging the condition of life and in forming the character,
   greater diligence must be used, that we may know how we ought to live.
   For in the former subject [385] some indulgence may be granted: for
   whether they say anything, they bestow no advantage; or if they
   foolishly rave, they do no injury. But in this subject there is no room
   for difference of opinion, none for error. All must entertain the same
   sentiments, and philosophy itself must give instructions as it were
   with one mouth; because if any error shall be committed, life is
   altogether overthrown. In that former part, as there is less danger, so
   there is more difficulty; because the obscurity of the subject compels
   us to entertain different and various opinions. But in this, as there
   is more danger, so there is less difficulty; because the very use of
   the subjects and daily experiments are able to teach what is truer and
   better. Let us see, therefore, whether they agree, or what assistance
   they give us for the better guidance of life. It is not necessary to
   enlarge on every point; let us select one, and especially that which is
   the chief and principal thing, in which the whole of wisdom centres and
   depends. [386] Epicurus deems that the chief good consists in pleasure
   of mind, Aristippus in pleasure of the body. Callipho and Dinomachus
   united virtue with pleasure, Diodorus with the privation of pain,
   Hieronymus placed the chief good in the absence of pain; the
   Peripatetics, again, in the goods of the mind, the body, and fortune.
   The chief good of Herillus is knowledge; that of Zeno, to live
   agreeably to nature; that of certain Stoics, to follow virtue.
   Aristotle placed the chief good in integrity and virtue. These are the
   sentiments of nearly all. In such a difference of opinions, whom do we
   follow? whom do we believe? All are of equal authority. If we are able
   to select that which is better, it follows that philosophy is not
   necessary for us; because we are already wise, inasmuch as we judge
   respecting the opinions of the wise. But since we come for the sake of
   learning wisdom, how can we judge, who have not yet begun to be wise?
   especially when the Academic is close at hand, to draw us back by the
   cloak, and forbid us to believe any one, without bringing forward that
   which we may follow.

    Chap. VIII.--Of the Chief Good, and the Pleasures of the Soul and Body, and
    of Virtue.

   What then remains, but that we leave raving and obstinate wranglers,
   and come to the judge, who is in truth the giver of simple and calm
   wisdom? which is able not only to mould us, and lead us into the way,
   but also to pass an opinion on the controversies of those men. This
   teaches us what is the true and highest good of man; but before I begin
   to speak on this subject, all those opinions must be refuted, that it
   may appear that no one of those philosophers was wise. Since the
   inquiry is respecting the duty of man, the chief good of the chief
   animal ought to be placed in that which it cannot have in common with
   the other animals. But as teeth are the peculiar property of wild
   beasts, horns of cattle, and wings of birds, so something peculiar to
   himself ought to be attributed to man, without which he would lose the
   fixed [387] order of his condition. For that which is given to all for
   the purpose of life or generation, is indeed a natural good; but still
   it is not the greatest, unless it be peculiar to each class. Therefore
   he was not a wise man who believed that pleasure of the mind is the
   chief good, since that, whether it be freedom from anxiety or joy, is
   common to all. I do not consider Aristippus even worthy of an answer;
   for since he is always rushing into pleasures of the body, and is only
   the slave of sensual indulgences, no one can regard him as a man: for
   he lived in such a manner that there was no difference between him and
   a brute, except this only, that he had the faculty of speech. But if
   the power of speaking were given to the ass, or the dog, or swine, and
   you were to inquire from these why they so furiously pursue the
   females, that they can scarcely be separated from them, and even
   neglect their food and I drink; why they either drive away other males,
   or do not abstain from the pursuit even when vanquished, but often,
   when bruised by stronger animals, they are more determined in their
   pursuit; why they dread neither rain nor cold; why they undertake
   labour, and do not shrink from danger;--what other answer will they
   give, but that the chief good is bodily pleasure?--that they eagerly
   seek it, in order that they may be affected with the most agreeable
   sensations; and that these are of so much importance, that, for the
   sake of attaining them, they imagine that no labour, nor wounds, nor
   death itself, ought to be refused by them? Shall we then seek precepts
   of living from these men, who have no other feelings than those of the
   irrational creatures?

   The Cyrenaics say that virtue itself is to be praised on this account,
   because it is productive of pleasure. True, says the filthy dog, or the
   swine wallowing in the mire. [388] For it is on this account that I
   contend with my adversary with the utmost exertion of strength, that my
   valour may procure for me pleasure; of which I must necessarily be
   deprived if I shall come off vanquished. Shall we therefore learn
   wisdom from these men, who differ from cattle and the brutes, not in
   feeling, but in language? To regard the absence of pain as the chief
   good, is not indeed the part of Peripatetic and Stoic, but of clinical
   philosophers. For who would not imagine that the discussion was carried
   on by those who were ill, and under the influence of some pain? What is
   so ridiculous, as to esteem that the chief good which the physician is
   able to give? We must therefore feel pain in order that we may enjoy
   good; and that, too, severely and frequently, that afterwards the
   absence of pain may be attended with greater pleasure. He is therefore
   most wretched who has never felt pain, because he is without that which
   is good; whereas we used to regard him as most happy, because he was
   without evil. He was not far distant from this folly, who said that the
   entire absence of pain was the chief good. For, besides the fact that
   every animal avoids pain, who can bestow upon himself that good,
   towards the obtaining of which we can do no more than wish? But the
   chief good cannot make any one happy, unless it shall be always in his
   power; and it is not virtue, nor learning, nor labour, which affords
   this to man, but nature herself bestows it upon all living creatures.
   They who joined pleasure with virtuous principle, wished to avoid this
   common blending together of all, but they made a contradictory kind of
   good; since he who is abandoned to pleasure must of necessity be
   destitute of virtuous principle, and he who aims at principle must be
   destitute of pleasure.

   The chief good of the Peripatetics may possibly appear excessive,
   various, and--excepting those goods which belong to the mind, and what
   they are is a great subject of dispute--common to man with the beasts.
   For goods belonging to the body--that is, safety, freedom from pain,
   health--are no less necessary for dumb creatures than for man; and I
   know not if they are not more necessary for them, because man can be
   relieved by remedies and services, the dumb animals cannot. The same is
   true of those which they call the goods of fortune; for as man has need
   of resources for the support of life, so have they [389] need of prey
   and pasture. Thus, by introducing a good which is not within the power
   of man, they made man altogether subject to the power of another. Let
   us also hear Zeno, for he at times dreams of virtue. The chief good, he
   says, is to live in accordance with nature. Therefore we must live
   after the manner of the brutes. For in these are found all the things
   which ought to be absent from man: they are eager for pleasures, they
   fear, they deceive, they lie in wait, they kill; and that which is
   especially to the point, they have no knowledge of God. Why, therefore,
   does he teach me to live according to nature, which is of itself prone
   to a worse course, and under the influence of some more soothing
   blandishments plunges headlong into vices? Or if he says that the
   nature of brutes is different from the nature of man, because man is
   born to virtue, he says something to the purpose; but, however, it will
   not be a definition of the chief good, because there is no animal which
   does not live in accordance with its nature.

   He who made knowledge the chief good, gave something peculiar to man;
   but men desire knowledge for the sake of something else, and not for
   its own sake. For who is contented with knowing, without seeking some
   advantage from his knowledge? The arts are learned for the purpose of
   being put into exercise; but they are exercised either for the support
   of life, or pleasure, or for glory. That, therefore, is not the chief
   good which is not sought for on its own account. What difference,
   therefore, does it make, whether we consider knowledge to be the chief
   good, or those very things which knowledge produces from itself, that
   is, means of subsistence, glory, pleasure? And these things are not
   peculiar to man, and therefore they are not the chief goods; for the
   desire of pleasure and of food does not exist in man alone, but also in
   the brutes. How is it with regard to the desire of glory? Is it not
   discovered in horses, since they exult in victory, and are grieved when
   vanquished? "So great is their love of praises, so great is their
   eagerness for victory." [390] Nor without reason does that most
   excellent poet say that we must try "what grief they feel when
   overcome, and how they rejoice in victory." But if those things which
   knowledge produces are common to man with other animals, it follows
   that knowledge is not the chief good. Moreover, it is no slight fault
   of this definition that bare knowledge is set forth. For all will begin
   to appear happy who shall have the knowledge of any art, even those who
   shall know mischievous subjects; so that he who shall have learned to
   mix poisons, is as happy as he who has learned to apply remedies. I
   ask, therefore, to what subject knowledge is to be referred. If to the
   causes of natural things, what happiness will be proposed to me, if I
   shall know the sources of the Nile, or the vain dreams of the natural
   philosophers respecting the heaven? Why should I mention that on these
   subjects there is no knowledge, but mere conjecture, which varies
   according to the abilities of men? It only remains that the knowledge
   of good and evil things is the chief good. Why, then, did he call
   knowledge the chief good more than wisdom, when both words have the
   same signification and meaning? But no one has yet said that the chief
   good is wisdom, though this might more properly have been said. For
   knowledge is insufficient for the undertaking of that which is good and
   avoiding that which is evil, unless virtue also is added. For many of
   the philosophers, though they discussed the nature of good and evil
   things, yet from the compulsion of nature lived in a manner different
   from their discourse, because they were without virtue. But virtue
   united with knowledge is wisdom.

   It remains that we refute those also who judged virtue itself to be the
   chief good, and Marcus Tullius was also of this opinion; and in this
   they were very inconsiderate. [391] For virtue itself is not the chief
   good, but it is the contriver and mother of the chief good; for this
   cannot be attained without virtue. Each point is easily understood. For
   I ask whether they imagine that it is easy to arrive at that
   distinguished good, or that it is reached only with difficulty and
   labour? Let them apply their ingenuity, and defend error. If it is
   easily attained to, and without labour, it cannot be the chief good.
   For why should we torment ourselves, why wear ourselves out with
   striving day and night, seeing that the object of our pursuit is so
   close at hand, that any one who wishes may grasp it without any effort
   of the mind? But if we do not attain even to a common and moderate good
   except by labour, since good things are by their nature arduous and
   difficult, [392] whereas evil things have a downward tendency, it
   follows that the greatest labour is necessary for the attainment of the
   greatest good. And if this is most true, then there is need of another
   virtue, that we may arrive at that virtue which is called the chief
   good; but this is incongruous and absurd, that virtue should arrive at
   itself by means of itself. If no good can be reached unless by labour,
   it is evident that it is virtue by which it is reached, since the force
   and office of virtue consist in the undertaking and carrying through of
   labours. Therefore the chief good cannot be that by which it is
   necessary to arrive at another. But they, since they were ignorant of
   the effects and tendency of virtue, and could discover nothing more
   honourable, stopped at the very name of virtue, and said that it ought
   to be sought, though no advantage was proposed from it; and thus they
   fixed for themselves a good which itself stood in need of a good. From
   these Aristotle was not far removed, who thought that virtue together
   with honour was the chief good; as though it were possible for any
   virtue to exist unless it were honourable, and as though it would not
   cease to be virtue if it had any measure of disgrace. But he saw that
   it might happen that a bad opinion is entertained respecting virtue by
   a depraved judgment, and therefore he thought that deference should be
   paid to what in the estimation of men constitutes a departure from what
   is right and good, because it is not in our power that virtue should be
   honoured simply for its own deserts. For what is honourable [393]
   character, except perpetual honour, conferred on any one by the
   favourable report of the people? What, then, will happen, if through
   the error and perverseness of men a bad reputation should ensue? Shall
   we cast aside virtue because it is judged to be base and disgraceful by
   the foolish? And since it is capable of being oppressed and harassed,
   in order that it may be of itself a peculiar and lasting good, it ought
   to stand in need of no outward assistance, so as not to depend by
   itself upon its own strength, and to remain stedfast. And thus no good
   is to be hoped by it from man, nor is any evil to be refused.

    Chap. IX.--Of the Chief Good, and the Worship of the True God, and a
    Refutation of Anaxagoras.

   I now come to the chief good of true wisdom, the nature of which is to
   be determined in this manner: first, it must be the property of man
   alone, and not belong to any other animal; secondly, it must belong to
   the soul only, and not be shared with the body; lastly, it cannot fall
   to the lot of any one without knowledge and virtue. Now this limitation
   excludes and does away with all the opinions of those whom I have
   mentioned; for their sayings contain nothing of this kind. I will now
   say what this is, that I may show, as I designed, that all philosophers
   were blind and foolish, who could neither see, nor understand, nor
   surmise at any time what was fixed as the chief good for man.
   Anaxagoras, when asked for what purpose he was born, replied that he
   might look upon the heaven and the sun. This expression is admired by
   all, and judged worthy of a philosopher. But I think that he, being
   unprepared with an answer, uttered this at random, that he might [394]
   not be silent. But if he had been wise, he ought to have considered and
   reflected with himself; for if any one is ignorant of his own
   condition, he cannot even he a man. But let us imagine that the saying
   was not uttered on the spur of the moment. Let us see how many and what
   great errors he committed in three words. First, he erred in placing
   the whole duty of man in the eyes alone, referring nothing to the mind,
   but everything to the body. But if he had been blind, would he lose the
   duty of a man, which cannot happen without the ruin [395] of the soul?
   What of the other parts of the body? Will they be destitute, each of
   its own duty? Why should I say that more depends upon the ears than
   upon the eye, since learning and wisdom can be gained by the ears only,
   but not by the eyes only? Were you born for the sake of seeing the
   heaven and the sun? Who introduced you to this [396] sight? or what
   does your vision contribute to the heaven and the nature of things?
   Doubtless that you may praise this immense and wonderful work.
   Therefore confess that God is the Creator of all things, who introduced
   you into this world, as a witness and praiser of His great work. You
   believe that it is a great thing to behold the heaven and the sun: why,
   therefore, do you not give thanks to Him who is the author of this
   benefit? why do you not measure with your mind the excellence, the
   providence, and the power of Him whose works you admire? For it must
   be, that He who created objects worthy of admiration, is Himself much
   more to be admired. If any one had invited you to dinner, and you had
   been well entertained, should you appear in your senses, if you
   esteemed the mere pleasure more highly than the author of the pleasure?
   So entirely do philosophers refer all things to the body, and nothing
   at all to the mind, nor do they see beyond that which fails under their
   eyes. [397] But all the offices of the body being put aside, the
   business of man is to be placed in the mind alone. Therefore we are not
   born for this purpose, that we may see those things which are created,
   but that we may contemplate, that is, behold with our mind, the Creator
   of all things Himself. Wherefore, if any one should ask a man who is
   truly wise for what purpose he was born, he will answer without fear or
   hesitation, that he was born for the purpose of worshipping God, who
   brought us into being for his cause, that we may serve Him. But to
   serve God is nothing else than to maintain and preserve justice by good
   works. But he, as a man ignorant of divine things, reduced a matter of
   the greatest magnitude to the least, by selecting two things only,
   which he said were to be beheld by him. But if he had said that he was
   born to behold the world, although he would comprise all things in
   this, and would use an expression of greater [398] sound, yet he would
   not have completed the duty of man; for as much as the soul excels the
   body, so much does God excel the world, for God made and governs the
   world. Therefore it is not the world which is to be contemplated by the
   eye, for each is a body; [399] but it is God who is to be contemplated
   by the soul: for God, being Himself immortal, willed that the soul also
   should be everlasting. But the contemplation of God is the reverence
   and worship of the common Parent of mankind. And if the philosophers
   were destitute of this, and in their ignorance of divine things
   prostrated themselves to the earth, we must suppose that Anaxagoras
   neither beheld the heaven nor the sun, though he said that he was born
   that he might behold them. The object proposed to man is therefore
   plain [400] and easy, if he is wise; and to it especially belongs
   humanity. [401] For what is humanity itself, but justice? what is
   justice, but piety? And piety [402] is nothing else than the
   recognition of God as a parent.

    Chap. X.--It is the Peculiar Property of Man to Know and Worship God.

   Therefore the chief good of man is in religion only; for the other
   things, even those which are supposed to be peculiar to man, are found
   in the other animals also. For when they discern and distinguish their
   own voices [403] by peculiar marks among themselves, they seem to
   converse: they also appear to have a kind of smile, when with soothed
   ears, and contracted mouth, and with eyes relaxed to sportiveness, they
   fawn upon man, or upon their own mates and young. Do they not give a
   greeting which bears some resemblance to mutual love and indulgence?
   Again, those creatures which look forward to the future and lay up for
   themselves food, plainly have foresight. Indications of reason are also
   found in many of them. For since they desire things useful to
   themselves, guard against evils, avoid dangers, prepare for themselves
   lurking-places standing open in different places with various outlets,
   assuredly they have some understanding. Can any one deny that they are
   possessed of reason, since they often deceive man himself? For those
   which have the office of producing honey, when they inhabit the place
   assigned to them, fortify a camp, construct dwellings with unspeakable
   skill, and obey their king; I know not if there is not in them perfect
   prudence. It is therefore uncertain whether those things which are
   given to man are common to him with other living creatures: they are
   certainly without religion. I indeed thus judge, that reason is given
   to all animals, but to the dumb creatures only for the protection of
   life, to man also for its prolongation. And because reason itself is
   perfect in man, it is named wisdom, which renders man distinguished in
   this respect, that to him alone it is given to comprehend divine
   things. And concerning this the opinion of Cicero is true: "Of so many
   kinds of animals," he says, "there is none except man which has any
   knowledge of God; and among men themselves, there is no nation either
   so uncivilized or so savage, which, even if it is ignorant of due
   conceptions of the Deity, does not know that some conception of Him
   ought to be entertained." From which it is effected, that he
   acknowledges God, who, as it were, calls to mind the source from which
   he is sprung. Those philosophers, therefore, who wish to free the mind
   from all fear, take away even religion, and thus deprive man of his
   peculiar and surpassing good, which is distinct from living uprightly,
   and from everything connected with man, because God, who made all
   living creatures subject to man, also made man subject to Himself. What
   reason is there why they should also maintain that the mind is to be
   turned in the same direction to which the countenance is raised? For if
   we must look to the heaven, it is undoubtedly for no other reason than
   on account of religion; if religion is taken away, we have nothing to
   do with the heaven. Therefore we must either look in that direction or
   bend down to the earth. We are not able to bend down to the earth, even
   if we should wish, since our posture is upright. We must therefore look
   up to the heaven, to which the nature of the body calls us. And if it
   is admitted that this must be done, it must either be done with this
   view, that we may devote ourselves to religion, or that we may know the
   nature of the heavenly objects. But we cannot by any means know the
   nature of the heavenly objects, because nothing of that kind can be
   found out by reflection, as I have before shown. We must therefore
   devote ourselves to religion, and he who does not undertake this
   prostrates himself to the ground, and, imitating the life of the
   brutes, abdicates the office of man. Therefore the ignorant are more
   wise; for although they err in choosing religion, yet they remember
   their own nature and condition.

    Chap. XI.--Of Religion, Wisdom, and the Chief Good.

   It is agreed upon, therefore, by the general consent of all mankind,
   that religion ought to be undertaken; but we have to explain what
   errors are committed on this subject. God willed this to be the nature
   of man, that he should be desirous and eager for two things, religion
   and wisdom. But men are mistaken in this, that they either undertake
   religion and pay no attention to wisdom, or they devote themselves to
   wisdom alone, and pay no attention to religion, though the one cannot
   be true without the other. The consequence is, that they fall into a
   multiplicity of religions, but false ones, because they have left
   wisdom, which could have taught them that there cannot be many gods; or
   they devote themselves to wisdom, but a false wisdom, because they have
   paid no attention to the religion of the Supreme God, who might have
   instructed them to the knowledge of the truth. Thus men who undertake
   either of these courses follow a devious path, and one full of the
   greatest errors, inasmuch as the duty of man, and all truth, are
   included in these two things which are inseparably connected. I wonder,
   therefore, that there was none at all of the philosophers who
   discovered the abode and dwelling-place of the chief good. For they
   might have sought it in this manner. Whatever the greatest good is, it
   must be an object proposed to all men. There is pleasure, which is
   desired by all; but this is common also to man with the beasts, and has
   not the force of the honourable, and brings a feeling of satiety, and
   when it is in excess is injurious, and it is lessened by advance of
   age, and does not fall to the lot of many: for they who are without
   resources, who constitute the greater part of men, must also be without
   pleasure. Therefore pleasure is not the chief good; but it is not even
   a good. What shall we say of riches? This is much more [404] true of
   them. For they fall to the lot of fewer men, and that generally by
   chance; and they often fall to the indolent, and sometimes by guilt,
   and they are desired by those who already possess them. What shall we
   say of sovereignty itself? That does not constitute the chief good: for
   all cannot reign, but it is necessary that all should be capable of
   attaining the chief good.

   Let us therefore seek something which is held forth to all. Is it
   virtue? It cannot be denied that virtue is a good, and undoubtedly a
   good for all men. But if it cannot be happy because its power and
   nature consist in the endurance of evil, it assuredly is not the chief
   good. Let us seek something else. But nothing can be found more
   beautiful than virtue, nothing more worthy of a wise man. For if vices
   are to be avoided on account of their deformity, virtue is therefore to
   be desired on account of its beauty. What then? Can it be that that
   which is admitted to be good and honourable should be requited with no
   reward, and be so unproductive as to procure no advantage from itself?
   That great labour and difficulty and struggling against evils with
   which this life is filled, must of necessity produce some great good.
   But what shall we say that it is? Pleasure? But nothing that is base
   can arise from that which is honourable. Shall we say that it is
   riches? or commands? But these things are frail and uncertain. [405] Is
   it glory? or honour? or a lasting name? But all these things are not
   contained in virtue itself, but depend upon the opinion and judgment of
   others. For virtue is often hated and visited with evil. But the good
   which arises from it ought to be so closely united with it as to be
   incapable of being separated or disunited from it; and it cannot appear
   to be the chief good in any other way than if it belongs peculiarly to
   virtue, and is such that nothing can be added to it or taken from it.
   Why should I say that the duties of virtue consist in the despising of
   all these things? For not to long for, or desire, or love pleasures,
   riches, dominions, and honours, and all those things which are esteemed
   as goods, as others do overpowered by desire, that assuredly is virtue.
   Therefore it effects something else more sublime and excellent; nor
   does anything struggle against these present goods but that which longs
   for greater and truer things. Let us not despair of being able to find
   it, if we turn our thoughts in all directions; for no slight or
   trifling rewards are sought.

    Chap. XII.--Of the Twofold Conflict of Body and Soul; And of Desiring Virtue
    on Account of Eternal Life.

   But our inquiry is as to the object for which we are born: and thus we
   are able to trace out what is the effect of virtue. There are two [406]
   parts of which man is made up, soul and body. There are many things
   peculiar to the soul, many peculiar to the body, many common to both,
   as is virtue itself; and as often as this is referred to the body, it
   is called fortitude for the sake of distinction. Since, therefore,
   fortitude is connected with each, a contest is proposed to each, and
   victory held forth to each from the contest: the body, because it is
   solid, and capable of being grasped, must contend with objects which
   are solid and can be grasped; but the soul, on the other hand, because
   it is slight [407] and subtle, and invisible, contends with those
   enemies who cannot be seen and touched. But what are the enemies of the
   soul, but lusts, vices, and sins? And if virtue shall have overcome and
   put to flight these, the soul will be pure and free from stain. Whence,
   then, are we able to collect what are the effects of fortitude of soul?
   Doubtless from that which is closely connected with it, and resembles
   it, that is, from fortitude of the body; for when this has come to any
   encounter and contest, what else does it seek from victory but life?
   For whether you contend with a man or beast, the contest is for safety.
   Therefore, as the body obtains by victory its preservation from
   destruction, so the soul obtains a continuation of its existence; and
   as the body, when overcome by its enemies, suffers death, so the soul,
   when overpowered by vices, must die. What difference, therefore, will
   there be between the contest carried on by the soul and that carried on
   by the body, except that the body seeks for temporal, but the soul
   eternal life? If, therefore, virtue is not happy by itself, since its
   whole force consists, as I have said, in the enduring of evils; if it
   neglects all things which are desired as goods; if in its highest
   condition it is exposed to death, inasmuch as it often refuses life,
   which is desired by others, and bravely undergoes death, which others
   fear; if it must necessarily produce some great good from itself,
   because labours, endured and overcome even until death, cannot fail of
   obtaining a reward; if no reward, such as it deserves, is found on
   earth, inasmuch as it despises all things which are frail and
   transitory, what else remains but that it may effect some heavenly
   reward, since it treats with contempt all earthly things, and may aim
   at higher things, since it despises things that are humble? And this
   reward can be nothing else but immortality.

   With good reason, therefore, did Euclid, no obscure philosopher, who
   was the founder of the system of the Megareans, differing from the
   others, say that that was the chief good which was unvarying and always
   the same. He certainly understood what is the nature of the chief good,
   although he did not explain in what it consisted; but it consists of
   immortality, nor anything else at all, inasmuch as it alone is
   incapable of diminution, or increase, or change. Seneca also
   unconsciously happened to confess that there is no other reward of
   virtue than immortality. For in praising virtue in the treatise which
   he wrote on the subject of premature death, he says: "Virtue is the
   only thing which can confer upon us immortality, and make us equal to
   the gods." But the Stoics also, whom he followed, say that no one can
   be made happy without virtue. Therefore, the reward of virtue is a
   happy life, if virtue, as it is rightly said, makes a happy life.
   Virtue, therefore, is not, as they say, to be sought on its own
   account, but on account of a happy life, which necessarily follows
   virtue. And this argument might have taught them in what the chief good
   consisted. But this present and corporeal life cannot be happy, because
   it is subjected to evils through the body. Epicurus calls God happy and
   incorruptible, because He is everlasting. For a state of happiness
   ought to be perfect, so that there may be nothing which can harass, or
   lessen, or change it. Nor can anything be judged happy in other
   respects, unless it be incorruptible. But nothing is incorruptible but
   that which is immortal. Immortality therefore is alone happy, because
   it can neither be corrupted nor destroyed. But if virtue falls within
   the power of man, which no one can deny, happiness also belongs to him.
   For it is impossible for a man to be wretched who is endued with
   virtue. If happiness falls within his power, then immortality, which is
   possessed of the attribute of happiness, also belongs to him.

   The chief good, therefore, is found to be immortality alone, which
   pertains to no other animal or body; nor can it happen to any one
   without the virtue of knowledge, that is, without the knowledge of God
   and justice. And how true and right is the seeking for this, the very
   desire of this life shows: for although it be but temporary, and most
   full of labour, yet it is sought and desired by all; for both old men
   and boys, kings and those of the lowest station, in fine, wise as well
   as foolish, desire this. Of such value, as it seemed to Anaxagoras, is
   the contemplation of the heaven and the light itself, that men
   willingly undergo any miseries on this account. Since, therefore, this
   short and laborious life, by the general consent not only of men, but
   also of other animals, is considered a great good, it is manifest that
   it becomes also a very great and perfect good if it is without an end
   and free from all evil. In short, there never would have been any one
   who would despise this life, however short it is, or undergo death,
   unless through the hope of a longer life. For those who voluntarily
   offered themselves to death for the safety of their countrymen, as
   Menoeceus did at Thebes, Codrus at Athens, Curtius and the two Mures at
   Rome, would never have preferred death to the advantages of life,
   unless they had thought that they should attain to immortality through
   the estimation of their countrymen; and although they were ignorant of
   the life of immortality, yet the reality itself did not escape their
   notice. For if virtue despises opulence and riches because they are
   frail, and pleasures because they are of brief continuance, it
   therefore despises a life which is frail and brief, that it may obtain
   one which is substantial and lasting. Therefore reflection itself,
   advancing by regular order, and weighing everything, leads us to that
   excellent and surpassing good, on account of which we are born. And if
   philosophers had thus acted, if they had not preferred obstinately to
   maintain that which they had once apprehended, they would undoubtedly
   have arrived at this truth, as I have lately shown. And if this was not
   the part of those who extinguish the heavenly souls together with the
   body, yet those who discuss the immortality of the soul ought to have
   understood that virtue is set before us on this account, that, lusts
   having been subdued, and the desire of earthly things overcome, our
   souls, pure and victorious, may return to God, that is, to their
   original source. For it is on this account that we alone of living
   creatures are raised to the sight of the heaven, that we may believe
   that our chief good is in the highest place. Therefore we alone receive
   religion, that we may know from this source that the spirit of man is
   not mortal, since it longs for and acknowledges God, who is immortal.

   Therefore, of all the philosophers, those who have embraced either
   knowledge or virtue as the chief good, have kept the way of truth, but
   have not arrived at perfection. For these are the two things which
   together make up that which is sought for. Knowledge causes us to know
   by what means and to what end we must attain; virtue causes us to
   attain to it. The one without the other is of no avail; for from
   knowledge arises virtue, and from virtue the chief good is produced.
   Therefore a happy life, which philosophers have always sought, and
   still do seek, has no existence either in the worship of the gods or in
   philosophy; and on this account they were unable to find it, because
   they did not seek the highest good in the highest place, but in the
   lowest. For what is the highest but heaven, and God, from whom the soul
   has its origin? And what is the lowest but the earth, from which the
   body is made? Therefore, although some philosophers have assigned the
   chief good, not to the body, but to the soul, yet, inasmuch as they
   have referred it to this life, which has its ending with the body, they
   have gone back to the body, to which the whole of this time which is
   passed on earth has reference. Therefore it was not without reason that
   they did not attain to the highest good; for whatever looks to the body
   only, and is without immortality, must necessarily be the lowest.
   Therefore happiness does not fall to the condition of man in that
   manner in which philosophers thought; but it so falls to him, not that
   he should then be happy, when he lives in the body, which must
   undoubtedly be corrupted in order to its dissolution; but then, when,
   the soul being freed from intercourse with the body, he lives in the
   spirit only. In this one thing alone can we be happy in this life, if
   we appear to be unhappy; if, avoiding the enticements of pleasures, and
   giving ourselves to the service of virtue only, we live in all labours
   and miseries, which are the means of exercising and strengthening
   virtue; if, in short, we keep to that rugged and difficult path which
   has been opened for us to happiness. The chief good therefore which
   makes men happy cannot exist, unless it be in that religion and
   doctrine to which is annexed the hope of immortality.

    Chap. XIII.--Of the Immortality of the Soul, and of Wisdom, Philosophy, and
    Eloquence.

   The subject seems to require in this place, that since we have taught
   that immortality is the chief good, we should prove this also, that the
   soul is immortal. On which subject there is great disputation among
   philosophers; nor have they who held true opinions respecting the soul
   been able to explain or prove anything: for, being destitute of divine
   knowledge, they neither brought forward true arguments by which they
   might overcome, nor evidence by which they might convince. But we shall
   treat of this question more conveniently in the last book, when we
   shall have to discuss the subject of a happy life. There remains that
   third part of philosophy, which they call Logic, in which the whole
   subject of dialectics and the whole method of speaking are contained.
   Divine learning does not stand in need of this, because the seat of
   wisdom is not the tongue, but the heart; and it makes no difference
   what kind of language you employ, for the question is not about words,
   [408] but facts. And we are not disputing about the grammarian or the
   orator, whose knowledge is concerned with the proper manner of
   speaking, but about the wise man, whose learning is concerned with the
   right manner of living. But if that system of natural philosophy before
   mentioned is not necessary, nor this of logic, because they are not
   able to render a man happy, it remains that the whole force of
   philosophy is contained in the ethical part alone, to which Socrates is
   said to have applied himself, laying aside the others. And since I have
   shown that philosophers erred in this part also, who did not grasp the
   chief good, for the sake of gaining which we are born; it appears that
   philosophy is altogether false and empty, since it does not prepare us
   for the duties of justice, nor strengthen the obligations and settled
   course of man's life. Let them know, therefore, that they are in error
   who imagine that philosophy is wisdom; let them not be drawn away by
   the authority of any one; but rather let them incline to the truth, and
   approach it. There is no room for rashness here; we must endure the
   punishment of our folly to all eternity, if we shall be deceived either
   by an empty character or a false opinion. But man, [409] such as he is,
   if he trusts in himself, that is, if he trusts in man, is (not to say
   foolish, in that he does not see his own error) undoubtedly arrogant,
   in venturing to claim for himself that which the condition of man does
   not admit of.

   And how much that greatest author of the Roman language is deceived, we
   may see from that sentiment of his; for when, in his "Books on
   Offices," [410] he had said that philosophy is nothing else than the
   desire of wisdom, and that wisdom itself is the knowledge of things
   divine and human, added: "And if any one censures the desire of this, I
   do not indeed understand what there is which he imagines praiseworthy.
   For if enjoyment of the mind and rest from cares is sought, what
   enjoyment can be compared with the pursuits of those who are always
   inquiring into something which has reference to and tends to promote a
   good and happy life? Or if any account is taken of consistency and
   virtue, either this is the study [411] by which we may attain them, or
   there is none at all. To say that there is no system in connection with
   the greatest subjects, when none of the least is without a system, is
   the part of men speaking inconsiderately, and erring in the greatest
   subjects. But if there is any discipline of virtue, where shall it be
   sought when you have departed from that kind of learning?" For my own
   part, although I endeavoured to attain in some degree to the means of
   acquiring learning, on account of my desire to teach others, yet I have
   never been eloquent, inasmuch as I never even engaged in public
   speaking; but the goodness of the cause cannot fail of itself to make
   me eloquent, and for its clear and copious defence the knowledge of
   divinity and the truth itself are sufficient. I could wish, therefore,
   that Cicero might for a short time rise from the dead, that a man of
   such consummate eloquence might be taught by an insignificant person
   who is devoid of eloquence, first, what that is which is deemed worthy
   of praise by him who blames that study which is called philosophy; and
   in the next place, that it is not that study by which virtue and
   justice are learned, nor any other, as he thought; and lastly, that
   since there is a discipline of virtue, he might be taught where it is
   to be sought, when you have laid aside that kind of learning, which he
   did not seek for the sake of hearing and learning. For from whom could
   he hear when no one knew it? But, as his usual practice was in pleading
   causes, he wished to press his opponent by questioning, and thus to
   lead him to confession, as though he were confident that no answer
   could be given to show that philosophy was not the instructress of
   virtue. And in the Tusculan disputations he openly professed this,
   turning his speech to philosophy, as though he was showing himself off
   by a declamatory style of speaking. "O philosophy, thou guide of life,"
   he says; "O thou investigator of virtue, and expeller of vices; what
   could not only we, but the life of men, have effected at all without
   thee? Thou hast been the inventor of laws, thou the teacher of morals
   and discipline;"--as though, indeed, she could perceive anything by
   herself, and he were not rather to be praised who gave her. In the same
   manner he might have given thanks to food and drink, because without
   these life could not exist; yet these, while they minister to sense,
   confer no benefit. But as these things are the nourishment of the body,
   so wisdom is of the soul.

   [408] There is a memorable story related by ecclesiastical historians,
   about a very clever disputant, whose sophistries could not be answered
   by his fellow-disputants, but who was completely silenced by the simple
   answers of a Christian otherwise unknown. When questioned about his
   sudden silence, the sophist replied that others exchanged words for
   words, but that this simple Christian fought with virtue.

   [409] There seems to be a reference to a passage of Terence, in which

    Chap. XIV.--That Lucretius and Others Have Erred, and Cicero Himself, in
    Fixing the Origin of Wisdom.

   Lucretius, accordingly, acts more correctly in praising him who was the
   first discoverer of wisdom; but he acts foolishly in this, that he
   supposed it to be discovered by a man,--as though that man whom he
   praises had found it lying somewhere as flutes at the fountain, [412]
   according to the legends of the poets. But if he praised the inventor
   of wisdom as a god,--for thus he speaks: [413] --


   "No one, I think, who is formed of mortal body. For if we must speak,
   as the acknowledged majesty of the subject itself demands, he was a
   god, he was a god, most noble Memmius,"--

   yet God ought not to have been praised on this account, because He
   discovered wisdom, but because He created man, who might be capable of
   receiving wisdom. For he diminishes the praise who praises a part only
   of the whole. But he praised Him as a man; whereas He ought to have
   been esteemed as a God on this very account, because He found out
   wisdom. For thus he speaks: [414] --


   "Will it not be right that this man should be enrolled among the gods?"

   From this it appears, either that he wished to praise Pythagoras, who
   was the first, as I have said, [415] to call himself a philosopher; or
   Thales of Miletus, who is reported to have been the first who discussed
   the nature of things. Thus, while he seeks to exalt, he has depressed
   the thing itself. For it is not great if it could have been discovered
   by man. But he may be pardoned as a poet. But that same accomplished
   orator, that same consummate philosopher, also censures the Greeks,
   whose levity he always accuses, and yet imitates. Wisdom itself, which
   at one time he calls the gift, at another time the invention, of the
   gods, he fashions after the manner of the poets, and praises on account
   of its beauty. He also grievously complains that there have been some
   who disparaged it. "Can any one," he says, "dare to censure the parent
   of life, and to defile himself with this guilt of parricide, and to be
   so impiously ungrateful?"

   Are we then parricides, Marcus Tullius, and in your judgment worthy to
   be sewed [416] up in a bag, who deny that philosophy is the parent of
   life? Or you, who are so impiously ungrateful towards God (not this god
   whose image you worship as he sits in the Capitol, but Him who made the
   world and created man, who bestowed wisdom also among His heavenly
   benefits), do you call her the teacher of virtue or the parent of life,
   having learned [417] from whom, one must be in much greater uncertainty
   than he was before? For of what virtue is she the teacher? For
   philosophers to the present time do not explain where she is situated.
   Of what life is she the parent? since the teachers themselves have been
   worn out by old age and death before they have determined upon the
   befitting course of life. Of what truth can you hold her forth as an
   explorer? since you often testify that, in so great a multitude of
   philosophers, not a single wise man has yet existed. What, then, did
   that mistress of life teach you? Was it to assail with reproaches the
   most powerful consul, [418] and by your envenomed speeches to render
   him the enemy of his country? But let us pass by those things, which
   may be excused under the name of fortune. You applied yourself, in
   truth, to the study of philosophy, and so, indeed, that no one ever
   applied himself more diligently; since you were acquainted with all the
   systems of philosophy, as you yourself are accustomed to boast, and
   elucidated the subject itself in Latin writings, and displayed yourself
   as an imitator of Plato. Tell us, therefore, what you have learned, or
   in what sect you have discovered the truth. Doubtless it was in the
   Academy which you followed and approved. But this teaches nothing,
   excepting that you know your own ignorance. [419] Therefore your own
   books refute you, and show the nothingness of the learning which may be
   gained from philosophy for life. These are your words: "But to me we
   appear not only blind to wisdom, but dull and obtuse to those very
   things which may appear in some degree to be discerned." If, therefore,
   philosophy is the teacher of life, why did you appear to yourself
   blind, and dull, and obtuse? whereas you ought, under her teaching,
   both to perceive and to be wise, and to be engaged in the clearest
   light. But how you confessed the truth of philosophy we learn from the
   letters addressed to your son, in which you advise him that the
   precepts of philosophy ought to be known, but that we must live as
   members of a community. [420]

   What can be spoken so contradictory? If the precepts of philosophy
   ought to be known, it is on this account that they ought to be known,
   in order to our living well and wisely. Or if we must live as members
   of a community, then philosophy is not wisdom, if it is better to live
   in accordance with society than with philosophy. For if that which is
   called philosophy be wisdom, he assuredly lives foolishly who does not
   live according to philosophy. But if he does not live foolishly who
   lives in accordance with society, it follows that he who lives
   according to philosophy lives foolishly. By your own judgment,
   therefore, philosophy is condemned of folly and emptiness. And you
   also, in your Consolation, that is, not in a work of levity and mirth,
   introduced this sentiment respecting philosophy: "But I know not what
   error possesses us, or deplorable ignorance of the truth." Where, then,
   is the guidance of philosophy? or what has that parent of life taught
   you, if you are deplorably ignorant of the truth? But if this
   confession of error and ignorance has been extorted almost against your
   will from your innermost breast, why do you not at length acknowledge
   to yourself the truth, that philosophy which, though it teaches
   nothing, you extolled with praises to the heavens, cannot be the
   teacher of virtue?

    Chap. XV.--The Error of Seneca in Philosophy, and How the Speech of
    Philosophers is at Variance with Their Life.

   Under the influence of the same error (for who could keep the right
   course when Cicero is in error?), Seneca said: "Philosophy is nothing
   else than the right method of living, or the science of living
   honourably, or the art of passing a good life. We shall not err in
   saying that philosophy is the law of living well and honourably. And he
   who spoke of it as a rule of life, gave to it that which was its due."
   He evidently did not refer to the common name of philosophy; for, since
   this is diffused into many sects and systems, and has nothing
   certain--nothing, in short, respecting which all agree with one mind
   and one voice,--what can be so false as that philosophy should be
   called the rule of life, since the diversity of its precepts hinders
   the right way and causes confusion? or the law of living well, when its
   subjects are widely discordant? or the science of passing life, in
   which nothing else is effected by its repeated contradictions than
   general [421] uncertainty? For I ask whether he thinks that the Academy
   is philosophy or not? I do not think that he will deny it. And if this
   is so, none of these things, therefore, is in agreement with
   philosophy; which renders all things uncertain, abrogates law, esteems
   art as nothing, subverts method, distorts rule, entirely takes away
   knowledge. Therefore all those things are false, because they are
   inconsistent with a system which is always uncertain, and up to this
   time explaining nothing. Therefore no system, or science, or law of
   living well, has been established, except in this the only true and
   heavenly wisdom, which had been unknown to philosophers. For that
   earthly wisdom, since it is false, becomes varied and manifold, and
   altogether opposed to itself. And as there is but one founder and ruler
   of the world, God, and as truth is one; so wisdom must be one and
   simple, because, if anything is true and good, it cannot be perfect
   unless it is the only one of its kind. But if philosophy were able to
   form the life, no others but philosophers would be good, and all those
   who had not learned it would be always bad. But since there are, and
   always have been, innumerable persons who are or have been good without
   any learning, but of philosophers there has seldom been one who has
   done anything praiseworthy in his life; who is there, I pray, who does
   not see that those men are not teachers of virtue, of which they
   themselves are destitute? For if any one should diligently inquire into
   their character, he will find that they are passionate, covetous,
   lustful, arrogant, wanton, and, concealing their vices under a show of
   wisdom, doing those things at home which they had censured in the
   schools. [422]

   Perhaps I speak falsely for the sake of bringing an accusation. Does
   not Tullius both acknowledge and complain of the same thing? "How few,"
   he says, "of philosophers are found of such a character, so constituted
   in soul and life, as reason demands! how few who think true instruction
   not a display of knowledge, but a law of life! how few who are obedient
   to themselves, and submit to their own decrees! We may see some of such
   levity and ostentation, that it would be better for them not to have
   learned at all; others eagerly desirous of money, others of glory; many
   the slaves of lusts, so that their speech wonderfully disagrees with
   their life." Cornelius Nepos also writes to the same Cicero: "So far am
   I from thinking that philosophy is the teacher of life and the
   completer of happiness, that I consider that none have greater need of
   teachers of living than many who are engaged in the discussion of this
   subject. For I see that a great part of those who give most elaborate
   precepts in their school respect-modesty and self-restraint, live at
   the same time in the unrestrained desires of all lusts." Seneca also,
   in his Exhortations, says: "Many of the philosophers are of this
   description, eloquent to their own condemnation: for if you should hear
   them arguing against avarice, against lust and ambition, you would
   think that they were making a public disclosure [423] of their own
   character, so entirely do the censures which they utter in public flow
   back upon themselves; so that it is right to regard them in no other
   light than as physicians, whose advertisements [424] contain medicines,
   but their medicine chests poison. Some are not ashamed of their vices;
   but they invent defences for their baseness, so that they may appear
   even to sin with honour." Seneca also says: "The wise man will even do
   things which he will not approve of, that he may find means of passing
   to the accomplishment of greater things; nor will he abandon good
   morals, but will adapt them to the occasion; and those things which
   others employ for glory or pleasure, he will employ for the sake of
   action." Then he says shortly afterwards: "All things which the
   luxurious and the ignorant do, the wise man also will do, but not in
   the same manner, and with the same purpose. But it makes no difference
   with what intention you act, when the action itself is vicious; because
   acts are seen, the intention is not seen."

   Aristippus, the master of the Cyrenaics, had a criminal intimacy with
   Lais, the celebrated courtesan; and that grave teacher of philosophy
   defended this fault by saying, that there was a great difference
   between him and the other lovers of Lais, because he himself possessed
   Lais, whereas others were possessed by Lais. O illustrious wisdom, to
   be imitated by good men! Would you, in truth, entrust your children to
   this man for education, that they might learn to possess a harlot? He
   said that there was some difference between himself and the dissolute,
   that they wasted their property, whereas he lived in indulgence without
   any cost. And in this the harlot was plainly the wiser, who had the
   philosopher as her creature, that all the youth, corrupted by the
   example and authority of the teacher, might flock together to her
   without any shame. What difference therefore did it make, with what
   intention the philosopher betook himself to that most notorious harlot,
   when the people and his rivals saw him more depraved than all the
   abandoned? Nor was it enough to live in this manner, but he began also
   to teach lusts; and he transferred his habits from the brothel to the
   school, contending that bodily pleasure was the chief good. Which
   pernicious and shameful doctrine has its origin not in the heart of the
   philosopher, but in the bosom of the harlot.

   For why should I speak of the Cynics, who practised licentiousness in
   public? What wonder if they derived their name and title from dogs,
   [425] since they also imitated their life? Therefore there is no
   instruction of virtue in this sect, since even those who enjoin more
   honourable things either themselves do not practice what they advise;
   or if they do (which rarely happens), it is not the system which leads
   them to that which is right, but nature which often impels even the
   unlearned to praise.

    Chap. XVI.--That the Philosophers Who Give Good Instructions Live Badly, by
    the Testimony of Cicero; Therefore We Should Not So Much Devote Ourselves to
    the Study of Philosophy as to Wisdom.

   But when they give themselves up to perpetual sloth, and undertake no
   exercise of virtue, and pass their whole life in the practice of
   speaking, in what light ought they to be regarded rather than as
   triflers? For wisdom, unless it is engaged on some action on which it
   may exert its force, is empty and false; and Tullius rightly gives the
   preference, above teachers of philosophy, to those men employed in
   civil affairs, who govern the state, who found new cities or maintain
   with equity those already founded, who preserve the safety and liberty
   of the citizens either by good laws or wholesome counsels, or by
   weighty judgments. For it is right to make men good rather than to give
   precepts about duty to those shut up in corners, which precepts are not
   observed even by those who speak them; and inasmuch as they have
   withdrawn themselves from true actions, it is manifest that they
   invented the system of philosophy itself, for the purpose of exercising
   the tongue, or for the sake of pleading. But they who merely teach
   without acting, of themselves detract from the weight of their own
   precepts; for who would obey, when they who give the precepts
   themselves teach disobedience? Moreover, it is a good thing to give
   right and honourable precepts; but unless you also practice them it is
   a deceit, and it is inconsistent and trifling to have goodness not in
   the heart, but on the lips.

   It is not therefore utility, but enjoyment, which they seek from
   philosophy. And this Cicero indeed testified. "Truly," he says, "all
   their disputation, although it contains most abundant fountains of
   virtue and knowledge, yet, when compared with their actions and
   accomplishments, I fear lest it should seem not to have brought so much
   advantage to the business of men as enjoyment to their times of
   relaxation." He ought not to have feared, since he spoke the truth; but
   as if he were afraid lest he should be arraigned by the philosophers on
   a charge of betraying a mystery, he did not venture confidently to
   pronounce that which was true, that they do not dispute for the purpose
   of teaching, but for their own enjoyment in their leisure; and since
   they are the advisers of actions, and do not themselves act at all,
   they are to be regarded as mere talkers. [426] But assuredly, because
   they contributed no advantage to life, they neither obeyed their own
   decrees, nor has any one been found, through so many ages, who lived in
   accordance with their laws. Therefore philosophy [427] must altogether
   be laid aside, because we are not to devote ourselves to the pursuit of
   wisdom, for this has no limit or moderation; but we must be wise, and
   that indeed quickly. For a second life is not granted to us, so that
   when we seek wisdom in this life we may be wise in that; each result
   must be brought about in this life. It ought to be quickly found, in
   order that it may be quickly taken up, lest any part of life should
   pass away, the end of which is uncertain. Hortensius in Cicero,
   contending against philosophy, is pressed by a clever argument;
   inasmuch as, when he said that men ought not to philosophize, he seemed
   nevertheless to philosophize, since it is the part of the philosophers
   to discuss what ought and what ought not to be done in life. We are
   free and exempt from this calumny, who take away philosophy, because it
   is the invention of human thought; we defend wisdom, because it is a
   divine tradition, and we testify that it ought to be taken up by all.
   He, when he took away philosophy without introducing anything better,
   was supposed to take away wisdom; and on that account was more easily
   driven from his opinion, because it is agreed upon that man is not born
   to folly, but to wisdom.

   Moreover, the argument which the same Hortensius employed has great
   weight also against philosophy,--namely, that it may be understood from
   this, that philosophy is not wisdom, since its beginning and origin are
   apparent. When, he says, did philosophers begin to exist? Thales, as I
   imagine, was the first, and his age was recent. Where, then, among the
   more ancient men did that love of investigating the truth lie hid?
   Lucretius also says: [428] --


   "Then, too, this nature and system of things has been discovered
   lately, and I the very first of all have only now been found able to
   transfer it into native words."

   And Seneca says: "There are not yet a thousand years since the
   beginnings of wisdom were undertaken." Therefore mankind for many
   generations lived without system. In ridicule of which, Persius says:
   [429] --


   "When wisdom came to the city,

   Together with pepper and palms;"

   as though wisdom had been introduced into the city together with
   savoury merchandise. [430] For if it is in agreement with the nature of
   man, it must have had its commencement together with man; but if it is
   not in agreement with it, human nature would be incapable of receiving
   it. But, inasmuch as it has received it, it follows that wisdom has
   existed from the beginning: therefore philosophy, inasmuch as it has
   not existed from the beginning, is not the same true wisdom. But, in
   truth, the Greeks, because they had not attained to the sacred letters
   of truth, did not know how wisdom was corrupted. And, therefore, since
   they thought that human life was destitute of wisdom, they invented
   philosophy; that is, they wished by discussion to tear up the truth
   which was lying hid and unknown to them: and this employment, through
   ignorance of the truth, they thought to be wisdom.

    Chap. XVII.--He Passes from Philosophy to the Philosophers, Beginning with
    Epicurus; And How He Regarded Leucippus and Democritus as Authors of Error.

   I have spoken on the subject of philosophy itself as briefly as I
   could; now let us come to the philosophers, not that we may contend
   with these, who cannot maintain their ground, but that we may pursue
   those who are in flight and driven from our battle-field. The system of
   Epicurus was much more generally followed than those of the others; not
   because it brings forward any truth, but because the attractive name of
   pleasure invites many. [431] For every one is naturally inclined to
   vices. Moreover, for the purpose of drawing the multitude to himself,
   he speaks that which is specially adapted to each character separately.
   He forbids the idle to apply himself to learning; he releases the
   covetous man from giving largesses to the people; he prohibits the
   inactive man from undertaking the business of the state, the sluggish
   from bodily exercise, the timid from military service. The irreligious
   is told that the gods pay no attention to the conduct of men; the man
   who is unfeeling and selfish is ordered to give nothing to any one, for
   that the wise man does everything on his own account. To a man who
   avoids the crowd, solitude is praised. One who is too sparing, learns
   that life can be sustained on water and meal. If a man hates his wife,
   the blessings of celibacy are enumerated to him; to one who has bad
   children, the happiness of those who are without children is
   proclaimed; against unnatural [432] parents it is said that there is no
   bond of nature. To the man who is delicate and incapable of endurance,
   it is said that pain is the greatest of all evils; to the man of
   fortitude, it is said that the wise man is happy even under tortures.
   The man who devotes himself to the pursuit of influence and distinction
   is enjoined to pay court to kings; he who cannot endure annoyance is
   enjoined to shun the abode of kings. Thus the crafty man collects an
   assembly from various and differing characters; and while he lays
   himself out to please all, he is more at variance with himself than
   they all are with one another. But we must explain from what source the
   whole of this system is derived, and what origin it has.

   Epicurus saw that the good are always subject to adversities, poverty,
   labours, exile, loss of dear friends. On the contrary, he saw that the
   wicked were happy; that they were exalted with influence, and loaded
   with honours; he saw that innocence was unprotected, that crimes were
   committed with impunity: he saw that death raged without any regard to
   character, without any arrangement or discrimination of age; but that
   some arrived at old age, while others were carried off in their
   infancy; that some died when they were now robust and vigorous, that
   others were cut off by an untimely death in the first flower of youth;
   that in wars the better men were especially overcome and slain. But
   that which especially moved him, was the fact that religious men were
   especially visited with weightier evils, whereas he saw that less evils
   or none at all fell upon those who altogether neglected the gods, or
   worshipped them in an impious manner; and that even the very temples
   themselves were often set on fire by lightning. And of this Lucretius
   complains, [433] when he says respecting the god:--


   "Then he may hurl lightnings, and often throw down his temples, and
   withdrawing into the deserts, there spend his rage in practising his
   bolt, which often passes the guilty by, and strikes dead the innocent
   and unoffending."

   But if he had been able to collect even a small particle of truth, he
   would never say that the god throws down his own temples, when he
   throws them down on this account, because they are not his. The
   Capitol, which is the chief seat of the Roman city and religion, was
   struck with lightning and set on fire not once only, but frequently.
   But what was the opinion of clever men respecting this is evident from
   the saying of Cicero, who says that the flame came from heaven, not to
   destroy that earthly dwelling-place of Jupiter, but to demand a loftier
   and more magnificent abode. Concerning which transaction, in the books
   respecting his consulship, he speaks to the same purport as
   Lucretius:--


   "For the father thundering on high, throned in the lofty Olympus,
   himself assailed his own citadels and famed temples, and cast fires
   upon his abode in the Capitol.

   In the obstinacy of their folly, therefore, they not only did not
   understand the power and majesty of the true God, but they even
   increased the impiety of their error, in endeavouring against all
   divine law to restore a temple so often condemned by the judgment of
   Heaven.

   Therefore, when Epicurus reflected on these things, induced as it were
   by the injustice of these matters (for thus it appeared to him in his
   ignorance of the cause and subject), he thought that there was no
   providence. [434] And having persuaded himself of this, he undertook
   also to defend it, and thus he entangled himself in inextricable
   errors. For if there is no providence, how is it that the world was
   made with such order and arrangement? He says: There is no arrangement,
   for many things are made in a different manner from that in which they
   ought to have been made. And the divine man found subjects of censure.
   Now, if I had leisure to refute these things separately, I could easily
   show that this man was neither wise nor of sound mind. Also, if there
   is no providence, how is it that the bodies of animals are arranged
   with such foresight, that the various members, being disposed in a
   wonderful manner, discharge their own offices individually? The system
   of providence, he says, contrived nothing in the production of animals;
   for neither were the eyes made for seeing, nor the ears for hearing,
   nor the tongue for speaking, nor the feet for walking; inasmuch as
   these were produced before it was possible to speak, to hear, to see,
   and to walk. Therefore these were not produced for use; but use was
   produced from them. If there is no providence, why do rains fall,
   fruits spring up, and trees put forth leaves? These things, he says,
   are not always done for the sake of living creatures, inasmuch as they
   are of no benefit to providence; but all things must be produced of
   their own accord. From what source, therefore, do they arise, [435] or
   how are all things which are carried on brought about? There is no
   need, he says, of supposing a providence; for there are seeds floating
   through the empty void, and from these, collected together without
   order, all things are produced and take their form. Why, then, do we
   not perceive or distinguish them? Because, he says, they have neither
   any colour, nor warmth, nor smell; they are also without flavour and
   moisture; and they are so minute, that they cannot be cut and divided.

   Thus, because he had taken up a false principle at the commencement,
   the necessity of the subjects which followed led him to absurdities.
   For where or from whence are these atoms? Why did no one dream of them
   besides Leucippus only? from whom Democritus, [436] having received
   instructions, left to Epicurus the inheritance of his folly. And if
   these are minute bodies, and indeed solid, as they say, they certainly
   are able to fall under the notice of the eyes. If the nature of all
   things is the same, how is it that they compose various objects? They
   meet together, he says, in varied order and position as the letters
   which, though few in number, by variety of arrangement make up
   innumerable words. But it is urged the letters have a variety of forms.
   And so, he says, have these first principles; for they are rough, they
   are furnished with hooks, they are smooth. Therefore they can be cut
   and divided, if there is in them any part which projects. But if they
   are smooth and without hooks, they cannot cohere. They ought therefore
   to he hooked, that they may be linked together one with another. But
   since they are said to be so minute that they cannot be cut asunder by
   the edge of any weapon, how is it that they have hooks or angles? For
   it must be possible for these to be torn asunder, since they project.
   In the next place, by what mutual compact, by what discernment, do they
   meet together, so that anything may be constructed out of them? If they
   are without intelligence, they cannot come together in such order and
   arrangement; for nothing but reason can bring to accomplishment
   anything in accordance with reason. With how many arguments can this
   trifling be refuted! But I must proceed with my subject. This is he


   "Who surpassed in intellect the race of man, and quenched the light of
   all, as the ethereal sun arisen quenches the stars." [437]

   Which verses I am never able to read without laughter. For this was not
   said respecting Socrates or Plato, who are esteemed as kings of
   philosophers, but concerning a man who, though of sound mind and
   vigorous health, raved more senselessly than any one diseased. And thus
   the most vain poet, I do not say adorned, but overwhelmed and crushed,
   the mouse with the praises of the lion. But the same man also releases
   us from the fear of death, respecting which these are his own exact
   words:--


   "When we are in existence, death does not exist; when death exists, we
   have no existence: therefore death is nothing to us."

   How cleverly he has deceived us! As though it were death now completed
   which is an object of fear, by which sensation has been already taken
   away, and not the very act of dying, by which sensation is being taken
   from us. For there is a time in which we ourselves even yet [438]
   exist, and death does not yet exist; and that very time appears to be
   miserable, because death is beginning to exist, and we are ceasing to
   exist.

   Nor is it said without reason that death is not miserable. The approach
   of death is miserable; that is, to waste away by disease, to endure the
   thrust, to receive the weapon in the body, to be burnt with fire, to be
   torn by the teeth of beasts. These are the things which are feared, not
   because they bring death, but because they bring great pain. But rather
   make out that pain is not an evil. He says it is the greatest of all
   evils. How therefore can I fail to fear, if that which precedes or
   brings about death is an evil? Why should I say that the argument is
   false, inasmuch as souls do not perish? But, he says, souls do perish;
   for that which is born with the body must perish with the body. I have
   already stated that I prefer to put off the discussion of this subject,
   and to reserve it for the last part of my work, that I may refute this
   persuasion of Epicurus, whether it was that of Democritus or
   Dicæarchus, both by arguments and divine testimonies. But perhaps he
   promised himself impunity in the indulgence of his vices; for he was an
   advocate of most disgraceful pleasure, and said that man was born for
   its enjoyment. [439] Who, when he hears this affirmed, would abstain
   from the practice of vice and wickedness? For; if the soul is doomed to
   perish, let us eagerly pursue riches, that we may be able to enjoy all
   kinds of indulgence; and if these are wanting to us, let us take them
   away from those who have them by stealth, by stratagem, or by force,
   especially if there is no God who regards the actions of men: as long
   as the hope of impunity shall favour us, let us plunder and put to
   death. [440] For it is the part of the wise man to do evil, if it is
   advantageous to him, and safe; since, if there is a God in heaven, He
   is not angry with any one. It is also equally the part of the foolish
   man to do good; because, as he is not excited with anger, so he is not
   influenced by favour. Therefore let us live in the indulgence of
   pleasures in every possible way; for in a short time we shall not exist
   at all. Therefore let us suffer no day, in short, no moment of time, to
   pass away from us without pleasure; lest, since we ourselves are doomed
   to perish, the life which we have already spent should itself also
   perish.

   Although he does not say this in word, yet he teaches it in fact. For
   when he maintains that the wise man does everything for his own sake,
   he refers all things which he does to his own advantage. And thus he
   who hears these disgraceful things, will neither think that any good
   thing ought to be done, since the conferring of benefits has reference
   to the advantage of another; nor that he ought to abstain from guilt,
   because the doing of evil is attended with gain. If any chieftain of
   pirates or leader of robbers were exhorting his men to acts of
   violence, what other language could he employ than to say the same
   things which Epicurus says: that the gods take no notice; that they are
   not affected with anger nor kind feeling; that the punishment of a
   future state is not to be dreaded, because souls die after death, and
   that there is no future state of punishment at all; that pleasure is
   the greatest good; that there is no society among men; that every one
   consults for his own interest; that there is no one who loves another,
   unless it be for his own sake; that death is not to be feared by a
   brave man, nor any pain; for that he, even if he should be tortured or
   burnt, should say that he does not regard it. There is evidently
   sufficient cause why any one should regard this as the expression of a
   wise man, since it can most fittingly be applied to robbers!

    Chap. XVIII.--The Pythagoreans and Stoics, While They Hold the Immortality
    of the Soul, Foolishly Persuade a Voluntary Death.

   Others, again, discuss things contrary to these, namely, that the soul
   survives after death; and these are chiefly the Pythagoreans and
   Stoics. And although they are to be treated with indulgence because
   they perceive the truth, yet I cannot but blame them, because they fell
   upon the truth not by their opinion, but by accident. And thus they
   erred in some degree even in that very matter which they rightly
   perceived. For, since they feared the argument by which it is inferred
   that the soul must necessarily die with the body, because it is born
   with the body, they asserted that the soul is not born with the body,
   but rather introduced into it, and that it migrates from one body to
   another. They did not consider that it was possible for the soul to
   survive the body, unless it should appear to have existed previously to
   the body. There is therefore an equal and almost similar error on each
   side. But the one side are deceived with respect to the past, the other
   with respect to the future. For no one saw that which is most true,
   that the soul is both created and does not die, because they were
   ignorant why that came to pass, or what was the nature of man. Many
   therefore of them, because they suspected that the soul is immortal,
   laid violent hands upon themselves, as though they were about to depart
   to heaven. Thus it was with Cleanthes [441] and Chrysippus, [442] with
   Zeno, [443] and Empedocles, [444] who in the dead of night cast himself
   into a cavity of the burning Ætna, that when he had suddenly
   disappeared it might be believed that he had departed to the gods; and
   thus also of the Romans Cato died, who through the whole of his life
   was an imitator of Socratic ostentation. For Democritus [445] was of
   another persuasion. But, however,


   "By his own spontaneous act he offered up his head to death; " [446]

   and nothing can be more wicked than this. For if a homicide is guilty
   because he is a destroyer of man, he who puts himself to death is under
   the same guilt, because he puts to death a man. Yea, that crime may be
   considered to be greater, the punishment of which belongs to God alone.
   For as we did not come into this life of our own accord; so, on the
   other hand, we can only withdraw from this habitation of the body which
   has been appointed for us to keep, by the command of Him who placed us
   in this body that we may inhabit it, until He orders us to depart from
   it; and if any violence is offered to us, we must endure it with
   equanimity, since the death of an innocent person cannot be unavenged,
   and since we have a great Judge who alone always has the power of
   taking vengeance in His hands.

   All these philosophers, therefore, were homicides; and Cato himself,
   the chief of Roman wisdom, who, before he put himself to death, is said
   to have read through the treatise of Plato which he wrote on the
   immortality of the soul, and was led by the authority of the
   philosopher to the commission of this great crime; yet he, however,
   appears to have had some cause for death in his hatred of slavery. Why
   should I speak of the Ambraciot, [447] who, having read the same
   treatise, threw himself into the sea, for no other cause than that he
   believed Plato?--a doctrine altogether detestable and to be avoided, if
   it drives men from life. But if Plato had known and taught by whom, and
   how, and to whom, and on account of what actions, and at what time,
   immortality is given, he would neither have driven Cleombrotus nor Cato
   to a voluntary death, but he would have trained them to live with
   justice. For it appears to me that Cato sought a cause for death, not
   so much that he might escape from Cæsar, as that he might obey the
   decrees of the Stoics, whom he followed, and might make his name
   distinguished by some great action; and I do not see what evil could
   have happened to him if he had lived. For Caius Cæsar, such was his
   clemency, had no other object, even in the very heat of civil war, than
   to appear to deserve well of the state, by preserving two excellent
   citizens, Cicero and Cato. But let us return to those who praise death
   as a benefit. You complain of life as though you had lived, or had ever
   settled with yourself why you were born at all. May not therefore the
   true and common Father of all justly find fault with that saying of
   Terence: [448] --


   "First, learn in what life consists; then, if you shall be dissatisfied
   with life, have recourse to death."

   You are indignant that you are exposed to evils; as though you deserved
   anything good, who are ignorant of your Father, Lord, and King; who,
   although you behold with your eyes the bright light, are nevertheless
   blind in mind, and lie in the depths of the darkness of ignorance. And
   this ignorance has caused that some have not been ashamed to say, that
   we are born for this cause, that we may suffer the punishment of our
   crimes; but I do not see what can be more senseless than this. For
   where or what crimes could we have committed when we did not even
   exist? Unless we shall happen to believe that foolish old man, [449]
   who falsely said that he had lived before, and that in his former life
   he had been Euphorbus. He, I believe, because he was born of an ignoble
   race, chose for himself a family from the poems of Homer. O wonderful
   and remarkable memory of Pythagoras! O miserable forgetfulness on the
   part of us all, since we know not who we were in our former life! But
   perhaps it was caused by some error, or favour, that he alone did not
   touch the abyss of Lethe, or taste the water of oblivion; doubtless the
   trifling old man (as is wont to be the case with old women who are free
   from occupation) invented fables as it were for credulous infants. But
   if he had thought well of those to whom he spoke these things; if he
   had considered them to be men, he would never have claimed to himself
   the liberty of uttering such perverse falsehoods. But the folly of this
   most trifling man is deserving of ridicule. What shall we do in the
   case of Cicero, who, having said in the beginning of his Consolation
   that men were born for the sake of atoning for their crimes, afterwards
   repeated the assertion, as though rebuking him who does not imagine
   that life is a punishment? He was right, therefore, in saying
   beforehand that he was held by error and wretched ignorance of the
   truth.

    Chap. XIX.--Cicero and Others of the Wisest Men Teach the Immortality of the
    Soul, But in an Unbelieving Manner; And that a Good or an Evil Death Must Be
    Weighed from the Previous Life.

   But those who assert the advantage of death, because they know nothing
   of the truth, thus reason: If there is nothing after death, death is
   not an evil; for it takes away the perception of evil. But if the soul
   survives, death is even an advantage; because immortality follows. And
   this sentiment is thus set forth by Cicero concerning the Laws: [450]
   "We may congratulate ourselves, since death is about to bring either a
   better state than that which exists in life, or at any rate not a
   worse. For if the soul is in a state of vigour without the body, it is
   a divine life; and if it is without perception, assuredly there is no
   evil." Cleverly argued, as it appeared to himself, as though there
   could be no other state. But each conclusion is false. For the sacred
   writings [451] teach that the soul is not annihilated; but that it is
   either rewarded according to its righteousness, or eternally punished
   according to its crimes. For neither is it right, that he who has lived
   a life of wickedness in prosperity should escape the punishment which
   he deserves; nor that he who has been wretched on account of his
   righteousness, should be deprived of his reward. And this is so true,
   that Tully also, in his Consolation, declared that the righteous and
   the wicked do not inhabit the same abodes. For those same wise men, he
   says, did not judge that the same course was open for all into the
   heaven; for they taught that those who were contaminated by vices and
   crimes were thrust down into darkness, and lay in the mire; but that,
   on the other hand, souls that were chaste, pure, upright, and
   uncontaminated, being also refined by the study and practice of virtue,
   by a light and easy course take their flight to the gods, that is, to a
   nature resembling their own. But this sentiment is opposed to the
   former argument. For that is based on the assumption that every man at
   his birth is presented with immortality. What distinction, therefore,
   will there be between virtue and guilt, if it makes no difference
   whether a man be Aristides or Phalaris, whether he be Cato or Catiline?
   But a man does not perceive this opposition between sentiments and
   actions, unless he is in possession of the truth. If any one,
   therefore, should ask me whether death is a good or an evil, I shall
   reply that its character depends upon the course of the life. For as
   life itself is a good if it is passed virtuously, but an evil if it is
   spent viciously, so also death is to be weighed in accordance with the
   past actions of life. And so it comes to pass, that if life has been
   passed in the service of God, death is not an evil, for it is a
   translation to immortality. But if not so, death must necessarily be an
   evil, since it transfers men, as I have said, to everlasting
   punishment. [452]

   What, then, shall we say, but that they are in error who either desire
   death as a good, or flee from life as an evil? unless they are most
   unjust, who do not weigh the fewer evils against the greater number of
   blessings. For when they pass all their lives in a variety of the
   choicest gratifications, if any bitterness has chanced to succeed to
   these, they desire to die; and they so regard it as to appear never to
   have fared well, if at any time they happen to fare ill. Therefore they
   condemn the whole of life, and consider it as nothing else than filled
   with evils. Hence arose that foolish sentiment, that this state which
   we imagine to be life is death, and that that which we fear as death is
   life; and so that the first good is not to be born, that the second is
   an early death. And that this sentiment may be of greater weight, it is
   attributed to Silenus. [453] Cicero in his Consolation says: "Not to be
   born is by far the best thing, and not to fall upon these rocks of
   life. But the next thing is, if you have been born, to die as soon as
   possible, and to flee from the violence of fortune as from a
   conflagration." That he believed this most foolish expression appears
   from this, that he added something of his own for its embellishment. I
   ask, therefore, for whom he thinks it best not to be born, when there
   is no one at all who has any perception; for it is the perception which
   causes anything to be good or bad. In the next place, why did he regard
   the whole of life as nothing else than rocks, and a conflagration; as
   though it were either in our power not to be born, or life were given
   to us by fortune, and not by God, or as though the course of life
   appeared to bear any resemblance to a conflagration?

   The saying of Plato is not dissimilar, that he gave thanks to nature,
   first that he was born a human being rather than a dumb animal; in the
   next place, that he was a man rather than a woman; that he was a Greek
   rather than a barbarian; [454] lastly, that he was an Athenian, and
   that he was born in the time of Socrates. It is impossible to say what
   great blindness and errors are produced by ignorance of the truth would
   altogether contend that nothing in the affairs of men was ever spoken
   more foolishly. As though, if he had been born a barbarian, or a woman,
   or, in fine, an ass, he would be the same Plato, and not that very
   being which had been produced. But he evidently believed Pythagoras,
   who, in order that he might prevent men from feeding on animals, said
   that souls passed from the bodies of men to the bodies of other
   animals; which is both foolish and impossible. It is foolish, because
   it was unnecessary to introduce souls that have long existed into new
   bodies, when the same Artificer who at one time had made the first, was
   always able to make fresh ones; it is impossible, because the soul
   endued with right reason can no more change the nature of its
   condition, than fire can rush downwards, or, like a river, pour its
   flame obliquely. [455] The wise man therefore imagined, that it might
   come to pass that the soul which was then in Plato might be shut up in
   some other animal, and might be endued with the sensibility of a man,
   so as to understand and grieve that it was burthened with an
   incongruous body. How much more rationally would he have acted, if he
   had said that he gave thanks because he was born with a good capacity,
   and capable of receiving instruction, and that he was possessed of
   those resources which enabled him to receive a liberal education! For
   what benefit was it that he was born at Athens? Have not many men of
   distinguished talent and learning lived in other cities, who were
   better individually than all the Athenians? How many thousands must we
   believe that there were, who, though born at Athens, and in the times
   of Socrates, were nevertheless unlearned and foolish? For it is not the
   walls or the place in which any one was born that can invest a man with
   wisdom. Of what avail was it to congratulate himself that he was born
   in the times of Socrates? Was Socrates able to supply talent to
   learners? It did not occur to Plato that Alcibiades also, and Critias,
   were constant hearers of the same Socrates, the one of whom was the
   most active enemy of his country, the other the most cruel of all
   tyrants.

    Chap. XX.--Socrates Had More Knowledge in Philosophy Than Other Men,
    Although in Many Things He Acted Foolishly.

   Let us now see what there was so great in Socrates himself, that a wise
   man deservedly gave thanks that he was born in his times. I do not deny
   that he was a little more sagacious than the others who thought that
   the nature of things could be comprehended by the mind. And in this I
   judge that they were not only senseless, but also impious; because they
   wished to send their inquisitive eyes into the secrets of that heavenly
   providence. We know that there are at Rome, and in many cities, certain
   sacred things which it is considered impious for men to look upon.
   Therefore they who are not permitted to pollute those objects abstain
   from looking upon them; and if by error or some accident a man has
   happened to see them, his guilt is expiated first by his punishment,
   and afterwards by a repetition of sacrifice. What can you do in the
   case of those who wish to pry into unpermitted things? Truly they are
   much more wicked who seek to profane the secrets of the world and this
   heavenly temple with impious disputations, than those who entered the
   temple of Vesta, or the Good Goddess, or Ceres. And these shrines,
   though it is not lawful for men to approach them, were yet constructed
   by men. But these men not only escape the charge of impiety, but, that
   which is much more unbecoming, they gain the fame of eloquence and the
   glory of talent. What if they were able to investigate anything? For
   they are as foolish in asserting as they are wicked in searching out;
   since they are neither able to find out anything, nor, even if they had
   found out anything, to defend it. For if even by chance they have seen
   the truth--a thing which often happens--they so act that it is refuted
   by others as false. For no one descends from heaven to pass sentence on
   the opinions of individuals; wherefore no one can doubt that those who
   seek after these things are foolish, senseless, and insane.

   Socrates therefore had something of human wisdom, [456] who, when he
   understood that these things could not possibly be ascertained, removed
   himself from questions of this kind; but I fear that he so acted in
   this alone. For many of his actions are not only undeserving of praise,
   but also most deserving of censure, in which things he most resembled
   those of his own class. Out of these I will select one which may be
   judged of by all. Socrates used this well-known proverb: "That which is
   above us is nothing to us." Let us therefore fall down upon the earth,
   and use as feet those hands which have been given us for the production
   of excellent works. The heaven is nothing to us, to the contemplation
   of which we have been raised; [457] in fine, the light itself can have
   no reference to us; undoubtedly the cause of our sustenance is from
   heaven. But if he perceived this, that we ought not to discuss the
   nature of heavenly things, he was unable even to comprehend the nature
   of those things which he had beneath his feet. What then? did he err in
   his words? It is not probable; but he undoubtedly meant that which he
   said, that we are not to devote ourselves to religion; but if he were
   openly to say this, no one would suffer it.

   For who cannot perceive that this world, completed with such wonderful
   method, is governed by some providence, since there is nothing which
   can exist without some one to direct it? Thus, a house deserted by its
   inhabitant fails to decay; a ship without a pilot goes to the bottom;
   and a body abandoned by the soul wastes away. Much less can we suppose
   that so great a fabric could either have been constructed without an
   Artificer, or have existed so long without a Ruler. But if he wished to
   overthrow those public superstitions, I do not disapprove of this; yea,
   I shall rather praise it, if he shall have found anything better to
   take their place. But the same man swore [458] by a dog and a goose. Oh
   buffoon (as Zeno the Epicurean [459] says), senseless, abandoned,
   desperate man, if he wished to scoff at religion; madman, if he did
   this seriously, so as to esteem a most base animal as God! For who can
   dare to find fault with the superstitions of the Egyptians, when
   Socrates confirmed them at Athens by his authority? But was it not a
   mark of consummate vanity, that before his death he asked his friends
   to sacrifice for him a cock which he had vowed to Æsculapius? He
   evidently feared lest he should be put upon his trial before
   Rhadamanthus, the judge, by Æsculapius on account of the vow. I should
   consider him most mad if he had died under the influence of disease.
   But since he did this in his sound mind, he who thinks that he was wise
   is himself of unsound mind. Behold one in whose times the wise man
   congratulates himself as having been born!

    Chap. XXI.--Of the System of Plato, Which Would Lead to the Overthrow of
    States.

   Let us, however, see what it was that he learned from Socrates, who,
   having entirely rejected natural philosophy, betook himself to
   inquiries about virtue and duty. And thus I do not doubt that he
   instructed his hearers in the precepts of justice. Therefore, under the
   teaching of Socrates, it did not escape the notice of Plato, that the
   force of justice consists in equality, since all are born in an equal
   condition. Therefore (he says) they must have nothing private or their
   own; but that they may be equal, as the method of justice requires,
   they must possess all things in common. This is capable of being
   endured, as long as it appears to be spoken of money. But how
   impossible and how unjust this is, I could show by many things. Let us,
   however, admit its possibility. For grant that all are wise, and
   despise money. To what, then, did that community lead him? Marriages
   also, be says, ought to be in common; so that many men may flock
   together like dogs to the same woman, and he who shall be superior in
   strength may succeed in obtaining her; or if they are patient as
   philosophers, they may await their turns, as in a brothel. Oh the
   wonderful equality of Plato! Where, then, is the virtue of chastity?
   where conjugal fidelity? And if you take away these, all justice is
   taken away. But he also says that states would be prosperous, if either
   philosophers were their kings, or their kings were philosophers. But if
   you were to give the sovereignty to this man of such justice and
   equity, who had deprived some of their own property, and given to some
   the property of others, he would prostitute the modesty of women; a
   thing which was never done, I do not say by a king, but not even by a
   tyrant.

   But what motive did he advance for this most degrading advice? The
   state will be in harmony, and bound together with the bonds of mutual
   love, if all shall be the husbands, and fathers, and wives, and
   children of all. What a confusion of the human race is this? How is it
   possible for affection to be preserved where there is nothing certain
   to be loved? What man will love a woman, or what woman a man, unless
   they shall always have lived together,--unless devotedness of mind, and
   faith mutually preserved, shall have made their love indivisible? But
   this virtue has no place in that promiscuous pleasure. Moreover, if all
   are the children of all, who will be able to love children as his own,
   when he is either ignorant or in doubt whether they are his own? Who
   will bestow honour upon any one as a father, when he does not know from
   whom he was born? From which it comes to pass, that he not only esteems
   a stranger as a father, but also a father as a stranger. Why should I
   say that it is possible for a wife to be common, but impossible for a
   son, who cannot be conceived except from one? The community, therefore,
   is lost to him alone, nature herself crying out against it. It remains
   that it is only for the sake of concord that he would have a community
   of wives. But there is no more vehement cause of discords, than the
   desire of one woman by many men. And in this Plato might have been
   admonished, if not by reason, yet certainly by example, both of the
   dumb animals, which fight most vehemently on this account, and of men,
   who have always carried on most severe wars with one another on account
   of this matter.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXII.--Of the Precepts of Plato, and Censures of the Same.

   It remains that the community of which we have spoken admits of nothing
   else but adulteries and lusts, for the utter extinction of which virtue
   is especially necessary. Therefore he did not find the concord which he
   sought, because he did not see whence it arises. For justice has no
   weight in outward circumstances, not even in the body, [460] but it is
   altogether employed on the mind of man. He, therefore, who wishes to
   place men on an equality, ought not to take away marriage and wealth,
   but arrogance, pride, and haughtiness, that those who are powerful and
   lifted up on high may know that they are on a level even with the most
   needy. For insolence and injustice being taken from the rich, it will
   make no difference whether some are rich and others poor, since they
   will be equal in spirit, and nothing but reverence towards God can
   produce this result. He thought, therefore, that he had found justice,
   whereas he had altogether removed it, because it ought not to be a
   community of perishable things, but of minds. For if justice is the
   mother [461] of all virtues, when they are severally taken away, it is
   also itself overthrown. But Plato took away above all things frugality,
   which has no existence when there is no property of one's own which can
   be possessed; he took away abstinence, since there will be nothing
   belonging to another from which one can abstain; he took away
   temperance and chastity, which are the greatest virtues in each sex; he
   took away self-respect, shame, and modesty, if those things which are
   accustomed to be judged base and disgraceful begin to be accounted
   honourable and lawful. Thus, while he wishes to confer virtue upon all,
   he takes it away from all. For the ownership of property contains the
   material both of vices and of virtues, but a community of goods
   contains nothing else than the licentiousness of vices. For men who
   have many mistresses can be called nothing else than luxurious and
   prodigal. And likewise women who are in the possession of many men,
   must of necessity be not adulteresses, because they have no fixed
   marriage, but prostitutes and harlots. Therefore he reduced human life,
   I do not say to the likeness of dumb animals, but of the herds and
   brutes. For almost all the birds contract marriages, and are united in
   pairs, and defend their nests, as though their marriage-beds, with
   harmonious mind, and cherish their own young, because they are well
   known to them; and if you put others in their way, they repel them. But
   this wise man, contrary to the custom of men, and contrary to nature,
   chose more foolish objects of imitation; and since he saw that the
   duties of males and females were not separated in the case of other
   animals, he thought that women also ought to engage in warfare, and
   take a share in the public counsels, and undertake magistracies, and
   assume commands. And therefore he assigned to them horses and arms: it
   follows that he should have assigned to men wool and the loom, and the
   carrying of infants. Nor did he see the impossibility of what he said,
   from the fact that no nation has existed in the world so foolish or so
   vain as to live in this manner. [462]

    Chap. XXIII.--Of the Errors of Certain Philosophers, and of the Sun and
    Moon.

   Since, therefore, the leading men among the philosophers are themselves
   discovered to be of such emptiness, what shall we think of those lesser
   [463] ones, who are accustomed never to appear to themselves so wise,
   as when they boast of their contempt of money? Brave spirit! But I wait
   to see their conduct, and what are the results of that contempt. They
   avoid as an evil, and abandon the property handed down to them from
   their parents. And lest they should suffer shipwreck in a storm, they
   plunge headlong of their own accord in a calm, being resolute not by
   virtue, but by perverse fear; as those who, through fear of being slain
   by the enemy, slay themselves, that by death they may avoid death. So
   these men, without honour and without influence, throw away the means
   by which they might have acquired the glory of liberality. Democritus
   is praised because he abandoned his fields, and suffered them to become
   public pastures. I should approve of it, if he had given them. But
   nothing is done wisely which is useless and evil if it is done by all.
   But this negligence is tolerable. What shall I say of him who changed
   his possessions into money, which he threw into the sea? I doubt
   whether he was in his senses, or deranged. Away, he says, ye evil
   desires, into the deep. I will cast you away, lest I myself should be
   cast away by you. If you have so great a contempt for money, employ it
   in acts of kindness and humanity, bestow it upon the poor; this, which
   you are about to throw away, may be a succour to many, so that they may
   not die through famine, or thirst, or nakedness. Imitate at least the
   madness and fury of Tuditanus; [464] scatter abroad your property to be
   seized by the people. You have it in your power both to escape the
   possession of money, and yet to lay it out to advantage; for whatever
   has been profitable to many is securely laid out.

   But who approves of the equality of faults as laid down by Zeno? But
   let us omit that which is always received with derision by all. This is
   sufficient to prove the error of this madman, that he places pity among
   vices and diseases. He deprives us of an affection, which involves
   almost the whole course of human life. For since the nature of man is
   more feeble than that of the other animals, which divine providence has
   armed with natural means of protection, [465] either to endure the
   severity of the seasons or to ward off attacks from their bodies,
   because none of these things has been given to man, he has received in
   the place of all these things the affection of pity, which is truly
   called humanity, by which we might mutually protect each other. For if
   a man were rendered savage by the sight of another man, which we see
   happen in the case of those animals which are of a solitary [466]
   nature, there would be no society among men, no care or system in the
   building of cities; and thus life would not even be safe, since the
   weakness of men would both be exposed to the attacks of the other
   animals, and they would rage among themselves after the manner of wild
   beasts. Nor is his madness less in other things.

   For what can be said respecting him who asserted that snow was black?
   How naturally it followed, that he should also assert that pitch was
   white! This is he who said that he was born for this purpose, that he
   might behold the heaven and the sun, who beheld nothing on the earth
   when the sun was shining. Xenophanes most foolishly believed
   mathematicians who said that the orb of the moon was eighteen times
   larger than the earth; and, as was consistent with this folly, he said
   that within the concave surface of the moon there was another earth,
   and that there another race of men live in a similar manner to that in
   which we live on this earth. Therefore these lunatics have another
   moon, to hold forth to them a light by night, as this does to us. And
   perhaps this globe of ours may be a moon to another earth below this.
   [467] Seneca says that there was one among the Stoics who used to
   deliberate whether he should assign to the sun also its own
   inhabitants; he acted foolishly in doubting. For what injury would he
   have inflicted if he had assigned them? But I believe the heat deterred
   him, so as not to imperil so great a multitude; lest, if they should
   perish through excessive heat, so great a calamity should be said to
   have happened by his fault.

    Chap. XXIV.--Of the Antipodes, the Heaven, and the Stars.

   How is it with those who imagine that there are antipodes [468]
   opposite to our footsteps? Do they say anything to the purpose? Or is
   there any one so senseless as to believe that there are men whose
   footsteps are higher than their heads? or that the things which with us
   are in a recumbent position, with them hang in an inverted direction?
   that the crops and trees grow downwards? that the rains, and snow, and
   hail fall upwards to the earth? And does any one wonder that hanging
   gardens [469] are mentioned among the seven wonders of the world, when
   philosophers make hanging fields, and seas, and cities, and mountains?
   The origin of this error must also be set forth by us. For they are
   always deceived in the same manner. For when they have assumed anything
   false in the commencement of their investigations, led by the
   resemblance of the truth, they necessarily fall into those things which
   are its consequences. Thus they fall into many ridiculous things;
   because those things which are in agreement with false things, must
   themselves be false. But since they placed confidence in the first,
   they do not consider the character of those things which follow, but
   defend them in every way; whereas they ought to judge from those which
   follow, whether the first are true or false.

   What course of argument, therefore, led them to the idea of the
   antipodes? They saw the courses of the stars travelling towards the
   west; they saw that the sun and the moon always set towards the same
   quarter, and rise from the same. But since they did not perceive what
   contrivance regulated their courses, nor how they returned from the
   west to the east, but supposed that the heaven itself sloped downwards
   in every direction, which appearance it must present on account of its
   immense breadth, they thought that the world is round like a ball, and
   they fancied that the heaven revolves in accordance with the motion of
   the heavenly bodies; and thus that the stars and sun, when they have
   set, by the very rapidity of the motion of the world [470] are borne
   back to the east. Therefore they both constructed brazen orbs, as
   though after the figure of the world, and engraved upon them certain
   monstrous images, which they said were constellations. It followed,
   therefore, from this rotundity of the heaven, that the earth was
   enclosed in the midst of its curved surface. But if this were so, the
   earth also itself must be like a globe; for that could not possibly be
   anything but round, which was held enclosed by that which was round.
   But if the earth also were round, it must necessarily happen that it
   should present the same appearance to all parts of the heaven; that is,
   that it should raise aloft mountains, extend plains, and have level
   seas. And if this were so, that last consequence also followed, that
   there would be no part of the earth uninhabited by men and the other
   animals. Thus the rotundity of the earth leads, in addition, to the
   invention of those suspended antipodes.

   But if you inquire from those who defend these marvellous fictions, why
   all things do not fall into that lower part of the heaven, they reply
   that such is the nature of things, that heavy bodies are borne to the
   middle, and that they are all joined together towards the middle, as we
   see spokes in a wheel; but that the bodies which are light, as mist,
   smoke, and fire, are borne away from the middle, so as to seek the
   heaven. I am at a loss what to say respecting those who, when they have
   once erred, consistently persevere in their folly, and defend one vain
   thing by another; but that I sometimes imagine that they either discuss
   philosophy for the sake of a jest, or purposely and knowingly undertake
   to defend falsehoods, as if to exercise or display their talents on
   false subjects. But I should be able to prove by many arguments that it
   is impossible for the heaven to be lower than the earth, were is not
   that this book must now be concluded, and that some things still
   remain, which are more necessary for the present work. And since it is
   not the work of a single book to run over the errors of each
   individually, let it be sufficient to have enumerated a few, from which
   the nature of the others may be understood.

    Chap. XXV.--Of Learning Philosophy, and What Great Qualifications are
    Necessary for Its Pursuit.

   We must now speak a few things concerning philosophy in general, that
   having strengthened our cause we may conclude. That greatest imitator
   of Plato among our writers thought that philosophy was not for the
   multitude, because none but learned men could attain to it.
   "Philosophy," says Cicero, [471] "is contented with a few judges, of
   its own accord designedly avoiding the multitude." It is not therefore
   wisdom, if it avoids the concourse of men; since, if wisdom is given to
   man, it is given to all without any distinction, so that there is no
   one at all who cannot acquire it. But they so embrace virtue, which is
   given to the human race, that they alone of all appear to wish to enjoy
   that which is a public good; being as envious as if they should wish to
   bind or tear out the eyes of others that they may not see the sun. For
   what else is it to deny wisdom to men, than to take away from their
   minds the true and divine light? But if the nature of man is capable of
   wisdom, it was befitting that both workmen, and country people, and
   women, and all, in short, who bear the human form, should be taught to
   be wise; and that the people should be brought together from every
   language, and condition, and sex, and age. Therefore it is a very
   strong argument that philosophy neither tends to wisdom, nor is of
   itself wisdom, that its mystery is only made known by the beard and
   cloak of the philosophers. [472] The Stoics, moreover, perceived this,
   who said that philosophy was to be studied both by slaves and women;
   Epicurus also, who invites those who are altogether unacquainted with
   letters to philosophy; and Plato also, who wished to compose a state of
   wise men.

   They attempted, indeed, to do that which truth required; but they were
   unable to proceed beyond words. First, because instruction in many arts
   is necessary for an application to philosophy. Common learning must be
   acquired on account of practice in reading, because in so great a
   variety of subjects it is impossible that all things should be learned
   by hearing, or retained in the memory. No little attention also must be
   given to the grammarians, in order that you may know the right method
   of speaking. That must occupy many years. Nor must there be ignorance
   of rhetoric, that you may be able to utter and express the things which
   you have learned. Geometry also, and music, and astronomy, are
   necessary, because these arts have some connection with philosophy; and
   the whole of these subjects cannot be learned by women, who must learn
   within the years of their maturity the duties which are hereafter about
   to be of service to them for domestic uses; nor by servants, who must
   live in service during those years especially in which they are able to
   learn; nor by the poor, or labourers, or rustics, who have to gain
   their daily support by labour. And on this account Tully says that
   philosophy is averse from the multitude. But yet Epicurus will receive
   the ignorant. [473] How, then, will they understand those things which
   are said respecting the first principles of things, the perplexities
   and intricacies of which are scarcely attained to by men of cultivated
   minds?

   Therefore, in subjects which are involved in obscurity, and confused by
   a variety of intellects, and set off by the studied language of
   eloquent men, what place is there for the unskilful and ignorant?
   Lastly, they never taught any women to study philosophy, except
   Themiste [474] only, within the whole memory of man; nor slaves, except
   Phædo [475] only, who is said, when living in oppressive slavery, to
   have been ransomed and taught by Cebes. They also enumerate Plato and
   Diogenes: these, however, were not slaves, though they had fallen into
   servitude, for they had been taken captive. A certain Aniceris is said
   to have ransomed Plato for eight sesterces. And on this account Seneca
   severely rebuked the ransomer himself, because he set so small value
   upon Plato. He was a madman, as it seems to me, who was angry with a
   man because he did not throw away much money; doubtless he ought to
   have weighed gold as though to ransom the corpse of Hector, or to have
   insisted upon the payment of more money than the seller demanded.
   Moreover, they taught none of the barbarians, with the single exception
   of Anacharsis the Scythian, who never would have dreamed of philosophy
   had he not previously learned both language and literature.

    Chap. XXVI.--It is Divine Instruction Only Which Bestows Wisdom; And of What
    Efficacy the Law of God is.

   That, therefore, which they perceived to be justly required by the
   demands of nature, but which they were themselves unable to perform,
   and saw that the philosophers could not effect, is accomplished only by
   divine instruction; for that only is wisdom. Doubtless they were able
   to persuade any one who do not even persuade themselves of anything; or
   they will crush the desires, moderate the anger, and restrain the lusts
   of any one, when they themselves both yield to vices, and acknowledge
   that they are overpowered by nature. But what influence is exerted on
   the souls of men by the precepts of God, because of their simplicity
   and truth, is shown by daily proofs. Give me a man who is passionate,
   scurrilous, and unrestrained; with a very few words of God,


   "I will render him as gentle as a sheep." [476]

   Give me one who is grasping, covetous, and tenacious; I will presently
   restore him to you liberal, and freely bestowing his money with full
   hands. Give me a man who is afraid of pain and death; he shall
   presently despise crosses, and fires, and the bull of Phalaris. [477]
   Give me one who is lustful, an adulterer, a glutton; you shall
   presently see him sober, chaste, and temperate. Give me one who is
   cruel and bloodthirsty: that fury shall presently be changed into true
   clemency. Give me a man who is unjust, foolish, an evil-doer; forthwith
   he shall be just, and wise, and innocent: for by one laver [478] all
   his wickedness shall be taken away. So great is the power of divine
   wisdom, that, when infused into the breast of man, by one impulse it
   once for all expels folly, which is the mother of faults, for the
   effecting of which there is no need of payment, or books, or nightly
   studies. These results are accomplished gratuitously, easily, and
   quickly, if only the ears are open and the breast thirsts for wisdom.
   Let no one fear: we do not sell water, nor offer the sun for a reward.
   The fountain of God, most abundant and most full, is open to all; and
   this heavenly light rises for all, [479] as many as have eyes. Did any
   of the philosophers effect these things, or is he able to effect them
   if he wishes? For though they spend their lives in the study of
   philosophy, they are neither able to improve any other person nor
   themselves (if nature has presented any obstacle). Therefore their
   wisdom, doing its utmost, does not eradicate, but hide vices. But a few
   precepts of God so entirely change the whole man, and having put off
   the old man, render him new, that you would not recognise him as the
   same.

    Chap. XXVII.--How Little the Precepts of Philosophers Contribute to True
    Wisdom, Which You Will Find in Religion Only.

   What, then? Do they enjoin nothing similar? Yes, indeed, many things;
   and they frequently approach the truth. But those precepts have no
   weight, because they are human, and are without a greater, that is,
   that divine authority. No one therefore believes them, because the
   hearer imagines himself to be a man, just as he is, who enjoins them.
   Moreover, there is no certainty with them, nothing which proceeds from
   knowledge. But since all things are done by conjecture, and many
   differing and various things are brought forward, it is the part of a
   most foolish man to be willing to obey their precepts, since it is
   doubted whether they are true or false; and therefore no one obeys
   them, because no one wishes to labour for an uncertainty. The Stoics
   say that it is virtue which can alone produce a happy life. Nothing can
   be said with greater truth. But what if he shall be tormented, or
   afflicted with pain? Will it be possible for any one to be happy in the
   hands of the executioners? But truly pain inflicted upon the body is
   the material of virtue; therefore he is not wretched even in tortures.
   Epicurus speaks much more strongly. The wise man, he says, is always
   happy; and even when shut up in the bull of Phalaris he will utter this
   speech: "It is pleasant, and I do not care for it." Who would not laugh
   at him? Especially, because a man who is devoted to pleasure took upon
   himself the character of a man of fortitude, and that to an immoderate
   degree; for it is impossible that any one should esteem tortures of the
   body as pleasures, since it is sufficient for discharging the office of
   virtue that one sustains and endures them. What do you, Stoics, say?
   What do you, Epicurus? The wise man is happy even when be is tortured.
   If it is on account of the glory of his endurance, he will not enjoy
   it, for perchance he will die under the tortures. If it is on account
   of the recollection of the deed, either he will not perceive it if
   souls shall perish, or, if he shall perceive it, he will gain nothing
   from it.

   What other advantage is there then in virtue? what happiness of life?
   Is it that a man may die with equanimity? You present to me the
   advantage of a single hour, or perhaps moment, for the sake of which it
   may not be expedient to be worn out by miseries and labours throughout
   the whole of life. But how much time does death occupy? on the arrival
   of which it now makes no difference whether you shall have undergone it
   with equanimity or not. Thus it happens that nothing is sought from
   virtue but glory. But this is either superfluous and short-lived, or it
   will not follow from the depraved judgments of men. Therefore there is
   no fruit from virtue where virtue is subject to death and decay.
   Therefore they who said these things saw a certain shadow [480] of
   virtue; they did not see virtue itself. For they had their eyes fixed
   on the earth, nor did they raise their countenances on high that they
   might behold her


   "Who showed herself from the quarters of heaven." [481]

   This is the reason why no one obeys their precepts; inasmuch as they
   either train men to vices, if they defend pleasure; or if they uphold
   virtue, they neither threaten sin with any punishment, except that of
   disgrace only, nor do they promise any reward to virtue, except that of
   honour and praise only, since they say that virtue is to be sought for
   its own sake, and not on account of any other object. The wise man
   therefore is happy under tortures; but when he suffers torture on
   account of his faith, on account of justice, or on account of God, that
   endurance of pain will render him most happy. For it is God alone who
   can honour virtue, the reward of which is immortality alone. And they
   who do not seek this, nor possess religion, with which eternal life is
   connected, assuredly do not know the power of virtue, the reward of
   which they are ignorant; nor look towards heaven, as they themselves
   imagine that they do, when they inquire into subjects which do not
   admit of investigation, since there is no other cause for looking
   towards heaven, unless it be either to undertake religion, or to
   believe that one's soul is immortal. For if any one understands that
   God is to be worshipped, or has the hope of immortality set before him,
   his mind [482] is in heaven; and although he may not behold it with his
   eyes, yet he does behold it with the eye of his soul. But they who do
   not take up religion are of the earth, for religion is from heaven; and
   they who think that the soul perishes together with the body, equally
   look down towards the earth: for beyond the body, which is earth, they
   see nothing further, which is immortal. It is therefore of no profit
   that man is so made, that with upright body he looks towards heaven,
   unless with mind raised aloft he discerns God, and his thoughts are
   altogether engaged upon the hope of everlasting life.

    Chap. XXVIII.--Of True Religion and of Nature. Whether Fortune is a Goddess,
    and of Philosophy.

   Wherefore there is nothing else in life on which our plan and condition
   can depend but the knowledge of God who created us, and the religious
   and pious worship of Him; and since the philosophers have wandered from
   this, it is plain that they were not wise. They sought wisdom, indeed;
   but because they did not seek it in a right manner, they sunk down to a
   greater distance, and fell into such great errors, that they did not
   even possess common wisdom. For they were not only unwilling to
   maintain religion, but they even took it away; while, led on by the
   appearance of false virtue, they endeavour to free the mind from all
   fear: and this overturning of religion gains the name of nature. For
   they, either being ignorant by whom the world was made, or wishing to
   persuade men that nothing was completed by divine intelligence, said
   that nature was the mother of all things, as though they should say
   that all things were produced of their own accord: by which word they
   altogether confess their own ignorance. For nature, apart from divine
   providence and power, is absolutely nothing. But if they call God
   nature, what perverseness is it, to use the name of nature rather than
   of God! [483] But if nature is the plan, or necessity, or condition of
   birth, it is not by itself capable of sensation; but there must
   necessarily be a divine mind, which by its foresight furnishes the
   beginning of their existence to all things. Or if nature is heaven and
   earth, and everything which is created, nature is not God, but the work
   of God.

   By a similar error they believe in the existence of fortune, as a
   goddess mocking the affairs of then with various casualties, because
   they know not from what source things good and evil happen to them.
   They think that they are brought together to do battle with her; nor do
   they assign any reason by whom and on what account they are thus
   matched; but they only boast that they are every moment carrying on a
   contest for life and death with fortune. Now, as many as have consoled
   any persons on account of the death and removal of friends, have
   censured the name of fortune with the most severe accusations; nor is
   there any disputation of theirs on the subject of virtue, in which
   fortune is not harassed. M. Tullius, in his Consolation, says that he
   has always fought against fortune, and that she was always overpowered
   by him when he had valiantly beaten back the attacks of his enemies;
   that he was not subdued by her even then, when he was driven from his
   home and deprived of his country; but then, when he lost his dearest
   daughter, he shamefully confesses that he is overcome by fortune. I
   yield, he says, and raise my hand. [484] What is more wretched than
   this man, who thus lies prostrate? He acts foolishly, he says; but it
   is one who professes that he is wise. What, then, does the assumption
   of the name imply? What that contempt of things which is laid claim to
   with magnificent words? What that dress, so different from others? Or
   why do you give precepts of wisdom at all, if no one has yet been found
   who is wise? And does any one bear ill-will to us because we deny that
   philosophers are wise, when they themselves confess that they neither
   have knowledge nor wisdom? For if at any time they have so failed that
   they are not even able to feign anything, as their practice is in other
   cases, then in truth they are reminded of their ignorance; and, as
   though in madness, they spring up and exclaim that they are blind and
   foolish. Anaxagoras pronounces that all things are overspread with
   darkness. Empedocles complains that the paths of the senses are narrow,
   as though for his reflections he had need of a chariot and four horses.
   Democritus says that the truth lies sunk in a well so deep that it has
   no bottom; foolishly, indeed, as he says other things. For the truth is
   not, as it were, sunk in a well to which it was permitted him to
   descend, or even to fall, but, as it were, placed on the highest top of
   a lofty mountain, or in heaven, which is most true. For what reason is
   there why he should say that it is sunk below rather than that it is
   raised aloft? unless by chance he preferred to place the mind also in
   the feet, or in the bottom of the heels, rather than in the breast or
   in the head.

   So widely removed were they from the truth itself, that even the
   posture of their own body did not admonish them, that the truth must be
   sought for by them in the highest place. [485] From this despair arose
   that confession of Socrates, in which he said that he knew nothing but
   this one thing alone, that he knew nothing. From this flowed the system
   of the Academy, if that is to be called a system in which ignorance is
   both learnt and taught. But not even those who claimed for themselves
   knowledge were able consistently to defend that very thing which they
   thought that they knew. For since they were not in agreement [486] with
   one another, through their ignorance of divine things they were so
   inconsistent and uncertain, and often asserting things contrary to one
   another, that you are unable to determine and decide what their meaning
   was. Why therefore should you fight against those men who perish by
   their own sword? Why should you labour to refute those whom their own
   speech refutes and presses? [487] Aristotle, says Cicero, accusing the
   ancient philosophers, declares that they are either most foolish or
   most vainglorious, since they thought that philosophy was perfected by
   their talents; but that he saw, because a great addition had been made
   in a few years, that philosophy would be complete in a short time.
   What, then, was that time? In what manner, when, or by whom, was
   philosophy completed? For that which he said, that they were most
   foolish in supposing that philosophy was made perfect by their talents,
   is true; but he did not even himself speak with sufficient discretion,
   who thought that it had either been begun by the ancients, or increased
   by those who were more recent, or that it would shortly be brought to
   perfection by those of later times. For that can never be investigated
   which is not sought by its own way.

    Chap. XXIX.--Of Fortune Again, and Virtue.

   But let us return to the subject which we laid aside. Fortune,
   therefore, by itself, is nothing; nor must we so regard it as though it
   had any perception, since fortune is the sudden and unexpected
   occurrence of accidents. But philosophers, that they may not sometimes
   fail to err, wish to be wise in a foolish matter; and say that she is
   not a goddess, as is generally believed, but a god. Sometimes, however,
   they call this god nature, sometimes fortune, "because he brings
   about," says the same Cicero, "many things unexpected by us, on account
   of our want of intelligence and our ignorance of causes." Since,
   therefore, they are ignorant of the causes on account of which anything
   is done, they must also be ignorant of him who does them. The same
   writer, in a work of great seriousness, in which he was giving to his
   son precepts of life drawn from philosophy, says, "Who can be ignorant
   that the power of fortune is great on either side? For both when we
   meet with a prosperous breeze from her we gain the issues which we
   desire, and when she has breathed contrary to us we are dashed on the
   rocks." [488] First of all, he who says that nothing can be known,
   spoke this as though he himself and all men had knowledge. Then he who
   endeavours to render doubtful even the things which are plain, thought
   that this was plain, which ought to have been to him especially
   doubtful; for to a wise man it is altogether false. Who, he says, knows
   not? I indeed know not. Let him teach me, if he can, what that power
   is, what that breeze, and what the contrary breath.

   It is disgraceful, therefore, for a man of talent to say that, which if
   you were to deny it, he would be unable to prove. Lastly, he who says
   that the assent must be withheld because it is the part of a foolish
   man rashly to assent to things which are unknown to him, he, I say,
   altogether believed the opinions of the vulgar and uninstructed, who
   think that it is fortune which gives to men good and evil things. For
   they represent her image with the horn of plenty and with a rudder, as
   though she both gave wealth and had the government of human affairs.
   And to this opinion Virgil [489] assented, who calls fortune
   omnipotent; and the historian [490] who says, But assuredly fortune
   bears sway in everything. What place, then, remains for the other gods?
   Why is she not said to reign by herself, if she has more power than
   others; or why is she not alone worshipped, if she has power in all
   things? Or if she inflicts evils only, let them bring forward some
   cause why, if she is a goddess, she envies men, and desires their
   destruction, though she is religiously worshipped by them; why she is
   more favourable to the wicked and more unfavourable to the good; why
   she plots, afflicts, deceives, exterminates; who appointed her as the
   perpetual harasser of the race of men; why, in short, she has obtained
   so mischievous a power, that she renders all things illustrious or
   obscure according to her caprice rather than in accordance with the
   truth. Philosophers, I say, ought rather to have inquired into these
   things, than rashly to have accused fortune, who is innocent: for
   although she has some existence, yet no reason can be brought forward
   by them why she should be as hostile to men as she is supposed to be.
   Therefore all those speeches in which they rail at the injustice of
   fortune, and in opposition to fortune arrogantly boast of their own
   virtues, are nothing else but the ravings of thoughtless levity.

   Wherefore let them not envy us, to whom God has revealed the truth:
   who, as we know that fortune is nothing, so also know that there is a
   wicked and crafty spirit who is unfriendly to the good, and the enemy
   of righteousness, who acts in opposition to God; the cause of whose
   enmity we have explained in the second book. [491] He therefore lays
   plots against all; but those who are ignorant of God he hinders by
   error, he overwhelms with folly, he overspreads with darkness, that no
   one may be able to attain to the knowledge of the divine name, in which
   alone are contained both wisdom and everlasting life. Those, on the
   other hand, who know God, he assails with wiles and craft, that he may
   ensnare them with desire and lust, and when they are corrupted by the
   blandishments of sin, may impel them to death; or, if he shall have not
   succeeded by stratagem, he attempts to cast them down by force and
   violence. For on this account he was not at once thrust down by God to
   punishment at the original transgression, that by his malice he may
   exercise man to virtue: for unless this is in constant agitation,
   unless it is strengthened by continual harassing, it cannot be perfect,
   inasmuch as virtue is dauntless and unconquered patience in enduring
   evils. From which it comes to pass that there is no virtue if an
   adversary is wanting. When, therefore, they perceived the force of this
   perverse power opposed to virtue, and were ignorant of its name, they
   invented for themselves the senseless name of fortune; and how far this
   is removed from wisdom, Juvenal declares in these verses: [492] --


   "No divine power is absent if there is prudence; but we make you a
   goddess, O Fortune, and place you in heaven."

   It was folly, therefore, and error, and blindness, and, as Cicero says,
   [493] ignorance of facts and causes, which introduced the names of
   Nature and Fortune. But as they are ignorant of their adversary, so
   also they do not indeed know virtue the knowledge of which is derived
   from the idea of an adversary. And if this is joined with wisdom, or,
   as they say, is itself also wisdom, they must be ignorant in what
   subjects it is contained. For no one can possibly be furnished with
   true arms if he is ignorant of the enemy against whom he must be armed;
   nor can he overcome his adversary, who in fighting does not attack his
   real enemy, but a shadow. For he will be overthrown, who, having his
   attention fixed on another object, shall not previously have foreseen
   or guarded against the blow aimed at his vitals.

    Chap. XXX.--The Conclusion of the Things Before Spoken; And by What Means We
    Must Pass from the Vanity of the Philosophers to True Wisdom, and the
    Knowledge of the True God, in Which Alone are Virtue and Happiness.

   I have taught, as far as my humble talents permitted, that the
   philosophers held a course widely deviating from the truth. I perceive,
   however, how many things I have omitted, because it was not my province
   to enter into a disputation against philosophers. But it was necessary
   for me to make a digression to this subject, that I might show that so
   many and great intellects have expended themselves in vain on false
   subjects, lest any one by chance being shut out by corrupt
   superstitions, should wish to betake himself to them as though about to
   find some certainty. Therefore the only hope, the only safety for man,
   is placed in this doctrine, which we defend. All the wisdom of man
   consists in this alone, the knowledge and worship of God: this is our
   tenet, this our opinion. Therefore with all the power of my voice I
   testify, I proclaim, I declare: Here, here is that which all
   philosophers have sought throughout their whole life; and yet, they
   have not been able to investigate, to grasp, and to attain to it,
   because they either retained a religion which was corrupt, or took it
   away altogether. Let them therefore all depart, who do not instruct
   human life, but throw it into confusion. For what do they teach? or
   whom do they instruct, who have not yet instructed themselves? whom are
   the sick able to heal, whom can the blind guide? Let us all, therefore,
   who have any regard for wisdom, betake ourselves to this subject. Or
   shall we wait until Socrates knows something? or Anaxagoras finds light
   in the darkness? or until Democritus draws forth truth from the well?
   or Empedocles extends the paths of his soul? or until Arcesilas and
   Carneades see, and feel, and perceive?

   Lo, a voice from heaven teaching the truth, and displaying to us a
   light brighter than the sun itself. [494] Why are we unjust to
   ourselves, and delay to take up wisdom, which learned men, though they
   wasted their lives in its pursuit, were never able to discover. Let him
   who wishes to be wise and happy hear the voice of God, learn
   righteousness, understand the mystery of his birth, despise human
   affairs, embrace divine things, that he may gain that chief good to
   which he was born. Having overthrown all false religions, and having
   refuted all the arguments, as many as it was customary or possible to
   bring forward in their defence; then, having proved the systems of
   philosophy to be false, we must now come to true religion and wisdom,
   since, as I shall teach, they are both connected together; that we may
   maintain it either by arguments, or by examples, or by competent
   witnesses, and may show that the folly with which those worshippers of
   gods do not cease to upbraid us, has no existence with us, but lies
   altogether with them. And although, in the former books, when I was
   contending against false religions, and in this, when I was
   overthrowing false wisdom, I showed where the truth is, yet the next
   book will more plainly indicate what is true religion and what true
   wisdom.

  Of True Wisdom and Religion.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. I.--Of the Former Religion of Men, and How Error Was Spread Over Every
    Age, and of the Seven Wise Men of Greece.

   When I reflect, O Emperor Constantine, and often revolve in my mind the
   original condition of men, it is accustomed to appear alike wonderful
   and unworthy that, by the folly of one age embracing various
   superstitions, and believing in the existence of many gods, they
   suddenly arrived at such ignorance of themselves, that the truth being
   taken away from their eyes, the religion of the true God was not
   observed, nor the condition of human nature, since men did not seek the
   chief good in heaven, but on earth. And on this account assuredly the
   happiness of the ancient ages was changed. For, having left God, the
   parent and founder of all things, men began to worship the senseless
   works [495] of their own hands. And what were the effects of this
   corruption, or what evils it introduced, the subject itself
   sufficiently declares. For, turning away from the chief good, which is
   blessed and everlasting on this account, because it cannot be seen,
   [496] or touched, or comprehended, and from the virtues which are in
   agreement with that good, and which are equally immortal, gliding down
   to these corrupt and frail gods, and devoting themselves to those
   things by which the body only is adorned, and nourished, and delighted,
   they sought eternal death for themselves, together with their gods and
   goods relating to the body, because all bodies are subject to death.
   Superstitions of this kind, therefore, were followed by injustice and
   impiety, as must necessarily be the case. For men ceased to raise their
   countenances to the heaven; but, their minds being depressed downwards,
   clung to goods of the earth, as they did to earth-born superstitions.
   There followed the disagreement of mankind, and fraud, and all
   wickedness; because, despising eternal and incorruptible goods, which
   alone ought to be desired by man, they rather chose temporal and
   short-lived things, and greater trust was placed by men in evil,
   inasmuch as they preferred vice to virtue, because it had presented
   itself as nearer at hand. [497]

   Thus human life, which in former ages had been occupied with the
   clearest light, was overspread with gloom and darkness; and in
   conformity with this depravity, when wisdom was taken away, then at
   length men began to claim for themselves the name of wise. For at the
   time when all were wise, no one was called by that name. And would that
   this name, once common to all the class, though reduced to a few, still
   retained its power! For those few might perhaps be able, either by
   talent, or by authority, or by continual exhortations, to free the
   people from vices and errors. But so entirely had wisdom died out, that
   it is evident, from the very arrogance of the name, that no one of
   those who were so called was really wise. And yet, before the discovery
   of this philosophy, as it is termed, there are said to have been seven,
   [498] who, because they ventured to inquire into and discuss natural
   subjects, deserved to be esteemed and called wise men.

   O wretched and calamitous age, in which through the whole world there
   were only seven who were called by the name of men, for no one can
   justly be called a man unless he is wise! But if all the others besides
   themselves were foolish, even they themselves were not wise, because no
   one can be truly wise in the judgment of the foolish. So far were they
   removed from wisdom, that not even afterwards, when learning increased,
   and many and great intellects were always intent upon this very
   subject, could the truth be perceived and ascertained. For, after the
   renown of those seven wise men, it is incredible with how great a
   desire of inquiring into the truth all Greece was inflamed. And first
   of all, they thought [499] the very name of wisdom arrogant, and did
   not call themselves wise men, but desirous of wisdom. By which deed
   they both condemned those who had rashly arrogated to themselves the
   name of wise men, of error and folly, and themselves also of ignorance,
   which indeed they did not deny. For wherever the nature of the subject
   had, as it were, laid its hands upon their minds, so that they were
   unable to give any account, they were accustomed to testify that, they
   knew nothing, and discerned nothing. Wherefore they are found to be
   much wiser, who in some degree saw themselves, than those who had
   believed that they were wise.

    Chap. II.--Where Wisdom is to Be Found; Why Pythagoras and Plato Did Not
    Approach the Jews.

   Wherefore, if they were not wise who were so called, nor those of later
   times, who did not hesitate to confess their want of wisdom, what
   remains but that wisdom is to be sought elsewhere, since it has not
   been found where it was sought. But what can we suppose to have been
   the reason why it was not found, though sought with the greatest
   earnestness and labour by so many intellects, and during so many ages,
   unless it be that philosophers sought for it out of their own limits?
   And since they traversed and explored all parts, but nowhere found any
   wisdom, and it must of necessity be somewhere, it is evident that it
   ought especially to be sought there where the title of folly [500]
   appears; under the covering of which God hides the treasury of wisdom
   and truth, lest the secret of His divine work should be exposed to
   view. [501] Whence I am accustomed to wonder that, when Pythagoras, and
   after him Plato, inflamed with the love of searching out the truth, had
   penetrated as far as to the Egyptians, and Magi, and Persians, that
   they might become acquainted with their religious rites and
   institutions (for they suspected that wisdom was concerned with
   religion), they did not approach the Jews only, in whose possession
   alone it then was, and to whom they might have gone more easily. But I
   think that they were turned away from them by divine providence, that
   they might not know the truth, because it was not yet permitted for the
   religion of the true God and righteousness to become known to men of
   other nations. [502] For God had determined, as the last time drew
   near, [503] to send from heaven a great leader, [504] who should reveal
   to foreign nations that which was taken away from a perfidious [505]
   and ungrateful people. And I will endeavour to discuss the subject in
   this book, if I shall first have shown that wisdom is so closely united
   with religion, that the one cannot be separated from the other.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. III.--Wisdom and Religion Cannot Be Separated: the Lord of Nature Must
    Necessarily Be the Father of Every One.

   The worship of the gods, as I have taught in the former book, does not
   imply wisdom; not only because it gives up man, who is a divine animal,
   to earthly and frail things, but because nothing is fixed in it which
   may avail for the cultivation of the character and the framing of the
   life; nor does it contain any investigation of the truth, but only the
   rite of worship, which does not consist in the service of the mind, but
   in the employment of the body. And therefore that is not to be deemed
   true religion, because it instructs and improves men by no precepts of
   righteousness and virtue. Thus philosophy, inasmuch as it does not
   possess true religion, that is, the highest piety, is not true wisdom.
   For if the divinity which governs this world supports mankind with
   incredible beneficence, and cherishes it as with paternal indulgence,
   wishes truly that gratitude should be paid, and honour given to itself,
   man cannot preserve his piety if he shall prove ungrateful for the
   heavenly benefits; and this is certainly not the part of a wise man.
   Since, therefore, as I have said, philosophy and the religious system
   of the gods are separated, and far removed from each other; seeing that
   some are professors of wisdom, through whom it is manifest that there
   is no approach to the gods, and that others are priests of religion,
   through whom wisdom is not learned; it is manifest that the one is not
   true wisdom, and that the other is not true religion. Therefore
   philosophy was not able to conceive the truth, nor was the religious
   system of the gods able to give an account of itself, since it is
   without it. But where wisdom is joined by an inseparable connection
   with religion, both must necessarily be true; because in our worship we
   ought to be wise, that is, to know the proper object and mode of
   worship, and in our wisdom to worship, that is, to complete our
   knowledge by deed and action.

   Where, then, is wisdom joined with religion? There, indeed, where the
   one God is worshipped, where life and every action is referred to one
   source, and to one supreme authority: in short, the teachers of wisdom
   are the same, who are also the priests of God. [506] Nor, however, let
   it affect any one, because it often has happened, and may happen, that
   some philosopher may undertake a priesthood of the gods; and when this
   happens, philosophy is not, however, joined with religion; but
   philosophy will both be unemployed amidst sacred rites, and religion
   will be unemployed when philosophy shall be treated of. For that system
   of religious rites is dumb, not only because it relates to gods who are
   dumb, but also because its observance is by the hand and the fingers,
   not by the heart and tongue, as is the case with ours, which is true.
   Therefore religion is contained in wisdom, and wisdom in religion. The
   one, then, cannot be separated from the other; because wisdom is
   nothing else but the worship of the true God with just and pious
   adoration. But that the worship of many gods is not in accordance with
   nature, may be inferred and conceived even by this argument: that every
   god who is worshipped by man must, amidst the solemn rites and prayers,
   be invoked as father, not only for the sake of honour, but also of
   reason; because he is both more ancient than man, and because he
   affords life, safety, and sustenance, as a father does. Therefore
   Jupiter is called father by those who pray to him, as is Saturnus, and
   Janus, and Liber, and the rest in order; which Lucilius [507] laughs at
   in the council of the gods: "So that there is none of us who is not
   called excellent father of the gods; so that father Neptunus, Liber,
   father Saturnus, Mars, Janus, father Quirinus, are called after one
   name." But if nature does not permit that one man should have many
   fathers (for he is produced from one only), therefore the worship of
   many gods is contrary to nature, and contrary to piety.

   One only, therefore, is to be worshipped, who can truly be called
   Father. He also must of necessity be Lord, because as He has power to
   indulge, so also has He power to restrain. He is to be called Father on
   this account, because He bestows upon us many and great things; and
   Lord on this account, because He has the greatest power of chastising
   and punishing. But that He who is Father is also Lord, is shown even by
   reference to civil law. [508] For who will be able to bring up sons,
   unless he has the power of a lord over them? Nor without reason is he
   called father of a household, [509] although he only has sons: for it
   is plain that the name of father embraces also slaves, because
   "household" follows; and the name of "household" comprises also sons,
   because the name of "father" precedes: from which it is evident, that
   the same person is both father of his slaves [510] and lord of his
   sons. Lastly, the son is set at liberty as if he were a slave; and the
   liberated slave receives the name [511] of his patron, as if he were a
   son. But if a man is named father of a household, that it may appear
   that he is possessed of a double power, because as a father he ought to
   indulge, and as a lord to restrain, it follows that he who is a son is
   also a slave, and that he who is a father is also a lord. As,
   therefore, by the necessity of nature, there cannot be more than one
   father, so there can only be one lord. For what will the slave do if
   many lords [512] shall give commands at variance with each other?
   Therefore the worship of many gods is contrary to reason and to nature,
   since there cannot be many fathers or lords; but it is necessary to
   consider the gods both as fathers and lords.

   Therefore the truth cannot be held where the same man is subject to
   many fathers and lords, where the mind, drawn in different directions
   to many objects, wanders to and fro, hither and thither. Nor can
   religion have any firmness, when it is without a fixed and settled
   dwelling-place. Therefore there can be no true worship of many gods;
   just as that cannot be called matrimony, in which one woman has many
   husbands, but she will either be called a harlot or an adulteress. For
   when a woman is destitute of modesty, chastity, and fidelity, she must
   of necessity be without virtue. Thus also the religious system of the
   gods is unchaste and unholy, because it is destitute of faith, for that
   unsettled and uncertain honour has no source or origin.

   [508] Fathers in ancient times had the greatest power over their

   throughout the passage, for the sake of uniformity of expression,
   though in some places "servant" and "master" might seem more
   appropriate.

   [511] Among the Romans slaves had no prænomen or distinguishing name;
   when a slave was set at liberty, he was allowed to assume the name of
   his master as a prænomen. Thus, in Persius (Sat., v.), "Dama," the
   liberated slave, becomes "Marcus Dama."

   [512] Thus the slave in Terence wished to know how many masters he had.

    Chapter IV.--Of Wisdom Likewise, and Religion, and of the Right of Father
    and Lord.

   By these things it is evident how closely connected are wisdom and
   religion. Wisdom relates to sons, and this relation requires love;
   religion to servants, and this relation requires fear. For as the
   former are bound to love and honour their father, so are the latter
   bound to respect and venerate their lord. But with respect to God, who
   is one only, inasmuch as He sustains the twofold character both of
   Father and Lord, we are bound both to love Him, inasmuch as we are
   sons, and to fear Him, inasmuch as we are servants. [513] Religion,
   therefore, cannot be divided from wisdom, nor can wisdom be separated
   from religion; because it is the same God, who ought to be understood,
   which is the part of wisdom, and to be honoured, which is the part of
   religion. But wisdom precedes, religion follows; for the knowledge of
   God comes first, His worship is the result of knowledge. Thus in the
   two names there is but one meaning, though it seems to be different in
   each case. For the one is concerned with the understanding, the other
   with action. But, however, they resemble two streams flowing from one
   fountain. But the fountain of wisdom and religion is God; and if these
   two streams shall turn aside from Him, they must be dried up: for they
   who are ignorant of Him cannot be wise or religious.

   Thus it comes to pass that philosophers, and those who worship many
   gods, either resemble disinherited sons or runaway slaves, because the
   one do not seek their father, nor the other their master. And as they
   who are disinherited do not attain to the inheritance of their father,
   nor runaway slaves impunity, so neither will philosophers receive
   immortality, which is the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom, that is,
   the chief good, which they especially seek; nor will the worshippers of
   gods escape the penalty of everlasting death, which is the punishment
   of the true Master against those who are deserters [514] of His majesty
   and name. But that God is Father and also Lord was unknown to both, to
   the worshippers of the gods as well as to the professors of wisdom
   themselves: inasmuch as they either thought that nothing at all was to
   be worshipped; or they approved of false religions; or, although they
   understood the strength and power of the Supreme God (as Plato, who
   says that there is one God, Creator of the world, and Marcus Tullius,
   who acknowledges that man has been produced by the Supreme God in an
   excellent condition), nevertheless they did not render the worship due
   to Him as to the supreme Father, which was their befitting and
   necessary duty. But that the gods cannot be fathers or lords, is
   declared not only by their multitude, as I have shown above, [515] but
   also by reason: because it is not reported that man was made by gods,
   nor is it found that the gods themselves preceded the origin of man,
   since it appears that there were men on the earth before the birth of
   Vulcan, and Liber, and Apollo, and Jupiter himself. But the creation of
   man is not accustomed to be assigned to Saturnus, nor to his father
   Coelus.

   But if none of those who are worshipped is said to have originally
   formed and created man, it follows that none of these can be called the
   father of man, and so none of them can be God. Therefore it is not
   lawful to worship those by whom man was not produced, for he could not
   be produced by many. Therefore the one and only God ought to be
   worshipped, who was before Jupiter, and Saturnus, and Coelus himself,
   and the earth. For He must have fashioned man, who, before the creation
   of man, finished the heaven and the earth. He alone is to be called
   Father who created us; He alone is to be considered Lord who rules, who
   has the true and perpetual power of life and death. And he who does not
   adore Him is a foolish servant, who flees from or does not know his
   Master; and an undutiful son, who either hates or is ignorant of his
   true Father.

    Chap. V.--The Oracles of the Prophets Must Be Looked Into; And of Their
    Times, and the Times of the Judges and Kings.

   Now, since I have shown that wisdom and religion cannot be separated,
   it remains that we speak of religion itself, and wisdom. I am aware,
   indeed, how difficult it is to discuss heavenly subjects; but still the
   attempt must be ventured, that the truth may be made clear and brought
   to light, and that many may be freed from error and death, who despise
   and refuse the truth, while it is concealed under a covering of folly.
   But before I begin to speak of God and His works, I must first speak a
   few things concerning the prophets, whose testimony I must now use,
   which I have refrained from doing in the former books. Above all
   things, he who desires to comprehend the truth ought not only to apply
   his mind to understand the utterances of the prophets, but also most
   diligently to inquire into the times during which each one of them
   existed, that he may know what future events they predicted, and after
   how many years their predictions were fulfilled. [516] Nor is there any
   difficulty in making these computations; for they testified under what
   king each of them received the inspiration of the Divine Spirit. And
   many have written and published books respecting the times, making
   their commencement from the prophet Moses, who lived about seven
   hundred years before the Trojan war. But he, when he had governed the
   people for forty years, was succeeded by Joshua, who held the chief
   place twenty-seven years.

   After this they were under the government of judges during three
   hundred and seventy years. Then their condition was changed, and they
   began to have kings; and when they had ruled during four hundred and
   fifty years, until the reign of Zedekiah, the Jews having been besieged
   by the king of Babylon, and carried into captivity, [517] endured a
   long servitude, until, in the seventieth year afterwards, the captive
   Jews were restored to their own lands and settlements by Cyrus the
   elder, who attained the supreme power over the Persians, at the time
   when Tarquinius Superbus reigned at Rome. Wherefore, since the whole
   series of times may be collected both from the Jewish histories and
   from those of the Greeks and Romans, the times of the prophets
   individually may also be collected; the last of whom was Zechariah, and
   it is agreed on that he prophesied in the time of King Darius, in the
   second year of his reign, and in the eighth month. Of so much greater
   antiquity [518] are the prophets found to be than the Greek writers.
   And I bring forward all these things, that they may perceive their
   error who endeavour to refute Holy Scripture, as though it were new and
   recently composed, being ignorant from what fountain the origin of our
   holy religion flowed. But if any one, having put together and examined
   the times, shall duly lay the foundation of learning, and fully
   ascertain the truth, he will also lay aside his error when he has
   gained the knowledge of the truth.

    Chap. VI.--Almighty God Begat His Son; And the Testimonies of the Sibyls and
    of Trismegistus Concerning Him.

   God, therefore, the contriver and founder of all things, as we have
   said in the second book, before He commenced this excellent work of the
   world, begat a pure and incorruptible Spirit, whom He called His Son.
   And although He had afterwards created by Himself innumerable other
   beings, whom we call angels, this first-begotten, however, was the only
   one whom He considered worthy of being called by the divine name, as
   being powerful in His Father's excellence and majesty. But that there
   is a Son of the Most High God, who is possessed of the greatest power,
   is shown not only by the unanimous utterances of the prophets, but also
   by the declaration of Trismegistus and the predictions of the Sibyls.
   Hermes, in the book which is entitled The Perfect Word, made use of
   these words: "The Lord and Creator of all things, whom we have thought
   right to call God, since He made the second God visible and sensible.
   But I use the term sensible, not because He Himself perceives (for the
   question is not whether He Himself perceives), but because He leads
   [519] to perception and to intelligence. Since, therefore, He made Him
   first, and alone, and one only, He appeared to Him beautiful, and most
   full of all good things; and He hallowed Him, and altogether loved Him
   as His own Son." The Erythræan Sibyl, in the beginning of her poem,
   which she commenced with the Supreme God, proclaims the Son of God as
   the leader and commander of all, in these verses:--


   "The nourisher and creator of all things, who placed the sweet breath
   in all, and made God the leader of all."

   And again, at the end of the same poem:--


   "But whom God gave for faithful men to honour."

   And another Sibyl enjoins that He ought to be known:--


   "Know Him as your God, who is the Son of God."

   Assuredly He is the very Son of God, who by that most wise King
   Solomon, full of divine inspiration, spake these things which we have
   added: [520] , "God founded [521] me in the beginning of His ways, in
   His work before the ages. He set me up in the beginning, before He made
   the earth, and before He established the depths, before the fountains
   of waters came forth: the Lord begat me before all the hills; He made
   the regions, and the uninhabitable [522] boundaries under the heaven.
   When He prepared the heaven, I was by Him: and when He separated His
   own seat, when He made the strong clouds above the winds, and when He
   strengthened the mountains, and placed them under heaven; when He laid
   the strong foundations of the earth, I was with Him arranging all
   things. I was He in whom He delighted: I was daily delighted, when He
   rejoiced, the world being completed." But on this account Trismegistus
   spoke of Him as "the artificer of God," and the Sibyl calls Him
   "Counsellor," because He is endowed by God the Father with such wisdom
   and strength, that God employed both His wisdom and hands in the
   creation of the world.

    Chap. VII.--Of the Name of Son, and Whence He is Called Jesus and Christ.

   Some one may perhaps ask who this is who is so powerful, so beloved by
   God, and what name He has, who was not only begotten at first before
   the world, [523] but who also arranged it by His wisdom and constructed
   it by His might. First of all, it is befitting that we should know that
   His name is not known even to the angels who dwell in heaven, but to
   Himself only, and to God the Father; nor will that name be published,
   as the sacred writings relate, before that the purpose of God shall be
   fulfilled. In the next place, we must know that this name cannot be
   uttered by the mouth of man, as Hermes teaches, saying these things:
   "Now the cause of this cause is the will of the divine good which
   produced God, whose name cannot be uttered by the mouth of man." And
   shortly afterwards to His Son: "There is, O Son, a secret word of
   wisdom, holy respecting the only Lord of all things, and the God first
   perceived [524] by the mind, to speak of whom is beyond the power of
   man." But although His name, which the supreme Father gave Him from the
   beginning, is known to none but Himself, nevertheless He has one name
   among the angels, and another among men, since He is called Jesus [525]
   among men: for Christ is not a proper name, but a title of power and
   dominion; for by this the Jews were accustomed to call their kings. But
   the meaning of this name must be set forth, on account of the error of
   the ignorant, who by the change of a letter are accustomed to call Him
   Chrestus. [526] The Jews had before been directed to compose a sacred
   oil, with which those who were called to the priesthood [527] or to the
   kingdom might be anointed. And as now the robe of purple [528] is a
   sign of the assumption of royal dignity among the Romans, so with them
   the anointing with the holy oil conferred the title and power of king.
   But since the ancient Greeks used the word chri'esthai to express the
   art of anointing, which they now express by alei'phesthai, as the verse
   of Homer shows,


   "But the attendants washed, and anointed [529] them with oil;"

   on this account we call Him Christ, that is, the Anointed, who in
   Hebrew is called the Messias. Hence in some Greek writings, which are
   badly translated [530] from the Hebrew, the word eleimmenos [531] is
   found written, from the word aleiphesthai, [532] anointing. But,
   however, by either name a king is signified: not that He has obtained
   this earthly kingdom, the time for receiving which has not yet arrived,
   but that He sways a heavenly and eternal kingdom, concerning which we
   shall speak in the last book. But now let us speak of His first
   nativity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [523] Literally, "whose first nativity not only preceded the world." He
   speaks of the eternal generation of the Son, as distinguished from His
   incarnation, which he afterwards speaks of as His second nativity. [See

   [524] Or, perceiving.

   [525] Jesus, that is, [Joshua = ] Saviour.

   [526] Suetonius speaks of Christ as Chrestus. The Christians also were

   chresto's has the signification of kind, gentle, good. [Vol. i. [48]p.
   163.]

   [527] Each has reference to Christ, as He is King and Priest. Of the
   anointing of kings, see 1 Sam., and of priests, Lev. viii. [Of
   prophets, 1 Kings xix. 16.] The priesthood of Christ is most fully set
   forth in the Epistle to the Hebrews.

    Chap. VIII.--Of the Birth of Jesus in the Spirit and in the Flesh: of
    Spirits and the Testimonies of Prophets.

   For we especially testify that He was twice born, first in the spirit,
   and afterwards in the flesh. Whence it is thus spoken by Jeremiah:
   [533] "Before I formed Thee in the womb I knew Thee." And likewise by
   the same: "Who was blessed before He was born;" [534] which was the
   case with no one else but Christ. For though He was the Son of God from
   the beginning, [535] He was born again [536] a second time [537]
   according to the flesh: and this twofold birth of His has introduced
   great terror into the minds of men, and overspread with darkness even
   those who retained the mysteries of true religion. But we will show
   this plainly and clearly, that they who love wisdom may be more easily
   and diligently instructed. He who hears the Son of God mentioned ought
   not to conceive in his mind so great impiety as to think that God begat
   Him by marriage and union with a woman, which none does but an animal
   possessed of a body, and subject to death. But with whom could God
   unite Himself, since He is alone? or since His power was so great, that
   He accomplished whatever He wished, assuredly He did not require the
   co-operation [538] of another for procreation. Unless by chance we
   shall [profanely] imagine, as Orpheus supposed, that God is both male
   and female, because otherwise He would have been unable to beget,
   unless He had the power of each sex, as though He could have
   intercourse with Himself, or without such intercourse be unable to
   produce.

   But Hermes also was of the same opinion, when he says that He was "His
   own father," and "His own mother." [539] But if this were so, as He is
   called by the prophets father, so also He would be called mother. In
   what manner, then, did He beget Him? First of all, divine operations
   cannot be known or declared [540] by any one; but nevertheless the
   sacred writings teach us, in which it is laid down [541] that this Son
   of God is the speech, or even the reason [542] of God, and also that
   the other angels are spirits [543] of God. For speech is breath sent
   forth with a voice signifying something. But, however, since breath and
   speech are sent forth from different parts, inasmuch as breath proceeds
   from the nostrils, speech from the mouth, the difference between the
   Son of God and the other angels is great. For they proceeded from God
   as silent spirits, because they were not created to teach [544] the
   knowledge of God, but for His service. But though He is Himself also a
   spirit, yet He proceeded from the mouth of God with voice and sound, as
   the Word, on this account indeed, because He was about to make use of
   His voice to the people; that is, because He was about to be a teacher
   of the knowledge of God, and of the heavenly mystery [545] to be
   revealed to man: which word also God Himself first spoke, that through
   Him He might speak to us, and that He might reveal to us the voice and
   will of God.

   With good reason, therefore, is He called the Speech and the Word of
   God, because God, by a certain incomprehensible energy and power of His
   majesty, enclosed the vocal spirit proceeding from His mouth, which he
   had not conceived in the womb, but in His mind, within a form which has
   life through its own perception and wisdom, and He also fashioned other
   spirits of His into angels. Our spirits [546] are liable to
   dissolution, because we are mortal: but the spirits of God both live,
   and are lasting, and have perception; because He Himself is immortal,
   and the Giver both of perception [547] and life. Our expressions,
   although they are mingled with the air, and fade away, yet generally
   remain comprised in letters; how much more must we believe that the
   voice of God both remains for ever, and is accompanied with perception
   and power, which it has derived from God the Father, as a stream from
   its fountain! But if any one wonders that God could be produced from
   God by a putting forth of the voice and breath, if he is acquainted
   with the sacred utterances of the prophets he will cease to wonder.
   That Solomon and his father David were most powerful kings, and also
   prophets, may perhaps be known even to those who have not applied
   themselves to the sacred writings; the one of whom, who reigned
   subsequently to the other, preceded the destruction of the city of Troy
   by one hundred and forty years. His father, the writer of sacred hymns,
   thus speaks in the thirty-second Psalm: [548] "By the word of God were
   the heavens made firm; and all their power [549] by the breath of His
   mouth." And also again in the forty-fourth Psalm: [550] "My heart hath
   given utterance to a good word; I speak of my doings towards the king;"
   testifying, in truth, that the works of God are known to no other than
   to the Son alone, who is the Word of God, and who must reign for ever.
   Solomon also shows that it is the Word of God, and no other, [551] by
   whose hands these works of the world were made. "I," He says, "came
   forth out of the mouth of the Most High before all creatures: I caused
   the light that faileth not to arise in the heavens, and covered the
   whole earth with a cloud. I have dwelt in the height, and my throne is
   in the pillar of the cloud." [552] John also thus taught: "In the
   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
   God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by
   Him, and without Him was not anything made." [553]

    Chap. IX.--Of the Word of God.

   But the Greeks speak of Him as the Logos, [554] more befittingly than
   we do as the word, or speech: for Logos signifies both speech and
   reason, inasmuch as He is both the voice and the wisdom of God. And of
   this divine speech not even the philosophers were ignorant, since Zeno
   represents the Logos as the arranger of the established order of
   things, and the framer of the universe: whom also He calls Fate, and
   the necessity of things, and God, and the soul of Jupiter, in
   accordance with the custom, indeed, by which they are wont to regard
   Jupiter as God. But the words are no obstacle, since the sentiment is
   in agreement with the truth. For it is the spirit of God which he named
   the soul of Jupiter. For Trismegistus, who by some means or other
   searched into almost all truth, often described the excellence and
   majesty of the word, as the instance before mentioned declares, in
   which he acknowledges that there is an ineffable and sacred speech, the
   relation of which exceeds the measure of man's ability. I have spoken
   briefly, as I have been able, concerning the first nativity. Now I must
   more fully discuss the second, since this is the subject most
   controverted, that we may hold forth the light of understanding to
   those who desire to know the truth.

    Chap. X.--Of the Advent of Jesus; Of the Fortunes of the Jews, and Their
    Government, Until the Passion of the Lord.

   In the first place, then, men ought to know that the arrangements of
   the Most High God have so advanced from the beginning, that it was
   necessary, as the end of the world [555] approached, that the Son of
   God should descend to the earth, that He might build a temple for God,
   and teach righteousness; but, however, not with the might of an angel
   or with heavenly power, but in the form of man and in the condition of
   a mortal, that when He had discharged the office of His ministry, [556]
   He might be delivered into the hands of wicked men, and might undergo
   death, that, having subdued this also by His might, He might rise
   again, and bring to man, whose nature He had put on [557] and
   represented, the hope of overcoming death, and might admit him to the
   rewards of immortality. And that no one may be ignorant of this
   arrangement, we will show that all things were foretold which we see
   fulfilled in Christ. Let no one believe our assertion unless I shall
   show that the prophets before a long series of ages published that it
   should come to pass at length that the Son of God should be born as a
   man, and perform wonderful deeds, and sow [558] the worship of God
   throughout the whole earth, and at last be crucified, and on the third
   day rise again. And when I shall have proved all these things by the
   writings of those very men who treated with violence their God who had
   assumed a mortal body, what else will prevent it from being manifest
   that true wisdom is conversant with this religion only? Now the origin
   of the whole mystery is to be related.

   Our ancestors, [559] who were chiefs of the Hebrews, when they were
   distressed by famine and want, passed over into Egypt, that they might
   obtain a supply of corn; and sojourning there a long time, they were
   oppressed with an intolerable yoke of slavery. Then God pitied them,
   and led them out, and freed them from the hand of the king of the
   Egyptians, after four hundred and thirty [560] years, under the
   leadership of Moses, through whom the law was afterwards given to them
   by God; and in this leading out God displayed the power of His majesty.
   For He made His people to pass through the midst of the Red Sea, His
   angel [561] going before and dividing the water, so that the people
   might walk over the dry land, of whom it might more truly be said (as
   the poet says [562] ), that "the wave, closing over him after the
   appearance of a mountain, stood around him." And when he heard of this,
   the tyrant of the Egyptians followed with this great host of his men,
   and rashly entering the sea which still lay open, was destroyed,
   together with his whole army, by the waves returning [563] to their
   place. But the Hebrews, when they had entered into the wilderness, saw
   many wonderful deeds. For when they suffered thirst, a rock having been
   struck with a rod, a fountain of water sprung forth and refreshed the
   people. And again, when they were hungry, a shower [564] of heavenly
   nourishment descended. Moreover, also, the wind [565] brought quails
   into their camp, so that they were not only satisfied with heavenly
   bread, but also with more choice banquets. And yet, in return for these
   divine benefits, they did not pay honour to God; but when slavery had
   been now removed from them, and their thirst and hunger laid aside,
   they fell away into luxury, and transferred their minds to the profane
   rites of the Egyptians. For when Moses, their leader, had ascended into
   the mountain, and there tarried forty days, they made the head [566] of
   an ox in gold, which they call Apis, [567] that it might go before them
   as a standard. [568] With which sin and crime God was offended, and
   justly visited the impious and ungrateful people with severe
   punishments, and made them subject to the law [569] which He had given
   by Moses.

   But afterwards, when they had settled in a desert part of Syria, the
   Hebrews [570] lost their ancient name; and since the leader of their
   host [571] was Judas, they were called Jews, [572] and the land which
   they inhabited Judæa. And at first, indeed, they were not subject to
   the dominion of Kings, but civil Judges presided over the people and
   the law: they were not, however, appointed only for a year, as the
   Roman consuls, but supported by a perpetual jurisdiction. Then, the
   name of Judges being taken away, the kingly power was introduced. But
   during the government of the Judges the people had often undertaken
   corrupt religious rites; and God, offended by them, as often brought
   them into bondage to strangers, until again, softened by the repentance
   of the people, He freed them from bondage. Likewise under the Kings,
   being oppressed by wars with their neighbours on account of their
   iniquities, and at last taken captive and led to Babylon, they suffered
   punishment for their impiety by oppressive slavery, until Cyrus came to
   the kingdom, who immediately restored the Jews by an edict. Afterwards
   they had tetrarchs until the time of Herod, who was in the reign of
   Tiberius Cæsar; in whose fifteenth year, in the consulship of the two
   Gemini, on the 23d of March, [573] the Jews crucified Christ. This
   series of events, this order, is contained in the secrets of the sacred
   writings. But I will first show for what reason Christ came to the
   earth, that the foundation and the system of divine religion may be
   manifest.

   worshipped.

   [569] The moral law had been already given to Moses on the mount before

   taken to express the burthensome routine of the ceremonial law, which
   Peter (Acts xv. 10) describes as a "yoke which neither their fathers
   nor they were able to bear." [Our author expresses himself with
   accuracy: He subjected them by the oppressive ceremonial law to the
   moral law He had just given.]

   [570] The Hebrews are said to have derived their name from Heber the

   that is, the man who had crossed the river,--a name given to him by the
   Canaanites. See Gen. xiv. 13.

   [572] There seems to be no authority for this derivation of the name.
   They were doubtless called Jews from Judah. As those who returned from
   the captivity at Babylon were principally of the tribe of Judah, though
   some from the other tribes returned with them, they were called Jews
   after the captivity.

   [573] There appears to be no reasonable doubt that the day on which our
   Lord suffered was the 14th of Nisan, that is, April 7. See Gresswell's
   Dissertations, vol. iii. p. 168; also Ellicott's Lectures on the Life
   of Christ [Gresswell is not to be too readily accepted in this. See the
   learned inquiry of Dr. Jarvis, of whom, vol. ii. p. 477.]
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XI.--Of the Cause of the Incarnation of Christ.

   When the Jews often resisted wholesome precepts, and departed from the
   divine law, going astray to the impious worship of false gods, then God
   filled just and chosen men with the Holy Spirit, appointing them as
   prophets in the midst of the people, by whom He might rebuke with
   threatening words the sins of the ungrateful people, and nevertheless
   exhort them to repent of their wickedness; for unless they did this,
   and, laying aside their vanities, return to their God, it would come to
   pass that He would change His covenant, [574] that is, bestow [575] the
   inheritance of eternal life upon foreign nations, and collect to
   Himself a more faithful people out of those who were aliens [576] by
   birth. But they, when rebuked by the prophets, not only rejected their
   words; but being offended because they were upbraided for their sins,
   they slew the prophets themselves with studied [577] tortures: all
   which things are sealed up and preserved in the sacred writings. For
   the prophet Jeremiah says: [578] "I sent to you my servants the
   prophets; I sent them before the morning light; but ye did not hearken,
   nor incline your ears to hear, when I spake unto you: let every one of
   you turn from his evil way, and from your most corrupt affections; and
   ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and to your fathers for
   ever. [579] Walk ye not after strange gods, to serve them; and provoke
   me not to anger with the works of your hands, that I should destroy
   you." The prophet Ezra [580] also, who was in the times of the same
   Cyrus by whom the Jews were restored, thus speaks: "They rebelled
   against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their backs, and slew Thy
   prophets which testified against them, that they might turn unto Thee."

   The prophet Elias also, in the third book of Kings: [581] "I have been
   very jealous [582] for the Lord God of hosts, because the children of
   Israel have forsaken Thee, thrown down Thine altars, and slain Thy
   prophets with the sword; and I only am left, and they seek my life to
   take it away." On account of these impieties of theirs He cast them off
   for ever; [583] and so He ceased to send to them prophets. But He
   commanded His own Son, the first-begotten, [584] the maker of all
   things, His own counsellor, to descend from heaven, that He might
   transfer the sacred religion of God to the Gentiles, [585] that is, to
   those who were ignorant of God, and might teach them righteousness,
   which the perfidious people had cast aside. And He had long before
   threatened that He would do this, as the prophet Malachi [586] shows,
   saying: "I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, and I will not
   accept an offering from your hands; for from the rising of the sun even
   unto its setting, my name shall be great [587] among the Gentiles."
   David also in the seventeenth Psalm [588] says: "Thou wilt make me the
   head of the heathen; a people whom I have not known shall serve me."
   Isaiah [589] also thus speaks: "I come to gather all nations and
   tongues; and they shall come and see my glory; and I will send among
   them a sign, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations
   which are afar off, which have not heard my fame; and they shall
   declare my glory among the Gentiles." Therefore, when God wished to
   send to the earth one who should measure [590] His temple, He was
   unwilling to send him with heavenly power and glory, that the people
   who had been ungrateful towards God might be led into the greatest
   error, and suffer punishment for their crimes, since they had not
   received their Lord and God, as the prophets had before foretold that
   it would thus happen. For Isaiah whom the Jews most cruelly slew,
   cutting him asunder with a saw, [591] thus speaks: [592] "Hear, O
   heaven; and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have
   begotten sons, and lifted [593] them up on high, and they have rejected
   me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's stall; but
   Israel hath not known, my people has not understood." Jeremiah also
   says, in like manner: [594] "The turtle and the swallow hath known her
   time, and the sparrows of the field have observed [595] the times of
   their coming: but my people have not known the judgment of the Lord.
   How do you say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? The
   meting out [596] is in vain; the scribes are deceived and confounded:
   the wise men are dismayed and taken, for they have rejected the word of
   the Lord."

   Therefore (as I had begun to say), when God had determined to send to
   men a teacher of righteousness, He commanded Him to be born again a
   second time in the flesh, and to be made in the likeness of man
   himself, to whom he was about to be a guide, and companion, and
   teacher. But since God is kind and merciful [597] to His people, He
   sent Him to those very persons whom He hated, [598] that He might not
   close the way of salvation against them for ever, but might give them a
   free opportunity of following God, that they might both gain the reward
   of life if they should follow Him (which many of them do, and have
   done), and that they might incur the penalty of death by their fault if
   they should reject their King. He ordered Him therefore to be born
   again among them, and of their seed, lest, if He should be born of
   another nation, they might be able to allege a just excuse from the law
   for their rejection of Him; and at the same time, that there might be
   no nation at all under heaven to which the hope of immortality should
   be denied.

    Chap. XII.--Of the Birth of Jesus from the Virgin; Of His Life, Death, and
    Resurrection, and the Testimonies of the Prophets Respecting These Things.

   Therefore the Holy Spirit of God, descending from heaven, chose the
   holy Virgin, that He might enter into her womb. [599] But she, being
   filled by the possession [600] of the Divine Spirit, conceived; and
   without any intercourse with a man, her virgin womb was suddenly
   impregned. But if it is known to all that certain animals are
   accustomed to conceive [601] by the wind and the breeze, why should any
   one think it wonderful when we say that a virgin was made fruitful by
   the Spirit of God, to whom whatever He may wish is easy? And this might
   have appeared incredible, had not the prophets many ages previously
   foretold its occurrence. Thus Solomon speaks: [602] "The womb of a
   virgin was strengthened, and conceived; and a virgin was made fruitful,
   and became a mother in great pity." Likewise the prophet Isaiah, [603]
   whose words are these: "Therefore God Himself shall give you a sign:
   Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son; and ye shall call His
   name Emmanuel." What can be more manifest than this? This was read by
   the Jews, who denied Him. If any one thinks that these things are
   invented by us, let him inquire of them, let him take especially from
   them: the testimony is sufficiently strong to prove the truth, when it
   is alleged by enemies themselves. But He was never called Emmanuel, but
   Jesus, who in Latin is called Saving, or Saviour, [604] because He
   comes bringing salvation to all nations. But by this name the prophet
   declared that God incarnate was about to come to men. For Emmanuel
   signifies God with us; because when He was born of a virgin, men ought
   to confess that God was with them, that is, on the earth and in mortal
   flesh. Whence David [605] says in the eighty-fourth Psalm, "Truth has
   sprung out of the earth;" because God, in whom is truth, hath taken a
   body of earth, that He might open a way of salvation to those of the
   earth. In like manner Isaiah also: [606] "But they disbelieved, and
   vexed His Holy Spirit; and He was turned to be their enemy. And He
   Himself fought against them, and He remembered the days of old, [607]
   who raised up from the earth a shepherd of the sheep." But who this
   shepherd was about to be, he declared in another place, [608] saying:
   "Let the heavens rejoice, and let the clouds put on righteousness; let
   the earth open, and put forth a Saviour. For I the Lord have begotten
   Him." But the Saviour is, as we have said before, Jesus. But in another
   place the same prophet also thus proclaimed: [609] "Behold, unto us a
   child is born, unto us a Son is given, whose dominion is upon His
   shoulders, and His name is called Messenger of great counsel." For on
   this account He was sent by God the Father, that He might reveal to all
   the nations which are under heaven the sacred mystery of the only true
   God, which was taken away from the perfidious people, who ofttimes
   sinned against God. Daniel also foretold similar things: [610] "I saw,"
   he said, "in a vision of the night, and, behold, one like the Son of
   man coming with the clouds of heaven, and He came even to the Ancient
   of days. And they who stood by brought Him near [611] before Him. And
   there was given unto Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all
   people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him: and His dominion is
   everlasting, which shall never pass away, and His kingdom shall not be
   destroyed." How then do the Jews both confess and expect the Christ of
   God? who rejected Him on this account, because He was born of man. For
   since it is so arranged by God that the same Christ should twice come
   to the earth, once to announce to the nations the one God, then again
   to reign, why do they who did not believe in His first advent believe
   in the second?

   But the prophet comprises both His advents in few words. Behold, he
   says, one like the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He did
   not say, like the Son of God, but the Son of man, that he might show
   that He had [612] to be clothed with flesh on the earth, that having
   assumed the form of a man and the condition of mortality, He might
   teach men righteousness; and when, having completed the commands of
   God, He had revealed the truth to the nations, He might also suffer
   death, that He might overcome and lay open [613] the other world also,
   and thus at length rising again, He might proceed to His Father borne
   aloft on a cloud. [614] For the prophet said in addition: And came even
   to the Ancient of days, and was presented to Him. He called the Most
   High God the Ancient of days, whose age and origin cannot be
   comprehended; for He alone was from generations, and He will be always
   to generations. [615] But that Christ, after His passion and
   resurrection, was about to ascend to God the Father, David bore witness
   in these words in the cixth Psalm: [616] "The Lord said unto my Lord,
   Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."
   Whom could this prophet, being himself a king, call his Lord, who sat
   at the right hand of God, but Christ the Son of God, who is King of
   kings and Lord of lords? And this is more plainly shown by Isaiah,
   [617] when he says: "Thus saith the Lord God to my Lord Christ, whose
   right hand I have holden; I will subdue nations before Him, and will
   break the strength of kings. I will open before Him gates, and the
   cities shall not be closed. I will go before Thee, and will make the
   mountains level; and I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and
   shatter the bars of iron; and I will give Thee the hidden and invisible
   treasures, that Thou mayest know that I am the Lord God, which call
   Thee by Thy name, the God of Israel." Lastly, on account of the
   goodness and faithfulness which He displayed towards God on earth,
   there was given to Him a kingdom, and glory, and dominion; and all
   people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; and His dominion is
   everlasting, and that which shall never pass away, and His kingdom
   shall not be destroyed. And this is understood in two ways: that even
   now He has an everlasting dominion, when all nations and all languages
   adore His name, confess His majesty, follow His teaching, and imitate
   His goodness: He has power and glory, in that all tribes of the earth
   obey His precepts. And also, when He shall come again with majesty and
   glory to judge every soul, and to restore the righteous to life, then
   He shall truly have the government of the whole earth: then, every evil
   having been removed from the affairs of men, a golden age (as the poets
   call it), that is, a time of righteousness and peace, will arise. But
   we will speak of these things more fully in the last book, when we
   shall speak of His second advent; now let us treat of His first advent,
   as we began.

    Chap. XIII.--Of Jesus, God and Man; And the Testimonies of the Prophets
    Concerning Him.

   Therefore the Most High God, and Parent of all, when He had purposed to
   transfer [618] His religion, sent from heaven a teacher of
   righteousness, that in Him or through Him He might give a new law to
   new worshippers; not as He had before done, by the instrumentality of
   man. Nevertheless it was His pleasure that He should be born as a man,
   that in all things He might be like His supreme Father. For God the
   Father Himself, who is the origin and source of all things, inasmuch as
   He is without parents, is most truly named by Trismegistus "fatherless"
   and "motherless," [619] because He was born from no one. For which
   reason it was befitting that the Son also should be twice born, that He
   also might become "fatherless" and "motherless." For in His first
   nativity, which was spiritual, He was "motherless," because He was
   begotten by God the Father alone, without the office of a mother. But
   in His second, which was in the flesh, He was born of a virgin's womb
   without the office of a father, that, bearing a middle substance
   between God and man, He might be able, as it were, to take by the hand
   this frail and weak nature of ours, and raise it to immortality. He
   became both the Son of God through the Spirit, and the Son of man
   through the flesh,--that is, both God and man. The power of God was
   displayed in Him, from the works which He performed; the frailty of the
   man, from the passion which He endured: on what account He undertook it
   I will mention a little later. In the meantime, we learn from the
   predictions of the prophets that He was both God and man--composed
   [620] of both natures. Isaiah testifies that He was God in these words:
   [621] "Egypt is wearied, [622] and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the
   Sabæans, men of stature, shall come over unto Thee, and shall be Thy
   servants: and they shall walk behind Thee; in chains they shall fall
   down unto Thee, and shall make supplication unto Thee, Since God is in
   Thee, and there is no other God besides Thee. For Thou art God, and we
   knew Thee not, the God of Israel, the Saviour. They shall all be
   confounded and ashamed who oppose Thee, and shall fall into confusion."
   In like manner the prophet Jeremiah [623] thus speaks: "This is our
   God, and there shall none other be compared unto Him. He hath found out
   all the way of knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant, and
   to Israel His beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt
   among men."

   David also, in the forty-fourth Psalm: [624] "Thy throne, O God, is for
   ever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Thy
   kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; therefore
   God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness." By which
   word he also shows His name, since (as I have shown above) He was
   called Christ from His anointing. Then, that He was also man, Jeremiah
   teaches, saying: [625] "And He is a man, and who hath known Him?" Also
   Isaiah: [626] "And God shall send to them a man, who shall save them,
   shall save them by judging." But Moses also, in Numbers, [627] thus
   speaks: "There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a man [628] shall
   spring forth from Israel." On which account the Milesian Apollo, [629]
   being asked whether He was God or man, replied in this manner: "He was
   mortal as to His body, being wise with wondrous works; but being taken
   with arms under Chaldean judges, with nails and the cross He endured a
   bitter end." In the first verse he spoke the truth, but he skilfully
   deceived him who asked the question, who was entirely ignorant of the
   mystery of the truth. For he appears to have denied that He was God.
   But when he acknowledges that He was mortal as to the flesh, which we
   also declare, it follows that as to the spirit He was God, which we
   affirm. For why would it have been necessary to make mention of the
   flesh, since it was sufficient to say that He was mortal? But being
   pressed by the truth, he could not deny the real state of the case; as
   that which he says, that He was wise.

   What do you reply to this, Apollo? If he is wise, then his system of
   instruction is wisdom, and no other; and they are wise who follow it,
   and no others. Why then are we commonly esteemed as foolish, and
   visionary, and senseless, who follow a Master who is wise even by the
   confession of the gods themselves? For in that he said that He wrought
   wonderful deeds, by which He especially claimed faith is His divinity,
   he now appears to assent to us, when he says the same things in which
   we boast. But, however, he recovers himself, and again has recourse to
   demoniacal frauds. For when he had been compelled to speak the truth,
   he now appeared to be a betrayer of the gods and of himself, unless he
   had, by a deceptive falsehood, concealed that which the truth had
   extorted from him. He says, therefore, that He did indeed perform
   wonderful works, yet not by divine power, but by magic. What wonder if
   Apollo thus persuaded men ignorant of the truth, when the Jews also,
   worshippers (as they seemed to be) of the Most High God, entertained
   the same opinion, though they had every day before their eyes those
   miracles which the prophets had foretold to them as about to happen,
   and yet they could not be induced by the contemplation of such powers
   to believe that He whom they saw was God? On this account, David, whom
   they especially read above the other prophets, in the twenty-seventh
   Psalm [630] thus condemns them: "Render to them their desert, because
   they regard not the works of the Lord." Both David himself and other
   prophets announced that of the house of this very David, Christ should
   be born according to the flesh. Thus it is written in Isaiah: [631]
   "And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and He who shall arise
   to rule over the nations, in Him shall the Gentiles trust; and His rest
   shall be glorious." And in another place: [632] "There shall come forth
   a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a blossom [633] shall grow out of
   his root; and the Spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of
   wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the
   spirit of knowledge and of piety; and He shall be filled [634] with the
   spirit of fear of the Lord." Now Jesse was the father of David, from
   whose root he foretold that a blossom would arise; namely him of whom
   the Sibyl speaks, "A pure blossom shall spring forth."

   Also in the second book of Kings, the prophet Nathan was sent to David,
   who wished to build a temple for God; and this was the word of the Lord
   to Nathan, saying: [635] "Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the
   Lord Almighty, Thou shall not build me a house for me to dwell in; but
   when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I
   will raise up thy seed after thee, and I will establish His kingdom. He
   shall build me a house for my name, and I will set up His throne for
   ever; and I will be to Him for a father, and He shall be to me for a
   son; and His house shall be established, [636] and His kingdom for
   ever." But the reason why the Jews did not understand these things was
   this, because Solomon the son of David built a temple for God, and the
   city which he called from his own name, Jerusalem. [637] Therefore they
   referred the predictions of the prophets to him. Now Solomon received
   the government of the kingdom from his father himself. But the prophets
   spoke of Him who was then born after that David had slept with his
   fathers. Besides, the reign of Solomon was not everlasting; for he
   reigned forty years. In the next place, Solomon was never called the
   son of God, but the son of David; and the house which he built was not
   firmly established, [638] as the Church, which is the true temple of
   God, which does not consist of walls, but of the heart [639] and faith
   of the men who believe on Him, and are called faithful. But that temple
   of Solomon, inasmuch as it was built by the hand, fell by the hand.
   Lastly, his father, in the cxxvith Psalm, prophesied in this manner
   respecting the works of his son: [640] "Except the Lord build the
   house, they have laboured in vain that built it; except the Lord keep
   the city, the watchman hath waked but in vain."

    Chap. XIV.--Of the Priesthood of Jesus Foretold by the Prophets.

   From which things it is evident that all the prophets declared
   concerning Christ, that it should come to pass at some time, that being
   born with a body [641] of the race of David, He should build an eternal
   temple in honour of God, which is called the Church, and assemble all
   nations to the true worship of God. This is the faithful house, this is
   the everlasting temple; and if any one hath not sacrificed in this, he
   will not have the reward of immortality. And since Christ was the
   builder of this great and eternal temple, He must also have an
   everlasting priesthood in it; and there can be no approach to the
   shrine of the temple, and to the sight of God, except through Him who
   built the temple. David in the cixth Psalm teaches the same, saying:
   [642] "Before the morning-star I begat Thee. The Lord hath sworn, and
   will not repent; Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of
   Melchisedec." Also in the first book of Kings: [643] "And I will raise
   me up a faithful Priest, who shall do all things that are in mine
   heart; and I will build him a sure [644] house; and he shall walk in my
   sight [645] all his days." But who this was about to be, to whom God
   promised an everlasting priesthood, Zechariah most plainly teaches,
   even mentioning His name: [646] "And the Lord God showed me Jesus [647]
   the great Priest standing before the face of the angel of the Lord, and
   the adversary [648] was standing at His right hand to resist Him. And
   the Lord said unto the adversary, The Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem
   rebuke thee; and lo, a brand plucked out of the fire. And Jesus was
   clothed with filthy garments, and He was standing before the face of
   the angel. And He answered and spake unto those that stood around
   before His face, saying, Take away the filthy garments from Him, and
   clothe Him with a flowing [649] garment, and place a fair mitre [650]
   upon His head; and they clothed Him with a garment, and placed a fair
   mitre upon His head. And the angel of the Lord stood, and protested,
   saying to Jesus: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, If Thou wilt walk in my
   ways, and keep my precepts, Thou shalt judge my house, and I will give
   Thee those that may walk with Thee in the midst of these that stand by.
   Hear, therefore, O Jesus, Thou great Priest."

   Who, therefore, would not believe that the Jews were then deprived of
   understanding, who, when they read and heard these things, laid impious
   hands upon their God? But from the time in which Zechariah lived, until
   the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar, in which Christ was
   crucified, nearly five hundred years are reckoned; since he flourished
   in the time of Darius and Alexander, [651] who lived not long after the
   banishment of Tarquinius Superbus. But they were again misled and
   deceived in the same manner, in supposing that these things were spoken
   concerning Jesus [652] the son of Nave, who was the successor of Moses,
   or concerning Jesus the high priest the son of Josedech; to whom none
   of those things which the prophet related was suited. For they were
   never clothed in filthy garments, since one of them was a most powerful
   prince, and the other high priest; or suffered any adversity, so that
   they should be regarded as a brand plucked from the fire: not did they
   ever stand in the presence of God and the angels; nor did the prophet
   speak of the past so much as of the future. He spoke, therefore, of
   Jesus the Son of God, to show that He would first come in humility and
   in the flesh. For this is the filthy garment, that He might prepare a
   temple for God, and might be scorched [653] as a brand with fire--that
   is, might endure tortures from men, and at last be extinguished. For a
   half-burnt brand drawn forth from the hearth and extinguished, is
   commonly so called. [654] But in what manner and with what commands He
   was sent by God to the earth, the Spirit of God declared through the
   prophet, teaching us that when He had faithfully and uniformly
   fulfilled the will of His supreme Father, He should receive judgment
   [655] and an everlasting dominion. If, He says, Thou wilt walk in my
   ways, and keep my precepts, then Thou shalt judge my house. What these
   ways of God were, and what His precepts, is neither doubtful nor
   obscure. For God, when He saw that wickedness and the worship of false
   gods had so prevailed throughout the world, that His name had now also
   been taken away from the memory of men (since even the Jews, who alone
   had been entrusted with the secret of God, had deserted the living God,
   and, ensnared by the deceits of demons, had gone astray, and turned
   aside to the worship of images, and when rebuked by the prophets did
   not choose to return to God), He sent His Son [656] as an ambassador to
   men, that He might turn them from their impious and vain worship to the
   knowledge and worship of the true God; and also that He might turn
   their minds from foolishness to wisdom, and from wickedness to deeds of
   righteousness. These are the ways of God, in which He enjoined Him to
   walk. These are the precepts which He ordered to be observed. But He
   exhibited faith towards God. For He taught that there is but one God,
   and that He alone ought to be worshipped. Nor did He at any time say
   that He Himself was God; for He would not have maintained His
   faithfulness, if, when sent to abolish the false gods, and to assert
   the existence of the one God, He had introduced another besides that
   one. This would have been not to proclaim one God, nor to do the work
   of Him who sent Him, but to discharge a peculiar office for Himself,
   and to separate Himself from Him whom He came to reveal. On which
   account, because He was so faithful, because He arrogated nothing at
   all to Himself, that He might fulfil the commands of Him who sent Him,
   He received the dignity of everlasting Priest, and the honour of
   supreme King, and the authority of Judge, and the name of God.

    Chap. XV.--Of the Life and Miracles of Jesus, and Testimonies Concerning
    Them.

   Having spoken of the second nativity, in which, He showed Himself in
   the flesh to men, let us come to those wonderful works, on account of
   which, though they were signs of heavenly power, the Jews esteemed Him
   a magician. When He first began to reach maturity [657] He was baptized
   by the prophet John in the river Jordan, that He might wash [658] away
   in the spiritual laver not His own sins, for it is evident that He had
   none, but those of the flesh, [659] which He bare; that as He saved the
   Jews by undergoing circumcision, so He might save the Gentiles also by
   baptism--that is, by the pouring forth [660] of the purifying dew. Then
   a voice from heaven was heard: "Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten
   Thee." [661] Which voice is found to have been foretold by David. And
   the Spirit of God descended upon Him, formed after the appearance of a
   white dove. [662] From that time He began to perform the greatest
   miracles, not by magical tricks, which display nothing true and
   substantial, but by heavenly strength and power, which were foretold
   even long ago by the prophets who announced Him; which works are so
   many, that a single book is not sufficient to comprise them all. I will
   therefore enumerate them briefly and generally, without any designation
   of persons and places, that I may be able to come to the setting forth
   of His passion and cross, to which my discourse has long been
   hastening. His powers were those which Apollo called wonderful: [663]
   that wherever He journeyed, by a single word, and in a single moment,
   He healed the sick and infirm, and those afflicted with every kind of
   disease: so that those who were deprived of the use of all their limbs,
   having suddenly received power, were strengthened, and themselves
   carried their couches, on which they had a little time before been
   carried. But to the lame, and to those afflicted with some defect [664]
   of the feet, He not only gave the power of walking, but also of
   running. Then, also, if any had their eyes blinded in the deepest
   darkness, He restored them to their former sight. He also loosened the
   tongues of the dumb, so that [665] they discoursed and spake
   eloquently. He also opened the ears of the deaf, and caused them to
   hear; [666] He cleansed the polluted and the blemished. [667] And He
   performed all these things not by His hands, or the application of any
   remedy, [668] but by His word and command, as also the Sibyl had
   foretold: "Doing all things by His word, and healing every disease."

   Nor, indeed, is it wonderful that He did wonderful things by His word,
   since He Himself was the Word of God, relying upon heavenly strength
   and power. Nor was it enough that He gave strength to the feeble,
   soundness of body to the maimed, health to the sick and languishing,
   unless He also raised the dead, as it were unbound from sleep, and
   recalled them to life.

   And the Jews, then, when they saw these things, contended that they
   were done by demoniacal power, although it was contained in their
   secret writings that all things should thus come to pass as they did.
   They read indeed the words of other prophets, and of Isaiah, [669]
   saying: "Be strong, ye hands that are relaxed; and ye weak knees, be
   comforted. Ye who are of a fearful [670] heart, fear not, be not
   afraid: our Lord shall execute judgment; He Himself shall come and save
   us. Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the
   deaf shall hear: then shall the lame man leap as a deer, and the tongue
   of the dumb speak plainly: [671] for in the wilderness water hath
   broken forth, and a stream in the thirsty land." But the Sibyl also
   foretold the same things in these verses:--


   "And there shall be a rising again of the dead; and the course of the
   lame shall be swift, and the deaf shall hear, and the blind shall see,
   the dumb shall speak."

   On account of these powers and divine works wrought by Him when a great
   multitude followed Him of the maimed, or sick, or of those who desired
   to present their sick to be healed, He went up into a desert mountain
   to pray there. And when He had tarried there three days, and the people
   were suffering from hunger, He called His disciples, and asked what
   quantity of food [672] they had with them. But they said that they had
   five loaves and two fishes in a wallet. Then He commanded that these
   should be brought forward, and that the multitude, distributed by
   fifties, should recline on the ground. When the disciples did this, He
   Himself broke the bread in pieces, and divided the flesh of the fishes,
   and in His hands both of them were increased. And when He had ordered
   the disciples to set them before the people, five thousand men were
   satisfied, and moreover twelve baskets [673] were filled from the
   fragments which remained. What can be more wonderful, either in
   narration or in action? But the Sibyl had before foretold that it would
   take place, whose verses are related to this effect:--


   "With five loaves at the same time, and with two fishes,

   He shall satisfy five thousand men in the wilderness;

   And afterwards taking all the fragments that remain,

   He shall fill twelve baskets to the hope of many."

   I ask, therefore, what the art of magic could have contrived in this
   case, the skill of which is of avail for nothing else than for
   deceiving [674] the eyes? He also, when He was about to retire to a
   mountain, as He was wont, for the sake of prayer, directed His
   disciples to take a small ship and go before Him. But they, setting out
   when evening was now coming on, began to be distressed [675] through a
   contrary wind. And when they were now in the midst of the sea, [676]
   then, setting His feet on the sea, [677] He came up to them, walking as
   though on the solid ground, [678] not as the poets fable Orion walking
   on the sea, who, while a part of his body was sunk in the water,


   "With his shoulder rises above the waves." [679]

   And again, when He had gone to sleep in the ship, and the wind had
   begun to rage, even to the extremity of danger, being aroused from
   sleep, He immediately ordered the wind to be silent; and the waves,
   which were borne with great violence, were still, and immediately at
   His word there followed a calm.

   But perhaps the sacred writings [680] speak falsely, when they teach
   that there was such power in Him, that by His command He compelled the
   winds to obey, the seas to serve Him, diseases to depart, the dead to
   be submissive. Why should I say that the Sibyls before taught the same
   things in their verses? one of whom, already mentioned, thus speaks:--


   "He shall still the winds by His word, and calm the sea

   As it rages, treading with feet of peace and in faith."

   And again another, which says:--


   "He shall walk on the waves, He shall release men from disease.

   He shall raise the dead, and drive away many pains;

   And from the bread of one wallet there shall be a satisfying of men."

   Some, refuted by these testimonies, are accustomed to have recourse to
   the assertion that these poems were not by the Sibyls, but made up and
   composed by our own writers. But he will assuredly not think this who
   has read Cicero, [681] and Varro, and other ancient writers, who make
   mention of the Erythræan and the other Sibyls, from whose books we
   bring forward these examples; and these authors died before the birth
   of Christ according to the flesh. But I do not doubt that these poems
   were in former times regarded as ravings, since no one then understood
   them. For they announced some marvellous wonders, of which neither the
   manner, nor the time, nor the author was signified. Lastly, the
   Erythræan Sibyl says that it would come to pass that she would be
   called mad and deceitful. But assuredly


   "They will say that the Sibyl

   Is mad, and deceitful: but when all things shall come to pass,

   Then ye will remember me; and no one will any longer

   Say that I, the prophetess of the great God, am mad."

   Therefore they were [682] neglected for many ages; but they received
   attention after the nativity and passion of Christ had revealed secret
   things. Thus it was also with the utterances of the prophets, which
   were read by the people of the Jews for fifteen hundred years and more,
   but yet were not understood until after Christ had explained [683] them
   both by His word and by His works. For the prophets spoke of Him; nor
   could the things which they said have been in any way understood,
   unless they had been altogether fulfilled.

    Chap. XVI.--Of the Passion of Jesus Christ; That It Was Foretold.

   I come now to the passion itself, which is often cast in our teeth as a
   reproach: [684] that we worship a man, and one who was visited and
   tormented with remarkable punishment: that I may show that this very
   passion was undergone by Him in accordance with a great and divine
   plan, and that goodness and truth and wisdom are contained in it alone.
   For if He had been most happy on the earth, and had reigned through all
   His life in the greatest prosperity, no wise man would either have
   believed Him to be a God, or judged Him worthy of divine honour: which
   is the case with those who are destitute of true divinity, who not only
   look up [685] to perishable riches, and frail power, and the advantages
   arising from the benefit of another, but even consecrate them, and
   knowingly do service to the memory of the dead, worshipping fortune
   when it is now extinguished, which the wise never regarded as an object
   of worship even when alive and present with them. For nothing among
   earthly things can be venerable and worthy of heaven; but it is virtue
   alone, and justice alone, which can be judged a true, and heavenly, and
   perpetual good, because it is neither given to any one, nor taken away.
   And since Christ came upon earth, supplied with virtue and
   righteousness, yea rather, since He Himself is virtue, and Himself
   righteousness, He descended that He might teach it and mould the
   character of man. And having performed this office and embassy from
   God, on account of this very virtue which He at once taught and
   practised, He deserved, and was able, to be believed a God by all
   nations. Therefore, when a great multitude from time to time flocked to
   Him, either on account of the righteousness which He taught or on
   account of the miracles which He worked, and heard His precepts, and
   believed that He was sent by God, and that He was the Son of God, then
   the rulers and priests of the Jews, excited with anger because they
   were rebuked by Him as sinners, and perverted by envy, because, while
   the multitude flocked to Him, they saw themselves despised and
   deserted, and (that which was the crowning point of their guilt)
   blinded by folly and error, and unmindful of the instructors sent from
   heaven, and of the prophets, they caballed against Him, and conceived
   the impious design of putting Him to death, and torturing Him: of which
   the prophets had long before written.

   For both David, in the beginning of his Psalms, foreseeing in spirit
   what a crime they were about to commit, says, [686] "Blessed is the man
   who hath not walked in the way of the ungodly; "and Solomon in the book
   of Wisdom used these words: [687] "Let us defraud the righteous, for he
   is unpleasant to us, and upbraideth us with our offences against the
   law. He maketh his boast that he has the knowledge of God; and he
   calleth himself the Son of God. He is made to reprove [688] our
   thoughts: it grieveth us even to look upon him: for his life is not
   like the life of others; his ways are of another fashion. [689] We are
   counted by him as triflers, [690] he withdraweth himself from our ways
   as from filthiness; he commendeth greatly [691] the latter end of the
   just, and boasteth that he has God for his Father. Let us see,
   therefore, if his words be true; let us prove what end [692] he shall
   have; let us examine him with rebukes and torments that we may know his
   meekness, [693] and prove his patience; let us condemn him to a
   shameful death. Such things have they imagined, and have gone astray.
   For their own folly hath blinded them, and they do not understand the
   mysteries [694] of God." Does he not describe that impious design
   entered into by the wicked against God, so that he clearly appears to
   have been present? But from Solomon, who foretold these things, to the
   time of their accomplishment, ten hundred and ten years intervened. We
   feign nothing; we add nothing. They who performed the actions had these
   accounts; they, against whom these things were spoken, read them. But
   even now the inheritors of their name and guilt have these accounts,
   and in their daily readings re-echo their own condemnation as foretold
   by the voice of the prophets; nor do they ever admit them into their
   heart, which is also itself a part of their condemnation. The Jews,
   therefore, being often reproved by Christ, who upbraided them with
   their sins and iniquities, and being almost deserted by the people,
   were stirred up to put Him to death.

   Now His humility emboldened them to this deed. For when they read with
   what great power and glory the Son of God was about to descend from
   heaven, but on the other hand saw Jesus humble, peaceful, of low
   condition, [695] without comeliness, they did not believe that He was
   the Son of God, being ignorant that two advents on His part were
   foretold by the prophets: the first, obscure in humility of the flesh;
   the other, manifest in the power of His majesty. Of the first David
   thus speaks in the seventy-first Psalm: [696] "He shall descend as rain
   upon a fleece; and in His days shall righteousness spring forth, and
   abundance of peace, as long as the moon is lifted up." For as rain, if
   it descends upon a fleece, cannot be perceived, because it makes no
   sound; so he said that Christ would come to the earth without exciting
   the notice [697] of any, that He might teach righteousness and peace.
   Isaiah also thus spoke: [698] "Lord, who hath believed our report? and
   to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We made proclamation [699]
   before Him as children, and as a root in a thirsty land: He has no form
   nor glory; and we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness. But His
   form was without honour, and defective beyond the rest of men. He is a
   man acquainted [700] with grief, and knowing how to endure infirmity,
   because He turned [701] His face away from us; and He was not esteemed.
   He carries our sins, and He endures pain for us: and we thought that He
   Himself [702] was in pain, and grief, and vexation. But He was wounded
   for our transgressions, He was bruised [703] for our offences; the
   chastisement [704] of our peace was upon Him, by His bruises [705] we
   are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray, and God hath delivered
   Him up for our sins." And in the same manner the Sibyl spoke: "Though
   an object of pity, dishonoured, without form, He will give hope to
   those who are objects of pity." On account of this humility they did
   not recognise their God, and entered into the detestable design of
   depriving Him of life, who had come to give them life.

    Chap. XVII.--Of the Superstitions of the Jews, and Their Hatred Against
    Jesus.

   But they alleged other causes for their anger and envy, which they bore
   shut up [706] within in their hearts--namely, that He destroyed the
   obligation [707] of the law given by Moses; that is, that He did not
   rest [708] on the Sabbath, but laboured for the good [709] of men; that
   He abolished circumcision; that He took away the necessity of
   abstaining from the flesh of swine; [710] --in which things the
   mysteries of the Jewish religion consist. On this account, therefore,
   the rest of the people, who had not yet withdrawn [711] to Christ, were
   incited by the priests to regard Him as impious, because He destroyed
   the obligation of the law of God, though He did this not by His own
   judgment, but according to the will of God, and after the predictions
   of the prophets. For Micah announced that He would give a new law, in
   these terms: [712] "The law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the
   Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many people, and rebuke
   strong nations." [713] For the former law, which was given by Moses,
   was not given on Mount Zion, but on Mount Horeb; [714] and the Sibyl
   shows that it would come to pass that this law would be destroyed by
   the Son of God:--


   "But when all these things which I told you shall be accomplished, then
   all the law is fulfilled with respect to Him."

   But even Moses himself, by whom the law was given which they so
   tenaciously maintain, though they have fallen away from God, and have
   not acknowledged God, had foretold that it would come to pass that a
   very great prophet would be sent by God, who should be above the law,
   and be a bearer of the will of God to men. In Deuteronomy he thus left
   it written: [715] "And the Lord said unto me, I will raise them up a
   Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my
   word in His mouth, and He shall speak unto them all that I shall
   command Him. And whosoever will not hearken to those things which that
   Prophet shall speak in my name, I will require [716] it of him." The
   Lord evidently announced by the law-giver himself that He was about to
   send His own Son--that is, a law alive, and present [717] in person,
   and destroy that old law given by a mortal, [718] that by Him who was
   eternal He might ratify afresh a law which was eternal.

   In like manner, Isaiah [719] thus prophesied concerning the abolition
   of circumcision: "Thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah who dwell at
   Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.
   Circumcise yourselves to the Lord your God, and take away the foreskins
   of your heart, lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none
   can quench it." Also Moses himself says: [720] "In the last days the
   Lord shall circumcise thine heart to love the Lord thy God." Also Jesus
   [721] the son of Nun, his successor, said: "And the Lord said unto
   Jesus, Make thee knives of flint very sharp, and sit and circumcise the
   children of Israel the second time." He said that this second
   circumcision would be not of the flesh, as the first was, which the
   Jews practice even now, but of the heart and spirit, which was
   delivered by Christ, who was the true Jesus. For the prophet does not
   say, "And the Lord said unto me," but "unto Jesus," that he might show
   that God was not speaking of him, but of Christ, to whom God was then
   speaking. For that Jesus represented [722] Christ: for when he was at
   first called Auses, [723] Moses, foreseeing the future, ordered that he
   should be called Jesus; that since he had been chosen as the leader of
   the warfare against Amalek, who was the enemy of the children of
   Israel, he might both subdue the adversary by the emblem [724] of the
   name, and lead the people into the land of promise. And for this reason
   he was also successor to Moses, to show that the new law given by
   Christ Jesus was about to succeed to the old law which was given by
   Moses. For that circumcision of the flesh is plainly irrational; since,
   if God had so willed it, He might so have formed man from the
   beginning, that he should be without a foreskin. But it was a figure of
   this second circumcision, signifying that the breast is to be laid
   bare; that is, that we ought to live with an open and simple heart,
   since that part of the body which is circumcised has a kind of
   resemblance to the heart, and is to be treated with reverence. On this
   account God ordered that it should be laid bare, that by this argument
   He might admonish us not to have our breast hidden [725] in obscurity;
   that is, not to veil any shameful deed within the secrets of
   conscience. This is the circumcision of the heart of which the prophets
   speak, which God transferred from the mortal flesh to the soul, which
   alone is about to endure. For being desirous of promoting our life and
   salvation in accordance with His own goodness, in that circumcision He
   hath set before us repentance, that if we lay open our hearts,--that is
   if we confess our sins and make satisfaction to God,--we shall obtain
   pardon, which is denied to those who are obstinate and conceal their
   faults, by Him who regards not the outward appearance, as man does, but
   the innermost secrets of the heart. [726]

   The forbidding of the flesh of swine also has the same intention; for
   when God commanded them to abstain from this, He willed that this
   should be especially understood, that they should abstain from sins and
   impurities. For this animal is filthy and unclean, [727] and never
   looks up to heaven, [728] but prostrates itself to the earth with its
   whole body and face: it is always the slave of its appetite and food;
   nor during its life can it afford any other service, as the other
   animals do, which either afford a vehicle for riding, [729] or aid in
   the cultivation of the fields, or draw waggons by their neck, or carry
   burthens on their back, or furnish a covering with their skins, [730]
   or abound with a supply of milk, or keep watch for guarding our houses.
   Therefore He forbade them to use the flesh of the pig for food, that
   is, not to imitate the life of swine, which are nourished only for
   death; lest, by devoting themselves to their appetite and pleasures,
   they should be useless for working righteousness, and should be visited
   with death. Also that they should not immerse themselves in foul lusts,
   as the sow, which wallows in the mire; [731] of that they do not serve
   earthly images, and thus defile themselves with mud: for they do bedaub
   themselves with mud who worship gods, that is, who worship mud and
   earth. Thus all the precepts of the Jewish law have for their object
   the setting forth of righteousness, since they are given in a
   mysterious [732] manner, that under the figure of carnal things those
   which are spiritual might be known.

    Chap. XVIII.--Of the Lord's Passion, and that It Was Foretold.

   When, therefore, Christ fulfilled these things which God would have
   done, and which He foretold many ages before by His prophets, incited
   by these things, and ignorant of the sacred Scriptures, they conspired
   together to condemn their God. And though He knew that this would come
   to pass, and repeatedly [733] said that He must suffer and be put to
   death for the salvation of many, nevertheless He withdrew Himself with
   His disciples, not that He might avoid that which it was necessary for
   Him to undergo and endure, but that He might show what ought to take
   place in every persecution, that no one should appear to have fallen
   into it through his own fault: and He announced that it would come to
   pass that He should be betrayed by one of them. And thus Judas, induced
   by a bribe, delivered up to the Jews the Son of God. But they took and
   brought Him before Pontius Pilate, who at that time was administering
   the province of Syria as governor, [734] and demanded that He should be
   crucified, though they laid nothing else to His charge except that He
   said that He was the Son of God, the King of the Jews; also His own
   saying, [735] "Destroy this temple, which was forty-six years in
   building, and in three days I will raise it up again without
   hands,"--signifying that His passion would shortly take place, and that
   He, having been put to death by the Jews, would rise again on the third
   day. For He Himself was the true temple of God. They inveighed against
   these expressions of His, as ill-omened and impious. And when Pilate
   had heard these things, and He said nothing in His own defence, he gave
   sentence that there appeared nothing deserving of condemnation in Him.
   But those most unjust accusers, together with the people whom they had
   stirred up, began to cry out, and with loud voices to demand His
   crucifixion.

   Then Pontius [736] was overpowered both by their outcries, and by the
   instigation of Herod the tetrarch, [737] who feared lest he should be
   deposed from his sovereignty. He did not, however, himself pass
   sentence, but delivered Him up to the Jews, that they themselves might
   judge Him according to their law. [738] Therefore they led Him away
   when He had been scourged with rods, and before they crucified Him they
   mocked Him; for they put upon Him a scarlet [739] robe, and a crown of
   thorns, and saluted Him as King, and gave Him gall for food, and
   mingled for Him vinegar to drink. After these things they spat upon His
   face, and struck Him with the palms of their hands; and when the
   executioners [740] themselves contended about His garments, they cast
   lots among themselves for His tunic and mantle. [741] And while all
   these things were doing, He uttered no voice from His mouth, as though
   He were dumb. Then they lifted Him up in the midst between two
   malefactors, who had been condemned for robbery, and fixed Him to the
   cross. What can I here deplore in so great a crime? or in what words
   can I lament such great wickedness? For we are not relating the
   crucifixion of Gavius, [742] which Marcus Tullius followed up with all
   the spirit and strength of his eloquence, pouring forth as it were the
   fountains of all his genius, proclaiming that it was an unworthy deed
   that a Roman citizen should be crucified in violation of all laws. And
   although He was innocent, and undeserving of that punishment, yet He
   was put to death, and that, too, by an impious man, who was ignorant of
   justice. What shall I say respecting the indignity of this cross, on
   which the Son of God was suspended and nailed? [743] Who will be found
   so eloquent, and supplied with so great an abundance of deeds and
   words, what speech flowing with such copious exuberance, [744] as to
   lament in a befitting manner that cross, which the world itself, and
   all the elements of the world, bewailed?

   But that these things were thus about to happen, was announced both by
   the utterances of the prophets and by the predictions of the Sibyls. In
   Isaiah it is found thus written: [745] "I am not rebellious, nor do I
   oppose: I gave my back to the scourge, and my cheeks to the hand: [746]
   I turned not away my face from the foulness of spitting." In like
   manner David, in the thirty-fourth Psalm: [747] "The abjects [748] were
   gathered together against me, [749] and they knew me not: [750] they
   were dispersed, nor did they feel remorse; they tempted me, and greatly
   [751] derided me; and they gnashed upon me with their teeth." The Sibyl
   also showed that the same things would happen:--


   "He shall afterwards come into the hands of the unjust and the
   faithless; and they shall inflict on God blows with impure hands, and
   with polluted mouths they shall send forth poisonous spittle; and He
   shall then absolutely [752] give His holy back to stripes."

   Likewise respecting His silence, which He perseveringly maintained even
   to His death, Isaiah thus spoke again: [753] "He was led as a sheep to
   the slaughter; and as a lamb before the shearer is dumb, so He opened
   not His mouth." And the above-mentioned Sibyl said:--


   "And being beaten, He shall be silent, lest any one should know what
   the Word is, or whence it came, that it may speak with mortals; and He
   shall wear the crown of thorns."

   But respecting the food and the drink which they offered to Him before
   they fastened Him to the cross, David thus speaks in the sixty-eighth
   Psalm: [754] "And they gave me gall for my meat; and in my thirst they
   gave me vinegar to drink." The Sibyl foretold that this also would
   happen:--


   "They gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst vinegar; this
   inhospitable table they will show."

   And another Sibyl rebukes the land of Judæa in these verses:--


   "For you, entertaining hurtful thoughts, did not recognise your God
   sporting [755] with mortal thoughts; but crowned Him with a crown of
   thorns, and mingled dreadful gall."

   Now, that it would come to pass that the Jews would lay hands upon
   their God, and put Him to death, these testimonies of the prophets
   foretold. In Esdras it is thus written: [756] "And Ezra said to the
   people, This passover is our Saviour and our refuge. Consider and let
   it come into your heart, that we have to abase Him in a figure; and
   after these things we will hope in Him, lest this place be deserted for
   ever, saith the Lord God of hosts. If you will not believe Him, nor
   hear His announcement, ye shall be a derision among the nations." From
   which it appears that the Jews had no other hope, unless they purified
   themselves from blood, and put their hopes in that very person whom
   they denied. [757] Isaiah also points out their deed, and says: [758]
   "In His humiliation His judgment was taken away. Who shall declare His
   generation? for His life shall be taken away from the earth; from the
   transgressions of my people He was led away to death. And I will give
   Him the wicked for His burial, and the rich for His death, because He
   did no wickedness, nor spoke guile with His mouth. Wherefore He shall
   obtain [759] many, and shall divide the spoils of the strong; because
   He was delivered up to death, and was reckoned among the transgressors;
   and He bore the sins of many, and was delivered up on account of their
   transgressions." David also, in the ninety-third Psalm: [760] "They
   will hunt after the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent
   blood; and the Lord is become my refuge." Also Jeremiah: [761] "Lord,
   declare it unto me, and I shall know. Then I saw their devices; I was
   led as an innocent [762] lamb to the sacrifice; [763] they meditated a
   plan against me, saying, Come, let us send wood into his bread, [764]
   and let us sweep away his life from the earth, and his name shall no
   more be remembered." Now the wood [765] signifies the cross, and the
   bread His body; for He Himself is the food and the life of all who
   believe in the flesh which He bare, and on the cross upon which He was
   suspended.

   Respecting this, however, Moses himself more plainly spoke to this
   effect, in Deuteronomy: [766] "And Thy life shall hang [767] before
   Thine eyes; and Thou shall fear day and night, and shalt have no
   assurance of Thy life." And the same again in Numbers: [768] "God is
   not in doubt as a man, nor does He suffer threats [769] as the son of
   man." Zechariah also thus wrote: [770] "And they shall look on me, whom
   they pierced." Also David in the twenty-first Psalm: [771] "They
   pierced my hands and my feet; they numbered all my bones; they
   themselves looked and stared upon me; they divided my garments among
   them; and upon my vesture they did cast lots." It is evident that the
   prophet did not speak these things concerning himself. For he was a
   king, and never endured these sufferings; but the Spirit of God, who
   was about to suffer these things, after ten hundred and fifty years,
   spoke by him. For this is the number of years from the reign of David
   to the crucifixion of Christ. But Solomon also, his son, who built
   Jerusalem, prophesied that this very city would perish in revenge for
   the sacred cross: [772] "But if ye turn away from me, saith the Lord,
   and will not keep my truth, I will drive Israel from the land which I
   have given them; and this house which I have built for them in my name,
   I will cast it out from all: [773] and Israel shall be for perdition
   [774] and a reproach to the people; and this house shall be desolate,
   and every one that shall pass by it shall be astonished, and shall say,
   Why hath God done these evils to this land and to this house? And they
   shall say, Because they forsook the Lord their God, and persecuted
   their King most beloved by God, and crucified Him with great
   degradation, [775] therefore hath God brought upon them these evils."

   [738] This statement requires some modification. Pilate did indeed say
   to the Jews, "Take ye Him, and judge Him according to your law;" but
   they declared that it was not lawful for them to put any man to death.
   The punishment was entirely Roman, the mode of death Roman, the
   executioners Roman soldiers. There were two distinct trials,--one
   before the Jewish Sanhedrim on a charge of impiety, the other before
   the Roman governor on a charge of treason.

   explanation is, that the word translated bread denotes fruit, as in the
   English authorized version, "Let us destroy the tree, with the fruit
   thereof." But see Pole on the passage. [Jer xi. 19. Here is a very
   insufficient note, the typology of Scripture not being duly observed.

    Chap. XIX.--Of the Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Jesus; And the
    Predictions of These Events.

   What more can now be said respecting the crime of the Jews, than that
   they were then blinded and seized with incurable madness, who read
   these things daily, and yet neither understood them, nor were able to
   be on their guard so as not to do them? Therefore, being lifted up and
   nailed to the cross, He cried to the Lord with a loud voice, and of His
   own accord gave up His spirit. And at the same hour there was an
   earthquake; and the veil of the temple, which separated the two
   tabernacles, was rent into two parts; and the sun suddenly withdrew its
   light, and there was darkness from the sixth [776] even to the ninth
   hour. Of which event the prophet Amos testifies: [777] "And it shall
   come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that the sun shall go down at
   noon, and the daylight shall be darkened; and I will turn your feasts
   into mourning, and your songs into lamentation." Also Jeremiah: [778]
   "She who brings forth is affrighted, and vexed in spirit; her sun is
   gone down while it was yet mid-day; she hath been ashamed and
   confounded; [779] and the residue of them will I give to the sword in
   the sight of their enemies." And the Sibyl:--


   "And the veil of the temple shall be rent, and at midday there shall be
   dark vast night for three hours,"

   When these things were done, even by the heavenly prodigies, they were
   not able to understand their crime.

   But since He had foretold that on the third day He should rise again
   from the dead, fearing lest, the body having been stolen by the
   disciples, and removed, all should believe that He had risen, and there
   should be a much greater disturbance among the people, they took Him
   down from the cross, and having shut Him up in a tomb, they securely
   surrounded it with a guard of soldiers. But on the third day, before
   light, there was an earthquake, and the sepulchre was suddenly opened;
   and the guard, who were astonished and stupefied with fear, seeing
   nothing, He came forth uninjured and alive from the sepulchre, and went
   into Galilee to seek His disciples: but nothing was found in the
   sepulchre except the grave-clothes in which they had enclosed and wrapt
   His body. Now, that He would not remain in hell, [780] but rise again
   on the third day, had been foretold by the prophets. David says, in the
   fifteenth Psalm: [781] "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither
   wilt Thou suffer Thine holy one to see corruption." Also in the third
   Psalm: [782] "I laid me down to sleep, and took my rest, and rose
   again, for the Lord sustained me." Hosea also, the first of the twelve
   prophets, testified of His resurrection: [783] "This my Son is wise,
   therefore He will not remain in the anguish of His sons: and I will
   redeem Him from the power [784] of the grave. Where is thy judgment, O
   death? or where is thy sting?" The same also in another place: [785]
   "After two days, He will revive us in the third day." And therefore the
   Sibyl said, that after three days' sleep he would put an end to
   death:--


   "And after sleeping three days, He shall put an end to the fate of
   death; and then, releasing Himself from the dead, He shall come to
   light, first showing to the called ones the beginning of the
   resurrection."

   For He gained life for us by overcoming death. No hope, therefore, of
   gaining immortality is given to man, unless he shall believe on Him,
   and shall take up that cross to be borne and endured.

    Chap. XX.--Of the Departure of Jesus into Galilee After His Resurrection;
    And of the Two Testaments, the Old and the New.

   Therefore He went into Galilee, for He was unwilling to show Himself to
   the Jews, lest He should lead them to repentance, and restore them from
   their impiety to a sound mind. [786] And there He opened to His
   disciples again assembled the writings of Holy Scripture, that is, the
   secrets of the prophets; which before His suffering could by no means
   be understood, for they told of Him and of His passion. Therefore
   Moses, and the prophets also themselves, call the law which was given
   to the Jews a testament: for unless the testator shall have died, a
   testament cannot be confirmed; nor can that which is written in it be
   known, because it is closed and sealed. And thus, unless Christ had
   undergone death, the testament could not have been opened; that is, the
   mystery of God could not have been unveiled [787] and understood.

   But all Scripture is divided into two Testaments. That which preceded
   the advent and passion of Christ--that is, the law and the prophets--is
   called the Old; but those things which were written after His
   resurrection are named the New Testament. The Jews make use of the Old,
   we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the
   fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even
   Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His
   everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and
   disinherited. [788] As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks
   such things: [789] "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will
   make a new testament [790] to the house of Israel and the house of
   Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in
   the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
   Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded [791]
   them, saith the Lord." Also in another place he says in like manner:
   [792] "I have forsaken my house, I have given up mine heritage into the
   hand of its enemies. Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the
   forest; it hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it." Since
   the inheritance is His heavenly kingdom, it is evident that He does not
   say that He hates the inheritance itself, but the heirs, who have been
   ungrateful towards Him, and impious. Mine heritage, he says, is become
   unto me as a lion; that is, I am become a prey and a devouring to my
   heirs, who have slain me as the flock. It hath cried out against me;
   that is, they have pronounced against me the sentence of death and the
   cross. For that which He said above, that He would make [793] a new
   testament to the house of Judah, shows that the old testament which was
   given by Moses was not perfect; [794] but that that which was to be
   given by Christ would be complete. But it is plain that the house of
   Judah does not signify the Jews, whom He casts off, but us, who have
   been called by Him out of the Gentiles, and have by adoption succeeded
   to their place, and are called sons [795] of the Jews, which the Sibyl
   declares when she says:--


   "The divine race of the blessed, heavenly Jews."

   But what that race was about to be, Isaiah teaches, in whose book the
   Most High Father addresses His Son: [796] "I the Lord God have called
   Thee in righteousness, and will hold Thine hand, and will keep Thee:
   [797] and I have given Thee for a covenant of my race, [798] for a
   light of the Gentiles; to open the eyes of the blind, to bring out the
   prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the
   prison-house." When, therefore, we who were in time past as it were
   blind, and as it were shut up in the prison of folly, were sitting in
   darkness, ignorant of God and of the truth, we have been enlightened by
   Him, who adopted us by His testament; and having freed us from cruel
   chains, and brought us out to the light of wisdom, He admitted us to
   the inheritance of His heavenly kingdom.

    Chap. XXI.--Of the Ascension of Jesus, and the Foretelling of It; And of the
    Preaching and Actions of the Disciples.

   But when He had made arrangements with His disciples for the preaching
   of the Gospel and His name, a cloud suddenly surrounded Him, and
   carried Him up into heaven, on the fortieth day after His passion, as
   Daniel had shown that it would be, saying: [799] "And, behold, one like
   the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient
   of days." But the disciples, being dispersed through the provinces,
   everywhere laid the foundations of the Church, themselves also in the
   name of their divine [800] Master doing many and almost incredible
   miracles; for at His departure He had endowed them with power and
   strength, by which the system [801] of their new announcement might be
   founded and confirmed. But He also opened to them all things which were
   about to happen, which Peter and Paul preached at Rome; and this
   preaching being written for the sake of remembrance, [802] became
   permanent, in which they both declared other wonderful things, and also
   said that it was about to come to pass, that after a short time God
   would send against them a king who would subdue [803] the Jews, and
   level their cities to the ground, and besiege the people themselves,
   worn out with hunger and thirst. Then it should come to pass that they
   should feed on the bodies of their own children, and consume one
   another. Lastly, that they should be taken captive, and come into the
   hands of their enemies, and should see their wives most cruelly
   harassed before their eyes, their virgins ravished and polluted, their
   sons torn in pieces, their little ones dashed to the ground; and
   lastly, everything laid waste with fire and sword, the captives
   banished for ever from their own lands, because they had exulted over
   the well-beloved and most approved Son of God. And so, after their
   decease, when Nero had put them to death, Vespasian destroyed the name
   and nation of the Jews, and did all things which they had foretold as
   about to come to pass.

    Chap. XXII.--Arguments of Unbelievers Against the Incarnation of Jesus.

   I have now confirmed, as I imagine, the things which are thought false
   and incredible by those who are not instructed in the true knowledge of
   heavenly learning. But, however, that we may refute those also who are
   too wise, not without injury to themselves, and who detract from the
   credit due to divine things, let us disprove their error, that they may
   at length perceive that the fact ought to have been as we show that it
   actually was. And although with good judges either testimonies are of
   sufficient weight without arguments, or arguments without testimonies,
   we, however, are not content with the one or the other, since we are
   supplied with both, that we may not leave room for any one of depraved
   ingenuity either to misunderstand or to dispute on the opposite side.
   They say that it was impossible for anything to be withdrawn [804] from
   an immortal nature. They say, in short, that it was unworthy of God to
   be willing to become man, and to burthen Himself with the infirmity of
   flesh; to become subject of His own accord to sufferings, to pain, and
   death: as though it had not been easy for Him to show Himself to men
   without [805] the weakness incident to a body, and to teach them
   righteousness (if He so wished) with greater authority, as of one who
   acknowledged [806] Himself to be God. For in that case all would have
   obeyed the heavenly precepts, if the influence and power of God
   enjoining them had been united with them. Why, then (they say), did He
   not come as God to teach men? why did He render Himself so humble and
   weak, that it was possible for Him both to be despised by men and to be
   visited with punishment? why did He suffer violence from those who are
   weak and mortal? why did He not repel by strength, or avoid by His
   divine knowledge, [807] the hands of men? why did He not at least in
   His very death reveal His majesty? but He was led as one without
   strength to trial, was condemned as one who was guilty, was put to
   death as one who was mortal. I will carefully refute these things, nor
   will I permit any one to be in error. For these things were done by a
   great and wonderful plan; and he who shall understand this, will not
   only cease to wonder that God was tortured by men, but also will easily
   see that it could not have been believed that he was God if those very
   things which he censures had not been done.

    Chap. XXIII.--Of Giving Precepts, and Acting.

   If any one gives to men precepts for living, and moulds the characters
   of others, I ask whether he is bound himself to practice the things
   which he enjoins, or is not bound. If he shall not do so, his precepts
   are annulled. For if the things which are enjoined are good, if they
   place the life of men in the best condition, the instructor ought not
   to separate himself from the number and assemblage of men among whom he
   acts; and he ought himself to live in the same manner in which he
   teaches that men ought to live, lest, by living in another way, he
   himself should disparage [808] his own precepts, and make his
   instruction of less value, if in reality he should relax the
   obligations of that which he endeavours to establish by his words. For
   every one, when he hears another giving precepts, is unwilling that the
   necessity of obeying should be imposed upon him, as though the right of
   liberty were taken from him. Therefore he answers his teacher in this
   manner: I am not able to do the things which you command, for they are
   impossible. For you forbid me to be angry, you forbid me to covet, you
   forbid me to be excited by desire, you forbid me to fear pain or death;
   but this is so contrary to nature, that all animals are subject to
   these affections. Or if you are so entirely of opinion that it is
   possible to resist nature, do you yourself practice the things which
   you enjoin, that I may know that they are possible? But since you
   yourself do not practice them, what arrogance is it, to wish to impose
   upon a free man laws which you yourself do not obey! You who teach,
   first learn; and before you correct the character of others, correct
   your own. Who could deny the justice of this answer? Nay! a teacher of
   this kind will fall into contempt, and will in his turn be mocked,
   because he also will appear to mock others.

   What, therefore, will that instructor do, if these things shall be
   objected to him? how will he deprive the self-willed [809] of an
   excuse, unless he teach them by deeds before their eyes [810] that he
   teaches things which are possible? Whence it comes to pass, that no one
   obeys the precepts of the philosophers. [811] For men prefer examples
   rather than words, because it is easy to speak, but difficult to
   accomplish. [812] Would to heaven that there were as many who acted
   well as there are who speak well! But they who give precepts, without
   carrying them out into action, are distrusted; [813] and if they shall
   be men, will be despised as inconsistent: [814] if it shall be God, He
   will be met with the excuse of the frailty of man's nature. It remains
   that words should be confirmed by deeds, which the philosophers are
   unable to do. Therefore, since the instructors themselves are overcome
   by the affections which they say that it is our duty to overcome, they
   are able to train no one to virtue, which they falsely proclaim; [815]
   and for this cause they imagine that no perfect wise man has as yet
   existed, that is, in whom the greatest virtue and perfect justice were
   in harmony with the greatest learning and knowledge. And this indeed
   was true. For no one since the creation of the world has been such,
   except Christ, who both delivered wisdom by His word, and confirmed His
   teaching by presenting virtue to the eyes of men. [816]

    Chap. XXIV.--The Overthrowing of the Arguments Above Urged by Way of
    Objection.

   Come, let us now consider whether a teacher sent from heaven can fail
   to be perfect. I do not as yet speak of Him whom they deny to have come
   from God. Let us suppose that some one were to be sent from heaven to
   instruct the life of men in the first principles of virtue, and to form
   them to righteousness. No one can doubt but that this teacher, who is
   sent from heaven, would be as perfect in the knowledge of all things as
   in virtue, lest there should be no difference between a heavenly and an
   earthly teacher. For in the case of a man his instruction can by no
   means be from within and of himself. [817] For the mind, shut in by
   earthly organs, and hindered by a corrupt [818] body, of itself can
   neither comprehend nor receive the truth, unless it is taught from
   another source. [819] And if it had this power in the greatest degree,
   yet it would be unable to attain to the highest virtue, and to resist
   all vices, the materials of which are contained in our bodily [820]
   organs. Hence it comes to pass, that an earthly teacher cannot be
   perfect. But a teacher from heaven, to whom His divine nature gives
   knowledge, and His immortality gives virtue, must of necessity in His
   teaching also, as in other things, be perfect and complete. But this
   cannot by any means happen, unless He should take to Himself a mortal
   body. And the reason why it cannot happen is manifest. For if He should
   come to men as God, not to mention that mortal eyes cannot look upon
   and endure the glory of His majesty in His own person, assuredly God
   will not be able to teach virtue; for, inasmuch as He is without a
   body, He will not practice the things which He will teach, and through
   this His teaching will not be perfect. Otherwise, if it is the greatest
   virtue patiently to endure pain for the sake of righteousness and duty,
   if it is virtue not to fear death itself when threatened, and when
   inflicted to undergo it with fortitude; it follows that the perfect
   teacher ought both to teach these things by precept, and to confirm
   them by practice. For he who gives precepts for the life, ought to
   remove every method [821] of excuse, that he may impose upon men the
   necessity of obedience, not by any constraint, but by a sense of shame,
   and yet may leave them liberty, that a reward may be appointed for
   those who obey, because it was in their power not to obey if they so
   wished; and a punishment for those who do not obey, because it was in
   their power to obey if they so wished. How then can excuse be removed,
   unless the teacher should practice what he teaches, and as it were go
   before [822] and hold out his hand to one who is about to follow? But
   how can one practice what he teaches, unless he is like him whom he
   teaches? For if he be subject to no passion, a man may thus answer him
   who is the teacher: It is my wish not to sin, but I am overpowered; for
   I am clothed with frail and weak flesh: it is this which covets, which
   is angry, which fears pain and death. And thus I am led on against my
   will; [823] and I sin, not because it is my wish, but because I am
   compelled. I myself perceive that I sin; but the necessity imposed by
   my frailty, which I am unable to resist, impels me. What will that
   teacher of righteousness say in reply to these things? How will he
   refute and convict a man who shall allege the frailty of the flesh as
   an excuse for his faults, unless he himself also shall be clothed with
   flesh, so that he may show that even the flesh is capable of virtue?
   For obstinacy cannot be refuted except by example. For the things which
   you teach cannot have any weight unless you shall be the first to
   practice them; because the nature of men is inclined to faults, and
   wishes to sin not only with indulgence, but also with a reasonable
   plea. [824] It is befitting that a master and teacher of virtue should
   most closely resemble man, that by overpowering sin he may teach man
   that sin may be overpowered by him. But if he is immortal, he can by no
   means propose an example to man. For there will stand forth some one
   persevering in his opinion, and will say: You indeed do not sin,
   because you are free from this body; you do not covet, because nothing
   is needed by an immortal; but I have need of many things for the
   support of this life. You do not fear death, because it can have no
   power against you. You despise pain, because you can suffer no
   violence. But I, a mortal, fear both, because they bring upon me the
   severest tortures, which the weakness of the flesh cannot endure. A
   teacher of virtue therefore ought to have taken away this excuse from
   men, that no one may ascribe it to necessity that he sins, rather than
   to his own fault. Therefore, that a teacher may be perfect, no
   objection ought to be brought forward by him who is to be taught, so
   that if he should happen to say, You enjoin impossibilities; the
   teacher may answer, See, I myself do them. But I am clothed with flesh,
   and it is the property of flesh to sin. [825] I too bear the same
   flesh, and yet sin does not bear rule in me. It is difficult for me to
   despise riches, because otherwise I am unable to live in this body.
   See, I too have a body, and yet I contend against every desire. I am
   not able to bear pain or death for righteousness, because I am frail.
   See, pain and death have power over me also; and I overcome those very
   things which you fear, that I may make you victorious over pain and
   death. I go before you through those things which you allege that it is
   impossible to endure: if you are not able to follow me giving
   directions, follow me going before you. In this way all excuse is taken
   away, and you must confess that man is unjust through his own fault,
   since he does not follow a teacher of virtue, who is at the same time a
   guide. You see, therefore, how much more perfect is a teacher who is
   mortal, because he is able to be a guide to one who is mortal, than one
   who is immortal, for he is unable to teach patient endurance who is not
   subject to passions. Nor, however, does this extend so far that I
   prefer man to God; but to show that man cannot be a perfect teacher
   unless he is also God, that he may by his heavenly authority impose
   upon men the necessity of obedience; nor God, unless he is clothed with
   a mortal body, that by carrying out his precepts to their completion
   [826] in actions, he may bind others by the necessity of obedience. It
   plainly therefore appears, that he who is a guide of life and teacher
   of righteousness must have a body, and that his teaching cannot
   otherwise be full and perfect, unless it has a root and foundation, and
   remains firm and fixed among men; and that he himself must undergo
   weakness of flesh and body, and display in himself [827] the virtue of
   which he is a teacher, that he may teach it at the same time both by
   words and deeds. Also, he must be subject to death and all sufferings,
   since the duties of virtue are occupied with the enduring of suffering,
   and the undergoing death; all which, as I have said, a perfect teacher
   ought to endure, that he may teach the possibility of their being
   endured.

    Chap. XXV.--Of the Advent of Jesus in the Flesh and Spirit, that He Might Be
    Mediator Between God and Man.

   Let men therefore learn and understand why the Most High God, when He
   sent His ambassador and messenger to instruct mortals with the precepts
   of His righteousness, willed that He should be clothed with mortal
   flesh, and be afflicted with torture, and be sentenced to death. For
   since there was no righteousness on earth, He sent a teacher, as it
   were a living law, to found a new name and temple, [828] that by His
   words and example He might spread throughout the earth a true and holy
   worship. But, however, that it might be certain that He was sent by
   God, it was befitting that He should not be born as man is born,
   composed of a mortal on both sides; [829] but that it might appear that
   He was heavenly even in the form of man, He was born without the office
   of a father. For He had a spiritual Father, God; and as God was the
   Father of His spirit without a mother, so a virgin was the mother of
   His body without a father. He was therefore both God and man, being
   placed in the middle between God and man. From which the Greeks call
   Him Mesites, [830] that He might be able to lead man to God--that is,
   to immortality: for if He had been God only (as we have before said),
   He would not have been able to afford to man examples of goodness; if
   He had been man only, He would not have been able to compel men to
   righteousness, unless there had been added an authority and virtue
   greater than that of man.

   For, since man is composed of flesh and spirit, and the spirit must
   earn [831] immortality by works of righteousness, the flesh, since it
   is earthly, and therefore mortal, draws with itself the spirit linked
   to it, and leads it from immortality to death. Therefore the spirit,
   apart from the flesh, could by no means be a guide to immortality for
   man, since the flesh hinders the spirit from following God. For it is
   frail, and liable to sin; but sin is the food and nourishment [832] of
   death. For this cause, therefore, a mediator came--that is, God in the
   flesh--that the flesh might be able to follow Him, and that He might
   rescue man from death, which has dominion over the flesh. Therefore He
   clothed Himself with flesh, that the desires of the flesh being
   subdued, He might teach that to sin was not the result of necessity,
   but of man's purpose and will. For we have one great and principal
   struggle to maintain with the flesh, the boundless desires of which
   press upon the soul, nor allow it to retain dominion, but make it the
   slave of pleasures and sweet allurements, and visit it with everlasting
   death. And that we might be able to overcome these, God has opened and
   displayed to us the way of overcoming the flesh. And this perfect and
   absolutely complete [833] virtue bestows on those who conquer, the
   crown and reward of immortality.

    Chap. XXVI.--Of the Cross, and Other Tortures of Jesus, and of the Figure of
    the Lamb Under the Law.

   I have spoken of humiliation, and frailty, and suffering--why God
   thought fit to undergo them. Now an account must be taken of the cross
   itself, and its meaning must be related. What the Most High Father
   arranged from the beginning, and how He ordained all things which were
   accomplished, not only the foretelling by the prophets, which preceded
   and was proved true [834] in Christ, but also the manner of His
   suffering itself teaches. For whatever sufferings He underwent were not
   without meaning; [835] but they had a figurative meaning [836] and
   great significance, as had also those divine works which He performed,
   the strength and power of which had some weight indeed for the present,
   but also declared something for the future. Heavenly influence opened
   the eyes of the blind, and gave light to those who did not see; and by
   this deed He signified that it would come to pass that, turning to the
   nations which were ignorant of God, He might enlighten the breasts of
   the foolish with the light of wisdom, and open the eyes of their
   understanding to the contemplation of the truth. For they are truly
   blind who, not seeing heavenly things, and surrounded with the darkness
   of ignorance, worship earthly and frail things. He opened the ears of
   the deaf. It is plain that this divine power did not limit its exercise
   to this point; [837] but He declared that it would shortly come to
   pass, that they who were destitute of the truth would both hear and
   understand the divine words of God. For you may truly call those deaf
   who do not hear the things which are heavenly and true, and worthy of
   being performed. He loosed the tongues of the dumb, so that they spake
   plainly. [838] A power worthy of admiration, [839] even when it was in
   operation: but there was contained in this display [840] of power
   another meaning, which showed that it would shortly come to pass that
   those who were lately ignorant of heavenly things, having received the
   instruction of wisdom, might speak respecting God and the truth. For he
   who is ignorant of the divine nature, he truly is speechless and dumb,
   although he is the most eloquent of all men. For when the tongue has
   begun to speak truth--that is, to set forth the excellency and majesty
   of the one God--then only does it discharge the office of its nature;
   but as long as it speaks false things it is not rightly employed: [841]
   and therefore he must necessarily be speechless who cannot utter divine
   things. He also renewed the feet of the lame to the office of
   walking,--a strength of divine work worthy of praise; but the figure
   implied this, that the errors of a worldly and wandering life being
   restrained, the path of truth was opened by which men might walk to
   attain the favour of God. For He is truly to be considered lame, who,
   being enwrapped in the gloom and darkness of folly, and ignorant in
   what direction to go, with feet liable to stumble and fall, walks in
   the way of death.

   Likewise He cleansed the stains and blemishes of defiled bodies,--no
   slight exercise of immortal power; but this strength prefigured that by
   the instruction of righteousness His doctrine was about to purify those
   defiled by the stains of sins and the blemishes of vices. For they
   ought truly to be accounted as leprous and unclean, [842] whom either
   boundless lusts compel to crimes, or insatiable pleasures to
   disgraceful deeds, and affect with an everlasting stain those who are
   branded with the marks of dishonourable actions. He raised the bodies
   of the dead as they lay prostrate; and calling them aloud by their
   names, He brought them back from death. What is more suitable to God,
   what more worthy of the wonder of all ages, than to have recalled [843]
   the life which has run its course, to have added times to the completed
   times of men, to have revealed the secrets of death? But this
   unspeakable power was the image of a greater energy, which showed that
   His teaching was about to have such might, that the nations throughout
   the world, which were estranged from God and subject to death, being
   animated by the knowledge of the true light, might arrive at the
   rewards of immortality. For you may rightly deem those to be dead, who,
   not knowing God the giver of life, and depressing their souls from
   heaven to earth, run into the snares of eternal death. The actions,
   therefore, which He then performed for the present, were
   representations of future things; the things which He displayed in
   injured and diseased bodies were figures [844] of spiritual things,
   that at present He might display to us the works of an energy which was
   not of earth, and for the future might show the power of His heavenly
   majesty. [845]

   Therefore, as His works had a signification also of greater power, so
   also His passion did not go before us as simple, or superfluous, or by
   chance. But as those things which He did signified the great efficacy
   and power of His teaching, so those things which He suffered announced
   that wisdom would be held in hatred. For the vinegar which they gave
   Him to drink, and the gall which they gave Him to eat, held forth
   hardships and severities [846] in this life to the followers of truth.
   And although His passion, which was harsh and severe in itself, gave to
   us a sample of the future torments which virtue itself proposes to
   those who linger in this world, yet drink and food of this kind, coming
   into the mouth of our teacher, afforded us an example of pressures, and
   labours, and miseries. All which things must be undergone and suffered
   by those who follow the truth; since the truth is bitter, and detested
   by all who, being destitute of virtue, give up their life to deadly
   pleasures. For the placing of a crown of thorns upon His head, declared
   that it would come to pass that He would gather to Himself a holy
   people from those who were guilty. For people standing around in a
   circle are called a corona. [847] But we, who before that we knew God
   were unjust, were thorns--that is, evil and guilty, not knowing what
   was good; and estranged from the conception and the works of
   righteousness, polluted all things with wickedness and lust. Being
   taken, therefore, from briars and thorns, we surround the sacred head
   of God; for, being called by Himself, and spread around Him, we stand
   beside God, who is our Master and Teacher, and crown Him King of the
   world, and Lord of all the living.

   But with reference to the cross, it has great force and meaning, which
   I will now endeavour to show. For God (as I have before explained),
   when He had determined to set man free, sent as His ambassador to the
   earth a teacher of virtue, who might both by salutary precepts train
   men to innocence, and by works and deeds before their eyes [848] might
   open the way of righteousness, by walking in which, and following his
   teacher, man might attain to eternal life. He therefore assumed a body,
   and was clothed in a garment of flesh, that He might hold out to man,
   for whose instruction He had come, examples of virtue and incitements
   to its practice. But when He had afforded an example of righteousness
   in all the duties of life, in order that He might teach man also the
   patient endurance of pain and contempt of death, by which virtue is
   rendered perfect and complete, He came into the hands of an impious
   nation, when, by the knowledge of the future which He had, He might
   have avoided them, and by the same power by which He did wonderful
   works He might have repelled them. Therefore He endured tortures, and
   stripes, and thorns. At last He did not refuse even to undergo death,
   that under His guidance man might triumph over death, subdued and bound
   in chains with all its terrors. But the reason why the Most High Father
   chose that kind of death in preference to others, with which He should
   permit Him to be visited, is this. For some one may perchance say: Why,
   if He was God, and chose to die, did He not at least suffer by some
   honourable kind of death? why was it by the cross especially? why by an
   infamous kind of punishment, which may appear unworthy even of a man if
   he is free, [849] although guilty? First of all, because He, who had
   come in humility that He might bring assistance to the humble and men
   of low degree, and might hold out to all the hope of safety, was to
   suffer by that kind of punishment by which the humble and low usually
   suffer, that there might be no one at all who might not be able to
   imitate Him. In the next place, it was in order that His body might be
   kept unmutilated, [850] since He must rise again from the dead on the
   third day.

   Nor ought any one to be ignorant of this, that He Himself, speaking
   before of His passion, also made it known that He had the power, when
   He willed it, of laying down His life and of taking it again.
   Therefore, because He had laid down His life while fastened to the
   cross, His executioners did not think it necessary to break His bones
   (as was their prevailing custom), but they only pierced His side. Thus
   His unbroken body was taken down from the cross, and carefully enclosed
   in a tomb. Now all these things were done lest His body, being injured
   and broken, should be rendered unsuitable [851] for rising again. That
   also was a principal cause why God chose the cross, because it was
   necessary that He should be lifted up on it, and the passion of God
   become known to all nations. For since he who is suspended upon a cross
   is both conspicuous to all and higher than others, the cross was
   especially chosen, which might signify that He would be so conspicuous,
   and so raised on high, that all nations from the whole world should
   meet together at once to know and worship Him. Lastly, no nation is so
   uncivilized, no region so remote, to which either His passion or the
   height of His majesty would be unknown. Therefore in His suffering He
   stretched forth His hands and measured out the world, that even then He
   might show that a great multitude, collected together out of all
   languages and tribes, from the rising of the sun even to his setting,
   was about to come under His wings, and to receive on their foreheads
   that great and lofty sign. [852] And the Jews even now exhibit a figure
   of this transaction when they mark their thresholds with the blood of a
   lamb. For when God was about to smite the Egyptians, to secure the
   Hebrews from that infliction He had enjoined them to slay a white [853]
   lamb without spot, and to place on their thresholds a mark from its
   blood. And thus, when the first-born of the Egyptians had perished in
   one night, the Hebrews alone were saved by the sign of the blood: not
   that the blood of a sheep had such efficacy in itself as to be the
   safety of men, but it was an image of things to come. For Christ was
   the white lamb without spot; that is, He was innocent, and just, and
   holy, who, being slain by the same Jews, is the salvation of all who
   have written on their foreheads the sign of blood--that is, of the
   cross, on which He shed His blood. For the forehead is the top of the
   threshold in man, and the wood sprinkled with blood is the emblem [854]
   of the cross. Lastly, the slaying of the lamb by those very persons who
   perform it is called the paschal feast, from the word "paschein," [855]
   because it is a figure of the passion, which God, foreknowing the
   future, delivered by Moses to be celebrated by His people. But at that
   time the figure was efficacious at the present for averting the danger,
   that it may appear what great efficacy the truth itself is about to
   have for the protection of God's people in the extreme necessity of the
   whole world. But in what manner or in what region all will be safe who
   have marked on the highest part of their body this sign of the true and
   divine blood, [856] I will show in the last book.

    Chap. XXVII.--Of the Wonders Effected by the Power of the Cross, and of
    Demons.

   At present it is sufficient to show what great efficacy the power of
   this sign has. How great a terror this sign is to the demons, he will
   know who shall see how, when adjured by Christ, they flee from the
   bodies which they have besieged. For as He Himself, when He was living
   among men, put to flight all the demons by His word, and restored to
   their former senses the minds of men which had been excited and
   maddened by their dreadful attacks; so now His followers, in the name
   of their Master, and by the sign of His passion, banish the same
   polluted spirits from men. And it is not difficult to prove this. For
   when they sacrifice to their gods, if any one bearing a marked forehead
   stands by, the sacrifices are by no means favourable. [857]


   "Nor can the diviner, when consulted, give answers." [858]

   And this has often been the cause of punishment to wicked kings. For
   when some of their attendants who were of our religion [859] were
   standing by their masters as they sacrificed, having the sign placed on
   their foreheads, they caused the gods of their masters to flee, that
   they might not be able to observe [860] future events in the entrails
   of the victims. And when the soothsayers understood this, at the
   instigation of the same demons to whom they had sacrificed, [861]
   complaining that profane men were present at the sacrifices, they drove
   their princes to madness, so that they attacked the temple of the god,
   and contaminated themselves by true sacrilege, which was expiated by
   the severest punishments on the part of their persecutors. Nor,
   however, are blind men able to understand even from this, either that
   this is the true religion, which contains such great power for
   overcoming, or that that is false, which is not able to hold its ground
   or to come to an engagement.

   But they say that the gods do this, not through fear, but through
   hatred; as though it were possible for any one to hate another, unless
   it be him who injures, or has the power of injuring. Yea, truly, it
   would be consistent with their majesty to visit those whom they hated
   with immediate punishment, [862] rather than to flee from them. But
   since they can neither approach those in whom they shall see the
   heavenly mark, nor injure those whom the immortal sign [863] as an
   impregnable wall protects, they harass them by men, and persecute them
   by the hands of others: and if they acknowledge the existence of these
   demons, we have overcome; for this must necessarily be the true
   religion, which both understands the nature of demons, and understands
   their subtlety, and compels them, vanquished and subdued, to yield to
   itself. If they deny it, they will be refuted by the testimonies of
   poets and philosophers. But if they do not deny the existence and
   malignity of demons, what remains except that they affirm that there is
   a difference between gods and demons? [864] Let them therefore explain
   to us the difference between the two kinds, that we may know what is to
   be worshipped and what to be held in execration; whether they have any
   mutual agreement, or are really opposed to one another. If they are
   united by some necessity, how shall we distinguish them? or how shall
   we unite the honour and worship of each kind? If, on the other hand,
   they are enemies, how is it that the demons do not fear the gods, or
   that the gods cannot put to flight the demons? Behold, some one excited
   by the impulse of the demon is out of his senses, raves, is mad: let us
   lead him into the temple of the excellent and mighty Jupiter; or since
   Jupiter knows not how to cure men, into the fane of Æsculapius or
   Apollo. Let the priest of either, in the name of his god, command the
   wicked spirit to come out of the man: that can in no way come to pass.
   What, then, is the power of the gods, if the demons are not subject to
   their control? But, in truth, the same demons, when adjured by the name
   of the true God, immediately flee. What reason is there why they should
   fear Christ, but not fear Jupiter, unless that they whom the multitude
   esteem to be gods are also demons? Lastly, if there should be placed in
   the midst one who is evidently suffering from an attack of a demon, and
   the priest of the Delphian Apollo, they will in the same manner dread
   the name of God; and Apollo will as quickly depart from his priest as
   the spirit of the demon from the man; and his god being adjured and put
   to flight, the priest will be for ever silent. [865] Therefore the
   demons, whom they acknowledge to be objects of execration, are the same
   as the gods to whom they offer supplications.

   If they imagine that we are unworthy of belief, let them believe Homer,
   who associated the supreme Jupiter [866] with the demons; and also
   other poets and philosophers, who speak of the same beings at one time
   as demons, and at another time as gods,--of which names one is true,
   and the other false. For those most wicked spirits, when they are
   adjured, then confess that they are demons; when they are worshipped,
   then falsely say that they are gods; in order that they may lead men
   into errors, [867] and call them away from the knowledge of the true
   God, by which alone eternal death can be escaped. They are the same
   who, for the sake of overthrowing man, have founded various systems of
   worship for themselves through different regions, [868] --under false
   and assumed names, however, that they might deceive. For because they
   were unable by themselves to aspire to divinity, they took to
   themselves the names of powerful kings, under whose titles they might
   claim for themselves divine honours; which error may be dispelled, and
   brought to the light of truth. For if any one desires to inquire
   further into the matter, let him assemble those who are skilled in
   calling forth spirits from the dead. Let them call forth [869] Jupiter,
   Neptune, Vulcan, Mercury, Apollo, and Saturnus the father of all. All
   will answer from the lower regions; and being questioned they will
   speak, and confess respecting themselves and God. After these things
   let them call up Christ; He will not be present, He will not appear,
   for He was not more than two days in the lower regions. What proof can
   be brought forward more certain than this? I have no doubt that
   Trismegistus arrived at the truth by some proof of this kind, who spoke
   many things [870] respecting God the Son which are contained in the
   divine secrets.

    Chap. XXVIII.--Of Hope and True Religion, and of Superstition.

   And since these things are so, as we have shown, it is plain that no
   other hope of life is set before man, except that, laying aside
   vanities and wretched error, he should know God, [871] and serve God;
   except he renounce this temporary life, and train himself by the
   principles of righteousness for the cultivation of true religion. For
   we are created on this condition, that we pay just and due obedience to
   God who created us, that we should know and follow Him alone. We are
   bound and tied to God by this chain of piety; [872] from which religion
   itself received its name, not, as Cicero explained it, from carefully
   gathering, [873] for in his second book respecting the nature of the
   gods he thus speaks: "For not only philosophers, but our ancestors
   also, separated superstition from religion. For they who spent whole
   days in prayers and sacrifices, that their children might survive [874]
   them, were called superstitious. But they who handled again, and as it
   were carefully gathered all things which related to the worship of the
   gods, were called religious from carefully gathering, [875] as some
   were called elegant from choosing out, and diligent from carefully
   selecting and intelligent from understanding. For in all these words
   there is the same meaning of gathering which there is in the word
   religious: thus it has come to pass, that in the names superstitious
   and religious, the one relates to a fault, the other belongs to
   praise." How senseless this interpretation is, we may know from the
   matter itself. For if both religion and superstition are engaged in the
   worship of the same gods, there is little or rather no difference
   between them. For what cause will he allege why he should think that to
   pray once for the health of sons is the part of a religious man, but to
   do the same ten times is the part of a superstitious man? For if it is
   an excellent thing to pray once, how much more so to do it more
   frequently! If it is well to do it at the first hour, then it is well
   to do it throughout the day. If one victim renders the deity
   propitious, it is plain that many victims must render him more
   propitious, because multiplied services oblige [876] rather than
   offend. For those servants do not appear to us hateful who are
   assiduous and constant in their attendance, but more beloved. Why,
   therefore, should he be in fault, and receive a name which implies
   censure, [877] who either loves his children more, or sufficiently
   honours the gods; and he, on the contrary, be praised, who loves them
   less? And this argument has weight also from the contrary. For if it is
   wrong [878] to pray and sacrifice during whole days, therefore it is
   wrong to do so once. If it is faulty frequently to wish for the
   preservation of our children, therefore he also is superstitious who
   conceives that wish even rarely. Or why should the name of a fault be
   derived from that, than which nothing can be wished more honourable,
   nothing more just? For as to his saying, that they who diligently take
   in hand again the things relating to the worship of the gods are called
   religious from their carefully gathering; how is it, then, that they
   who do this often in a day lose the name of religious men, when it is
   plain from their very assiduity that they more diligently gather those
   things by which the gods are worshipped?

   What, then, is it? Truly religion is the cultivation of the truth, but
   superstition of that which is false. And it makes the entire difference
   what you worship, not how you worship, or what prayer you offer. [879]
   But because the worshippers of the gods imagine themselves to be
   religious, though they are superstitious, they are neither able to
   distinguish religion from superstition, nor to express the meaning of
   the names. We have said that the name of religion is derived from the
   bond of piety, [880] because God has tied man to Himself, and bound him
   by piety; [881] for we must serve Him as a master, and be obedient to
   Him as a father. And therefore Lucretius [882] better explained this
   name, who says that He loosens the knots of superstitions. [883] But
   they are called superstitious, not who wish their children to survive
   them, for we all wish this; but either those who reverence the
   surviving memory of the dead, or those who, surviving their parents,
   reverenced their images at their houses as household gods. For those
   who assumed to themselves new rites, that they might honour the dead as
   gods, whom they supposed to be taken from men and received into heaven,
   they called superstitious. But those who worshipped the public and
   ancient gods [884] they named religious. From which Virgil says: [885]
   --


   "Superstition vain, and ignorant of ancient gods."

   But since we find that the ancient gods also were consecrated in the
   same manner after their death, therefore they are superstitious who
   worship many and false gods. We, on the other hand, are religious, who
   make our supplications to the one true God.

    Chap. XXIX.--Of the Christian Religion, and of the Union of Jesus with the
    Father.

   Some one may perhaps ask how, when we say that we worship one God only,
   we nevertheless assert that there are two, God the Father and God the
   Son: which assertion has driven many into the greatest error. For when
   the things which we say seem to them probable, they consider that we
   fail in this one point alone, that we confess that there is another
   God, and that He is mortal. We have already spoken of His mortality:
   now let us teach concerning His unity. When we speak of God the Father
   and God the Son, we do not speak of them as different, nor do we
   separate each: because the Father cannot exist without the Son, nor can
   the Son be separated from the Father, since the name of Father [886]
   cannot be given without the Son, nor can the Son be begotten without
   the Father. Since, therefore, the Father makes the Son, and the Son the
   Father, they both have one mind, one spirit, one substance; but the
   former [887] is as it were an overflowing fountain, the latter [888] as
   a stream flowing forth from it: the former as the sun, the latter as it
   were a ray [889] extended from the sun. And since He is both faithful
   to the Most High Father, and beloved by Him, He is not separated from
   Him; just as the stream is not separated from the fountain, nor the ray
   from the sun: for the water of the fountain is in the stream, and the
   light of the sun is in the ray: just as the voice cannot be separated
   from the mouth, nor the strength or hand from the body. When,
   therefore, He is also spoken of by the prophets as the hand, and
   strength, and word of God, there is plainly no separation; for the
   tongue, which is the minister of speech, and the hand, in which the
   strength is situated, are inseparable portions of the body.

   We may use an example more closely connected with us. When any one has
   a son whom he especially loves, who is still in the house, and in the
   power [890] of his father, although he concede to him the name and
   power of a master, yet by the civil law the house is one, and one
   person is called master. So this world [891] is the one house of God;
   and the Son and the Father, who unanimously inhabit the world, are one
   God, for the one is as two, and the two are as one. Nor is that
   wonderful, since the Son is in the Father, for the Father loves the
   Son, and the Father is in the Son; for He faithfully obeys the will of
   the Father, nor does He ever do nor has done anything except what the
   Father either willed or commanded. Lastly, that the Father and the Son
   are but one God, Isaiah showed in that passage which we have brought
   forward before, [892] when he said: [893] "They shall fall down unto
   Thee, and make supplication unto Thee, since God is in Thee, and there
   is no other God besides Thee." And he also speaks to the same purport
   in another place: [894] "Thus saith God the King of Israel, and His
   Redeemer, the everlasting God; I am the first, and I am the last; and
   beside me there is no God." When he had set forth two persons, one of
   God the King, that is, Christ, and the other of God the Father, who
   after His passion raised Him from the dead, as we have said [895] that
   the prophet Hosea showed, [896] who said, "I will redeem Him from the
   power of the grave:" nevertheless, with reference to each person, he
   introduced the words, "and beside me there is no God," when he might
   have said "beside us;" but it was not right that a separation of so
   close a relationship should be made by the use of the plural number.
   For there is one God alone, free, most high, without any origin; for He
   Himself is the origin of all things, and in Him at once both the Son
   and all things are contained. Wherefore, since the mind and will of the
   one is in the other, or rather, since there is one in both, both are
   justly called one God; for whatever is in the Father [897] flows on to
   the Son, and whatever is in the Son descends from the Father. Therefore
   that highest and matchless God cannot be worshipped except through the
   Son. He who thinks that he worships the Father only, as he does not
   worship the Son, so he does not worship even the Father. But he who
   receives the Son, and bears His name, he truly together with the Son
   worships the Father also, since the Son is the ambassador, and
   messenger, and priest of the Most High Father. He is the door of the
   greatest temple, He the way of light, He the guide to salvation, He the
   gate of life.

    Chap. XXX.--Of Avoiding Heresies and Superstitions, and What is the Only
    True Catholic Church.

   But since many heresies have existed, and the people of God have been
   rent into divisions at the instigation of demons, the truth must be
   briefly marked out by us, and placed in its own peculiar
   dwelling-place, that if any one shall desire to draw the water of life,
   he may not be borne to broken cisterns [898] which hold no water, but
   may know the abundant fountain of God, watered by which he may enjoy
   perpetual light. Before all things, it is befitting that we should know
   both that He Himself and His ambassadors foretold that there must be
   numerous sects and heresies, [899] which would break the unity [900] of
   the sacred body; and that they admonished us to be on our guard with
   the greatest prudence, lest we should at any time fall into the snares
   and deceits of that adversary of ours, with whom God has willed that we
   should contend. Then that He gave us sure commands, which we ought
   always to treasure in our minds; for many, forgetting them, and
   abandoning the heavenly road, have made for themselves devious paths
   amidst windings and precipices, by which they might lead away the
   incautious and simple part of the people to the darkness of death: I
   will explain how this happened. There were some of our religion whose
   faith was less established, or who were less learned or less cautious,
   who rent the unity and divided the Church. But they whose faith was
   unsettled, [901] when they pretended that they knew and worshipped God,
   aiming at the increase of their wealth and honour, aspired to the
   highest sacerdotal power; and when overcome by others more powerful,
   preferred to secede with their supporters, than to endure those set
   over them, over whom they themselves before desired to be set. [902]

   But some, not sufficiently instructed in heavenly learning, when they
   were unable to reply to the accusers of the truth, who objected that it
   was either impossible or inconsistent that God should be shut up in the
   womb of a woman, and that the Majesty of heaven could not be reduced to
   such weakness as to become an object of contempt and derision, a
   reproach and mockery to men; lastly, that He should even endure
   tortures, and be affixed to the accursed cross; and when they could
   defend and refute all these things neither by talent nor learning, for
   they did not thoroughly perceive their force and meaning, they were
   perverted [903] from the right path, and corrupted the sacred writings,
   so that they composed for themselves a new doctrine without any root
   and stability. But some, enticed by the prediction of false prophets,
   concerning whom both the true prophets and he himself had foretold,
   fell away from the knowledge of God, and left the true tradition. But
   all of these, ensnared by frauds of demons, which they ought to have
   foreseen and guarded against, by their carelessness lost the name and
   worship of God. For when they are called Phrygians, [904] or Novatians,
   [905] or Valentinians, [906] or Marcionites, [907] or Anthropians,
   [908] or Arians, [909] or by any other name, they have ceased to be
   Christians, who have lost the name of Christ, and assumed human and
   external names. Therefore it is the Catholic Church alone which retains
   true worship.

   This is the fountain of truth, this is the abode of the faith, this is
   the temple of God; into which if any one shall not enter, or from which
   if any shall go out, he is estranged from the hope of life and eternal
   salvation. No one ought to flatter himself with persevering strife. For
   the contest is respecting life and salvation, which, unless it is
   carefully and diligently kept in view, will be lost and extinguished.
   But, however, because all the separate assemblies of heretics call
   themselves Christians in preference to others, and think that theirs is
   the Catholic Church, it must be known that the true Catholic Church is
   that in which there is confession and repentance, [910] which treats in
   a wholesome manner the sins and wounds to which the weakness of the
   flesh is liable. I have related these things in the meanwhile for the
   sake of admonition, that no one who desires to avoid error may be
   entangled in a greater error, while he is ignorant of the secret [911]
   of the truth. Afterwards, in a particular and separate work, we will
   more fully and copiously [912] contend against all divisions of
   falsehoods. It follows that, since we have spoken sufficiently on the
   subject of true religion and wisdom, we discuss the subject of justice
   in the next book.

    General Notes by the American Editor.

      I.

   (On cap. 29.)

   Here we should look for something also concerning the Holy Spirit. But
   our author's principle is doubtless a reflection of the prevailing
   sentiment of the Church at this period, which was perhaps a violent
   exaggeration of our Lord's example (Mark iv. 33). And see something of
   this on p. 140, note 6, infra; also Matt. vii. 6.

      II.

   (On cap. 30.)

   The simplicity with which our author gives a note of the Catholic
   Church, in accordance with African canons and the teaching of Cyprian,
   is very noteworthy. It never occurred to him that communion with any
   one particular See was the note. Hippolytus alone would have reminded
   him that the worst heretics had been in communion with both Zephyrinus
   and Callistus in his days (see vol. v. pp. [68]156 and [69]160; also
   Ibid., [70]125, [71]130), and that orthodoxy had been persecuted by
   these bishops of Rome.

   [904] The Phrygians were the followers of Montanus, who was the founder

   of Ardaba, on the borders of Phrygia, on which account his followers
   were called the Phrygian or Cataphrygian heretics. Montanus gave
   himself out for the Paraclete or Comforter whom our Lord promised to
   send. The most eminent of his followers were Priscilla and Maximilla.
   [But see vol. ii. pp. [75]4 and 5; also vol. iii. and iv. this series,

   century, They assumed to themselves the title of Cathari, or the pure.
   They refused to re-admit to the ir communion those who had once fallen
   away, and allowed no place for repentance.

   [906] The Valentinians were the followers of Valentinus, an Egyptian
   who founded a sect in the second century. His system somewhat resembled
   the Gnostics. He taught that Christ had a heavenly or spiritual body,
   and assumed nothing from the Virgin Mary.

   [907] The Marcionites were the followers of Marcion, a heretic of the
   second century, who held the Oriental belief of two independent,
   eternal, co-existing principles, one of good, the other of evil. He
   applied this doctrine to Christianity. His chief opponent was
   Tertullian.

   [908] The Anthropians held that Jesus Christ was nothing but man

    Chap. I.--Of the Non-Condemnation of Accused Persons Without a Hearing of
    Their Cause; From What Cause Philosophers Despised the Sacred Writings; Of
    the First Advocates of the Christian Religion.

   I Entertain no doubt, O mighty Emperor Constantine, [913] --since they
   are impatient through excessive superstition,--that if any one of those
   who are foolishly religious should take in hand this work of ours, in
   which that matchless Creator of all things and Ruler of this boundless
   world is asserted, he would even assail it with abusive language, and
   perhaps, having scarcely read the beginning, would dash it to the
   ground, cast it from him, curse it, and think himself contaminated and
   bound by inexpiable guilt if he should patiently read or hear these
   things. We demand, however, from this man, if it is possible, by the
   right of human nature, [914] that he should not condemn before that he
   knows the whole matter. For if the right of defending themselves is
   given to sacrilegious persons, and to traitors and sorcerers, and if it
   is lawful for no one to be condemned beforehand, his cause being as yet
   untried, we do not appear to ask unjustly, that if there shall be any
   one who shall have fallen upon this subject, if he shall read it, he
   read it throughout; if he shall hear it, that he put off the forming of
   an opinion until the end. But I know the obstinacy of men; we shall
   never succeed in obtaining this. For they fear lest they should be
   overcome by us, and be compelled at length to yield, truth itself
   crying out. They interrupt, therefore, and make hindrances, that they
   may not hear; and close their eyes, that they may not see the light
   which we present to them. Wherefore they themselves plainly show their
   distrust in their own abandoned system, since they neither venture to
   investigate, nor to engage with as, because they know that they are
   easily overpowered. And therefore, discussion being taken away,


   "Wisdom is driven from among them, they have recourse to violence,"

   as Ennius says; and because they eagerly endeavour to condemn as guilty
   those whom they plainly know to be innocent, they are unwilling to be
   agreed respecting innocence itself; as though, in truth, it were a
   greater injustice to have condemned innocence, when proved to be such,
   than unheard. But, as I said, they are afraid lest, if they should
   hear, they should be unable to condemn.

   And therefore they torture, put to death, and banish the worshippers of
   the Most High God, that is, the righteous; nor are they, who so
   vehemently hate, themselves able to assign the causes of their hatred.
   Because they are themselves in error, they are angry with those who
   follow the path of truth; and when they are able to correct themselves,
   they greatly increase [915] their errors by cruel deeds, they are
   stained with the blood of the innocent, and they tear away with
   violence souls dedicated to God from the lacerated bodies. Such are the
   men with whom we now endeavour to engage and to dispute: these are the
   men whom we would lead away from a foolish persuasion to the truth, men
   who would more readily drink blood than imbibe the words of the
   righteous. What then? Will our labour be in vain? By no means. For if
   we shall not be able to deliver these from death, to which they are
   hastening with the greatest speed; if we cannot recall them from that
   devious path to life and light, since they themselves oppose their own
   safety; yet we shall strengthen those who belong to us, whose opinion
   is not settled, and founded and fixed with solid roots. For many of
   them waver, and especially those who have any acquaintance with
   literature. For in this respect philosophers, and orators, and poets
   are pernicious, because they are easily able to ensnare unwary souls by
   the sweetness of their discourse, and of their poems flowing with
   delightful modulation. These are sweets [916] which conceal poison. And
   on this account I wished to connect wisdom with religion, that that
   vain system may not at all injure the studious; so that now the
   knowledge of literature may not only be of no injury to religion and
   righteousness, but may even be of the greatest profit, if he who has
   learned it should be more instructed in virtues and wiser in truth.

   Moreover, even though it should be profitable to no other, it certainly
   will be so to us: the conscience will delight itself, and the mind will
   rejoice that it is engaged in the light of truth, which is the food of
   the soul, being overspread with an incredible kind of pleasantness. But
   we must not despair. Perchance


   "We sing not to the deaf." [917]

   For neither are affairs in so bad a condition that there are no sound
   minds to which the truth may be pleasing, and which may both see and
   follow the right course when it is pointed out to them. Only let the
   cup be anointed [918] with the heavenly honey of wisdom, that the
   bitter remedies may be drunk by them unawares, without any annoyance,
   whilst the first sweetness of taste by its allurement conceals, under
   the cover [919] of pleasantness, the bitterness of the harsh flavour.
   For this is especially the cause why, with the wise and the learned,
   and the princes of this world, the sacred Scriptures are without
   credit, because the prophets spoke in common and simple language, as
   though they spoke to the people. And therefore they are despised by
   those who are willing to hear or read nothing except that which is
   polished and eloquent; nor is anything able to remain fixed in their
   minds, except that which charms their ears by a more soothing sound.
   But those things which appear humble [920] are considered anile,
   foolish, and common. So entirely do they regard nothing as true, except
   that which is pleasant to the ear; nothing as credible, except that
   which can excite [921] pleasure: no one estimates [922] a subject by
   its truth, but by its embellishment. Therefore they do not believe the
   sacred writings, because they are without any pretence; [923] but they
   do not even believe those who explain them, because they also are
   either altogether ignorant, or at any rate possessed of little
   learning. For it very rarely happens that they are wholly eloquent; and
   the cause of this is evident. For eloquence is subservient to the
   world, it desires to display itself to the people, and to please in
   things which are evil; since it often endeavours to overpower the
   truth, that it may show its power; it seeks wealth, desires honours; in
   short, it demands the highest degree of dignity. Therefore it despises
   these subjects as low; it avoids secret things as contrary to itself,
   inasmuch as it rejoices in publicity, and longs for the multitude and
   celebrity. Hence it comes to pass that wisdom and truth need suitable
   heralds. And if by chance any of the learned have betaken themselves to
   it, they have not been sufficient for its defence.

   Of those who are known to me, Minucius Felix was of no ignoble rank
   among pleaders. His book, which bears the title of Octavius, declares
   how suitable a maintainer of the truth he might have been, if he had
   given himself altogether to that pursuit. [924] Septimius Tertullianus
   also was skilled in literature of every kind; but in eloquence he had
   little readiness, and was not sufficiently polished, and very obscure.
   Not even therefore did he find sufficient renown. Cyprianus, therefore,
   was above all others [925] distinguished and renowned, since he had
   sought great glory to himself from the profession of the art of
   oratory, and he wrote very many things worthy of admiration in their
   particular class. For he was of a turn of mind which was ready,
   copious, agreeable, and (that which is the greatest excellence of
   style) plain and open; so that you cannot determine whether he was more
   embellished in speech, or more ready in explanation, or more powerful
   in persuasion. And yet he is unable to please those who are ignorant of
   the mystery except by his words; inasmuch as the things which he spoke
   are mystical, and prepared with this object, that they may be heard by
   the faithful only: in short, he is accustomed to be derided by the
   learned men of this age, to whom his writings have happened to be
   known. I have heard of a certain man who was skilful indeed, who by the
   change of a single letter called him Coprianus, [926] as though he were
   one who had applied to old women's fables a mind which was elegant and
   fitted for better things. But if this happened to him whose eloquence
   is not unpleasant, what then must we suppose happens to those whose
   discourse is meagre and displeasing, who could have had neither the
   power of persuasion, nor subtlety in arguing, nor any severity at all
   for refuting?

    Chap. II.--To What an Extent the Christian Truth Has Been Assailed by Rash
    Men.

   Therefore, because there have been wanting among us suitable and
   skilful teachers, who might vigorously and sharply refute public
   errors, and who might defend the whole cause of truth with elegance and
   copiousness, this very want incited some to venture to write against
   the truth, which was unknown to them. I pass by those who in former
   times in vain assailed it. When I was teaching rhetorical learning in
   Bithynia, having been called thither, and it had happened that at the
   same time the temple of God was overthrown, there were living at the
   same place two men who insulted the truth as it lay prostrate and
   overthrown, I know not whether with greater arrogance or harshness: the
   one of whom professed himself the high priest of philosophy; [927] but
   he was so addicted to vice, that, though a teacher of abstinence, he
   was not less inflamed with avarice than with lusts; so extravagant in
   his manner of living, that though in his school he was the maintainer
   of virtue, the praiser of parsimony and poverty, he dined less
   sumptuously in a palace than at his own house. Nevertheless he
   sheltered [928] his vices by his hair [929] and his cloak, and (that
   which is the greatest screen [930] ) by his riches; and that he might
   increase these, he used to penetrate with wonderful effort [931] to the
   friendships of the judges; and he suddenly attached them to himself by
   the authority of a fictitious name, not only that he might make a
   traffic of their decisions, but also that he might by this influence
   hinder his neighbours, whom he was driving from their homes and lands,
   from the recovery of their property. This man, in truth, who overthrew
   his own arguments by his character, or censured his own character by
   his arguments, a weighty censor and most keen accuser against himself,
   at the very same time in which a righteous people were impiously
   assailed, vomited forth three books against the Christian religion and
   name; professing, above all things, that it was the office of a
   philosopher to remedy the errors of men, and to recall them to the true
   way, that is, to the worship of the gods, by whose power and majesty,
   as he said, the world is governed; and not to permit that inexperienced
   men should be enticed by the frauds of any, lest their simplicity
   should be a prey and sustenance to crafty men.

   Therefore he said that he had undertaken this office, worthy of
   philosophy, that he might hold out to those who do not see the light of
   wisdom, not only that they may return to a healthy state of mind,
   having undertaken the worship of the gods, but also that, having laid
   aside their pertinacious obstinacy, they may avoid tortures of the
   body, nor wish in vain to endure cruel lacerations of their limbs. But
   that it might be evident on what account he had laboriously worked out
   that task, he broke out profusely into praises of the princes, whose
   piety and foresight, as he himself indeed said, had been distinguished
   both in other matters, and especially in defending the religious rites
   of the gods; that he had, in short, consulted the interests of men, in
   order that, impious and foolish superstition having been restrained,
   all men might have leisure for lawful sacred rites, and might
   experience the gods propitious to them. But when he wished to weaken
   the grounds of that religion against which he was pleading, he appeared
   senseless, vain, and ridiculous; because that weighty adviser of the
   advantage of others was ignorant not only what to oppose, but even what
   to speak. For if any of our religion were present, although they were
   silent on account of the time, nevertheless in their mind they derided
   him; since they saw a man professing that he would enlighten others,
   when he himself was blind; that he would recall others from error, when
   he himself was ignorant where to plant his feet; that he would instruct
   others to the truth, of which he himself had never seen even a spark at
   any time; inasmuch as he who was a professor of wisdom, endeavoured to
   overthrow wisdom. All, however, censured this, that he undertook this
   work at that time in particular, in which odious cruelty raged. O
   philosopher, a flatterer, and a time-server! But this man was despised,
   as his vanity deserved; for he did not gain the popularity which he
   hoped for, and the glory which he eagerly sought for was changed into
   censure and blame. [932]

   Another [933] wrote the same subject with more bitterness, who was then
   of the number of the judges, and who was especially the adviser of
   enacting persecution; and not contented with this crime, he also
   pursued with writings those whom he had persecuted. For he composed two
   books, not against the Christians, lest he might appear to assail them
   in a hostile manner but to the Christians, that he might be thought to
   consult for them with humanity and kindness. And in these writings he
   endeavoured so to prove the falsehood of sacred Scripture, as though it
   were altogether contradictory to itself; for he expounded some chapters
   which seemed to be at variance with themselves, enumerating so many and
   such secret [934] things, that he sometimes appears to have been one of
   the same sect. But if this was so, what Demosthenes will be able to
   defend from the charge of impiety him who became the betrayer of the
   religion to which he had given his assent, [935] and of the faith the
   name of which he had assumed, [936] and of the mystery [937] which he
   had received, unless it happened by chance that the sacred writings
   fell into his hands? What rashness was it, therefore, to dare to
   destroy that which no one explained to him! It was well that he either
   learned nothing or understood nothing. For contradiction is as far
   removed from the sacred writings as he was removed from faith and
   truth. He chiefly, however, assailed Paul and Peter, and the other
   disciples, as disseminators of deceit, whom at the same time he
   testified to have been unskilled and unlearned. For he says that some
   of them made gain by the craft of fishermen, as though he took it ill
   that some Aristophanes or Aristarchus did not devise that subject.

    Chap. III.--Of the Truth of the Christian Doctrine, and the Vanity of Its
    Adversaries; And that Christ Was Not a Magician.

   The desire of inventing, [938] therefore, and craftiness were absent
   from these men, since they were unskilful. Or what unlearned man could
   invent things adapted to one another, and coherent, when the most
   learned of the philosophers, Plato and Aristotle, and Epicurus and
   Zeno, themselves spoke things at variance with one another, and
   contrary? For this is the nature of falsehoods, that they cannot be
   coherent. But their teaching, because it is true, everywhere agrees,
   [939] and is altogether consistent with itself; and on this account it
   effects persuasion, because it is based on a consistent plan. They did
   not therefore devise that religion for the sake of gain and advantage,
   inasmuch as both by their precepts and in reality they followed that
   course of life which is without pleasures, and despised all things
   which are reckoned among good things, and since they not only endured
   death for their faith, but also both knew and foretold that they were
   about to die, and afterwards that all who followed their system would
   suffer cruel and impious things. But he [940] affirmed that Christ
   Himself was put to flight by the Jews, and having collected a band of
   nine hundred men, committed robberies. Who would venture to oppose so
   great an authority? We must certainly believe this, for perchance some
   Apollo announced it to him in his slumbers. So many robbers have at all
   times perished, and do perish daily, and you yourself have certainly
   condemned many: which of them after his crucifixion was called, I will
   not say a God, but a man? But you perchance believed it from the
   circumstance of your having consecrated the homicide Mars as a god,
   though you would not have done this if the Areopagites had crucified
   him.

   The same man, when he endeavoured to overthrow his wonderful deeds, and
   did not however deny them, wished to show that Apollonius [941]
   performed equal or even greater deeds. It is strange that he omitted to
   mention Apuleius, [942] of whom many and wonderful things are
   accustomed to be related. Why therefore, O senseless one, does no one
   worship Apollonius in the place of God? unless by chance you alone do
   so, who are worthy forsooth of that god, with whom the true God will
   punish you everlastingly. If Christ is a magician because He performed
   wonderful deeds, it is plain that Apollonius, who, according to your
   description, when Domitian wished to punish him, suddenly disappeared
   on his trial, was more skilful than He who was both arrested and
   crucified. But perhaps he wished from this very thing to prove the
   arrogance of Christ, in that He made Himself God, that the other may
   appear to have been more modest, who, though he performed greater
   actions, as this one thinks, nevertheless did not claim that for
   himself. I omit at present to compare the works themselves, because in
   the second and preceding book I have spoken respecting the fraud and
   tricks of the magic art. I say that there is no one who would not wish
   that that should especially befall him after death which even the
   greatest kings desire. For why do men prepare for themselves
   magnificent sepulchres why statues and images? why by some illustrious
   deeds, or even by death undergone in behalf of their countrymen, do
   they endeavour to deserve the good opinions of men? Why, in short, have
   you yourself wished to raise a monument of your talent, built with this
   detestable folly, as if with mud, except that you hope for immortality
   from the remembrance of your name? It is foolish, therefore, to imagine
   that Apollonius did not desire that which he would plainly wish for if
   he were able to attain to it; because there is no one who refuses
   immortality, and especially when you say that he was both adored by
   some as a god, and that his image was set up under the name of
   Hercules, the averter of evil, and is even now honoured by the
   Ephesians.

   He could not therefore after death be believed to be a god, because it
   was evident that he was both a man and a magician; and for this reason
   he affected [943] divinity under the title of a name belonging to
   another, for in his own name he was unable to attain it, nor did he
   venture to make the attempt. But he of whom we speak [944] could both
   be believed to be a god, because he was not a magician, and was
   believed to be such because he was so in truth. I do not say this, he
   says, that Apollonius was not accounted a god, because he did not wish
   it, but that it may be evident that we, who did not at once connect a
   belief in his divinity with wonderful deeds, are wiser than you, who on
   account of slight wonders believed that he was a god. It is not
   wonderful if you, who are far removed from the wisdom of God,
   understand nothing at all of those things which you have read, since
   the Jews, who from the beginning had frequently read the prophets, and
   to whom the mystery [945] of God had been assigned, were nevertheless
   ignorant of what they read. Learn, therefore, if you have any sense,
   that Christ was not believed by us to be God on this account, because
   He did wonderful things, but because we saw that all things were done
   in His case which were announced to us by the prediction of the
   prophets. He performed wonderful deeds: we might have supposed Him to
   be a magician, as you now suppose Him to be, and the Jews then supposed
   Him, if all the prophets did not with one accord [946] proclaim that
   Christ would do those very things. Therefore we believe Him to be God,
   not more from His wonderful deeds and works, than from that very cross
   which you as dogs lick, since that also was predicted at the same time.
   It was not therefore on His own testimony (for who can be believed when
   he speaks concerning himself?), but on the testimony of the prophets
   who long before foretold all things which He did and suffered, that He
   gained a belief in His divinity, which could have happened neither to
   Apollonius, [947] nor to Apuleius, nor to any of the magicians; nor can
   it happen at any time. When, therefore, he had poured forth such absurd
   ravings [948] of his ignorance, when he had eagerly endeavoured utterly
   to destroy the truth, he dared to give to his books which were impious
   and the enemies of God the title of "truth-loving." O blind breast! O
   mind more black than Cimmerian darkness, as they say! He may perhaps
   have been a disciple of Anaxagoras, [949] to whom snows were as black
   as ink. But it is the same blindness, to give the name of falsehood to
   truth, and of truth to falsehood. Doubtless the crafty man wished to
   conceal the wolf under the skin of a sheep, [950] that he might ensnare
   the reader by a deceitful title. Let it be true; grant that you did
   this from ignorance, not from malice: what truth, however, have you
   brought to us, except that, being a defender of the gods, you had at
   last betrayed those very gods? For, having set forth the praises of the
   Supreme God, whom you confessed to be king, most mighty, the maker of
   all things, the fountain of honours, the parent of all, the creator and
   preserver of all living creatures, you took away the kingdom from your
   own Jupiter; and when you had driven him from the supreme power, you
   reduced him to the rank of servants. Thus your own conclusion [951]
   convicts you of folly, vanity, and error. For you affirm that the gods
   exist, and yet you subject and enslave them to that God whose religion
   you attempt to overturn.

    Chap. IV.--Why This Work Was Published, and Again of Tertullian and Cyprian.

   Since, therefore, they of whom I have spoken had set forth their
   sacrilegious writings in my presence, and to my grief, being incited
   both by the arrogant impiety of these, and by the consciousness of
   truth itself, and (as I think) by God, I have undertaken this office,
   that with all the strength of my mind I might refute the accusers of
   righteousness; not that I should write against these, who might be
   crushed with a few words, but that I might once for all by one attack
   overthrow all who everywhere effect, or have effected, the same work.
   For I do not doubt that very many others, and in many places, and that
   not only in Greek, but also in Latin writings, have raised a monument
   of their own unrighteousness. And since I was not able to reply to
   these separately, I thought that this cause was to be so pleaded by me
   that I might overthrow former writers, together with all their
   writings, and cut off from future writers the whole power of writing
   and of replying. [952] Only let them attend, and I will assuredly
   effect that whosoever shall know these things, must either embrace that
   which he before condemned, or, which is next to it, cease at length to
   deride it. Although Tertullian fully pleaded the same cause in that
   treatise which is entitled the Apology, [953] yet, inasmuch as it is
   one thing to answer accusers, which consists in defence or denial only,
   and another thing to instruct, which we do, in which the substance of
   the whole system must be contained, I have not shrunk from this labour,
   that I might complete the subject, which Cyprian did not fully carry
   out in that discourse in which he endeavours to refute Demetrianus (as
   he himself says) railing at and clamouring [954] against the truth.
   Which subject he did not handle as he ought to have done; for he ought
   to have been refuted not by the testimonies of Scripture, which he
   plainly considered vain, fictitious, and false, but by arguments and
   reason. For, since he was contending against a man who was ignorant of
   the truth, he ought for a while to have laid aside divine readings, and
   to have formed from the beginning this man as one who was altogether
   ignorant, [955] and to have shown to him by degrees the beginnings of
   light, that he might not be dazzled, [956] the whole of its brightness
   being presented to him. [957]

   For as an infant is unable, on account of the tenderness of its
   stomach, to receive the nourishment of solid and strong food, but is
   supported by liquid and soft milk, until, its strength being confirmed,
   it can feed on stronger nourishment; so also it was befitting that this
   man, because he was not yet capable of receiving divine things, should
   be presented with human testimonies--that is, of philosophers and
   historians--in order that he might especially be refuted by his own
   authorities. And since he did not do this, being carried away by his
   distinguished knowledge of the sacred writings, so that he was content
   with those things alone in which faith consists, I have undertaken,
   with the favour of God, to do this, and at the same time to prepare the
   way for the imitation of others. And if, through my exhortation,
   learned and eloquent men shall begin to betake themselves to this
   subject, and shall choose to display their talents and power of
   speaking in this field of truth, no one can doubt that false religions
   will quickly disappear, and philosophy altogether fall, if all shall be
   persuaded that this alone is religion and the only true wisdom. But I
   have wandered from the subject further than I wished.

    Chap. V.--There Was True Justice Under Saturnus, But It Was Banished by
    Jupiter.

   Now the promised disputation concerning justice must be given; which is
   either by itself the greatest virtue, or by itself the fountain of
   virtue, which not only philosophers sought, but poets also, who were
   much earlier, and were esteemed as wise before the origin of the name
   of philosophy. These clearly understood that this justice was absent
   from the affairs of men; and they feigned that it, being offended with
   the vices of men, departed from the earth, and withdrew to heaven; and
   that they may teach what it is to live justly (for they are accustomed
   to give precepts by circumlocutions), they repeat examples of justice
   from the times of Saturnus, which they call the golden times, and they
   relate in what condition human life was while it delayed on the earth.
   [958] And this is not to be regarded as a poetic fiction, but as the
   truth. For, while Saturnus reigned, the religious worship of the gods
   not having yet been instituted, nor any [959] race being as yet set
   apart in the belief of its divinity, God was manifestly worshipped. And
   therefore there were neither dissensions, nor enmities, nor wars.


   "Not yet had rage unsheathed maddened swords,"

   as Germanicus Cæsar speaks in his poem translated from Aratus, [960]


   "Nor had discord been known among relatives."

   No, nor even among strangers: but there were no swords at all to be
   unsheathed. For who, when justice was present and in vigour, would
   think respecting his own protection, since no one plotted against him;
   or respecting the destruction of another, since no one desired
   anything?


   "They preferred to live content with a simple mode of life,"

   as Cicero [961] relates in his poem; and this is peculiar to our
   religion. "It was not even allowed to mark out or to divide the plain
   with a boundary: men sought all things in common;" [962] since God had
   given the earth in common to all, that they might pass their life in
   common, not that mad and raging avarice might claim all things for
   itself, and that that which was produced for all might not be wanting
   to any. And this saying of the poet ought so to be taken, not as
   suggesting the idea that individuals at that time had no private
   property, but it must be regarded as a poetical figure; that we may
   understand that men were so liberal, that they did not shut up the
   fruits of the earth produced for them, nor did they in solitude brood
   over the things stored up, but admitted the poor to share the fruits of
   their labour:--


   "Now streams of milk, now streams of nectar flowed." [963]

   And no wonder, since the storehouses of the good liberally lay open to
   all. Nor did avarice intercept the divine bounty, and thus cause hunger
   and thirst in common; but all alike had abundance, since they who had
   possessions gave liberally and bountifully to those who had not. But
   after that Saturnus had been banished from heaven, and had arrived in
   Latium,--


   "Exiled from his throne

   By Jove, his mightier heir," [964] --

   since the people either through fear of the new king, or of their own
   accord, had become corrupted and ceased to worship God, and had begun
   to esteem the king in the place of God, since he himself, almost a
   parricide, was an example to others to the injury of piety,--


   "The most just Virgin in haste deserted the lands;" [965]

   but not as Cicero says, [966]


   "And settled, in the kingdom of Jupiter, [967] [968] and in a part of
   the heaven."

   For how could she settle or tarry in the kingdom of him who expelled
   his father from his kingdom, harassed him with war, and drove him as an
   exile over the whole world?


   "He gave to the black serpents their noxious poison,

   And ordered wolves to prowl;" [969]

   that is, he introduced among men hatred, and envy, and stratagem; so
   that they were poisonous as serpents, and rapacious as wolves. And they
   truly do this who persecute those who are righteous and faithful
   towards God, and give to judges the power of using violence against the
   innocent. Perhaps Jupiter may have done something of this kind for the
   overthrow and removal of righteousness; and on this account he is
   related to have made serpents fierce, and to have whetted the spirit of
   wolves.


   "Then war's indomitable rage,

   And greedy lust of gain;" [970]

   and not without reason. For the worship of God being taken away, men
   lost the knowledge of good and evil. Thus the common intercourse of
   life perished from among then, and the bond of human society was
   destroyed. Then they began to contend with one another, and to plot,
   and to acquire for themselves glory from the shedding of human blood.

    Chap. VI.--After the Banishment of Justice, Lust, Unjust Laws, Daring,
    Avarice, Ambition, Pride, Impiety, and Other Vices Reigned.

   And the source of all these evils was lust; which, indeed, burst forth
   from the contempt of true majesty. For not only did they who had a
   superfluity fail to bestow a share upon others, but they even seized
   the property of others, drawing everything to their private gain; and
   the things which formerly even individuals laboured to obtain for the
   common use of men, [971] were now conveyed to the houses of a few. For,
   that they might subdue others by slavery, they began especially to
   withdraw and collect together the necessaries of life, and to keep them
   firmly shut up, that they might make the bounties of heaven their own;
   not on account of kindness, [972] a feeling which had no existence in
   them, but that they might sweep together all the instruments of lust
   and avarice. They also, under the name of justice, passed most unequal
   and unjust laws, by which they might defend their plunder and avarice
   against the force of the multitude. They prevailed, therefore, as much
   by authority as by strength, or resources, or malice. And since there
   was in them no trace of justice, the offices of which are humanity,
   equity, pity, they now began to rejoice in a proud and swollen
   inequality, and made [973] themselves higher than other men, by a
   retinue of attendants, and by the sword, and by the brilliancy of their
   garments. For this reason they invented for themselves honours, and
   purple robes, and fasces, that, being supported by the terror produced
   by axes and swords, they might, as it were by the right of masters,
   rule them, stricken with fear, and alarmed. Such was the condition in
   which the life of man was placed by that king who, having defeated and
   put to flight a parent, did not seize his kingdom, but set up an
   impious tyranny by violence and armed men, and took away that golden
   age of justice, and compelled men to become wicked and impious, even
   from this very circumstance, that he turned them away from God to the
   worship of himself; and the terror of his excessive power had extorted
   this.

   For who would not fear him who was girded about with arms, whom the
   unwonted gleam of steel and swords surrounded? Or what stranger would
   he spare who had not even spared his own father? Whom, in truth, should
   he fear, who had conquered in war, and destroyed by massacre the race
   of the Titans, which was strong and excelling in might? What wonder if
   the whole multitude, pressed by unusual fear, had given themselves up
   to the adulation of a single man? Him they venerated, to him they paid
   the greatest honour. And since it is judged to be a kind of
   obsequiousness to imitate the customs and vices of a king, all men laid
   aside piety, lest, if they should live piously, they might seem to
   upbraid the wickedness of the king. Thus, being corrupted by continual
   imitation, they abandoned divine right, and the practice of living
   wickedly by degrees became a habit. And now nothing remained of the
   pious and excellent condition of the preceding age; but justice being
   banished, and drawing with her the truth, left to men error, ignorance,
   and blindness. The poets therefore were ignorant, who sung that she
   fled to heaven, to the kingdom of Jupiter. For if justice was on the
   earth in the age which they call "golden," it is plain that she was
   driven away by Jupiter, who changed the golden age. But the change of
   the age and the expulsion of justice is to be deemed nothing else, as I
   have said, than the laying aside of divine religion, which alone
   effects that man should esteem man dear, and should know that he is
   bound to him by the tie of brotherhood, since God is alike a Father to
   all, so as to share the bounties of the common God and Father with
   those who do not possess them; to injure no one, to oppress no one, not
   to close his door against a stranger, nor his ear against a suppliant,
   but to be bountiful, beneficent, and liberal, which Tullius [974]
   thought to be praises suitable to a king. This truly is justice, and
   this is the golden age, which was first corrupted when Jupiter reigned,
   and shortly afterwards, when he himself and all his offspring were
   consecrated as gods, and the worship of many deities undertaken, had
   been altogether taken away.

    Chap. VII.--Of the Coming of Jesus, and Its Fruit; And of the Virtues and
    Vices of that Age.

   But God, as a most indulgent parent, when the last time approached,
   sent a messenger to bring back that old age, and justice which had been
   put to flight, that the human race might not be agitated by very great
   and perpetual errors. Therefore the appearance of that golden time
   returned, and justice was restored to the earth, but was assigned to a
   few; and this justice is nothing else than the pious and religious
   worship of the one God. But perhaps some may be inclined to ask, why,
   if this be justice, it is not given to all mankind, and the whole
   multitude does not agree to it. This is a matter of great disputation,
   why a difference was retained by God when He gave justice to the earth;
   and this I have shown in another place, and whenever a favourable
   opportunity shall occur it shall be explained. Now it is sufficient
   very briefly to signify it: that virtue can neither be discerned,
   unless it has vices opposed to it; nor be perfect, unless it is
   exercised by adversity. [975] For God designed that there should be
   this distinction between good and evil things, that we may know from
   that which is evil the quality of the good, and also the quality of the
   evil from the good; nor can the nature of the one be understood if the
   other is taken away. God therefore did not exclude evil, that the
   nature of virtue might be evident. For how could patient endurance
   [976] retain its meaning and name if there were nothing which we were
   compelled to endure? [977] How could faith devoted to its God deserve
   praise, unless there were some one who wished to turn us away from God?
   For on this account He permitted the unjust to be more powerful, that
   they might be able to compel to evil; and on this account to be more
   numerous, that virtue might be precious, because it is rare. And this
   very point is admirably and briefly shown by Quintilian in "the muffled
   head." [978] "For what virtue," he says, "would there be in innocence,
   had not its rarity furnished it with praises? But because it is
   provided by nature that hatred, desire, and anger drive men blindly to
   that object to which they have applied themselves, to be free from
   fault appears to be beyond the power of man. Otherwise, if nature had
   given to all men equal affections, piety would be nothing."

   How true this is, the necessity of the case itself teaches. For if it
   is virtue to resist with fortitude evils and vices, it is evident that,
   without evil and vice, there is no perfected virtue; and that God might
   render this complete and perfect, He retained that which was contrary
   to it, with which it might contend. For, being agitated by evils which
   harass it, it gains stability; and in proportion to the frequency with
   which it is urged onward, is the firmness with which it is
   strengthened. This is evidently the cause which effects that, although
   justice is sent to men, yet it cannot be said that a golden age exists;
   because God has not taken away evil, that He might retain that
   diversity which alone preserves the mystery of a divine religion.

    Chap. VIII.--Of Justice Known to All, But Not Embraced; Of the True Temple
    of God, and of His Worship, that All Vices May Be Subdued.

   They, therefore, who think that no one is just, have justice before
   their eyes, but are unwilling to discern it. For what reason is there
   why they should describe it either in poems or in all their discourse,
   complaining of its absence, when it is very easy for them to be good if
   they wish? Why do you depict to yourselves justice as worthless, [979]
   and wish that she may fall from heaven, as it were, represented in some
   image? Behold, she is in your sight; receive her, if you are able, and
   place her in the abode of your breast; and do not imagine that this is
   difficult, or unsuited to the times. Be just and good, and the justice
   which you seek will follow you of her own accord. Lay aside every evil
   thought from your hearts, and that golden age will at once return to
   you, which you cannot attain to by any other means than by beginning to
   worship the true God. But you long for justice on the earth, while the
   worship of false gods continues, which cannot possibly come to pass.
   But it was not possible even at that time when you imagine, because
   those deities whom you impiously worship were not yet produced, and the
   worship of the one God must have prevailed throughout the earth; of
   that God, I say, who hates wickedness and requires goodness; whose
   temple is not stones or clay, but man himself, who bears the image of
   God. And this temple is adorned not with corruptible gifts of gold and
   jewels, but with the lasting offices of virtues. Learn, therefore, if
   any intelligence is left to you, that men are wicked and unjust because
   gods are worshipped; and that all evils daily increase to the affairs
   of men on this account, because God the Maker and Governor of this
   world has been neglected; because, contrary to that which is right,
   impious superstitions have been taken up; and lastly, because you do
   not permit God to be worshipped even by a few.

   But if God only were worshipped, there would not be dissensions and
   wars, since men would know that they are the sons of one God; and,
   therefore, among those who were connected by the sacred and inviolable
   bond of divine relationship, there would be no plottings, inasmuch as
   they would know what kind of punishments God prepared for the
   destroyers of souls, who sees through secret crimes, and even the very
   thoughts themselves. There would be no frauds or plunderings if they
   had learned, through the instruction of God, to be content with that
   which was their own, though little, so that they might prefer solid and
   eternal things to those which are frail and perishable. There would be
   no adulteries, and debaucheries, and prostitution of women, if it were
   known to all, that whatever is sought beyond the desire of procreation
   is condemned by God. [980] Nor would necessity compel a woman to
   dishonour her modesty, to seek for herself a most disgraceful mode of
   sustenance; since the males also would restrain their lust, and the
   pious and religious contributions of the rich would succour the
   destitute. There would not, therefore, as I have said, be these evils
   on the earth, if there were by common consent a general observance
   [981] of the law of God, if those things were done by all which our
   people alone perform. How happy and how golden would be the condition
   of human affairs, if throughout the world gentleness, and piety, and
   peace, and innocence, and equity, and temperance, and faith, took up
   their abode! In short, there would be no need of so many and varying
   laws to rule men, since the law of God alone would be sufficient for
   perfect innocence; nor would there be any need of prisons, or the
   swords of rulers, or the terror of punishments, since the wholesomeness
   of the divine precepts infused into the breasts of men would of itself
   instruct them to works of justice. But now men are wicked through
   ignorance of what is right and good. And this, indeed, Cicero saw; for,
   discoursing on the subject of the laws, [982] he says: "As the world,
   with all its parts agreeing with one another, coheres and depends upon
   one and the same nature, so all men, being naturally confused among
   themselves, disagree through depravity; nor do they understand that
   they are related by blood, and that they are all subject to one and the
   same guardianship: for if this were kept in mind, assuredly men would
   live the life of gods." Therefore the unjust and impious worship of the
   gods has introduced all the evils by which mankind in turn destroy one
   another. For they could not retain their piety, who, as prodigal and
   rebellious children, had renounced the authority of God, the common
   parent of all.

    Chap. IX.--Of the Crimes of the Wicked, and the Torture Inflicted on the
    Christians.

   At times, however, they perceive that they are wicked, and praise the
   condition of the former ages, and conjecture that justice is absent
   because of their characters and deserts; for, though she presents
   herself to their eyes, they not only fail to receive or recognise her,
   but they even violently hate, and persecute, and endeavour to banish
   her. Let us suppose, in the meantime, that she whom we follow is not
   justice: how will they receive her whom they imagine to be the true
   justice, if she shall have come, when they torture and kill those whom
   they themselves confess to be imitators of the just, because they
   perform good and just actions; whereas, if they should put to death the
   wicked only, they would deserve to be unvisited by justice, who had no
   other reason for leaving the earth than the shedding of human blood?
   How much more so when they slay the righteous, and account the
   followers of justice themselves as enemies, yea, as more than enemies;
   who, though they eagerly seek their lives, and property, and children
   by sword and fire, yet are spared when conquered; and there is a place
   for clemency even amidst arms; or if they have determined to carry
   their cruelty to the utmost, nothing more is done towards them, except
   that they are put to death or led away to slavery! But this is
   unutterable which is done towards those who are ignorant of crime, and
   none are regarded as more guilty than those who are of all men
   innocent. Therefore most wicked men venture to make mention of justice,
   men who surpass wild beasts in ferocity, who lay waste the most gentle
   flock of God,--


   "Like gaunt wolves rushing from their den,

   Whom lawless hunger's sullen growl

   Drives forth into the night to prowl." [983]

   But these have been maddened not by the fury of hunger, but of the
   heart; nor do they prowl in a black mist, but by open plundering; nor
   does the consciousness of their crimes ever recall them from profaning
   the sacred and holy name of justice with that mouth which, like the
   jaws of beasts, is wet with the blood of the innocent. What must we say
   is especially the cause of this excessive and persevering hatred?


   "Does truth produce hatred," [984]

   as the poet says, as though inspired by the Divine Spirit, or are they
   ashamed to be bad in the presence of the just and good? Or is it rather
   from both causes? For the truth is always hateful on this account,
   because he who sins wishes to have free scope for sinning, and thinks
   that he cannot in any other way more securely enjoy the pleasure of his
   evil doings, than if there is no one whom his faults may displease.
   Therefore they endeavour entirely to exterminate and take them away as
   witnesses of their crimes and wickedness, and think them burthensome to
   themselves, as though their life were reproved. For why should any be
   unseasonably good, who, when the public morals are corrupted, should
   censure them by living well? Why should not all be equally wicked,
   rapacious, unchaste, adulterers, perjured, covetous, and fraudulent?
   Why should they not rather be taken out of the way, in whose presence
   they are ashamed to lead an evil life, who, though not by words, for
   they are silent, but by their very course of life, so unlike their own,
   assail and strike the forehead of sinners? For whoever disagrees with
   them appears to reprove them.

   Nor is it greatly to be wondered at if these things are done towards
   men, since for the same cause the people who were placed in hope, [985]
   and not ignorant of God, rose up against God Himself; and the same
   necessity follows the righteous which attacked the Author of
   righteousness Himself. Therefore they harass and torment them with
   studied kinds of punishments, and think it little to kill those whom
   they hate, unless cruelty also mocks their bodies. But if any through
   fear of pain or death, or by their own perfidy, have deserted the
   heavenly oath, [986] and have consented to deadly sacrifices, these
   they praise and load [987] with honours, that by their example they may
   allure others. But upon those who have highly esteemed their faith, and
   have not denied that they are worshippers of God, they fall with all
   the strength of their butchery, as though they thirsted for blood; and
   they call them desperate, [988] because they by no means spare their
   body; as though anything could be more desperate, than to torture and
   tear in pieces him whom you know to be innocent. Thus no sense of shame
   remains among those from whom all kind feeling is absent, and they
   retort upon just men reproaches which are befitting to themselves. For
   they call them impious, being themselves forsooth pious, and shrinking
   from the shedding of human blood; whereas, if they would consider their
   own acts, and the acts of those whom they condemn as impious, they
   would now understand how false they are, and more deserving of all
   those things which they either say or do against the good. For they are
   not of our number, but of theirs who besiege the roads in arms,
   practice piracy by sea; or if it has not been in their power openly to
   assail, secretly mix poisons; who kill their wives that they may gain
   their dowries, or their husbands that they may marry adulterers; who
   either strangle the sons born from themselves, or if they are too
   pious, expose them; who restrain their incestuous passions neither from
   a daughter, nor sister, nor mother, nor priestess; who conspire against
   their own citizens and country; who do not fear the sack; [989] who, in
   fine, commit sacrilege, and despoil the temples of the gods whom they
   worship; and, to speak of things which are light and usually practised
   by them, who hunt for inheritances, forge wills, either remove or
   exclude the just heirs; who prostitute their own persons to lust; who,
   in short, unmindful of what they were born, contend with women in
   passivity; [990] who, in violation of all propriety, [991] pollute and
   dishonour the most sacred part of their body; who mutilate themselves,
   and that which is more impious, in order that they may be priests of
   religion; who do not even spare their own life, but sell their lives to
   be taken away in public; who, if they sit as judges, corrupted by a
   bribe, either destroy the innocent or set free the guilty without
   punishment; who grasp at the heaven itself by sorceries, as though the
   earth would not contain their wickedness. These crimes, I say, and more
   than these, are plainly committed by those who are worshippers of the
   gods.

   Amidst these crimes of such number and magnitude, what place is there
   for justice? And I have collected a few only out of many, not for the
   purpose of censure, but to show their nature. Let those who shall wish
   to know all take in hand the books of Seneca, who was at the same time
   a most true describer and a most vehement accuser of the public morals
   and vices. But Lucilius also briefly and concisely described that dark
   life in these verses: "But now from morn to night, on festival and
   ordinary day alike, the whole people and the fathers with one accord
   display themselves in [992] the forum, and never depart from it. They
   have all given themselves to one and the same pursuit and art, that
   they may be able cautiously to deceive, to fight treacherously, to
   contend in flattery, each to pretend that he is a good man, to lie in
   wait, as if all were enemies to all." But which of these things can be
   laid to the charge of our people, [993] with whom the whole of religion
   consists in living without guilt and without spot? Since, therefore,
   they see that both they and their people do those things which we have
   said, but that ours practice nothing else but that which is just and
   good, they might, if they had any understanding, have perceived from
   this, both that they who do what is good are pious, and that they
   themselves who commit wicked actions are impious. For it is impossible
   that they who do not err in all the actions of their life, should err
   in the main point, that is, in religion, which is the chief of all
   things. For impiety, if taken up in that which is the most important,
   would follow through all the rest. And therefore [994] it is impossible
   that they who err in the whole of their life should not be deceived
   also in religion; inasmuch as piety, if it kept its rule in the chief
   point, would maintain its course in others. Thus it happens, that on
   either side the character of the main subject may be known from the
   state of the actions which are carried on.

    Chap. X.--Of False Piety, and of False and True Religion.

   It is worth while to investigate their piety, that from their merciful
   and pious actions it may be understood what is the character of those
   things which are done by them contrary to the laws of piety. And that I
   may not seem to attack any one with harshness, I will take a character
   from the poets, and one which is the greatest example of piety. In
   Maro, that king


   "Than who

   The breath of being none e'er drew,

   More brave, more pious, or more true," [995] --

   what proofs of justice did he bring forward to us?

   What can be more merciful than this piety? what more merciful than to
   immolate human victims to the dead, and to feed the fire with the blood
   of men as with oil? But perhaps this may not have been the fault of the
   hero himself, but of the poet, who polluted with distinguished
   wickedness "a man distinguished by his piety." [997] Where then, O
   poet, is that piety which you so frequently praise? Behold the pious
   Æneas:--


   "Four hapless youths of Sulmo's breed,

   And four who Ufens call their sire,

   He takes alive, condemned to bleed

   To Pallas' shade on Pallas' pyre." [998]

   Why, therefore, at the very same time when he was sending the men in
   chains to slaughter, did he say,


   "Fain would I grant the living peace," [999]

   when he ordered that those whom he had in his power alive should be
   slain in the place of cattle? But this, as I have said, was not his
   fault--for he perhaps had not received a liberal education--but yours;
   for, though you were learned, yet you were ignorant of the nature of
   piety, and you believed that that wicked and detestable action of his
   was the befitting exercise of piety. He is plainly called pious on this
   account only, because he loved his father. Why should I say that


   "The good Æneas owned their plea," [1000]

   and yet slew them? For, though adjured by the same father, and


   "By young Iulus' dawning day," [1001]

   he did not spare them,


   "Live fury kindling every vein" [1002]

   What! can any one imagine that there was any virtue in him who was
   fired with madness as stubble, and, forgetful of the shade of his
   father, by whom he was entreated, was unable to curb his wrath? He was
   therefore by no means pious who not only slew the unresisting, but even
   suppliants. Here some one will say: What then, or where, or of what
   character is piety? Truly it is among those who are ignorant of wars,
   who maintain concord with all, who are friendly even to their enemies,
   who love all men as brethren, who know how to restrain their anger, and
   to soothe every passion of the mind with calm government. How great a
   mist, therefore, how great a cloud of darkness and errors, has
   over-spread the breasts of men who, when they think themselves
   especially pious, then become especially impious? For the more
   religiously they honour those earthy images, so much the more wicked
   are they towards the name of the true divinity. And therefore they are
   often harassed with greater evils as the reward of their impiety; and
   because they know not the cause of these evils, the blame is altogether
   ascribed to fortune, and the philosophy of Epicurus finds a place, who
   thinks that nothing extends to the gods, and that they are neither
   influenced by favour nor moved by anger, because they often see their
   despisers happy, and their worshippers in misery. And this happens on
   this account, because when they seem to be religious and naturally
   good, they are believed to deserve nothing of that kind which they
   often suffer. However, they console themselves by accusing fortune; nor
   do they perceive that if she had any existence, she would never injure
   her worshippers. Piety of this kind is therefore deservedly followed by
   punishment; and the deity offended with the wickedness of men who are
   depraved in their religious worship, [1003] punishes them with heavy
   misfortune; who, although they live with holiness in the greatest faith
   and innocence, yet because they worship gods whose impious and profane
   rites are an abomination to the true God, are estranged from justice
   and the name of true piety. Nor is it difficult to show why the
   worshippers of the gods cannot be good and just. For how shall they
   abstain from the shedding of blood who worship bloodthirsty deities,
   Mars and Bellona? or how shall they spare their parents who worship
   Jupiter, who drove out his father? or how shall they spare their own
   infants who worship Saturnus? how shall they uphold chastity who
   worship a goddess who is naked, and an adulteress, and who prostitutes
   herself as it were among the gods? how shall they withhold themselves
   from plunder and frauds who are acquainted with the thefts of
   Mercurius, who teaches that to deceive is not the part of fraud, but of
   cleverness? how shall they restrain their lusts who worship Jupiter,
   Hercules, Liber, Apollo, and the others, whose adulteries and
   debaucheries with men and women are not only known to the learned, but
   are even set forth in the theatres, and made the subject of songs, so
   that they are notorious [1004] to all? Among these things is it
   possible for men to be just, who, although they were naturally good,
   would be trained to injustice by the very gods themselves? For, that
   you may propitiate the god whom you worship, there is need of those
   things with which you know that he is pleased and delighted. Thus it
   comes to pass that the god fashions the life of his worshippers
   according to the character of his own will, [1005] since the most
   religious worship is to imitate.

    Chap XI.--Of the Cruelty of the Heathens Against the Christians.

   Therefore, because justice is burthensome and unpleasant to those men
   who agree with the character of their gods, they exercise with violence
   against the righteous the same impiety which they show in other things.
   And not without reason are they spoken of by the prophets as beasts.
   Therefore it is excellently said by Marcus Tullius: [1006] "For if
   there is no one who would not prefer to die than to be changed into the
   figure of a beast, although he is about to have the mind of a man, how
   much more wretched is it to be of a brutalized mind in the figure of a
   man! To me, indeed, it seems as much worse as the mind is more
   excellent than the body." Therefore they view with disdain the bodies
   of beasts, though they are themselves more cruel than these; and they
   pride themselves on this account, that they were born men, though they
   have nothing belonging to man except the features and the eminent
   figure. For what Caucasus, what India, what Hyrcania ever nourished
   beasts so savage and so bloodthirsty? For the fury of all wild beasts
   rages until their appetite is satisfied; and when their hunger is
   appeased, immediately is pacified. That is truly a beast by whose
   command alone


   "With rivulets of slaughter reeks

   The stern embattled field."

   "Dire agonies, wild terrors swarm,

   And Death glares grim in many a form." [1007]

   No one can befittingly describe the cruelty of this beast, which
   reclines in one place, and yet rages with iron teeth throughout the
   world, and not only tears in pieces the limbs of men, but also breaks
   their very bones, and rages over their ashes, that there may be no
   place for their burial, as though they who confess God aimed at this,
   that their tombs should be visited, and not rather that they themselves
   may reach the presence of God.

   What brutality is it, what fury, what madness, to deny light to the
   living, earth to the dead? I say, therefore, that nothing is more
   wretched than those men whom necessity has either found or made the
   ministers of another's fury, the satellites of an impious command. For
   that was no honour, or exaltation of dignity, but the condemnation of a
   man to torture, and also to the everlasting punishment of God. But it
   is impossible to relate what things they performed individually
   throughout the world. For what number of volumes will contain so
   infinite, so varied kinds of cruelty? For, having gained power, every
   one raged according to his own disposition. Some, through excessive
   timidity, proceeded to greater lengths than they were commanded; others
   thus acted through their own particular hatred against the righteous;
   some by a natural ferocity of mind; some through a desire to please,
   and that by this service they might prepare the way to higher offices:
   some were swift to slaughter, as an individual in Phrygia, who burnt a
   whole assembly of people, together with their place of meeting. But the
   more cruel he was, so much the more merciful [1008] is he found to be.
   But that is the worst kind of persecutors whom a false appearance of
   clemency flatters; he is the more severe, he the more cruel torturer,
   who determines to put no one to death. Therefore it cannot be told what
   great and what grievous modes of tortures judges of this kind devised,
   that they might arrive at the accomplishment of their purpose. But they
   do these things not only on this account, that they may be able to
   boast that they have slain none of the innocent,--for I myself have
   heard some boasting that their administration has been in this respect
   without bloodshed,--but also for the sake of envy, lest either they
   themselves should be overcome, or the others should obtain the glory
   due to their virtue. And thus, in devising modes of punishment, they
   think of nothing else besides victory. For they know that this is a
   contest and a battle. I saw in Bithynia the præfect wonderfully elated
   with joy, as though he had subdued some nation of barbarians, because
   one who had resisted for two years with great spirit appeared at length
   to yield. They contend, therefore, that they may conquer and inflict
   exquisite [1009] pains on their bodies, and avoid nothing else but that
   the victims may not die under the torture: as though, in truth, death
   alone could make them happy, and as though tortures also in proportion
   to their severity would not produce greater glory of virtue. But they
   with obstinate folly give orders that diligent care shall be given to
   the tortured, that their limbs may be renovated for other tortures, and
   fresh blood be supplied for punishment. What can be so pious, so
   beneficent, so humane? They would not have bestowed such anxious care
   on any whom they loved. This is the discipline of the gods: to these
   deeds they train their worshippers; these are the sacred rites which
   they require. Moreover, most wicked murderers have invented impious
   laws against the pious. For both sacrilegious ordinances and unjust
   disputations of jurists are read. Domitius, in his seventh book,
   concerning the office of the proconsul, has collected wicked rescripts
   of princes, that he might show by what punishments they ought to be
   visited who confessed themselves to be worshippers of God.

    Chap. XII.--Of True Virtue; And of the Estimation of a Good or Bad Citizen.

   What would you do to those who give the name of justice to the tortures
   inflicted by tyrants of old, who fiercely raged against the innocent;
   and though they are teachers of injustice and cruelty, wish to appear
   just and prudent, being blind and dull, and ignorant of affairs and of
   truth? Is justice so hateful to you, O abandoned minds, that ye regard
   it as equal with the greatest crimes? Is innocence so utterly lost in
   your eyes, that you do not think it worthy of death only, [1010] but it
   is esteemed as beyond all crimes to commit no crime, and to have a
   breast pure from all contagion of guilt? And since we are speaking
   generally with those who worship gods, let us have your permission to
   do good with you; for this is our law, this our business, this our
   religion. If we appear to you wise, imitate us; if foolish, despise us,
   or even laugh at us, if you please; for our folly is profitable to us.
   Why do you lacerate, why do you afflict us? We do not envy your wisdom.
   We prefer this folly of ours--we embrace this. We believe that this is
   expedient for us,--to love you, and to confer all things upon you, who
   hate us.

   There is in the writings of Cicero [1011] a passage not inconsistent
   with the truth, in that disputation which is held by Furius against
   justice: "I ask," he says, "if there should be two men, and one of them
   should be an excellent man, of the highest integrity, the greatest
   justice, and remarkable faith, and the other distinguished by crime and
   audacity; and if the state should be in such error as to regard that
   good man as wicked, vicious, and execrable, but should think the one
   who is most wicked to be of the highest integrity and faith; and if, in
   accordance with this opinion of all the citizens, that good man should
   be harassed, dragged away, should be deprived of his hands, have his
   eyes dug out, should be condemned, be bound, be branded, be banished,
   be in want, and lastly, should most justly appear to all to be most
   wretched; but, on the other hand, if that wicked man should be praised,
   and honoured, and loved by all,--if all honours, all commands, all
   wealth, and all abundance should be bestowed upon him,--in short, if he
   should be judged in the estimation of all an excellent man, and most
   worthy of all fortune,--who, I pray, will be so mad as to doubt which
   of the two he would prefer to be?" Assuredly he put forth this example
   as though he divined what evils were about to happen to us, and in what
   manner, on account of righteousness; for our people suffer all these
   things through the perverseness of those in error. Behold, the state,
   or rather the whole world itself, is in such error, that it persecutes,
   tortures, condemns, and puts to death good and righteous men, as though
   they were wicked and impious. For as to what he says, that no one is so
   infatuated as to doubt which of the two he would prefer to be, he
   indeed, as the one who was contending against justice, thought this,
   that the wise man would prefer to be bad if he had a good reputation,
   than to be good with a bad reputation.

   But may this senselessness be absent from us, that we should prefer
   that which is false to the true? Or does the character of our good man
   depend upon the errors of the people, more than upon our own conscience
   and the judgment of God? Or shall any prosperity ever allure us, so
   that we should not rather choose true goodness, though accompanied with
   all evil, than false goodness together with all prosperity? Let kings
   retain their kingdoms, the rich their riches, as Plautus says, [1012]
   the wise their wisdom; let them leave to us our folly, which is
   evidently proved to be wisdom, from the very fact that they envy us its
   possession: for who would envy a fool, but he who is himself most
   foolish? But they are not so foolish as to envy fools; but from the
   fact of their following us up with such care and anxiety, they allow
   that we are not fools. For why should they rage with such cruelty,
   unless it is that they fear lest, as justice grows strong from day to
   day, they should be deserted together with their decaying [1013] gods?
   If, therefore, the worshippers of gods are wise, and we are foolish,
   why do they fear lest the wise shall be allured by the foolish?

    Chapter XIII.--Of the Increase and the Punishment of the Christians. [1014]

   But since our number is continually increased from the worshippers of
   gods, but is never lessened, not even in persecution itself,--since men
   may commit sin, and be defiled by sacrifice, but they cannot be turned
   away from God, for the truth prevails by its own power,--who is there,
   I pray, so foolish and so blind as not to see on which side wisdom is?
   But they are blinded by malice and fury, that they cannot see; and they
   think that those are foolish who, when they have it in their power to
   avoid punishments, nevertheless prefer to be tortured and to be put to
   death; whereas they might see from this very circumstance, that it is
   not folly to which so many thousands throughout the world agree with
   one and the same mind. For if women fall into error through the
   weakness of their sex (for these persons sometimes call it a womanish
   and anile superstition), men doubtless are wise. If boys, if youths are
   improvident through their age, the mature and aged doubtless have a
   fixed judgment. If one city is unwise, it is evident that the other
   innumerable cities cannot be foolish. If one province or one nation is
   without prudence, the rest must have understanding of that which is
   right. But since the divine law has been received from the rising even
   to the setting of the sun, and each sex, every age, and nation, and
   country, with one and the same mind obeys God--since there is
   everywhere the same patient endurance, the same contempt of death--they
   ought to have understood that there is some reason in that matter, that
   it is not without a cause that it is defended even to death, that there
   is some foundation and solidity, which not only frees that religion
   from injuries and molestation, but always increases and makes it
   stronger. For in this respect also the malice of those is brought to
   light, who think that they have utterly overthrown the religion of God
   if they have corrupted men, when it is permitted them to make
   satisfaction also to God; and there is no worshipper of God so evil who
   does not, when the opportunity is given him, return to appease God, and
   that, too, with greater devotedness. For the consciousness of sin and
   the fear of punishment make a man more religious, and the faith is
   always much stronger which is replaced through repentance. If,
   therefore, they themselves, when they think that the gods are angry
   with them, nevertheless believe that they are appeased by gifts, and
   sacrifices, and incense, what reason is there why they should imagine
   our God to be so unmerciful and implacable, that it should appear
   impossible for him to be a Christian, who by compulsion and against his
   will has poured a libation to their gods? Unless by chance they think
   that those who are once contaminated are about to change their mind, so
   that they may now begin of their own accord to do that which they have
   done under the influence of torture. Who would willingly undertake that
   duty which began with injury? Who, when he sees the scars on his own
   sides, would not the more hate the gods, on account of whom he bears
   the traces of lasting punishment, and the marks imprinted upon his
   flesh? Thus it comes to pass, that when peace is given from heaven,
   those who were estranged [1015] from us return, and a fresh crowd
   [1016] of others are added on account of the wonderful nature [1017] of
   the virtue displayed. For when the people see that men are lacerated by
   various kinds of tortures, and that they retain their patience
   unsubdued while the executioners are wearied, they think, as is really
   the case, that neither the agreement of so many nor the constancy of
   the dying is without meaning, and that patience itself could not
   surmount such great tortures without the aid of God. Robbers and men of
   robust frame are unable to endure lacerations of this kind: they utter
   exclamations, and send forth groans; for they are overcome by pain,
   because they are destitute of patience infused [1018] into them. But in
   our case (not to speak of men), boys and delicate women in silence
   overpower their torturers, and even the fire is unable to extort from
   them a groan. Let the Romans go and boast in their Mutius or
   Regulus,--the one of whom gave himself up to be slain by the enemy,
   because he was ashamed to live as a captive; the other being taken by
   the enemy, when he saw that he could not escape death, laid his hand
   upon the burning hearth, that he might make atonement for his crime to
   the enemy whom he wished to kill, and by that punishment received the
   pardon which he had not deserved. Behold, the weak sex and fragile age
   endure to be lacerated in the whole body, and to be burned: not of
   necessity, for it is permitted them to escape if they wished to do so;
   but of their own will, because they put their trust in God. [1019]

   But this is true virtue, which the vaunting philosophers also boast of,
   not in deed, but with empty words, saying that nothing is so befitting
   the gravity and constancy of a wise man as to be able to be driven away
   from his sentiment and purpose by no torturers, but that it is worth
   his while [1020] to suffer torture and death rather than betray a trust
   or depart from his duty, or, overcome by fear of death or severity of
   pain, commit any injustice. Unless by chance Flaccus appears to them to
   rave in his lyrics, when he says,


   "Not the rage of the million commanding things evil;

   Not the doom frowning near in the brows of the tyrant,

   Shakes the upright and resolute man

   In his solid completeness of soul." [1021]

   And nothing can be more true than this, if it is referred to those who
   refuse no tortures, no kind of death, that they may not turn aside from
   faith and justice; who do not tremble at the commands of tyrants nor
   the swords of rulers, [1022] so as not to maintain true and solid
   liberty with constancy of mind, which wisdom is to be observed in this
   alone. For who is so arrogant, who so lifted up, as to forbid me to
   raise my eyes to heaven? Who can impose upon me the necessity either of
   worshipping that which I am unwilling to worship, or of abstaining from
   the worship of that which I wish to worship? What further will now be
   left to us, if even this, which must be done of one's own will, [1023]
   shall be extorted from me by the caprice of another? No one will effect
   this, if we have any courage to despise death and pain. But if we
   possess this constancy, why are we judged foolish when we do those
   things which philosophers praise? Seneca, in charging men with
   inconsistency, rightly says the highest virtue appears to them to
   consist in greatness of spirit; and yet the same persons regard him who
   despises death as a madman, which is plainly a mark of the greatest
   perverseness. But those followers of vain religions urge this with the
   same folly with which they fail to understand the true God; and these
   the Erythræan Sibyl calls "deaf and senseless," [1024] since they
   neither hear nor perceive divine things, but fear and adore an earthen
   image moulded by their own fingers.

    Chap. XV.--Of Folly, Wisdom, Piety, Equity, and Justice.

   But the reason on account of which they imagine those who are wise to
   be foolish has strong grounds of support (for they are not deceived
   without reason). And this must be diligently explained by us, that they
   may at length (if it is possible) recognise their errors. Justice by
   its own nature has a certain appearance of folly, and I am able to
   confirm this both by divine and human testimonies. But perhaps we
   should not succeed with them, unless we should teach them from their
   own authorities that no one can be just, a matter which is united with
   true wisdom, unless he also appears to be foolish. Carneades was a
   philosopher of the Academic sect; and one who knows not what power he
   had in discussion, what eloquence, what sagacity, will nevertheless
   understand the character of the man himself from the praises of Cicero
   or of Lucilius, in whose writings Neptune, discoursing on a subject of
   the greatest difficulty, shows that it cannot be explained, even if
   Orcus should restore Carneades himself to life. This Carneades, when he
   had been sent by the Athenians as ambassador to Rome, disputed
   copiously on the subject of justice, in the hearing of Galba and Cato,
   who had been censor, who were at that time the greatest of orators. But
   on the next day the same man overthrew his own argument by a
   disputation to the contrary effect, and took away the justice which he
   had praised on the preceding day, not indeed with the gravity of a
   philosopher, whose prudence ought to be firm and his opinion settled,
   but as it were by an oratorical kind of exercise of disputing on both
   sides. And he was accustomed to do this, that he might be able to
   refute others who asserted anything. L. Furius, in Cicero, makes
   mention of that discussion in which justice is overthrown. [1025] I
   believe, inasmuch as he was discussing the subject of the state, he did
   it that he might introduce the defence and praise of that without which
   he thought that a state could not be governed. But Carneades, that he
   might refute Aristotle and Plato, the advocates of justice, in that
   first disputation collected all the arguments which were alleged in
   behalf of justice, that he might be able to overthrow them, as he did.
   For it was very easy to shake justice, having no roots, inasmuch as
   there was then none on the earth, that its nature or qualities might be
   perceived by philosophers. And I could wish that men, so many and of
   such a character, had possessed knowledge also, in proportion to their
   eloquence and spirit, for completing the defence of this greatest
   virtue, which has its origin in religion, its principle in equity! But
   those who were ignorant of that first part could not possess the
   second. But I wish first to show, summarily and concisely, what it is,
   that it may be understood that the philosophers were ignorant of
   justice, and were unable to defend that with which they were
   unacquainted. Although justice embraces all the virtues together, yet
   there are two, the chief of all, which cannot be torn asunder and
   separated from it--piety and equity. For fidelity, temperance,
   uprightness, innocence, integrity, and the other things of this kind,
   either naturally or through the training of parents, may exist in those
   men who are ignorant of justice, as they have always existed; for the
   ancient Romans, who were accustomed to glory in justice, used evidently
   to glory in those virtues which (as I have said) may proceed from
   justice, and be separated from the very fountain itself. But piety and
   equity are, as it were, its veins: for in these two fountains the whole
   of justice is contained; but its source and origin is in the first, all
   its force and method in the second. But piety is nothing else but the
   conception [1026] of God, as Trismegistus most truly defined it, as we
   have said in another place. If, therefore, it is piety to know God, and
   the sum of this knowledge is that you worship Him, it is plain that he
   is ignorant of justice who does not possess the knowledge of God. For
   how can he know justice itself, who is ignorant of the source from
   which it arises? Plato, indeed, spoke many things respecting the one
   God, by whom he said that the world was framed; but he spoke nothing
   respecting religion: for he had dreamed of God, but had not known Him.
   But if either he himself or any other person had wished to complete the
   defence of justice, he ought first of all to have overthrown the
   religions of the gods, because they are opposed to piety. And because
   Socrates indeed tried to do this, he was thrown into prison; that even
   then it might be seen what was about to happen to those men who had
   begun to defend true justice, and to serve the only God.

   The other part of justice, therefore, is equity; and it is plain that I
   am not speaking of the equity of judging well, though this also is
   praiseworthy in a just man, but of making himself equal to others,
   which Cicero calls equability. [1027] For God, who produces and gives
   breath to men, willed that all should be equal, that is, equally
   matched. [1028] He has imposed on all the same condition of living; He
   has produced all to wisdom; He has promised immortality to all; no one
   is cut off from His heavenly benefits. For as He distributes to all
   alike His one light, sends forth His fountains to all, supplies food,
   and gives the most pleasant rest of sleep; so He bestows on all equity
   and virtue. In His sight no one is a slave, no one a master; for if all
   have the same Father, by an equal right we are all children. No one is
   poor in the sight of God, but he who is without justice; no one is
   rich, but he who is full of virtues; no one, in short, is excellent,
   but he who has been good and innocent; no one is most renowned, but he
   who has abundantly performed works of mercy; no one is most perfect,
   but he who has filled all the steps of virtue. Therefore neither the
   Romans nor the Greeks could possess justice, because they had men
   differing from one another by many degrees, from the poor to the rich,
   from the humble to the powerful; in short, from private persons to the
   highest authorities of kings. For where all are not equally matched,
   there is not equity; and inequality of itself excludes justice, the
   whole force of which consists in this, that it makes those equal who
   have by an equal lot arrived at the condition of this life.

   Therefore, since those two fountains of justice are changed, all virtue
   and all truth are taken away, and justice itself returns to heaven. And
   on this account the true good was not discovered by philosophers,
   because they were ignorant both of its origin and effects: which has
   been revealed to no others but to our people. [1029] Some one will say,
   Are there not among you some poor, and others rich; some servants, and
   others masters? Is there not some difference between individuals? There
   is none; nor is there any other cause why we mutually bestow upon each
   other the name of brethren, except that we believe ourselves to be
   equal. For since we measure all human things not by the body, but by
   the spirit, although the condition of bodies is different, yet we have
   no servants, but we both regard and speak of them as brothers in
   spirit, in religion as fellow-servants. Riches also do not render men
   illustrious, except that [1030] they are able to make them more
   conspicuous by good works. For men are rich, not because they possess
   riches, but because they employ them on works of justice; and they who
   seem to be poor, on this account are rich, because they are not [1031]
   in want, and desire nothing.

   Though, therefore, in lowliness of mind we are on an equality, the free
   with slaves, and the rich with the poor, nevertheless in the sight of
   God we are distinguished by virtue. And every one is more elevated in
   proportion to his greater justice. For if it is justice for a man to
   put himself on a level even with those of lower rank, although he
   excels in this very thing, that he made himself equal to his inferiors;
   yet if he has conducted himself not only as an equal, but even as an
   inferior, he will plainly obtain a much higher rank of dignity in the
   judgment of God. [1032] For assuredly, since all things in this
   temporal life are frail and liable to decay, men both prefer themselves
   to others, and contend about dignity; than which nothing is more foul,
   nothing mere arrogant, nothing more removed from the conduct of a wise
   man: for these earthly things are altogether opposed to heavenly
   things. For as the wisdom of men is the greatest foolishness with God,
   and foolishness is (as I have shown) the greatest wisdom; so he is low
   and abject in the sight of God who shall have been conspicuous and
   elevated on earth. For, not to mention that these present earthly goods
   to which great honour is paid are contrary to virtue, and enervate the
   vigour of the mind, what nobility, I pray, can be so firm, what
   resources, what power, since God is able to make kings themselves even
   lower than the lowest? And therefore God has consulted our interest in
   placing this in particular among the divine precepts: "He that exalteth
   himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be
   exalted." [1033] And the wholesomeness of this precept teaches that he
   who shall simply place himself on a level with other men, and carry
   himself with humility, is esteemed excellent and illustrious in the
   sight of God. For the sentiment is not false which is brought forward
   in Euripides to this effect:--


   "The things which are here considered evil are esteemed good in
   heaven."

    Chap. XVII.--Of the Equity, Wisdom, and Foolishness of Christians.

   I have explained the reason why philosophers were unable either to find
   or to defend justice. Now I return to that which I had purposed.
   Carneades, therefore, since the arguments of the philosophers were
   weak, undertook the bold task of refuting them, because he understood
   that they were capable of refutation. The substance of his disputation
   was this: "That men [1034] enacted laws for themselves, with a view to
   their own advantage, differing indeed according to their characters,
   and in the case of the same persons often changed according to the
   times: but that there was no natural law: that all, both men and other
   animals, were borne by the guidance of nature to their own advantage;
   therefore that there was no justice, or if any did exist, it was the
   greatest folly, because it injured itself by promoting the interests of
   others." And he brought forward these arguments: "That all nations
   which flourished with dominion, even the Romans themselves, who were
   masters of the whole world, if they wish to be just, that is, to
   restore the possessions of others, must return to cottages, and lie
   down in want and miseries." Then, leaving general topics, he came to
   particulars. "If a good man," he says, "has a runaway slave, or an
   unhealthy and infected house, and he alone knows these faults, and on
   this account offers it for sale, will he give out that the slave is a
   runaway, and the house which he offers for sale is infected, or will he
   conceal it from the purchaser? If he shall give it out, he is good
   indeed, because he will not deceive; but still he will be judged
   foolish, because he will either sell at a low price or not sell at all.
   If he shall conceal it, he will be wise indeed, because he will consult
   his own interest; but he will be also wicked, because he will deceive.
   Again, if he should find any one who supposes that he is selling copper
   ore when it is gold, or lead when it is silver, will he be silent, that
   he may buy it at a small price; or will he give information of it, so
   that he may buy it at a great price? It evidently appears foolish to
   prefer to buy it at a great price." From which he wished it to be
   understood, both that he who is just and good is foolish, and that he
   who is wise is wicked; and yet that it may possibly happen without
   ruin, for men to be contented with poverty. Therefore he passed to
   greater things, in which no one could be just without danger of his
   life. For he said: "Certainly it is justice not to put a man to death,
   not to take the property of another. What, then, will the just man do,
   if he shall happen to have suffered shipwreck, and some one weaker than
   himself shall have seized a plank? Will he not thrust him from the
   plank, that he himself may get upon it, and supported by it may escape,
   especially since there is no witness in the middle of the sea? If he is
   wise, he will do so; for he must himself perish unless he shall thus
   act. But if he choose rather to die than to inflict violence upon
   another, in this case he is just, but foolish, in not sparing his own
   life while he spares the life of another. Thus also, if the army of his
   own people shall have been routed, and the enemy have begun to press
   upon them, and that just man shall have met with a wounded man on
   horseback, will he spare him so as to be slain himself, or will he
   throw him from his horse, that he himself may escape from the enemy? If
   he shall do this, he will be wise, but also wicked; if he shall not do
   it, he will be just, but also of necessity foolish." When, therefore,
   he had thus divided justice into two parts, saying that the one was
   civil, the other natural, he subverted both: because the civil part is
   wisdom, but not justice; but the natural part is justice, but not
   wisdom. These arguments are altogether subtle and acute, [1035] and
   such as Marcus Tullius was unable to refute. For when he represents
   Lælius as replying to Furius, and speaking in behalf of justice, he
   passed them by as a pitfall without refuting them; so that the same
   Lælius appears not to have defended natural justice, which bad fallen
   under the charge of folly, but that civil justice which Furius had
   admitted to be wisdom, but unjust. [1036]

    Chap. XVIII.--Of Justice, Wisdom, and Folly.

   With reference to our present discussion, I have shown how justice
   bears the resemblance of folly, that it may appear that those are not
   deceived without reason who think that men of our religion are foolish
   in appearing to do such things as he proposed. Now I perceive that a
   greater undertaking is required from me, to show why God wished to
   enclose justice under the appearance of folly, and to remove it from
   the eyes of men, when I shall have first replied to Furius, since
   Lælius has not sufficiently replied to him; who, although he was a wise
   man, as he was called, yet could not be the advocate of true justice,
   because he did not possess the source and fountain of justice. But this
   defence is easier for us, to whom by the bounty of Heaven this justice
   is familiar and well known, and who know it not in name, but in
   reality. For Plato and Aristotle desired with an honest will to defend
   justice, and would have effected something, if their good endeavours,
   their eloquence, and vigour of intellect had been aided also by a
   knowledge of divine things. Thus their work, being vain and useless,
   was neglected: nor were they able to persuade any of men to live
   according to their precept, because that system had no foundation from
   heaven. But our work must be more certain, since we are taught of God.
   For they represented justice in words, and pictured it when it was not
   in sight; nor were they able to confirm their assertions by present
   examples. For the hearers might have answered that it was impossible to
   live as they prescribed in their disputation; so that none have as yet
   existed who followed that course of life. But we show the truth of our
   statements not only by words, but also by examples derived from the
   truth. Therefore Carneades understood what is the nature of justice,
   except that he did not sufficiently perceive that it was not folly;
   although I seem to myself to understand with what intention he did
   this. For he did not really think that he who is just is foolish; but
   when he knew that he was not so, but did not comprehend the cause why
   he appeared so, he wished to show that the truth lay hidden, that he
   might maintain the dogma of his own sect, [1037] the chief opinion of
   which is, "that nothing can be fully comprehended."

   Let us see, therefore, whether justice has any agreement with folly.
   The just man, he says, if he does not take away from the wounded man
   his horse, and from the shipwrecked man his plank, in order that he may
   preserve his own life, is foolish. First of all, I deny that it can in
   any way happen that a man who is truly just should be in circumstances
   of this kind; for the just man is neither at enmity with any human
   being, nor desires anything at all which is the property of another.
   For why should he take a voyage, or what should he seek from another
   land, when his own is sufficient for him? Or why should he carry on
   war, and mix himself with the passions of others, when his mind is
   engaged in perpetual peace with men? Doubtless he will be delighted
   with foreign merchandise or with human blood, who does not know how to
   seek gain, who is satisfied with his mode of living, and considers it
   unlawful not only himself to commit slaughter, but to be present with
   those who do it, and to behold it! But I omit these things, since it is
   possible that a man may be compelled even against his will to undergo
   these things. Do you then, O Furius--or rather O Carneades, for all
   this speech is his--think that justice is so useless, so superfluous,
   and so despised by God, that it has no power and no influence in itself
   which may avail for its own preservation? But it is evident that they
   who are ignorant of the mystery [1038] of man, and who therefore refer
   all things to this present life, cannot know how great is the force of
   justice. For when they discuss the subject of virtue, although they
   understand that it is very full of labours and miseries, nevertheless
   they say that it is to be sought for its own sake; for they by no means
   see its rewards, which are eternal and immortal. Thus, by referring all
   things to the present life, they altogether reduce virtue to folly,
   since it undergoes such great labours of this life in vain and to no
   purpose. But more on this subject at another opportunity.

   In the meanwhile let us speak of justice, as we began, the power of
   which is so great, that when it has raised its eyes to heaven, it
   deserves all things from God. Flaccus therefore rightly said, that the
   power of innocence is so great, that wherever it journeys, it needs
   neither arms nor strength for its protection:--


   "He whose life hath no flaw, pure from guile, need not borrow

   Or the bow or the darts of the Moor, O my Fuscus!

   He relies for defence on no quiver that teems with

   Poison-steept arrows.

   Though his path be along sultry African Syrtes,

   Or Caucasian ravines, where no guest finds a shelter,

   Or the banks which Hydaspes, the stream weird [1039] with fable,

   Licks languid-flowing." [1040]

   It is impossible, therefore, that amidst the dangers of tempests and of
   wars the just man should be unprotected by the guardianship of Heaven;
   and that even if he should be at sea in company with parricides and
   guilty men, the wicked also should not be spared, that this one just
   and innocent soul may be freed from danger, or at any rate may be alone
   preserved while the rest perish. But let us grant that the case which
   the philosopher proposes is possible: what, then, will the just man do,
   if he shall have met with a wounded man on a horse, or a shipwrecked
   man on a plank? I am not unwilling to confess he will rather die than
   put another to death. Nor will justice, which is the chief good of man,
   on this account receive the name of folly. For what ought to be better
   and dearer to man than innocence? And this must be the more perfect,
   the more you bring it to extremity, and choose to die rather than to
   detract from the character of innocence. It is folly, he says, to spare
   the life of another in a case which involves the destruction of one's
   own life. Then do you think it foolish to perish even for friendship?

   Why, then, are those Pythagorean friends praised by you, of whom the
   one gave himself to the tyrant as a surety for the life of the other,
   and the other at the appointed time, when his surety was now being led
   to execution, presented himself, and rescued him by his own
   interposition? Whose virtue would not be held in such glory, when one
   of them was willing to die for his friend, the other even for his word
   [1041] which had been pledged, if they were regarded as fools. In fine,
   on account of this very virtue the tyrant rewarded them by preserving
   both, and thus the disposition of a most cruel man was changed.
   Moreover, it is even said that he entreated [1042] them to admit him as
   a third party to their friendship, from which it is plain that he
   regarded them not as fools, but as good and wise men. Therefore I do
   not see why, since it is reckoned the highest glory to die for
   friendship and for one's word, it is not glorious to a man to die even
   for his innocence. They are therefore most foolish who impute it as a
   crime to us that we are willing to die for God, when they themselves
   extol to the heavens with the highest praises him who was willing to
   die for a man. In short, to conclude this disputation, reason itself
   teaches that it is impossible for a man to be at once just and foolish,
   wise and unjust. For he who is foolish is unacquainted with that which
   is just and good, and therefore always errs. For he is, as it were, led
   captive by his vices; nor can he in any way resist them, because he is
   destitute of the virtue of which he is ignorant. But the just man
   abstains from all fault, because he cannot do otherwise, although he
   has the knowledge of right and wrong.

   But who is able to distinguish right from wrong except the wise man?
   Thus it comes to pass, that he can never be just who is foolish, nor
   wise who is unjust. And if this is most true, it is plain that he who
   has not taken away a plank from a shipwrecked man, or a horse from one
   who is wounded, is not foolish; because it is a sin to do these things,
   and the wise man abstains from sin. Nevertheless I myself also confess
   that it has this appearance, through the error of men, who are ignorant
   of the peculiar character [1043] of everything. And thus the whole of
   this inquiry is refuted not so much by arguments as by definition.
   Therefore folly is the erring in deeds and words, through ignorance of
   what is right and good. Therefore he is not a fool who does not even
   spare himself to prevent injury to another, which is an evil. And this,
   indeed, reason and the truth itself dictate. [1044] For we see that in
   all animals, because they are destitute of wisdom, nature is the
   provider of supplies for itself. Therefore they injure others that they
   may profit themselves, for they do not understand that the [1045]
   committing an injury is evil. But man, who has the knowledge of good
   and evil, abstains from committing an injury even to his own damage,
   which an animal without reason is unable to do; and on this account
   innocence is reckoned among the chief virtues of man. Now by these
   things it appears that he is the wisest man who prefers to perish
   rather than to commit an injury, that he may preserve that sense of
   duty [1046] by which he is distinguished from the dumb creation. For he
   who does not point out the error of one who is offering the gold for
   sale, in order that he may buy it for a small sum, or he who does not
   avow that he is offering for sale a runaway slave or an infected house,
   having an eye to his own gain or advantage, is not a wise man, as
   Carneades wished it to appear, but crafty and cunning. Now craftiness
   and cunning exist in the dumb animals also: either when they lie in
   wait for others, and take them by deceit, that they may devour them; or
   when they avoid the snares of others in various ways. But wisdom falls
   to man alone. For wisdom is understanding either with the purpose of
   doing that which is good and right, or for the abstaining from improper
   words and deeds. Now a wise man never gives himself to the pursuit of
   gain, because he despises these earthly advantages: nor does he allow
   any one to be deceived, because it is the duty of a good man to correct
   the errors of men, and to bring them back to the right way; since the
   nature of man is social and beneficent, in which respect alone he bears
   a relation to God.

    Father and Master.

   But undoubtedly this is the cause [1047] why he appears to be foolish
   who prefers to be in want, or to die rather than to inflict injury or
   take away the property of another,--namely, because they think that man
   is destroyed by death. And from this persuasion all the errors both of
   the common people and also of the philosophers arise. For if we have no
   existence after death, assuredly it is the part of the most foolish man
   not to promote the interests of the present life, that it may be
   long-continued, and may abound with all advantages. But he who shall
   act thus must of necessity depart from the rule of justice. But if
   there remains to man a longer and a better life--and this we learn both
   from the arguments of great philosophers, and from the answers of
   seers, and the divine words of prophets--it is the part of the wise man
   to despise this present life with its advantages, since its entire loss
   is compensated by immortality. The same defender of justice, Lælius,
   says in Cicero: [1048] "Virtue altogether wishes for honour; nor is
   there any other reward of virtue." There is indeed another, and that
   most worthy of virtue, which you, O Lælius, could never have supposed;
   for you had no knowledge of the sacred writings. And this reward it
   easily receives, and does not harshly demand. You are greatly mistaken,
   if you think that a reward can be paid to virtue by man, since you
   yourself most truly said in another place: "What riches will you offer
   to this man? what commands? what kingdoms? He who regards these things
   as human, judges his own advantages to be divine." Who, therefore, can
   think you a wise man, O Lælius, when you contradict yourself, and after
   a short interval take away from virtue that which you have given to
   her? But it is manifest that ignorance of the truth makes your opinion
   uncertain and wavering.

   In the next place, what do you add? "But if all the ungrateful, or the
   many who are envious, or powerful enemies, deprive virtue of its
   rewards." Oh how frail, how worthless, have you represented virtue to
   be, if it can be deprived of its reward! For if it judges its goods to
   be divine, as you said, how can there be any so ungrateful, so envious,
   so powerful, as to be able to deprive virtue of those goods which were
   conferred upon it by the gods? "Assuredly it delights itself," he says,
   "by many comforts, and especially supports itself by its own beauty."
   By what comforts? by what beauty? since that beauty is often charged
   upon it as a fault, and turned into a punishment. For what if, as
   Furius said, [1049] a man should be dragged away, harassed, banished,
   should be in want, be deprived of his hands, have his eyes put out, be
   condemned, put into chains, be burned, be miserably tortured also? will
   virtue lose its reward, or rather, will it perish itself? By no means.
   But it will both receive its reward from God the Judge, and it will
   live, and always flourish. And if you take away these things, nothing
   in the life of man can appear to be so useless, so foolish, as virtue,
   the natural goodness and honour of which may teach us that the soul is
   not mortal, and that a divine reward is appointed for it by God. But on
   this account God willed that virtue itself should be concealed under
   the character of folly, that the mystery of truth and of His religion
   might be secret; that He might show the vanity and error of these
   superstitions, and of that earthly wisdom which raises itself too
   highly, and exhibits great self-complacency, that its difficulty being
   at length set forth, that most narrow path might lead to the lofty
   reward of immortality.

   I have shown, as I think, why our people are esteemed foolish by the
   foolish. For to choose to be tortured and slain, rather than to take
   incense in three fingers, and throw it upon the hearth, [1050] appears
   as foolish as, in a case where life is endangered, to be more careful
   of the life of another than of one's own. For they do not know how
   great an act of impiety it is to adore any other object than God, who
   made heaven and earth, who fashioned the human race, breathed into them
   the breath of life, and gave them light. But if he is accounted the
   most worthless of slaves who runs away and deserts his master, and if
   he is judged most deserving of stripes and chains, and a prison, and
   the cross, and of all evil; and if a son, in the same manner, is
   thought abandoned and impious who deserts his father, that he may not
   pay him obedience, and on this account is considered deserving of being
   disinherited, and of having his name removed for ever from his
   family,--how much more so does he who forsakes God, in whom the two
   names entitled to equal reverence, of Lord and Father, alike meet? For
   what benefit does he who buys a slave bestow upon him, beyond the
   nourishment with which he supplies him for his own advantage? And he
   who begets a son has it not in his power to effect that he shall be
   conceived, or born, or live; from which it is evident that he is not
   the father, but only the instrument [1051] of generation. Of what
   punishments, therefore, is he deserving, who forsakes Him who is both
   the true Master and Father, but those which God Himself has appointed?
   who has prepared everlasting fire for the wicked spirits; and this He
   Himself threatens by His prophets to the impious and the rebellious.

   Therefore, let those who destroy their own souls and the souls of
   others learn what an inexpiable crime they commit; in the first place,
   because they cause their own death by serving most abandoned demons,
   whom God has condemned to everlasting punishments; in the next place,
   because they do not permit God to be worshipped by others, but
   endeavour to turn men aside to deadly rites, and strive with the
   greatest diligence that no life may be without injury on earth, which
   looks to heaven with its condition secured. What else shall I call them
   but miserable men, who obey the instigations of their own plunderers,
   [1053] whom they think to be gods? of whom they neither know the
   condition, nor origin, nor names, nor nature; but, clinging to the
   persuasion of the people, they willingly err, and favour their own
   folly. And if you should ask them the grounds of their persuasion, they
   can assign none, but have recourse to the judgment of their ancestors,
   saying that they were wise, that they approved them, that they knew
   what was best; and thus they deprive themselves of all power of
   perception: they bid adieu to reason, while they place confidence in
   the errors of others. Thus, involved in ignorance of all things, they
   neither know themselves nor their gods. And would to heaven that they
   had been willing to err by themselves, and to be unwise by themselves!
   But they hurry away others also to be companions of their evil, as
   though they were about to derive comfort from the destruction of many.
   But this very ignorance causes them to be so cruel in persecuting the
   wise; and they pretend that they are promoting their welfare, that they
   wish to recall them to a good mind.

   Do they then strive to effect this by conversation, or by giving some
   reason? By no means; but they endeavour to effect it by force and
   tortures. O wonderful and blind infatuation! It is thought that there
   is a bad mind in those who endeavour to preserve their faith, but a
   good one in executioners. Is there, then, a bad mind in those who,
   against every law of humanity, against every principle of justice, are
   tortured, or rather, in those who inflict on the bodies of the innocent
   such things, as neither the most cruel robbers, nor the most enraged
   enemies, nor the most savage barbarians have ever practised? Do they
   deceive themselves to such an extent, that they mutually transfer and
   change the names of good and evil? Why, therefore, do they not call day
   night--the sun darkness? Moreover, it is the same impudence to give to
   the good the name of evil, to the wise the name of foolish, to the just
   the name of impious. Besides this, if they have any confidence in
   philosophy or in eloquence, let them arm themselves, and refute these
   arguments of ours if they are able; let them meet us hand to hand, and
   examine every point. It is befitting that they should undertake the
   defence of their gods, lest, if our affairs should increase (as they do
   increase daily), theirs should be deserted, together with their shrines
   and their vain mockeries; [1054] and since they can effect nothing by
   violence (for the religion of God is increased the more it is
   oppressed), let them rather act by the use of reason and exhortations.

   Let their priests come forth into the midst, whether the inferior ones
   or the greatest; their flamens, augurs, and also sacrificing kings, and
   the priests and ministers of their superstitions. Let them call us
   together to an assembly; let them exhort us to undertake the worship of
   their gods; let them persuade us that there are many beings by whose
   deity and providence all things are governed; let them show how the
   origins and beginnings of their sacred rites and gods were handed down
   to mortals; let them explain what is their source and principle; let
   them set forth what reward there is in their worship, and what
   punishment awaits neglect; why they wish to be worshipped by men; what
   the piety of men contributes to them, if they are blessed: and let them
   confirm all these things not by their own assertion (for the authority
   of a mortal man is of no weight), but by some divine testimonies, as we
   do. There is no occasion for violence and injury, for religion cannot
   be imposed by force; the matter must be carried on by words rather than
   by blows, that the will may be affected. Let them unsheath the weapon
   of their intellect; if their system is true, let it be asserted. We are
   prepared to hear, if they teach; while they are silent, we certainly
   pay no credit to them, as we do not yield to them even in their rage.
   Let them imitate us in setting forth the system of the whole matter:
   for we do not entice, as they say; but we teach, we prove, we show. And
   thus no one is detained by us against his will, for he is unserviceable
   to God who is destitute of faith and devotedness; and yet no one
   departs from us, since the truth itself detains him. Let them teach in
   this manner, if they have any confidence in the truth; let them speak,
   let them give utterance; let them venture, I say, to discuss with us
   something of this nature; and then assuredly their error and folly will
   be ridiculed by the old women, whom they despise, and by our boys. For,
   since they are especially clever, they know from books the race of the
   gods, and their exploits, and commands, and deaths, and tombs; they may
   also know that the rites themselves, in which they have been initiated,
   had their origin either in human actions, or in casualties, or in
   deaths. [1055] It is the part of incredible madness to imagine that
   they are gods, whom they cannot deny to have been mortal; or if they
   should be so shameless as to deny it, their own writings, and those of
   their own people, will refute them; in short, the very beginnings of
   the sacred rites will convict them. [1056] They may know, therefore,
   even from this very thing, how great a difference there is between
   truth and falsehood; for they themselves with all their eloquence are
   unable to persuade, whereas the unskilled and the uneducated are able,
   because the matter itself and the truth speaks.

   Why then do they rage, so that while they wish to lessen their folly,
   they increase it? Torture [1057] and piety are widely different; nor is
   it possible for truth to be united with violence, or justice with
   cruelty. But with good reason they do not venture to teach anything
   concerning divine things, lest they should both be derided by our
   people and be deserted by their own. For the common people for the most
   part, if they ascertain that these mysteries were instituted in memory
   of the dead, will condemn them, and seek for some truer object of
   worship.


   "Hence rites of mystic awe" [1058]

   were instituted by crafty men, that the people may not know what they
   worship. But since we are acquainted with their systems, why do they
   either not believe us who are acquainted with both, or envy us because
   we have preferred truth to falsehood? But, they say, the public rites
   of religion [1059] must be defended. Oh with what an honourable
   inclination the wretched men go astray! For they are aware that there
   is nothing among men more excellent than religion, and that this ought
   to be defended with the whole of our power; but as they are deceived in
   the matter of religion itself, so also are they in the manner of its
   defence. For religion is to be defended, not by putting to death, but
   by dying; not by cruelty, but by patient endurance; not by guilt, but
   by good faith: for the former belong to evils, but the latter to goods;
   and it is necessary for that which is good to have place in religion,
   and not that which is evil. For if you wish to defend religion by
   bloodshed, and by tortures, and by guilt, it will no longer be
   defended, but will be polluted and profaned. For nothing is so much a
   matter of free-will as religion; in which, if the mind of the
   worshipper is disinclined to it, religion is at once taken away, and
   ceases to exist. The right method therefore is, that you defend
   religion by patient endurance or by death; in which the preservation of
   the faith is both pleasing to God Himself, and adds authority to
   religion. For if he who in this earthly warfare preserves his faith to
   his king in some illustrious action, if he shall continue to live,
   because more beloved and acceptable, and if he shall fall, obtains the
   highest glory, because he has undergone death for his leader; how much
   more is faith to be kept towards God, the Ruler of all, who is able to
   pay the reward of virtue, not only to the living, but also to the dead!
   Therefore the worship of God, since it belongs to heavenly warfare,
   requires the greatest devotedness and fidelity. For how will God either
   love the worshipper, if He Himself is not loved by him, or grant to the
   petitioner whatever he shall ask, when he draws nigh to offer his
   prayer without sincerity or reverence? But these men, when they come to
   offer sacrifice, present to their gods nothing from within, nothing of
   their own--no uprightness of mind, no reverence or fear. Therefore,
   when the worthless sacrifices are completed, they leave their religion
   altogether in the temple, and with the temple, as they had found it;
   and neither bring with them anything of it, nor take anything back.
   Hence it is that religious observances of this kind are neither able to
   make men good, nor to be firm and unchangeable. And thus men are easily
   led away from them, because nothing is learned in them relating to the
   life, nothing relating to wisdom, nothing to faith. [1060] For what is
   the religion of those gods? what is its power? what its discipline?
   what its origin? what its principle? what its foundation? what its
   substance? what is its tendency? or what does it promise, so that it
   may be faithfully preserved and boldly defended by man? I see nothing
   else in it than a rite pertaining to the fingers only. [1061] But our
   religion is on this account firm, and solid, and unchangeable, because
   it teaches justice, because it is always with us, because it has its
   existence altogether in the soul of the worshipper, because it has the
   mind itself for a sacrifice. In that religion nothing else is required
   but the blood of animals, and the smoke of incense, and the senseless
   pouring out of libations; but in this of ours, a good mind, a pure
   breast, an innocent life: those rites are frequented by unchaste
   adulteresses without any discrimination, by impudent procuresses, by
   filthy harlots; they are frequented by gladiators, robbers, thieves,
   and sorcerers, who pray for nothing else but that they may commit
   crimes with impunity. For what can the robber ask when he sacrifices,
   or the gladiator, but that they may slay? what the poisoner, but that
   he may escape notice? what the harlot, but that she may sin to the
   uttermost? what the adulteress, but either the death of her husband, or
   that her unchastity may be concealed? what the procuress, but that she
   may deprive many of their property? what the thief, but that he may
   commit more peculations? But in our religion there is no place even for
   a slight and ordinary offence; and if any one shall come to a sacrifice
   without a sound conscience, he hears what threats God denounces against
   him: that God, I say, who sees the secret places of the heart, who is
   alway hostile to sins, who requires justice, who demands fidelity. What
   place is there here for an evil mind or for an evil prayer? But those
   unhappy men neither understand from their own crimes how evil it is to
   worship, since, defiled by all crimes, they come to offer prayer; and
   they imagine that they offer a pious sacrifice if they wash their skin;
   as though any streams could wash away, or any seas purify, the lusts
   which are shut up within their breast. How much better it is rather to
   cleanse the mind, which is defiled by evil desires, and to drive away
   all vices by the one laver of virtue and faith! For he who shall do
   this, although he bears a body which is defiled and sordid, is pure
   enough.

    Chap. XXI.--Of the Worship of Other Gods and the True God, and of the
    Animals Which the Egyptians Worshipped.

   But they, because they know not the object or the mode of worship,
   blindly and unconsciously fall into the contrary practice. Thus they
   adore their enemies, they appease with victims their robbers and
   murderers, and they place their own souls to be burned with the very
   incense on detestable altars. The wretched men are also angry, because
   others do not perish in like manner, with incredible blindness of
   minds. For what can they see who do not see the sun? As though, if they
   were gods, they would need the assistance of men against their
   despisers. Why, therefore, are they angry with us, if they have no
   power to effect anything? Unless it be that they destroy their gods,
   whose power they distrust, they are more irreligious than those who do
   not worship them at all. Cicero, in his Laws, [1062] enjoining men to
   approach with holiness to the sacrifices, says, "Let them put on piety,
   let them lay aside riches; if any one shall act otherwise, God Himself
   will be the avenger." This is well spoken; for it is not right to
   despair about God, whom you worship on this account, because you think
   Him powerful. For how can He avenge the wrongs of His worshippers, if
   He is unable to avenge His own? I wish therefore to ask them to whom
   especially they think that they are doing a service in compelling them
   to sacrifice against their will, Is it to those whom they compel? But
   that is not a kindness which is done to one who refuses it. But we must
   consult their interests, even against their will, since they know not
   what is good. Why, then, do they so cruelly harass, torture, and weaken
   them, if they wish for their safety? or whence is piety so impious,
   that they either destroy in this wretched manner, or render useless,
   those whose welfare they wish to promote? Or do they do service to the
   gods? But that is not a sacrifice which is extorted from a person
   against his will. For unless it is offered spontaneously, and from the
   soul, it is a curse; when men sacrifice, compelled by proscription, by
   injuries, by prison, by tortures. If they are gods who are worshipped
   in this manner, if for this reason only, they ought not to be
   worshipped, because they wish to be worshipped in this manner: they are
   doubtless worthy of the detestation of men, since libations are made to
   them with tears, with groaning, and with blood flowing from all the
   limbs.

   But we, on the contrary, do not require that any one should be
   compelled, whether he is willing or unwilling, to worship our God, who
   is the God of all men; nor are we angry if any one does not worship
   Him. For we trust in the majesty of Him who has power to avenge
   contempt shown towards Himself, as also He has power to avenge the
   calamities and injuries inflicted on His servants. And therefore, when
   we suffer such impious things, we do not resist even in word; but we
   remit vengeance to God, not as they act who would have it appear that
   they are defenders of their gods, and rage without restraint against
   those who do not worship them. From which it may be understood how it
   is not good to worship their gods, since men ought to have been led to
   that which is good by good, and not by evil; but because this is evil,
   even its office is destitute of good. But they who destroy religious
   systems must be punished. Have we destroyed them in a worse manner than
   the nation of the Egyptians, who worship the most disgraceful figures
   of beasts and cattle, and adore as gods some things which it is even
   shameful to speak of? Have we done worse than those same who, when they
   say that they worship the gods, yet publicly and shamefully deride
   them?--for they even allow pantomimic [1063] representations of them to
   be acted with laughter and pleasure. What kind of a religion is this,
   or how great must that majesty be considered, which is adored in
   temples and mocked in theatres? And they who have done these things do
   not suffer the vengeance of the injured deity, but even go away
   honoured and praised. Do we destroy them in a worse manner than certain
   philosophers, who say that there are no gods at all, but that all
   things are spontaneously produced, and that all things which are done
   happen by chance? Do we destroy them in a worse manner than the
   Epicureans, who admit the existence of gods, but deny that they regard
   anything, and say that they are neither angry nor are influenced by
   favour? By which words they plainly persuade men that they are not to
   be worshipped at all, inasmuch as they neither regard their
   worshippers, nor are angry with those who do not worship them.
   Moreover, when they argue against fears, they endeavour to effect
   nothing else than that no one should fear the gods. And yet these
   things are willingly heard by men, and discussed with impunity.

    Chap. XXII.--Of the Rage of the Demons Against Christians, and the Error of
    Unbelievers.

   They do not therefore rage against us on this account, because their
   gods are not worshipped by us, but because the truth is on our side,
   which (as it has been said most truly) produces hatred. What, then,
   shall we think, but that they are ignorant of what they suffer? For
   they act [1064] with a blind and unreasonable fury, which we see, but
   of which they are ignorant. For it is not the men themselves who
   persecute, for they have no cause of anger against the innocent; but
   those contaminated and abandoned spirits by whom the truth is both
   known and hated insinuate themselves into their minds, and goad them in
   their ignorance to fury. For these, as long as there is peace among the
   people of God, flee from the righteous, and fear them; and when they
   seize upon the bodies of men, and harass their souls, they are adjured
   by them, and at the name of the true God are put to flight. For when
   they hear this name they tremble, cry out, and assert that they are
   branded and beaten; and being asked who they are, whence they are come,
   and how they have insinuated themselves into a man, confess it. Thus,
   being tortured and excruciated by the power of the divine name, they
   come out of the man. [1065] On account of these blows and threats, they
   always hate holy and just men; and because they are unable of
   themselves to injure them, they pursue with public hatred those whom
   they perceive to be grievous to them, and they exercise cruelty, with
   all the violence which they can employ, that they may either weaken
   their faith by pain, or, if they are unable to effect that, may take
   them away altogether from the earth, that there may be none to restrain
   their wickedness. It does not escape my notice what reply can be made
   on the other side. Why, then, does that God of surpassing power, that
   mighty One, whom you confess to preside over all things, and to be Lord
   of all, permit these things to be done, and neither avenge nor defend
   His worshippers? Why, in short, are they who do not worship Him rich,
   and powerful, and happy? and why do they enjoy honours and kingly
   state, and have these very persons [1066] subject to their power and
   sway?

   We must also give a reason for this, that no error may remain. For this
   is especially the cause why it is thought that religion has not the
   power of God, because men are influenced by the appearance of earthly
   and present goods, which in no way have reference to the care of the
   mind; and because they see that the righteous are without these goods,
   and that the unrighteous abound in them, they both judge that the
   worship of God is worthless, in which they do not see these things
   contained, and they imagine that the rites of other gods are true,
   since their worshippers enjoy riches and honours and kingdoms. But they
   who are of this opinion do not attentively consider the power and
   method of man, which consists altogether in the mind, and not in the
   body. For they see nothing more than is seen, namely the body; and
   because this is to be seen and handled, [1067] it is weak, frail, and
   mortal; and to this belong all those goods which are their desire and
   admiration, wealth, honours, and governments, since they bring
   pleasures to the body, and therefore are as liable to decay as the body
   itself. But the soul, in which alone man consists since it is not
   exposed to the sight of the eyes, and its goods cannot be seen, for
   they are placed in virtue only, must therefore be as firm, and
   constant, and lasting as virtue itself, in which the good of the soul
   consists.

    Chap. XXIII.--Of the Justice and Patience of the Christians.

   It would be a lengthened task to draw forth all the appearances of
   virtue, to show respecting each how necessary it is for a wise and just
   man to be far removed from those goods, the enjoyment of which by the
   unjust causes the worship of their gods to be regarded as true and
   efficacious. As our present inquiry is concerned, it will be sufficient
   to prove our point from the case of a single virtue. For instance,
   patience is a great and leading virtue, which the public voices of the
   people and philosophers and orators alike extol with the highest
   praises. But if it cannot be denied that this is a virtue of the
   highest kind, it is necessary that the just and wise man should be in
   the power of the unjust, for obtaining patience; for patience is the
   bearing with equanimity of the evils which are either inflicted or
   happen to fall upon us. Therefore the just and wise man, because he
   exercises virtue, has patience in himself; but he will be altogether
   free from this if he shall suffer no adversity. On the other hand, the
   man who lives in prosperity is impatient, and is without the greatest
   virtue. I call him impatient, because he suffers nothing. He is also
   unable to preserve innocency, which virtue is peculiar to the just and
   wise man. But he often acts unjustly also, and desires the property of
   others, and seizes upon that which he has desired by injustice, because
   he is without virtue, and is subject to vice and sin; and forgetful of
   his frailty, he is puffed up with a mind elated with insolence.

   From this cause the unjust, and those who are ignorant of God, abound
   with riches, and power, and honours. For all these things are the
   rewards of injustice, because they cannot be perpetual, and they are
   sought through lust and violence. But the just and wise man, because he
   deems all these things as human, as it has been said by Lælius, and his
   own goods as divine, neither desires anything which belongs to another,
   lest he should injure any one at all in violation of the law of
   humanity; nor does he long for any power or honour, that he may not do
   an injury to any one. For he knows that all are produced by the same
   God, and in the same condition, and are joined together by the right of
   brotherhood. [1068] But being contented with his own, and that a
   little, because he is mindful of his frailty, he does not seek for
   anything beyond that which may support his life; and even from that
   which he has he bestows a share on the destitute, because he is pious;
   but piety is a very great virtue. To this is added, that he despises
   frail and vicious pleasures, for the sake of which riches are desired;
   since he is temperate, and master of his passions. He also, having no
   pride or insolence, does not raise himself too highly, nor lift up his
   head with arrogance; but he is calm and peaceful, lowly [1069] and
   courteous, because he knows his own condition. Since, therefore, he
   does injury to none, nor desires the property of others, and does not
   even defend his own if it is taken from him by violence, since he knows
   how even to bear with moderation an injury inflicted upon him, because
   he is endued with virtue; it is necessary that the just man should be
   subject to the unjust, and that the wise should be insulted by the
   foolish, that the one may sin because he is unjust, and the other may
   have virtue in himself because he is just.

   But if any one shall wish to know more fully why God permits the wicked
   and the unjust to become powerful, happy, and rich, and, on the other
   hand, suffers the pious to be humble, wretched, and poor, let him take
   the book of Seneca which has the title, "Why many evils happen to good
   men, though there is a providence;" in which book he has said many
   things, not assuredly with the ignorance of this world, but wisely, and
   almost with divine inspiration. [1070] "God," he says, "regards men as
   His children, but He permits the corrupt and vicious to live in luxury
   and delicacy, because He does not think them worthy of His correction.
   But He often chastises the good whom He loves, and by continual labours
   exercises them to the practice of virtue: nor does He permit them to be
   corrupted and depraved by frail and perishable goods." From which it
   ought to appear strange to no one if we are often chastised by God for
   our faults. Yea, rather, when we are harassed and pressed, then we
   especially give thanks to our most indulgent Father, because He does
   not permit our corruption to proceed to greater lengths, but corrects
   it with stripes and blows. From which we understand that we are an
   object of regard to God, since He is angry when we sin. For when He
   might have bestowed upon His people both riches and kingdoms, as He had
   before given them to the Jews, whose successors and posterity we are;
   on this account He would have them live under the power and government
   of others, lest, being corrupted by the happiness of prosperity, they
   should glide into luxury and despise the precepts of God; as those
   ancestors of ours, who, ofttimes enervated by these earthly and frail
   goods, departed from discipline and burst the bonds of the law.
   Therefore He foresaw how far He would afford rest to His worshippers if
   they should keep His commandments, and yet correct them if they did not
   obey His precepts. Therefore, lest they should be as much corrupted by
   ease as their fathers had been by indulgence, [1071] it was His will
   that they should be oppressed by those in whose power He placed them,
   that He may both confirm them when wavering, and renew them to
   fortitude when corrupted, and try and prove them when faithful. For how
   can a general prove the valour of his soldiers, unless he shall have an
   enemy? And yet there arises an adversary to him against his will,
   because he is mortal, and is able to be conquered; but because God
   cannot be opposed, He Himself stirs up adversaries to His name, not to
   fight against God Himself, but against His soldiers, that He may either
   prove the devotedness and fidelity of His servants, or may strengthen
   them, until He corrects their wasting discipline by the stripes of
   affliction. [1072]

   There is also another cause why He permits persecutions to be carried
   on against us, that the people of God may be increased. [1073] Nor is
   it difficult to show why or how this happens. First of all, great
   numbers are driven from the worship of the false gods by their hatred
   of cruelty. For who would not shrink from such sacrifices? In the next
   place, some are pleased with virtue and faith itself. Some suspect that
   it is not without reason that the worship of the gods is considered
   evil by so many men, so that they would rather die than do that which
   others do that they may preserve their life. Some one desires to know
   what that good is which is defended even to death, which is preferred
   to all things which are pleasant and beloved in this life, from which
   neither the loss of goods, nor of the light, nor bodily pain, nor
   tortures of the vitals deter them. These things have great effect; but
   these causes have always especially increased the number of our
   followers. The people who stand around hear them saying in the midst of
   these very torments that they do not sacrifice to stones wrought by the
   hand of man, but to the living God, who is in heaven: many understand
   that this is true, and admit it into their breast. In the next place,
   as it is accustomed to happen in matters of uncertainty while they make
   inquiry of one another, what is the cause of this perseverance, many
   things which relate to religion, being spread abroad and carefully
   observed by rumour among one another, are learned; and because these
   are good they cannot fail to please. Moreover, the revenge which
   follows, as always happens, greatly impels men to believe. Nor, indeed,
   is it a slight cause that the unclean spirits of demons, having
   received permission, throw themselves into the bodies of many; and when
   these have afterwards been driven out, they who have been healed cling
   to the religion, the power of which they have experienced. These
   numerous causes being collected together, wonderfully gain over a great

    Chap. XXIV.--Of the Divine Vengeance Inflicted on the Torturers of the
    Christians.

   Whatever, therefore, wicked princes plan against us, God Himself
   permits to be done. And yet most unjust persecutors, to whom the name
   of God was a subject of reproach and mockery, must not think that they
   will escape with impunity, because they have been, as it were, the
   ministers of His indignation against us. For they will be punished with
   the judgment of God, who, having received power, have abused it to an
   inhuman degree, and have even insulted God in their arrogance, and
   placed His eternal name beneath their feet, to be impiously and
   wickedly trampled upon. On this account He promises that He will
   quickly take vengeance upon them, and exterminate the evil monsters
   [1075] from the earth. But He also, although He is accustomed to avenge
   the persecutions [1076] of His people even in the present world,
   commands us, however, to await patiently that day of heavenly judgment,
   in which He Himself will honour or punish every man according to his
   deserts. Therefore let not the souls of the sacrilegious expect that
   those whom they thus trample upon will be despised and unavenged. Those
   ravenous and voracious wolves who have tormented just and innocent
   souls, without the commission of any crimes, will surely meet with
   their reward. Only let us labour, that nothing else in us may be
   punished by men but righteousness alone: let us strive with all our
   power that we may at once deserve at the hands of God the avenging of
   our suffering and a reward.

  Book VI.

  Of True Worship.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. I.--Of the Worship of the True God, and of Innocency, and of the
    Worship of False Gods.

   We have completed that which was the object of our undertaking, through
   the teaching of the Divine Spirit, and the aid of the truth itself; the
   cause of asserting and explaining which was imposed upon me both by
   conscience and faith, and by our Lord Himself, without whom nothing can
   be known or clearly set forth. I come now to that which is the chief
   and greatest part of this work--to teach in what manner or by what
   sacrifice God must be worshipped. For that is the duty of man, and in
   that one object the sum of all things and the whole course of a happy
   life consists, since we were fashioned and received the breath of life
   from Him on this account, not that we might behold the heaven and the
   sun, as Anaxagoras supposed, but that we might with pure and
   uncorrupted mind worship Him who made the sun and the heaven. But
   although in the preceding books, as far as my moderate talent
   permitted, I defended the truth, yet it may especially be elucidated
   [1077] by the mode of worship itself. For that sacred and surpassing
   majesty requires from man nothing more than innocence alone; and if any
   one has presented this to God, he has sacrificed with sufficient piety
   and religion. But men, neglecting justice, though they are polluted by
   crimes and outrages of all kinds, think themselves religious if they
   have stained the temples and altars with the blood of victims, if they
   have moistened the hearths with a profusion of fragrant and old wine.
   Moreover, they also prepare sacred feasts and choice banquets, as
   though they offered to those who would taste something from them.
   Whatever is rarely to be viewed, whatever is precious in workmanship or
   in fragrance, that they judge to be pleasing to their gods, not by any
   reference to their divinity, of which they are ignorant, but from their
   own desires; nor do they understand that God is in no want of earthly
   resources.

   For they have no knowledge of anything except the earth, and they
   estimate good and evil things by the perception and pleasure of the
   body alone. And as they judge of religion according to its pleasure, so
   also they arrange the acts of their whole life. And since they have
   turned away once for all from the contemplation of the heaven, and have
   made that heavenly faculty the slave of the body, they give the reins
   to their lusts, as though they were about to bear away pleasure with
   themselves, which they hasten to enjoy at every moment; whereas the
   soul ought to employ the service of the body, and not the body to make
   use of the service of the soul. The same men judge riches to be the
   greatest good. And if they cannot obtain them by good practices, they
   endeavour to obtain them by evil practices; they deceive, they carry
   off by violence, they plunder, they lie in wait, they deny on oath; in
   short, they have no consideration or regard for anything, [1078] if
   only they can glitter with gold, and shine conspicuous with plate, with
   jewels, and with garments, can spend riches upon their greedy appetite,
   and always walk attended with crowds of slaves through the people
   compelled to give way. [1079] Thus devoting [1080] themselves to the
   service of pleasures, they extinguish the force and vigour of the mind;
   and when they especially think that they are alive, they are hastening
   with the greatest precipitation to death. For, as we showed in the
   second book, the soul is concerned with heaven, the body with the
   earth. [1081] They who neglect the goods of the soul, and seek those of
   the body, are engaged with darkness and death, which belong to the
   earth and to the body, because life and light are from heaven; and they
   who are without this, by serving the body, are far removed from the
   understanding of divine things. The same blindness everywhere oppresses
   the wretched men; for as they know not who is the true God, so they
   know not what constitutes true worship.

    Chap. II.--Of the Worship of False Gods and the True God.

   Therefore they sacrifice fine and fat victims to God, as though He were
   hungry; they pour forth wine to Him, as though He were thirsty; they
   kindle lights to Him, as though He were in darkness. [1082] But if they
   were able to conjecture or to conceive in their mind what those
   heavenly goods are, the greatness of which we cannot imagine, while we
   are still encompassed with an earthly body, they would at once know
   that they are most foolish with their empty offices. Or if they would
   contemplate that heavenly light which we call the sun, they will at
   once perceive how God has no need of their candles, who has Himself
   given so clear and bright a light for the use of man. [1083] And when,
   in so small a circle, which on account of its distance appears to have
   a measure no greater than that of a human head, there is still so much
   brilliancy that mortal eye cannot behold it, and if you should direct
   your eye to it for a short time mist and darkness would overspread your
   dimmed eyes, what light, I pray, what brightness, must we suppose that
   there is in God, with whom there is no night? For He has so attempered
   this very light, that it might neither injure living creatures by
   excessive brightness or vehement heat, and has given it so much of
   these properties as mortal bodies might endure or the ripening of the
   crops require. Is that man, therefore, to be thought in his senses, who
   presents the light of candles and torches as an offering to Him who is
   the Author and Giver of light? The light which He requires from us is
   of another kind, and that indeed not accompanied with smoke, but (as
   the poet says) clear and bright; I mean the light of the mind, on
   account of which we are called by the poets photes, [1084] which light
   no one can exhibit unless he has known God. But their gods, because
   they are of the earth, stand in need of lights, that they may not be in
   darkness; and their worshippers, because they have no taste for
   anything heavenly, are recalled to the earth even by the religious
   rites to which they are devoted. [1085] For on the earth there is need
   of a light, because its system and nature are dark. Therefore they do
   not attribute to the gods a heavenly perception, but rather a human
   one. And on this account they believe that the same things are
   necessary and pleasing to them as to us, who, when hungry, have need of
   food; or, when thirsty, of drink; or, when we are cold, require a
   garment; or, when the sun has withdrawn himself, require a light that
   we may be able to see. [1086]

   From nothing, therefore, can it be so plainly proved and understood
   that those gods, since they once lived, are dead, as from their worship
   itself, which is altogether of the earth. For what heavenly influence
   can there be in the shedding of the blood of beasts, with which they
   stain their altars? unless by chance they imagine that the gods feed
   upon that which men shrink from touching. And whoever shall have
   offered to them this food, [1087] although he be an assassin, an
   adulterer, a sorcerer, or a parricide, he will he happy and prosperous.
   Him they love, him they defend, to him they afford all things which he
   shall wish for. Persius therefore deservedly ridicules superstitions of
   this kind in his own style: [1088] "With what bribe," he says, "dost
   thou win the ears of gods? Is it with lungs and rich intestines?" He
   plainly perceived that there is no need of flesh for appeasing the
   majesty of heaven, but of a pure mind and a just spirit, and a breast,
   as he himself says, which is generous with a natural love of honour.
   This is the religion of heaven--not that which consists of corrupt
   things, but of the virtues of the soul, which has its origin from
   heaven; this is true worship, in which the mind of the worshipper
   presents itself as an undefiled offering to God. But how this is to be
   obtained, how it is to be afforded, the discussion of this book will
   show; for nothing can be so illustrious and so suited to man as to
   train men to righteousness. [1089]

   In Cicero, Catulus in the Hortensius, while he prefers philosophy to
   all things, says that he would rather have one short treatise
   respecting duty, than a long speech in behalf of a seditious man
   Cornelius. And this is plainly to be regarded not as the opinion of
   Catulus, who perhaps did not utter this saying, but as that of Cicero,
   who wrote it. I believe that he wrote it for the purpose of
   recommending these books which he was about to write on Offices, in
   which very books he testifies that nothing in the whole range of
   philosophy is better and more profitable than to give precepts for
   living. But if this is done by those who do not know the truth, how
   much more ought we to do it, who are able to give true precepts, [1090]
   being taught and enlightened by God? Nor, however, shall we so teach as
   though we were delivering the first elements of virtue, which would be
   an endless task, but as though we had undertaken the instruction of him
   who, with them, appears to be already perfect. For while their precepts
   remain, which they are accustomed to give correctly, with a view to
   uprightness, we will add to them things which were unknown to them, for
   the completion and consummation of righteousness, which they do not
   possess. But I will omit those things which are common to us with them,
   that I may not appear to borrow from those whose errors I have
   determined to convict and bring to light.

    Chap. III.--Of the Ways, and of Vices and Virtues; And of the Rewards of
    Heaven and the Punishments of Hell.

   There are two ways, [1091] O Emperor Constantine, by which human life
   must proceed--the one which leads to heaven, the other which sinks to
   hell; and these ways poets have introduced in their poems, and
   philosophers in their disputations. And indeed philosophers have
   represented the one as belonging to virtues, the other to vices; and
   they have represented that which belongs to virtues as steep and rugged
   at the first entrance, in which if any one, having overcome the
   difficulty, has climbed to the summit, they say that he afterwards has
   a level path, a bright and pleasant plain, and that he enjoys abundant
   and delightful fruits of his labours; but that those whom the
   difficulty of the first approach has deterred, glide and turn aside
   into the way of vices, which at its first entrance appears to be
   pleasant and much more beaten, but afterwards, when they have advanced
   in it a little further, that the appearance of its pleasantness is
   withdrawn, and that there arises a steep way, now rough with stones,
   now overspread with thorns, now interrupted by deep waters or violent
   with torrents, so that they must be in difficulty, hesitate, slip
   about, and fall. And all these things are brought forward that it may
   appear that there are very great labours in undertaking virtues, but
   that when they are gained there are the greatest advantages, and firm
   and incorruptible pleasures; but that vices ensnare the minds of men
   with certain natural blandishments, and lead them captivated by the
   appearance of empty pleasures to bitter griefs and miseries,--an
   altogether wise discussion, if they knew the forms and limits of the
   virtues themselves. For they had not learned either what they are, or
   what reward awaits them from God: but this we will show in these two
   books.

   But these men, because they were ignorant or in doubt that the souls of
   men are immortal, estimated both virtues and vices by earthly honours
   or punishments. Therefore all this discussion respecting the two ways
   [1092] has reference to frugality and luxury. For they say that the
   course of human life resembles the letter Y, because every one of men,
   when he has reached the threshold of early youth, and has arrived at
   the place "where the way divides itself into two parts," [1093] is in
   doubt, and hesitates, and does not know to which side he should rather
   turn himself. If he shall meet with a guide who may direct him wavering
   to better things--that is, if he shall learn philosophy or eloquence,
   or some honourable arts by which he may turn to good conduct, [1094]
   which cannot take place without great labour--they say that he will
   lead a life of honour and abundance; but if he shall not meet with a
   teacher of temperance, [1095] that he falls into the way on the left
   hand, which assumes the appearance of the better,--that is, he gives
   himself up to idleness, sloth, and luxury, which seem pleasant for a
   time to one who is ignorant of true goods, but that afterwards, having
   lost all his dignity and property, he will live in all wretchedness and
   ignominy. Therefore they referred the end of those ways [1096] to the
   body, and to this life which we lead on earth. The poets perhaps did
   better, who would have it that this twofold way was in the lower
   regions; but they are deceived in this, that they proposed these ways
   to the dead. Both therefore spoke with truth, but yet both incorrectly;
   for the ways themselves ought to have been referred to life, their ends
   to death. We therefore speak better and more truly, who say that the
   two ways [1097] belong to heaven and hell, because immortality is
   promised to the righteous, and everlasting punishment is threatened to
   the unrighteous.

   But I will explain how these ways either exalt to heaven or thrust down
   to hell, and I will set forth what these virtues are of which the
   philosophers were ignorant; then I will show what are their rewards,
   and also what are vices, and what their punishments. For perhaps some
   one may expect that I shall speak separately of vices and virtues;
   whereas, when we discuss the subject of good or evil, that which is
   contrary may also be understood. For, whether you introduce virtues,
   vices will spontaneously depart; or if you take away vices, virtues
   will of their own accord succeed. The nature of good and evil things is
   so fixed, that they always oppose and drive out one another: and thus
   it comes to pass that vices cannot be removed without virtues, nor can
   virtues be introduced without the removal of vices. Therefore we bring
   forward these ways in a very different manner from that in which the
   philosophers are accustomed to present them: first of all, because we
   say that a guide is proposed to each, and in each case an immortal: but
   that the one is honoured who presides over virtues and good qualities,
   the other condemned who presides over vices and evils. But they place a
   guide only on the right side, and that not one only, nor a lasting one;
   inasmuch as they introduce any teacher of a good art, who may recall
   men from sloth, and teach them to be temperate. But they do not
   represent any as entering upon that way except boys and young men; for
   this reason, that the arts are learned at these ages. We, on the other
   hand, lead those of each sex, every age and race, into this heavenly
   path, because God, who is the guide of that way, denies immortality to
   no human being. [1098] The shape also of the ways themselves is not as
   they supposed. For what need is there of the letter Y in matters which
   are different and opposed to one another? But the one which is better
   is turned towards the rising of the sun, the other which is worse
   towards its setting: since he who follows truth and righteousness,
   having received the reward of immortality, will enjoy perpetual light;
   but he who, enticed by that evil guide, shall prefer vices to virtues,
   falsehood to truth, must be borne to the setting of the sun, and to
   darkness. [1099] I will therefore describe each, and will point out
   their properties and habits.

    Chap. IV.--Of the Ways of Life, of Pleasures, Also of the Hardships of
    Christians.

   There is one way, therefore, of virtue and the good, which leads, not,
   as the poets say, to the Elysian plains, but to the very citadel of the
   world:--


   "The left gives sinners up to pain,

   And leads to Tartarus' guilty reign." [1100]

   For it belongs to that accuser who, having invented false religions,
   turns men away from the heavenly path, and leads them into the way of
   perdition. And the appearance and shape of this way is so composed to
   the sight, that it appears to be level and open, and delightful with
   all kinds of flowers and fruits. For there are placed [1101] in it all
   things which are esteemed on earth as good things--I mean wealth,
   honour, repose, pleasure, all kinds of enticements; but together with
   these also injustice, cruelty, pride, perfidy, lust, avarice, discord,
   ignorance, falsehood, folly, and other vices. But the end of this way
   is as follows: When they have reached the point from which there is now
   no return, it is so suddenly removed, together with all its beauty,
   that no one is able to foresee the fraud before that he falls headlong
   into a deep abyss. For whoever is captivated by the appearance of
   present goods, and occupied with the pursuit and enjoyment of these,
   shall not have foreseen the things which are about to follow after
   death, and shall have turned aside from God; he truly will be cast down
   to hell, and be condemned to eternal punishment.

   But that heavenly way is set forth as difficult and hilly, or rough
   with dreadful thorns, or entangled with stones jutting out; so that
   every one must walk with the greatest labour and wearing of the feet,
   and with great precautions against falling. In this he has placed
   justice, temperance, patience, faith, chastity, self-restraint,
   concord, knowledge, truth, wisdom, and the other virtues; but together
   with these, poverty, ignominy, labour, pain, and all kinds of hardship.
   For whoever has extended his hope beyond the present, and chosen better
   things, will be without these earthly goods, that, being lightly
   equipped and without impediment, he may overcome the difficulty of the
   way. For it is impossible for him who has surrounded himself with royal
   pomp, or loaded himself with riches, either to enter upon or to
   persevere in these difficulties. And from this it is understood that it
   is easier for the wicked and the unrighteous to succeed in their
   desires, because their road is downward and on the decline; but that it
   is difficult for the good to attain to their wishes, because they walk
   along a difficult and steep path. Therefore the righteous man, since he
   has entered upon a hard and rugged way, must be an object of contempt,
   derision, and hatred. For all whom desire or pleasure drags headlong,
   envy him who has been able to attain to virtue, and take it ill that
   any one possesses that which they themselves do not possess. Therefore
   he will be poor, humble, ignoble, subject to injury, and yet enduring
   all things which are grievous; and if he shall continue his patience
   unceasingly to that last step and end, the crown of virtue will be
   given to him, and he will be rewarded by God with immortality for the
   labours which he has endured in life for the sake of righteousness.
   These are the ways which God has assigned to human life, in each of
   which he has shown both good and evil things, but in a changed and
   inverted order. In the one he has pointed out in the first place
   temporal evils followed by eternal goods, which is the better order; in
   the other, first temporal goods followed by eternal evils, which is the
   worse order: so that, whosoever has chosen present evils together with
   righteousness, he will obtain greater and more certain goods than those
   were which he despised; but whoever has preferred present goods to
   righteousness, will fall into greater and more lasting evils than those
   were which he avoided. For as this bodily life is short, therefore its
   goods and evils must also be short; but since that spiritual life,
   which is contrary to this earthly life, is everlasting, therefore its
   goods and evils are also everlasting. Thus it comes to pass, that goods
   of short duration are succeeded by eternal evils, and evils of short
   duration by eternal goods.

   Since, therefore, good and evil things are set before man at the same
   time, it is befitting that every one should consider with himself how
   much better it is to compensate evils of short duration by perpetual
   goods, than to endure perpetual evils for short and perishable goods.
   For as, in this life, when a contest with an enemy is set before you,
   you must first labour that you may afterwards enjoy repose, you must
   suffer hunger and thirst, you must endure heat and cold, you must rest
   on the ground, must watch and undergo dangers, that your children,
   [1102] and house, and property being preserved, you may be able to
   enjoy all the blessings of peace and victory; but if you should choose
   present ease in preference to labour, you must do yourself the greatest
   injury: for the enemy will surprise you offering no resistance, your
   lands will be laid waste, your house plundered, your wife and children
   become a prey, you yourself will be slain or taken prisoner; to prevent
   the occurrence of these things, present advantage must be put aside,
   that a greater and more lasting advantage may be gained;--so in the
   whole of this life, because God has provided an adversary for us, that
   we might be able to acquire virtue, present gratification must be laid
   aside, lest the enemy should overpower us. We must be on the watch,
   must post guards, must undertake military expeditions, must shed our
   blood to the uttermost; in short, we must patiently submit to all
   things which are unpleasant and grievous, and the more readily because
   God our commander has appointed for us eternal rewards for our labours.
   And since in this earthly warfare men expend so much labour to acquire
   for themselves those things which may perish in the same manner as that
   in which they were acquired, assuredly no labour ought to be refused by
   us, by whom that is gained which can in no way be lost.

   For God, who created men to this warfare, desired that they should
   stand prepared in battle array, and with minds keenly intent should
   watch against the stratagems or open attacks of our single enemy, who,
   as is the practice of skilful and experienced generals, endeavours to
   ensnare us by various arts, directing his rage according to the nature
   and disposition of each. For he infuses into some insatiable avarice,
   that, being chained by their riches as by fetters, he may drive them
   from the way of truth. He inflames others with the excitement of anger,
   that while they are rather intent upon inflicting injury, he may turn
   them aside from the contemplation of God. He plunges others into
   immoderate lusts, that, giving themselves to pleasure of the body, they
   may be unable to look towards virtue. He inspires others with envy,
   that, being occupied with their own torments, they may think of nothing
   but the happiness of those whom they hate. He causes others to swell
   with ambitious desires. These are they who direct the whole occupation
   and care of their life to the holding of magistracies, that they may
   set a mark upon the annals, [1103] and give a name to the years. The
   desire of others mounts higher, not that they may rule provinces with
   the temporal sword, but with boundless and perpetual power may wish to
   be called lords of the whole human race. [1104] Moreover, those whom he
   has seen to be pious he involves in various [1105] superstitions, that
   he may make them impious. But to those who seek for wisdom, he dashes
   philosophy before their eyes, [1106] that he may blind them with the
   appearance of light, lest any one should grasp and hold fast the truth.
   Thus he has blocked up all the approaches against men, and has occupied
   the way, rejoicing in public errors; but that we might be able to
   dispel these errors, and to overcome the author of evils himself, God
   has enlightened us, and has armed us with true and heavenly virtue,
   respecting which I must now speak.

    Chap. V.--Of False and True Virtue; And of Knowledge.

   But before I begin to set forth the separate virtues, I must mark out
   the character of virtue itself, which the philosophers have not rightly
   defined, as to its nature, or in what things it consisted; and I must
   describe its operation and office. For they only retained the name, but
   lost its power, and nature, and effect. But whatever they are
   accustomed to say in their definition of virtue, Lucilius puts together
   and expresses in a few verses, which I prefer to introduce, lest, while
   I refute the opinions of many, I should be longer than is necessary:--


   "It is virtue, O Albinus, to pay the proper price,

   To attend to the matters in which we are engaged, and in which we live.

   It is virtue for a man to know the nature of everything.

   It is virtue for a man to know what is right and useful and honourable,

   What things are good, and what are evil.

   What is useless, [1107] base, and dishonourable.

   It is virtue to know the end of an object to be sought and the means of
   procuring it

   It is virtue to be able to assign their value to riches.

   It is virtue to give that which is really due to honour;

   To be the enemy and the foe [1108] of bad men and manners, but, on the
   other hand, the defender of good men and manners;

   To esteem these highly, to wish them well, to live in friendship with
   them,

   Moreover, to consider the interest of one's country first;

   Then those of parents, to put our own interests in the third and last
   place."

   From these definitions, which the poet briefly puts together, Marcus
   Tullius derived the offices of living, following Panætius the Stoic,
   [1109] and included them in three books.

   But we shall presently see how false these things are, that it may
   appear how much the divine condescension has bestowed on us in opening
   to us the truth. He says that it is virtue to know what is good and
   evil, what is base, what is honourable, what is useful, what is
   useless. He might have shortened his treatise if he had only spoken of
   that which is good and evil; for nothing can be useful or honourable
   which is not also good, and nothing useless and base which is not also
   evil. And this also appears to be thus to philosophers, and Cicero
   shows it likewise in the third book of the above-mentioned treatise.
   [1110] But knowledge cannot be virtue, because it is not within us, but
   it comes to us from without. But that which is able to pass from one to
   the other is not virtue, because virtue is the property of each
   individual. Knowledge therefore consists in a benefit derived from
   another; for it depends upon hearing. Virtue is altogether our own; for
   it depends upon the will of doing that which is good. As, therefore, in
   undertaking a journey, it is of no profit to know the way, unless we
   also have the effort and strength for walking, so truly knowledge is of
   no avail if our virtue fails. For, in general, even they who sin
   perceive what is good and evil, though not perfectly; and as often as
   they act improperly, they know that they sin, and therefore endeavour
   to conceal their actions. But though the nature of good and evil does
   not escape their notice, they are overpowered by an evil desire to sin,
   because they are wanting in virtue, that is, the desire of doing right
   and honourable things. Therefore that the knowledge of good and evil is
   one thing, and virtue another, appears from this, because knowledge can
   exist without virtue, as it has been in the case of many of the
   philosophers; in which, since not to have done what you knew to be
   right is justly censurable, a depraved will and a vicious mind, which
   ignorance cannot excuse, will be justly punished. Therefore, as the
   knowledge of good and evil is not virtue, so the doing that which is
   good and the abstaining from evil is virtue. And yet knowledge is so
   united with virtue, that knowledge precedes virtue, and virtue follows
   knowledge; because knowledge is of no avail unless it is followed up by
   action. Horace therefore speaks somewhat better: "Virtue is the fleeing
   from vice, and the first wisdom is to be free from folly." [1111] But
   he speaks improperly, because he defined virtue by its contrary, as
   though he should say, That is good which is not evil. For when I know
   not what virtue is, I do not know what vice is. Each therefore requires
   definition, because the nature of the case is such that each must be
   understood or not understood. [1112]

   But let us do that which he ought to have done. It is a virtue to
   restrain anger, to control desire, to curb lust; for this is to flee
   from vice. For almost all things which are done unjustly and
   dishonestly arise from these affections. For if the force of this
   emotion which is called anger be blunted, all the evil contentions of
   men will be lulled to rest; no one will plot, no one will rush forth to
   injure another. Also, if desire be restrained, no one will use violence
   by land or by sea, no one will lead an army to carry off and lay waste
   the property of others. Also, if the ardour of lusts be repressed,
   every age and sex will retain its sanctity; no one will suffer, or do
   anything disgraceful. Therefore all crimes and disgraceful actions will
   be taken away from the life and character of men, if these emotions are
   appeased and calmed by virtue. And this calming of the emotions and
   affections has this meaning, that we do all things which are right. The
   whole duty of virtue then is, not to sin. And assuredly he cannot
   discharge this who is ignorant of God, since ignorance of Him from whom
   good things proceed must thrust a man unawares into vices. Therefore,
   that I may more briefly and significantly fix the offices of each
   subject, knowledge is to know God, virtue is to worship Him: the former
   implies wisdom, the latter righteousness.

    Chap. VI.--Of the Chief Good and Virtue, and or Knowledge and Righteousness.

   I have said that which was the first thing, that the knowledge of good
   is not virtue; and secondly, I have shown what virtue is, and in what
   it consists. It follows that I should show this also, that the
   philosophers were ignorant of what is good and evil; and this briefly,
   because it has been almost [1113] made plain in the third book, when I
   was discussing the subject of the chief good. And because they did not
   know what the chief good was, they necessarily erred in the case of the
   other goods and evils which are not the chief; for no one can weigh
   these with a true judgment who does not possess the fountain itself
   from which they are derived. Now the source of good things is God; but
   of evils, he who is always the enemy of the divine name, of whom we
   have often spoken. From these two sources good and evil things have
   their origin. Those which proceed from God have this object, to procure
   immortality, which is the greatest good; but those which arise from the
   other have this office, to call man away from heavenly things and sink
   him in earthly things, and thus to consign him to the punishment of
   everlasting death, which is the greatest evil. Is it therefore doubtful
   but that all those were ignorant of what was good and evil, who neither
   knew God nor the adversary of God? Therefore they referred the end of
   good things to the body, and to this short life, which must be
   dissolved and perish: they did not advance further. But all their
   precepts, and all the things which they introduce as goods, adhere to
   the earth, and lie on the ground, since they die with the body, which
   is earth; for they do not tend to procure life for man, but either to
   the acquisition or increase of riches, honour, glory, and power, which
   are altogether mortal things, as much so indeed as he who has laboured
   to obtain them. Hence is that saying, [1114] "It is virtue to know the
   end of an object [1115] to be sought, and the means of procuring it;"
   for they enjoin by what means and by what practices property is to be
   sought, for they see that it is often sought unjustly. But virtue of
   this kind is not proposed to the wise man; for it is not virtue to seek
   riches, of which neither the finding nor the possession is in our
   power: therefore they are more easy to be gained and to be retained by
   the bad than by the good. Virtue, then, cannot consist in the seeking
   of those things in the despising of which the force and purport of
   virtue appears; nor will it have recourse to those very things which,
   with its great and lofty mind, it desires to trample upon and bruise
   under foot; nor is it lawful for a soul which is earnestly fixed on
   heavenly goods to be called away from its immortal pursuits, that it
   may acquire for itself these frail things. But the course [1116] of
   virtue especially consists in the acquisition of those things which
   neither any man, nor death itself, can take away from us. Since these
   things are so, that which follows is true: "It is virtue to be able to
   assign their value to riches:" which verse is nearly of the same
   meaning as the first two. But neither he nor any of the philosophers
   was able to know the price itself, either of what nature or what it is;
   for the poet, and all those whom he followed, thought that it meant to
   make a right use of riches,--that is, to be moderate in living, not to
   make costly entertainments, not to squander carelessly, not to expend
   property on superfluous or disgraceful objects. [1117]

   Some one will perhaps say, What do you say? Do you deny that this is
   virtue? I do not deny it indeed; for if I should deny it, I should
   appear to prove the opposite. But I deny that it is true virtue;
   because it is not that heavenly principle, but is altogether of the
   earth, since it produces no effect but that which remains on the earth.
   [1118] But what it is to make a right use of wealth, and what advantage
   is to be sought from riches, I will declare more openly when I shall
   begin to speak of the duty of piety. Now the other things which follow
   are by no means true; for to proclaim enmity against the wicked, or to
   undertake the defence of the good, may be common to it with the evil.
   For some, by a pretence of goodness, prepare the way for themselves to
   power, and do many things which the good are accustomed to do, and that
   the more readily because they do them for the sake of deceiving; and I
   wish that it were as easy to carry out goodness in action as it is to
   pretend to it. But when they have begun to attain to their purpose and
   their wish in reaching the highest step of power, then, truly laying
   aside pretence, these men discover their character; they seize upon
   everything, and offer violence, and lay waste; and they press upon the
   good themselves, whose cause they had undertaken; and they cut away the
   steps by which they mounted, that no one may be able to imitate them
   against themselves. But, however, let us suppose that this duty of
   defending the good belongs only to the good man. Yet to undertake it is
   easy, to fulfil it is difficult; because when you have committed
   yourself to a contest and an encounter, the victory is placed at the
   disposal of God, not in your own power. And for the most part the
   wicked are more powerful both in number and in combination than the
   good, so that it is not so much virtue which is necessary to overcome
   them as good fortune. Is any one ignorant how often the better and the
   juster side has been overcome? From this cause harsh tyrannies have
   always broken out against the citizens. All history is full of
   examples, but we will be content with one. Cnoeus Pompeius wished to be
   the defender of the good, since he took up arms in defence of the
   commonwealth, in defence of the senate, and in defence of liberty; and
   yet the same man, being conquered, perished together with liberty
   itself, [1119] and being mutilated by Egyptian eunuchs, was cast forth
   unburied. [1120]

   It is not virtue, therefore, either to be the enemy of the bad or the
   defender of the good, because virtue cannot be subject to uncertain
   chances.


   "Moreover, to reckon the interests of our country as in the first
   place."

   When the agreement of men is taken away, virtue has no existence at
   all; for what are the interests of our country, but the inconveniences
   of another state or nation?--that is, to extend the boundaries which
   are violently taken from others, to increase the power of the state, to
   improve the revenues,--all which things are not virtues, but the
   overthrowing of virtues: for, in the first place, the union of human
   society is taken away, innocence is taken away, the abstaining from the
   property of another is taken away; lastly, justice itself is taken
   away, which is unable to bear the tearing asunder of the human race,
   and wherever arms have glittered, must be banished and exterminated
   from thence. This saying of Cicero [1121] is true: "But they who say
   that regard is to be had to citizens, but that it is not to be had to
   foreigners, these destroy the common society of the human race; and
   when this is removed, beneficence, liberality, kindness, and justice
   are entirely [1122] taken away." For how can a man be just who injures,
   who hates, who despoils, who puts to death? And they who strive to be
   serviceable to their country do all these things: for they are ignorant
   of what this being serviceable is, who think nothing useful, nothing
   advantageous, but that which can be held by the hand; and this alone
   cannot be held, because it may be snatched away.

   Whoever, then, has gained for his country these goods--as they
   themselves call them--that is, who by the overthrow of cities and the
   destruction of nations has filled the treasury with money, has taken
   lands and enriched his country-men--he is extolled with praises to the
   heaven: in him there is said to be the greatest and perfect virtue. And
   this is the error not only of the people and the ignorant, but also of
   philosophers, who even give precepts for injustice, lest folly and
   wickedness should be wanting in discipline and authority. Therefore,
   when they are speaking of the duties relating to warfare, all that
   discourse is accommodated neither to justice nor to true virtue, but to
   this life and to civil institutions; [1123] and that this is not
   justice the matter itself declares, and Cicero has testified. [1124]
   "But we," he says, "are not in possession of the real and life-like
   figure of true law and genuine justice, we have nothing but
   delineations and sketches; [1125] and I wish that we followed even
   these, for they are taken from the excellent copies made by nature and
   truth." It is then a delineation and a sketch which they thought to be
   justice. But what of wisdom? does not the same man confess that it has
   no existence in philosophers? "Nor," he says, [1126] "when Fabricius or
   Aristides is called just, is an example of justice sought from these as
   from a wise man; for none of these is wise in the sense in which we
   wish the truly wise to be understood. Nor were they who are esteemed
   and called wise, Marcus Cato and Caius Lælius, actually wise, nor those
   well-known seven; [1127] but from their constant practice of the middle
   duties,' [1128] they bore a certain likeness and appearance [1129] of
   wise men." If therefore wisdom is taken away from the philosophers by
   their own confession, and justice is taken away from those who are
   regarded as just, it follows that all those descriptions of virtue must
   be false, because no one can know what true virtue is but he who is
   just and wise. But no one is just and wise but he whom God has
   instructed with heavenly precepts.

    Chap. VII.--Of the Way of Error and of Truth: that It is Single, Narrow, and
    Steep, and Has God for Its Guide.

   For all those who, by the confessed folly of others, are thought wise,
   being clothed with the appearance of virtue, grasp at shadows and
   outlines, but at nothing true. Which happens on this account, because
   that deceitful road which inclines to the west has many paths, on
   account of the variety of pursuits and systems which are dissimilar and
   varied in the life of men. For as that way of wisdom contains something
   which resembles folly, as we showed in the preceding book, so this way,
   which belongs altogether to folly, contains something which resembles
   wisdom, and they who perceive the folly of men in general seize upon
   this; and as it has its vices manifest, so it has something which
   appears to resemble virtue: as it has its wickedness open, so it has a
   likeness and appearance of justice. For how could the forerunner [1130]
   of that way, whose strength and power are altogether in deceit, lead
   men altogether into fraud, unless he showed them some things which
   resembled the truth? [1131] For, that His immortal secret might be
   hidden, God placed in his way things which men might despise as evil
   and disgraceful, that, turning away from wisdom and truth, which they
   were searching for without any guide, they might fall upon that very
   thing which they desired to avoid and flee from. Therefore he points
   out that way of destruction and death which has many windings, either
   because there are many kinds of life, or because there are many gods
   who are worshipped.

   The deceitful [1132] and treacherous guide of this way, that there may
   appear to be some distinction between truth and falsehood, good and
   evil, leads the luxurious in one direction, and those who are called
   temperate [1133] in another; the ignorant in one direction, the learned
   in another; the sluggish in one direction, the active in another; the
   foolish in one direction, the philosophers in another, and even these
   not in one path. For those who do not shun pleasures or riches, he
   withdraws a little from this public and frequented road; but those who
   either wish to follow virtue, or profess a contempt for things, he
   drags over certain rugged precipices. But nevertheless all those paths
   which display an appearance of honours are not different roads, but
   turnings off [1134] and bypaths, which appear indeed to be separated
   from that common one, and to branch off to the right, but yet return to
   the same, and all lead at the very end to one issue. For that guide
   unites them all, where it was necessary that the good should be
   separated from the bad, the strong from the inactive, the wise from the
   foolish; namely, in the worship of the gods, in which he slays them all
   with one sword, because they were all foolish without any distinction,
   and plunges them into death. But this way--which is that of truth, and
   wisdom, and virtue, and justice, of all which there is but one
   fountain, one source of strength, one abode--is both simple, [1135]
   because with like minds, and with the utmost agreement, we follow and
   worship one God; and it is narrow, because virtue is given to the
   smaller number; and steep, because goodness, which is very high and
   lofty, cannot be attained to without the greatest difficulty and
   labour.

    Chap. VIII.--Of the Errors of Philosophers, and the Variableness of Law.

   This is the way which philosophers seek, but do not find on this
   account, because they prefer to seek it on the earth, where it cannot
   appear. Therefore they wander, as it were, on the great sea, and do not
   understand whither they are borne, because they neither discern the way
   nor follow any guide. For this way of life ought to be sought in the
   same manner in which their course is sought by ships over the deep: for
   unless they observe some light of heaven, they wander with uncertain
   courses. But whoever strives to hold the right course of life ought not
   to look to the earth, but to the heaven: and, to speak more plainly, he
   ought not to follow man, but God; not to serve these earthly images,
   but the heavenly God; not to measure all things by their reference to
   the body, but by their reference to the soul; not to attend to this
   life, but the eternal life. Therefore, if you always direct your eyes
   towards heaven, and observe the sun, where it rises, and take this as
   the guide of your life, as in the case of a voyage, your feet will
   spontaneously be directed into the way; and that heavenly light, which
   is a much brighter sun [1136] to sound minds than this which we behold
   in mortal flesh, will so rule and govern you as to lead you without any
   error to the most excellent harbour of wisdom and virtue.

   Therefore the law of God must be undertaken, which may direct us to
   this path; that sacred, that heavenly law, which Marcus Tullius, in his
   third book respecting the Republic, [1137] has described almost with a
   divine voice; whose words have subjoined, that I might not speak at
   greater length: "There is indeed a true law, right reason, agreeing
   with nature, diffused among all, unchanging, everlasting, which calls
   to duty by commanding, deters from wrong by forbidding; which, however,
   neither commands nor forbids the good in vain, nor affects the wicked
   by commanding or forbidding. It is not allowable to alter [1138] the
   provisions of this law, nor is it permitted us to modify it, nor can it
   be entirely abrogated. [1139] Nor, truly, can we be released from this
   law, either by the senate or by the people; nor is another person to be
   sought to explain or interpret it. Nor will there be one law at Rome
   and another at Athens; one law at the present time, and another
   hereafter: but the same law, everlasting and unchangeable, will bind
   all nations at all times; and there will be one common Master and Ruler
   of all, even God, the framer, arbitrator, and proposer of this law; and
   he who shall not obey this will flee from himself, and, despising the
   nature of man, will suffer the greatest punishments through this very
   thing, even though he shall have escaped the other punishments which
   are supposed to exist." Who that is acquainted with the mystery of God
   could so significantly relate the law of God, as a man far removed from
   the knowledge of the truth has set forth that law? But I consider that
   they who speak true things unconsciously are to be so regarded as
   though they prophesied [1140] under the influence of some spirit. But
   if he had known or explained this also, in what precepts the law itself
   consisted, as he clearly saw the force and purport of the divine law,
   he would not have discharged the office of a philosopher, but of a
   prophet. And because he was unable to do this, it must be done by us,
   to whom the law itself has been delivered by the one great Master and
   Ruler of all, God.

    Chap. IX.--Of the Law and Precept of God; Of Mercy, and the Error of the
    Philosophers.

   The first head of this law is, to know God Himself, to obey Him alone,
   to worship Him alone. For he cannot maintain the character of a man who
   is ignorant of God, the parent of his soul: which is the greatest
   impiety. For this ignorance causes him to serve other gods, and no
   greater crime than this can be committed. Hence there is now so easy a
   step to wickedness through ignorance of the truth and of the chief
   good; since God, from the knowledge of whom he shrinks, is Himself the
   fountain of goodness. Or if he shall wish to follow the justice of God,
   yet, being ignorant of the divine law, he embraces the laws of his own
   country as true justice, though they were clearly devised not by
   justice, but by utility. For why is it that there are different and
   various laws amongst all people, but that each nation has enacted for
   itself that which it deemed useful for its own affairs? But how greatly
   utility differs from justice the Roman people themselves teach, who, by
   proclaiming war through the Fecials, and by inflicting injuries
   according to legal forms, by always desiring and carrying off the
   property of other, have gained for themselves the possession of the
   whole world. [1141] But these persons think themselves just if they do
   nothing against their own laws; which may be even ascribed to fear, if
   they abstain from crimes through dread of present punishment. But let
   us grant that they do that naturally, or, as the philosopher says, of
   their own accord, which they are compelled to do by the laws. Will they
   therefore be just, because they obey the institutions of men, who may
   themselves have erred, or have been unjust?--as it was with the framers
   of the twelve tables, who certainly promoted the public advantage
   according to the condition of the times. Civil law is one thing, which
   varies everywhere according to customs; but justice is another thing,
   which God has set forth to all as uniform and simple: and he who is
   ignorant of God must also be ignorant of justice.

   But let us suppose it possible that any one, by natural and innate
   goodness, should gain true virtues, such a man as we have heard that
   Cimon was at Athens, who both gave alms to the needy, and entertained
   the poor, and clothed the naked; yet, when that one thing which is of
   the greatest importance is wanting--the acknowledgment of God--then all
   those good things are superfluous and empty, so that in pursuing them
   he has laboured in vain. [1142] For all his justice will resemble a
   human body which has no head, in which, although all the limbs are in
   their proper position, and figure, and proportion, yet, since that is
   wanting which is the chief thing of all, it is destitute both of life
   and of all sensation. Therefore those limbs have only the shape of
   limbs, but admit of no use, as much so as a head without a body; and he
   resembles this who is not without the knowledge of God, but yet lives
   unjustly. For he has that only which is of the greatest importance; but
   he has it to no purpose, since he is destitute of the virtues, as it
   were, of limbs.

   Therefore, that the body may be alive, and capable of sensation, both
   the knowledge of God is necessary, as it were the head, and all the
   virtues, as it were the body. Thus there will exist a perfect and
   living man; but, however, the whole substance is in the head; and
   although this cannot exist in the absence of all, it may exist in the
   absence of some. And it will be an imperfect and faulty animal, but yet
   it will be alive, as he who knows God and yet sins in some respect. For
   God pardons sins. And thus it is possible to live without some of the
   limbs, but it is by no means possible to live without a head. This is
   the reason why the philosophers, though they may be naturally good, yet
   have no knowledge and no intelligence. All their learning and virtue is
   without a head, because they are ignorant of God, who is the Head of
   virtue and knowledge; and he who is ignorant of Him, though he may see,
   is blind; though he may hear, is deaf; though he may speak, is dumb.
   But when he shall know the Creator and Parent of all things, then he
   will both see, and hear, and speak. For he begins to have a head, in
   which all the senses are placed, that is, the eyes, and ears, and
   tongue. For assuredly he sees who has beheld with the eyes of his mind
   the truth in which God is, or God in whom the truth is; he hears, who
   imprints on his heart the divine words and life-giving precepts; he
   speaks, who, in discussing heavenly things, relates the virtue and
   majesty of the surpassing God. Therefore he is undoubtedly impious who
   does not acknowledge God; and all his virtues, which he thinks that he
   has or possesses, are found in that deadly road which belongs
   altogether to darkness. Wherefore there is no reason why any one should
   congratulate himself if he has gained these empty virtues, because he
   is not only wretched who is destitute of present goods, but he must
   also be foolish, since he undertakes the greatest labours in his life
   without any purpose. For if the hope of immortality is taken away,
   which God promises to those who continue in His religion, for the sake
   of obtaining which virtue is to be sought, and whatever evils happen
   are to be endured, it will assuredly be the greatest folly to wish to
   comply with virtues which in vain bring calamities and labours to man.
   For if it is virtue to endure and undergo with fortitude, want, exile,
   pain, and death, which are feared by others, what goodness, I pray, has
   it in itself, that philosophers should say that it is to be sought for
   on its own account? Truly they are delighted with superfluous and
   useless punishments, when it is permitted them to live in tranquillity.

   For if our souls are mortal, if virtue is about to have no existence
   after the dissolution of the body, why do we avoid the goods assigned
   to us, as though we were ungrateful or unworthy of enjoying the divine
   gifts? For, that we may enjoy these blessings, we must live in
   wickedness and impiety, because virtue, that is, justice, is followed
   by poverty. Therefore he is not of sound mind, who, without having any
   greater hope set before him, prefers labours, and tortures, and
   miseries, to those goods which others enjoy in life. [1143] But if
   virtue is to be taken up, as is most rightly said by these, because it
   is evident that man is born to it, it ought to contain some greater
   hope, which may apply a great and illustrious solace for the ills and
   labours which it is the part of virtue to endure. Nor can virtue, since
   it is difficult in itself, be esteemed as a good in any other way than
   by having its hardship compensated by the greatest good. We can in no
   other way equally abstain from these present goods, than if there are
   other greater goods on account of which it is worth while to leave the
   pursuit of pleasures, and to endure all evils. But these are no other,
   as I have shown in the third book, [1144] than the goods of everlasting
   life. Now who can bestow these except God, who has proposed to us
   virtue itself? Therefore the sum and substance of everything is
   contained in the acknowledging and worship of God; all the hope and
   safety of man centres in this; this is the first step of wisdom, to
   know who is our true Father, and to worship Him alone with the piety
   which is due to Him, to obey Him, to yield ourselves to His service
   with the utmost devotedness: let our entire acting, and care, and
   attention, be laid out in gaining His favour. [1145]

    Chap. X.--Of Religion Towards God, and Mercy Towards Men; And of the
    Beginning of the World.

   I have said what is due to God, I will now say what is to be given to
   man; although this very thing which you shall give to man is given to
   God, for man is the image of God. But, however, the first office of
   justice is to be united with God, the second with man. But the former
   is called religion; the second is named mercy or kindness; [1146] which
   virtue is peculiar to the just, and to the worshippers of God, because
   this alone comprises the principle of common life. For God, who has not
   given wisdom to the other animals, has made them more safe from attack
   in danger by natural defences. But because He made him naked and
   defenceless, [1147] that He might rather furnish him with wisdom, He
   gave him, besides other things, this feeling of kindness; [1148] so
   that man should protect, love, and cherish man, and both receive and
   afford assistance against all dangers. Therefore kindness is the
   greatest bond of human society; and he who has broken this is to be
   deemed impious, and a parricide. For if we all derive our origin from
   one man, whom God created, we are plainly of one blood; and therefore
   it must be considered the greatest wickedness to hate a man, even
   though guilty. On which account God has enjoined that enmities are
   never to be contracted by us, but that they are always to be removed,
   so that we soothe those who are our enemies, by reminding them of their
   relationship. Likewise, if we are all inspired and animated by one God,
   what else are we than brothers? And, indeed, the more closely united,
   because we are united in soul rather than in body. [1149] Accordingly
   Lucretius does not err when he says: [1150] "In short, we are all
   sprung from a heavenly seed; all have that same father." Therefore they
   are to be accounted as savage beasts who injure man; who, in opposition
   to every law and right of human nature, plunder, torture, slay, and
   banish.

   On account of this relationship of brotherhood, God teaches us never to
   do evil, but always good. And He also prescribes [1151] in what this
   doing good consists: in affording aid to those who are oppressed and in
   difficulty, and in bestowing food on those who are destitute. For God,
   since He is kind, [1152] wished us to be a social animal. Therefore, in
   the case of other men, we ought to think of ourselves. We do not
   deserve to be set free in our own dangers, if we do not succour others;
   we do not deserve assistance, if we refuse to render it. There are no
   precepts of philosophers to this purport, inasmuch as they, being
   captivated by the appearance of false virtue, have taken away mercy
   from man, and while they wish to heal, have corrupted. [1153] And
   though they generally admit that the mutual participation of human
   society is to be retained, they entirely separate themselves from it by
   the harshness of their inhuman virtue. This error, therefore, is also
   to be refuted, of those who think that nothing is to be bestowed on any
   one. They have introduced not one origin only, and cause of building a
   city; but some relate that those men who were first born from the
   earth, when they passed a wandering life among the woods and plains,
   and were not united by any mutual bond of speech or justice, but had
   leaves and grass for their beds, and caves and grottos for their
   dwellings, were a prey to the beasts and stronger animals. Then, that
   those who had either escaped, having been torn, or had seen their
   neighbours torn, being admonished of their own danger, had recourse to
   other men, implored protection, and at first made their wishes known by
   nods; then that they tried the beginnings of conversation, and by
   attaching names to each object, by degrees completed the system of
   speech. But when they saw that numbers themselves were not safe against
   the beasts, they began also to build towns, either that they might make
   their nightly repose safe, or that they might ward off the incursions
   and attacks of beasts, not by fighting, but by interposing barriers.
   [1154]

   O minds unworthy of men, which produced these foolish trifles! O
   wretched and pitiable men, who committed to writing and handed down to
   memory the record of their own folly; who, when they saw that the plan
   of assembling themselves together, or of mutual intercourse, or of
   avoiding danger, or of guarding against evil, or of preparing for
   themselves sleeping-places and lairs, was natural even to the dumb
   animals, thought, however, that men could not have been admonished and
   learned, except by examples, what they ought to fear, what to avoid,
   and what to do, or that they would never have assembled together, or
   have discovered the method of speech, had not the beasts devoured them!
   These things appeared to others senseless, as they really were; and
   they said that the cause of their coming together was not the tearing
   of wild beasts, but rather the very feeling of humanity itself; and
   that therefore they collected themselves together, because the nature
   of men avoided solitude, and was desirous of communion and society. The
   discrepancy between them is not great; since the causes are different,
   the fact is the same. Each might have been true, because there is no
   direct opposition. But, however, neither is by any means true, because
   men were not born from the ground throughout the world, as though
   sprung from the teeth of some dragon, as the poets relate; but one man
   was formed by God, and from that one man all the earth was filled with
   the human race, in the same way as again took place after the deluge,
   which they certainly cannot deny. [1155] Therefore no assembling
   together of this kind took place at the beginning; and that there were
   never men on the earth who could not speak except those who were
   infants, [1156] every one who is possessed of sense will understand.
   Let us suppose, however, that these things are true which idle and
   foolish old men vainly say, that we may refute them especially by their
   own feelings and arguments.

   If men were collected together on this account, that they might protect
   their weakness by mutual help, therefore we must succour man, who needs
   help. For, since men entered into and contracted fellowship with men
   for the sake of protection, either to violate or not to preserve that
   compact which was entered into among men from the commencement of their
   origin, is to be considered as the greatest impiety. For he who
   withdraws himself from affording assistance must also of necessity
   withdraw himself from receiving it; for he who refuses his aid to
   another thinks that he stands in need of the aid of none. But he who
   withdraws and separates himself from the body [1157] at large, must
   live not after the custom of men, but after the manner of wild beasts.
   But if this cannot be done, the bond of human society is by all means
   to be retained, because man can in no way live without man. But the
   preservation [1158] of society is a mutual sharing of kind offices;
   that is, the affording help, that we may be able to receive it. But if,
   as those others assert, the assembling together of men has been caused
   on account of humanity itself, man ought undoubtedly to recognise man.
   But if those ignorant and as yet uncivilized men did this, and that,
   when the practice of speaking was not yet established, what must we
   think ought to be done by men who are polished, and connected together
   by interchange of conversation and all business, who, being accustomed
   to the society of men, cannot endure solitude?

    Chap. XI.--Of the Persons Upon Whom a Benefit is to Be Conferred.

   Therefore humanity is to be preserved, if we wish rightly to be called
   men. But what else is this preservation of humanity than the loving a
   man because he is a man, and the same as ourselves? Therefore discord
   and dissension are not in accordance with the nature of man; and that
   expression of Cicero is true, which says [1159] that man, while he is
   obedient to nature, cannot injure man. Therefore, if it is contrary to
   nature to injure a man, it must be in accordance with nature to benefit
   a man; and he who does not do this deprives himself of the title of a
   man, because it is the duty of humanity to succour the necessity and
   peril of a man. I ask, therefore, of those who do not think it the part
   of a wise man to be prevailed upon and to pity, If a man were seized by
   some beast, and were to implore the aid of an armed man, whether they
   think that he ought to be succoured or not? They are not so shameless
   as to deny that that ought to be done which humanity demands and
   requires. Also, if any one were surrounded by fire, crushed by the
   downfall of a building, plunged in the sea, or carried away by a river,
   would they think it the duty of a man not to assist him? They
   themselves are not men if they think so; for no one can fail to be
   liable to dangers of this kind. Yes, truly, they will say that it is
   the part of a human being, and of a brave man too, to preserve one who
   was on the point of perishing. If, therefore, in casualties of this
   nature which imperil the life of man, they allow that it is the part of
   humanity to give succour, what reason is there why they should think
   that succour is to be withheld if a man should suffer from hunger,
   thirst, or cold? But though these things are naturally on an equality
   with those accidental circumstances, and need one and the same
   humanity, yet they make a distinction between these things, because
   they measure all things not by the truth itself, but by present
   utility. For they hope that those whom they rescue from peril will make
   a return of the favour to them. But because they do not hope for this
   in the case of the needy, they think that whatever they bestow on men
   of this kind is thrown away. Hence that sentiment of Plautus is
   detestable: [1160] --


   "He deserves ill who gives food to a beggar;

   For that which he gives is thrown away, and

   It lengthens out the life of the other to his misery."

   But perhaps the poet spoke for the actor. [1161]

   What does Marcus Tullius say in his books respecting Offices? Does he
   not also advise that bounty should not be employed at all? For thus he
   speaks: [1162] "Bounty, which proceeds from our estate, drains the very
   source of our liberality; and thus liberality is destroyed by
   liberality: for the more numerous they are towards whom you practice
   it, the less you will be able to practice it towards many." And he also
   says shortly afterwards: "But what is more foolish than so to act that
   you may not be able to continue to do that which you do willingly?"
   This professor of wisdom plainly keeps men back from acts of kindness,
   and advises them carefully to guard their property, and to preserve
   their money-chest in safety, rather than to follow justice. And when he
   perceived that this was inhuman and wicked, soon afterwards, in another
   chapter, as though moved by repentance, he thus spoke: "Sometimes,
   however, we must exercise bounty in giving: nor is this kind of
   liberality altogether to be rejected; and we must give from our
   property to suitable [1163] persons when they are in need of
   assistance." What is the meaning of "suitable?" Assuredly those who are
   able to restore and give back the favour. [1164] If Cicero were now
   alive, I should certainly exclaim: Here, here, Marcus Tullius, you have
   erred from true justice; and you have taken it away by one word, since
   you measured the offices of piety and humanity by utility. For we must
   not bestow our bounty on suitable objects, but as much as possible on
   unsuitable objects. For that will be done with justice, piety, and
   humanity, which you shall do without the hope of any return!

   This is that true and genuine justice, of which you say that you have
   no real and life-like figure. [1165] You yourself exclaim in many
   places that virtue is not mercenary; and you confess in the books of
   your Laws [1166] that liberality is gratuitous, in these words: "Nor is
   it doubtful that he who is called liberal and generous is influenced by
   a sense of duty, and not by advantage." Why therefore do you bestow
   your bounty on suitable persons, unless it be that you may afterwards
   receive a reward? With you, therefore, as the author and teacher of
   justice, whosoever shall not be a suitable person will be worn out with
   nakedness, thirst, and hunger; nor will men who are rich and abundantly
   supplied, even to luxuriousness, assist his last extremity. If virtue
   does not exact a reward; if, as you say, it is to be sought on its own
   account, then estimate justice, which is the mother and chief of the
   virtues, at its own price, and not according to your advantage: give
   especially to him from whom you hope for nothing in return. Why do you
   select persons? Why do you look at bodily forms? He is to be esteemed
   by you as a man, whoever it is that implores you, because he considers
   you a man. Cast away those outlines and sketches of justice, and hold
   fast justice itself, true and fashioned to the life. Be bountiful to
   the blind, the feeble, the lame, the destitute, who must die unless you
   bestow your bounty upon them. They are useless to men, but they are
   serviceable to God, who retains them in life, who endues them with
   breath, who vouchsafes to them the light. Cherish as far as in you
   lies, and support with kindness, the lives of men, that they may not be
   extinguished. He who is able to succour one on the point of perishing,
   if he fails to do so, kills him. But they, because they neither retain
   their nature, nor know what reward there is in this, while they fear to
   lose, do lose, and fall into that which they chiefly guard against; so
   that whatever they bestow is either lost altogether, or profits only
   for the briefest time. For they who refuse a small gift to the
   wretched, who wish to preserve humanity without any loss to themselves,
   squander their property, so that they either acquire for themselves
   frail and perishable things, or they certainly gain nothing by their
   own great loss.

   For what must be said of those who, induced by the vanity of popular
   favour, [1167] expend on the exhibition of shows wealth that would be
   sufficient even for great cities? Must we not say that they are
   senseless and mad who bestow upon the people that which is both lost to
   themselves, and which none of those on whom it is bestowed receives?
   Therefore, as all pleasure is short and perishable, and especially that
   of the eyes and ears, men either forget and are ungrateful for the
   expenses incurred by another, or they are even offended if the caprice
   of the people is not satisfied: so that most foolish men have even
   acquired evil for themselves by evil; or if they have thus succeeded in
   pleasing, they gain nothing more than empty favour and the talk [1168]
   of a few days. Thus every day the estates of most trifling men are
   expended on superfluous matters. Do they then act more wisely who
   exhibit to their fellow-citizens more useful and lasting gifts? They,
   for instance, who by the building of public works seek a lasting memory
   for their name? Not even do they act rightly in burying their property
   in the earth; because the remembrance of them neither bestows anything
   upon the dead, nor are their works eternal, inasmuch as they are either
   thrown down and destroyed by a single earthquake, or are consumed by an
   accidental fire, or they are over through by some attack of an enemy,
   or at any rate they decay and fall to pieces by mere length of time.
   For there is nothing, as the orator says, [1169] made by the work of
   man's hand which length of time does not weaken and destroy. But this
   justice of which we speak, and mercy, flourish more every day. They
   therefore act better who bestow their bounty on their tribesmen and
   clients, for they bestow something on men, and profit them; but that is
   not true and just bounty, for there is no conferring of a benefit where
   there is no necessity. Therefore, whatever is given to those who are
   not in need, for the sake of popularity, is thrown away; or it is
   repaid with interest, and thus it will not be the conferring of a
   benefit. And although it is pleasing to those to whom it is given,
   still it is not just, because if it is not done, no evil follows.
   Therefore the only sure and true office of liberality is to support the
   needy and unserviceable.

    Chap. XII.--Of the Kinds of Beneficence, and Works of Mercy.

   This is that perfect justice which protects human society, concerning
   which philosophers speak. This is the chief and truest advantage of
   riches; not to use wealth for the particular pleasure of an individual,
   but for the welfare of many; not for one's own immediate enjoyment, but
   for justice, which alone does not perish. We must therefore by all
   means keep in mind, that the hope of receiving in return must be
   altogether absent from the duty of showing mercy: for the reward of
   this work and duty must be expected from God alone; for if you should
   expect it from man, then that will not be kindness, but the lending of
   a benefit at interest; [1170] nor can he seem to have deserved well who
   affords that which he does, not to another, but to himself. And yet the
   matter comes to this, that whatever a man has bestowed upon another,
   hoping for no advantage from him, he really bestows upon himself, for
   he will receive a reward from God. God has also enjoined, that if at
   any time we make a feast, we should invite to the entertainment those
   who cannot invite us in return, and thus make us a recompense, so that
   no action of our life should be without the exercise of mercy. Nor,
   however, let any one think that he is debarred from intercourse with
   his friends or kindness with his neighbours. But God has made known to
   us what is our true and just work: we ought thus to live with our
   neighbours, provided that we know that the one manner of living relates
   to man, the other to God. [1171]

   Therefore hospitality is a principal virtue, as the philosophers also
   say; but they turn it aside from true justice, and forcibly apply
   [1172] it to advantage. Cicero says: [1173] "Hospitality was rightly
   praised by Theophrastus. For (as it appears to me) it is highly
   becoming that the houses of illustrious men should be open to
   illustrious guests." He has here committed the same error which he then
   did, when he said that we must bestow our bounty on "suitable" persons.
   For the house of a just and wise man ought not to be open to the
   illustrious, but to the lowly and abject. For those illustrious and
   powerful men cannot be in want of anything, since they are sufficiently
   protected and honoured by their own opulence. But nothing is to be done
   by a just man except that which is a benefit. But if the benefit is
   returned, it is destroyed and brought to an end; for we cannot possess
   in its completeness that for which a price has been paid to us.
   Therefore the principle of justice is employed about those benefits
   which have remained safe and uncorrupted; but they cannot thus remain
   by any other means than if they are be stowed upon those men who can in
   no way profit us. But in receiving illustrious men, he looked to
   nothing else but utility; nor did the ingenious man conceal what
   advantage he hoped from it. For he says that he who does that will
   become powerful among foreigners by the favour of the leading men, whom
   he will have bound to himself by the right of hospitality and
   friendship. O by how many arguments might the inconsistency of Cicero
   be proved, if this were my object! Nor would he be convicted so much by
   my words as by his own. For he also says, that the more any one refers
   all his actions to his own advantage, the less he is a good man. He
   also says, that it is not the part of a simple and open man to
   ingratiate himself in the favour of others, [1174] to pretend and
   allege anything, to appear to be doing one thing when he is doing
   another, to feign that he is bestowing upon another that which he is
   bestowing upon himself; but that this is rather the part of one who is
   designing [1175] and crafty, deceitful and treacherous. But how could
   he maintain that that ambitious hospitality was not evil intention?
   [1176] "Do you run round through all the gates, that you may invite to
   your house the chief men of the nations and cities as they arrive, that
   by their means you may acquire influence with their citizens; and wish
   yourself to be called just, and kind, and hospitable, though you are
   studying to promote your own advantage?" But did he not say this rather
   incautiously? For what is less suitable for Cicero? But through his
   ignorance of true justice he knowingly and with foresight fell into
   this snare. And that he might be pardoned for this, he testified that
   he does not give precepts with reference to true justice, which he does
   not hold, but with reference to a sketch and outline of justice.
   Therefore we must pardon this teacher who uses sketches and outlines,
   [1177] nor must we require the truth from him who admits that he is
   ignorant of it.

   The ransoming of captives is a great and noble exercise of justice, of
   which the same Tullius also approved. [1178] "And this liberality," he
   says, "is serviceable even to the state, that captives should be
   ransomed from slavery, and that those of slender resources should be
   provided for. And I greatly prefer this practice of liberality to
   lavish expenditure on shows. This is the part of great and eminent
   men." Therefore it is the appropriate work of the just to support the
   poor and to ransom captives, since among the unjust if any do these
   things they are called great and eminent. For it is deserving of the
   greatest praise for those to confer benefit from whom no one expected
   such conduct. For he who does good to a relative, or neighbour, or
   friend, either deserves no praise, or certainly no great praise,
   because he is bound to do it, and he would be impious and detestable if
   he did not do that which both nature itself and relationship require;
   and if he does it, he does it not so much for the sake of obtaining
   glory as of avoiding censure. But he who does it to a stranger and an
   unknown person, he truly is worthy of praise, because he was led to do
   it by kindness only. Justice therefore exists there, where there is no
   obligation of necessity for conferring a benefit. He ought not
   therefore to have preferred this duty of generosity to expenditure on
   shows; for this is the part of one making a comparison, and of two
   goods choosing that which is the better. For that profusion of men
   throwing away their property into the sea is vain and trifling, and
   very far removed from all justice. Therefore they are not even to be
   called gifts, [1179] in which no one receives but he who does not
   deserve to receive.

   Nor is it less a great work of justice to protect and defend orphans
   and widows who are destitute and stand in need of assistance; and
   therefore that divine law prescribes this to all, since all good judges
   deem that it belongs to their office to favour them with natural
   kindness, and to strive to benefit them. But these works are especially
   ours, since we have received the law, and the words of God Himself
   giving us instructions. For they perceive that it is naturally just to
   protect those who need protection, but they do not perceive why it is
   so. For God, to whom everlasting mercy belongs, on this account
   commands that widows and orphans should be defended and cherished, that
   no one through regard and pity for his pledges [1180] should be
   prevented from undergoing death in behalf of justice and faith, but
   should encounter it with promptitude and boldness, since he knows that
   he leaves his beloved ones to the care of God, and that they will never
   want protection. Also to undertake the care and support of the sick,
   who need some one to assist them, is the part of the greatest kindness,
   and of great beneficence; [1181] and he who shall do this will both
   gain a living sacrifice to God, and that which he has given to another
   for a time he will himself receive from God for eternity. The last and
   greatest office of piety is the burying of strangers and the poor;
   which subject those teachers of virtue and justice have not touched
   upon at all. For they were unable to see this, who measured all their
   duties by utility. For in the other things which have been mentioned
   above, although they did not keep the true path, yet, since they
   discovered some advantage in these things, retained as it were by a
   kind of inkling [1182] of the truth, they wandered to a less distance;
   but they abandoned this because they were unable to see any advantage
   in it.

   Moreover, there have not been wanting those who esteemed burial as
   superfluous, and said that it was no evil to lie unburied and
   neglected; but their impious wisdom is rejected alike by the whole
   human race, and by the divine expressions which command the performance
   of the rite. [1183] But they do not venture to say that it ought not to
   be done, but that, if it happens to be omitted, no inconvenience is the
   result. Therefore in that matter they discharge the office, not so much
   of those who give precepts, as of those who suggest consolation, that
   if this shall by chance have occurred to a wise man, he should not deem
   himself wretched on this account. But we do not speak of that which
   ought to be endured by a wise man, but of that which he himself ought
   to do. Therefore we do not now inquire whether the whole system of
   burial is serviceable or not; but this, even though it be useless, as
   they imagine, must nevertheless be practised, even on this account
   only, that it appears among men to be done rightly and kindly. For it
   is the feeling which is inquired into, and it is the purpose which is
   weighed. Therefore we will not suffer the image and workmanship of God
   to lie exposed as a prey to beasts and birds, but we will restore it to
   the earth, from which it had its origin; and although it be in the case
   of an unknown man, we will fulfil the office of relatives, into whose
   place, since they are wanting, let kindness succeed; and wherever there
   shall be need of man, there we will think that our duty is required.
   [1184] But in what does the nature of justice more consist than in our
   affording to strangers through kindness, that which we render to our
   own relatives through affection? And this kindness is much more sure
   and just when it is now afforded, not to the man who is insensible, but
   to God alone, to whom a just work is a most acceptable sacrifice. Some
   one will perhaps say: If I shall do all these things, I shall have no
   possessions. For what if a great number of men shall be in want, shall
   suffer cold, shall be taken captive, shall die, since one who acts thus
   must deprive himself of his property even in a single day, shall I
   throw away the estate acquired by my own labour or by that of my
   ancestors, so that after this I myself must live by the pity of others?

   Why do you so pusillanimously fear poverty, which even your
   philosophers praise, and bear witness that nothing is safer and nothing
   more calm than this? That which you fear is a haven against anxieties.
   Do you not know to how many dangers, to how many accidents, you are
   exposed with these evil resources? These will treat you well if they
   shall pass without your bloodshed. But you walk about laden with booty,
   and you bear spoils which may excite the minds even of your own
   relatives. Why, then, do you hesitate to lay that out well which
   perhaps a single robbery will snatch away from you, or a proscription
   suddenly arising, or the plundering of an enemy? Why do you fear to
   make a frail and perishable good everlasting, or to entrust your
   treasures to God as their preserver, in which case you need not fear
   thief and robber, nor rust, nor tyrant? He who is rich towards God can
   never be poor. [1185] If you esteem justice so highly, lay aside the
   burthens which press you, and follow it; free yourself from fetters and
   chains, that you may run to God without any impediment. It is the part
   of a great and lofty mind to despise and trample upon mortal affairs.
   But if you do not comprehend this virtue, that you may bestow your
   riches upon the altar [1186] of God, in order that you may provide for
   yourself firmer possessions than these frail ones, I will free you from
   fear. All these precepts are not given to you alone, but to all the
   people who are united in mind, and hold together as one man. If you are
   not adequate to the performance of great works alone, cultivate justice
   with all your power, in such a manner, however, that you may excel
   others in work as much as you excel them in riches. And do not think
   that you are advised to lessen or exhaust your property; but that which
   you would have expended on superfluities, turn to better uses. Devote
   to the ransoming of captives that from which you purchase beasts;
   maintain the poor with that from which you feed wild beasts; bury the
   innocent dead with that from which you provide men for the sword.
   [1187] What does it profit to enrich men of abandoned wickedness, who
   fight with beasts, [1188] and to equip them for crimes? Transfer things
   about to be miserably thrown away to the great sacrifice, that in
   return for these true gifts you may have an everlasting gift from God.
   Mercy has a great reward; for God promises it, that He will remit all
   sins. If you shall hear, He says, the prayers of your suppliant, I also
   will hear yours; if you shall pity those in distress, I also will pity
   you in your distress. But if you shall not regard nor assist them, I
   also will bear a mind like your own against you, and I will judge you
   by your own laws. [1189]

    Chap. XIII.--Of Repentance, of Mercy, and the Forgiveness of Sins.

   As often, therefore, as you are asked for aid, believe that you are
   tried by God, that it may be seen whether you are worthy of being
   heard. Examine your own conscience, and, as far as you are able, heal
   your wounds. Nor, however, because offences are removed by bounty,
   think that a licence is given you for sinning. For they are done away
   with, if you are bountiful to God because you have sinned; for if you
   sin through reliance on your bounty, they are not done away with. For
   God especially desires that men shall be cleansed from their sins, and
   therefore He commands them to repent. But to repent is nothing else
   than to profess and to affirm that one will sin no more. Therefore they
   are pardoned who unawares and incautiously glide into sin; he who sins
   wilfully has no pardon. Nor, however, if any one shall have been
   purified from all stain of sin, let him think that he may abstain from
   the work of bounty because he has no faults to blot out. Nay, in truth,
   he is then more bound to exercise justice when he is become just, so
   that that which he had before done for the healing of his wounds he may
   afterwards do for the praise and glory of virtue. To this is added,
   that no one can be without fault as long as he is burthened with a
   covering of flesh, the infirmity of which is subject to the dominion of
   sin in a threefold manner--in deeds, in words, and thoughts.

   By these steps justice advances to the greatest height. The first step
   of virtue is to abstain from evil works; the second, to abstain also
   from evil words; the third, to abstain even from the thoughts of evil
   things. He who ascends the first step is sufficiently just; he who
   ascends the second is now of perfect virtue, since he offends neither
   in deeds nor in conversation; [1190] he who ascends the third appears
   truly to have attained the likeness of God. For it is almost beyond the
   measure of man not even to admit to the thought [1191] that which is
   either bad in action or improper in speech. Therefore even just men,
   who can refrain from every unjust work, are sometimes, however,
   overcome by frailty itself, so that they either speak evil in anger,
   or, at the sight of delightful things, they desire them with silent
   thought. But if the condition of mortality does not suffer a man to be
   pure from every stain, the faults of the flesh ought therefore to be
   done away with by continual bounty. For it is the single work of a man
   who is wise, and just, and worthy of life, to lay out his riches on
   justice alone; for assuredly he who is without this, although he should
   surpass Croesus or Crassus in riches, is to be esteemed as poor, as
   naked, as a beggar. Therefore we must use our efforts that we may be
   clothed with the garment of justice and piety, of which no one may
   deprive us, which may furnish us with an everlasting ornament. For if
   the worshippers of gods adore senseless images, and bestow upon them
   whatever they have which is precious, though they can neither make use
   of them nor give thanks because they have received them, how much more
   just and true is it to reverence the living images of God, that you may
   gain the favour of the living God! For as these make use of what they
   have received, and give thanks, so God, in whose sight you shall have
   done that which is good, will both approve of it and reward your piety.

    Chap. XIV.--Of the Affections, and the Opinion of the Stoics Respecting
    Them; And of Virtue, the Vices, and Mercy.

   If, therefore, mercy is a distinguished and excellent gift in man, and
   that is judged to be very good by the consent both of the good and the
   evil, it appears that philosophers were far distant from the good of
   man, who neither enjoined nor practised anything of this kind, but
   always esteemed as a vice that virtue which almost holds the first
   place in man. It pleases me here to bring forward one subject of
   philosophy, that we may more fully refute the errors of those who call
   mercy, desire, and fear, diseases of the soul. They indeed attempt to
   distinguish virtues from vices, which is truly a very easy matter. For
   who cannot distinguish a liberal man from one who is prodigal (as they
   do), or a frugal man from one who is mean, or a calm man from one who
   is slothful, or a cautious man from one who is timid? Because these
   things which are good have their limits, and if they shall exceed these
   limits, fall into vices; so that constancy, unless it is undertaken for
   the truth, becomes shamelessness. In like manner, bravery, if it shall
   undergo certain danger, without the compulsion of any necessity, or not
   for an honourable cause, is changed into rashness. Freedom of speech
   also, if it attack others rather than oppose those who attack it, is
   obstinacy. Severity also, unless it restrain itself within the
   befitting punishments of the guilty, becomes savage cruelty.

   Therefore they say, that those who appear evil do not sin of their own
   accord, or choose evils by preference, but that, erring [1192] through
   the appearance of good, they fall into evils, while they are ignorant
   of the distinction between good things and evil. These things are not
   indeed false, but they are all referred to the body. For to be frugal,
   or constant, or cautious, or calm, or grave, or severe, are virtues
   indeed, but virtues which relate to this short [1193] life. But we who
   despise this life have other virtues set before us, respecting which
   philosophers could not by any means even conjecture. Therefore they
   regarded certain virtues as vices, and certain vices as virtues. For
   the Stoics take away from man all the affections, by the impulse of
   which the soul is moved--desire, joy, fear, sorrow: the two former of
   which arise from good things, either future or present; the latter from
   evil things. In the same manner, they call these four (as I said)
   diseases, not so much inserted in us by nature as undertaken through a
   perverted opinion; and therefore they think that these can be
   eradicated, if the false notion of good and evil things is taken away.
   For if the wise man thinks nothing good or evil, he will neither be
   inflamed with desire, nor be transported with joy, nor be alarmed with
   fear, nor suffer his spirits to droop [1194] through sadness. We shall
   presently see whether they effect that which they wish, or what it is
   which they do effect: in the meantime their purpose is arrogant and
   almost mad, who think that they apply a remedy, and that they are able
   to strive in opposition to the force and system of nature.

    Chap. XV.--Of the Affections, and the Opinion of the Peripatetics Respecting
    Them.

   For, that these things are natural and not voluntary, the nature of all
   living beings shows, which is moved by all these affections. Therefore
   the Peripatetics act better, who say that all these cannot be taken
   from us, because they were born with us; and they endeavour to show how
   providently and how necessarily God, or nature (for so they term it),
   armed us with these affections; which, however, because they generally
   become vicious if they are in excess, can be advantageously regulated
   by man,--a limit being applied, so that there may be left to man as
   much as is sufficient for nature. Not an unwise disputation, if, as I
   said, all things were not referred to this life. The Stoics therefore
   are mad who do not regulate but cut them out, and wish by some means or
   other to deprive man of powers implanted in him by nature. And this is
   equivalent to a desire of taking away timidity from stags, or poison
   from serpents, or rage from wild beasts, or gentleness from cattle. For
   those qualities which have been given separately to dumb animals, are
   altogether given to man at the same time. But if, as physicians affirm,
   the affection of joy has its seat in the spleen, [1195] that of anger
   in the gall, of desire in the liver, of fear in the heart, it is easier
   to kill the animal itself than to tear anything from the body; for this
   is to wish to change the nature of the living creature. But the skilful
   men do not understand that when they take away vices from man, they
   also take away virtue, for which alone they are making a place. For if
   it is virtue in the midst of the impetuosity of anger to restrain and
   check oneself, which they cannot deny, then he who is without anger is
   also without virtue. If it is virtue to control the lust of the body,
   he must be free from virtue who has no lust which he may regulate. If
   it is virtue to curb the desire from coveting that which belongs to
   another, he certainly can have no virtue who is without that, to the
   restraining of which the exercise of virtue is applied. Where,
   therefore, there are no vices, there is no place even for virtue, as
   there is no place for victory where there is no adversary. And so it
   comes to pass that there can be no good in this life without evil. An
   affection therefore is a kind of natural fruitfulness [1196] of the
   powers of the mind. For as a field which is naturally fruitful produces
   an abundant crop of briars, [1197] so the mind which is uncultivated is
   overgrown with vices flourishing of their own accord, as with thorns.
   But when the true cultivator has applied himself, immediately vices
   give way, and the fruits of virtues spring up.

   Therefore God, when He first made man, with wonderful foresight first
   implanted in him these emotions of the mind, that he might be capable
   of receiving virtue, as the earth is of cultivation; and He placed the
   subject-matter of vices in the affections, and that of virtue in vices.
   For assuredly virtue will have no existence, or not be in exercise, if
   those things are wanting by which its power is either shown or exists.
   Now let us see what they have effected who altogether removes vices.
   With regard to those four affections [1198] which they imagine to arise
   from the opinion of things good and evil, by the eradication of which
   they think that the mind of the wise man is to be healed, since they
   understand that they are implanted by nature, and that without these
   nothing can be put in motion, nothing be done, they put certain other
   things into their place and room: for desire they substitute
   inclination, as though it were not much better to desire a good than to
   feel inclination for it; they in like manner substitute for joy
   gladness, and for fear caution. But in the case of the fourth they are
   at a loss for a method of exchanging the name. Therefore they have
   altogether taken away grief, that is, sadness and pain of mind, which
   cannot possibly be done. For who can fail to be grieved if pestilence
   has desolated his country, or an enemy overthrown it, or a tyrant
   crushed its liberty? Can any one fail to be grieved if he has beheld
   the overthrow of liberty, [1199] and the banishment or most cruel
   slaughter of neighbours, friends, or good men?--unless the mind of any
   one should be so struck with astonishment that all sensibility should
   be taken from him. Wherefore they ought either to have taken away the
   whole, or this defective [1200] and weak discussion ought to have been
   completed; that is, something ought to have been substituted in the
   place of grief, since, the former ones having been so arranged, this
   naturally followed.

   For as we rejoice in good things that are present, so we are vexed and
   grieved with evil things. If, therefore, they gave another name to joy
   because they thought it vicious, so it was befitting that another name
   should be given to grief because they thought it also vicious. From
   which it appears that it was not the object itself which was wanting to
   them, but a word, through want of which they wished, contrary to what
   nature allowed, to take away that affection which is the greatest. For
   I could have refuted those changes of names at greater length, and have
   shown that many names are attached to the same objects, for the sake of
   embellishing the style and increasing its copiousness, or at any rate
   that they do not greatly differ from one another. For both desire takes
   its beginning from the inclination, and caution arises from fear, and
   joy is nothing else than the expression of gladness. But let us suppose
   that they are different, as they themselves will have it. Accordingly
   they will say that desire is continued and perpetual inclination, but
   that joy is gladness bearing itself immoderately; and that fear is
   caution in excess, and passing the limits of moderation. Thus it comes
   to pass, that they do not take away those things which they think ought
   to be taken away, but regulate them, since the names only are changed,
   the things themselves remain. They therefore return unawares to that
   point at which the Peripatetics arrive by argument, that vices, since
   they cannot be taken away, are to be regulated with moderation.
   Therefore they err, because they do not succeed in effecting that which
   they aim at, and by a circuitous route, which is long and rough, they
   return to the same path.

    Chap. XVI.--Of the Affections, and the Refutation of the Opinion of the
    Peripatetics Concerning Them; What is the Proper Use of the Affections, and
    What is a Bad Use of Them.

   But I think that the Peripatetics did not even approach the truth, who
   allow that they are vices, but regulate them with moderation. For we
   must be free even from moderate vices; yea, rather, it ought to have
   been at first effected that there should be no vices. For nothing can
   be born vicious; [1201] but if we make a bad use of the affections they
   become vices, if we use them well they become virtues. Then it must be
   shown that the causes of the affections, and not the affections
   themselves, must be moderated. We must not, they say, rejoice with
   excessive joy, but moderately and temperately. This is as though they
   should say that we must not run swiftly, but walk quietly. But it is
   possible that he who walks may err, and that he who runs may keep the
   right path. What if I show that there is a case in which it is vicious
   not only to rejoice moderately, but even in the smallest degree; and
   that there is another case, on the contrary, in which even to exult
   with transports of joy is by no means faulty? What then, I pray, will
   this mediocrity profit us? I ask whether they think that a wise man
   ought to rejoice if he sees any evil happening to his enemy; or whether
   he ought to curb his joy, if by the conquest of enemies, or the
   overthrow of a tyrant, liberty and safety have been acquired by his
   countrymen. [1202]

   No one doubts but that in the former case to rejoice a little, and in
   the latter to rejoice too little, is a very great crime. We may say the
   same respecting the other affections. But, as I have said, the object
   of wisdom does not consist in the regulation of these, but of their
   causes, since they are acted upon from without; nor was it befitting
   that these themselves should be restrained; since they may exist in a
   small degree with the greatest criminality, and in the greatest degree
   without any criminality. But they ought to have been assigned to fixed
   times, and circumstances, and places, that they may not be vices, when
   it is permitted us to make a right use of them. For as to walk in the
   right course is good, but to wander from it is evil, so to be moved by
   the affections to that which is right is good, but to that which is
   corrupt is evil. For sensual desire, if it does not wander from its
   lawful object, although it be ardent, yet is without fault. But if it
   desires an unlawful object, although it be moderate, yet it is a great
   vice. Therefore it is not a disease to be angry, nor to desire, nor to
   be excited by lust; but to be passionate, to be covetous or licentious,
   is a disease. For he who is passionate is angry even with him with whom
   he ought not to be angry or at times when he ought not. He who is
   covetous desires even that which is unnecessary. He who is licentious
   pursues even that which is forbidden by the laws. The whole matter
   ought to have turned on this, that since the impetuosity of these
   things cannot be restrained, nor is it right that it should be, because
   it is necessarily implanted for maintaining the duties of life, it
   might rather be directed into the right way, where it may be possible
   even to run without stumbling and danger.

    Chap. XVII.--Of the Affections and Their Use; Of Patience, and the Chief
    Good of Christians.

   But I have been carried too far in my desire of refuting them; since it
   is my purpose to show that those things which the philosophers thought
   to be vices, are so far from being vices, that they are even great
   virtues. Of others, I will take, for the sake of instruction, those
   which I think to be most closely related to the subject. They regard
   dread or fear as a very great vice, and think that it is a very great
   weakness of mind; the opposite to which is bravery: and if this exists
   in a man, they say that there is no place for fear. Does any one then
   believe that it can possibly happen that this same fear is the highest
   fortitude? By no means. For nature does not appear to admit that
   anything should fall back to its contrary. But yet I, not by any
   skilful conclusion, as Socrates does in the writings of Plato, who
   compels those against whom he disputes to admit those things which they
   had denied, but in a simple manner, will show that the greatest fear is
   the greatest virtue. No one doubts but that it is the part of a timid
   and feeble mind either to fear pain, or want, or exile, or
   imprisonment, or death; and if any one does not dread all these, he is
   judged a man of the greatest fortitude. But he who fears God is free
   from the fear of all these things. In proof of which, there is no need
   of arguments: for the punishments inflicted on the worshippers of God
   have been witnessed at all times, and are still witnessed through the
   world, in the tormenting of whom new and unusual tortures have been
   devised. For the mind shrinks from the recollection of various kinds of
   death, when the butchery of savage monsters has raged even beyond death
   itself. But a happy and unconquered patience endured these execrable
   lacerations of their bodies without a groan. This virtue afforded the
   greatest astonishment to all people and provinces, and to the torturers
   themselves, when cruelty was overcome by patience. But this virtue was
   caused by nothing else than the fear of God. Therefore (as I said) fear
   is not to be uprooted, as the Stoics maintain, nor to be restrained, as
   the Peripatetics wish, but to be directed into the right way; and
   apprehensions are to be taken away, but so that this one only may be
   left: for since this is the only lawful and true one, it alone effects
   that all other things may not be feared. Desire also is reckoned among
   vices; but if it desires those things which are of the earth, it is a
   vice; on the other hand, if it desires heavenly things, it is a virtue.
   For he who desires to obtain justice, God, perpetual life, everlasting
   light, and all those things which God promises to man, will despise
   these riches, and honours, and commands, and kingdoms themselves.

   The Stoic will perhaps say that inclination is necessary for the
   attainment of these things, and not desire; but, in truth, the
   inclination is not sufficient. For many have the inclination; but when
   pain has approached the vitals, inclination gives way, but desire
   perseveres: and if it effects that all things which are sought by
   others are objects of contempt to him, it is the greatest virtue, since
   it is the mother of self-restraint. And therefore we ought rather to
   effect this, that we may rightly direct the affections, a corrupt use
   of which is vice. For these excitements of the mind resemble a
   harnessed chariot, in the right management of which the chief duty of
   the driver is to know the way; and if he shall keep to this, with
   whatever swiftness he may go, he will not strike against an obstacle.
   But if he shall wander from the course, although he may go calmly and
   gently, he will either be shaken over rough places, or will glide over
   precipices, or at any rate will be carried where he does not need to
   go. So that chariot of life which is led by the affections as though by
   swift horses, if it keeps the right way, will discharge its duty.
   Dread, therefore, and desire, if they are cast down to the earth, will
   become vices, but they will be virtues if they are referred to divine
   things. On the other hand, they esteem parsimony as a virtue; which, if
   it is eagerness for possessing, cannot be a virtue, because it is
   altogether employed in the increase or preservation of earthly goods.
   But we do not refer the chief good to the body, but we measure every
   duty by the preservation of the soul only. But if, as I have before
   taught, we must by no means spare our property that we may preserve
   kindness and justice, it is not a virtue to be frugal; which name
   beguiles and deceives under the appearance of virtue. For frugality is,
   it is true, the abstaining from pleasures; but in this respect it is a
   vice, because it arises from the love of possessing, whereas we ought
   both to abstain from pleasures, and by no means to withhold money. For
   to use money sparingly, that is, moderately, is a kind of weakness of
   mind, either of one fearing lest he should be in want, or of one
   despairing of being able to recover it, or of one incapable of the
   contempt of earthly things. But, on the other hand, they call him who
   is not sparing of his property prodigal. For thus they distinguish
   between the liberal man and the prodigal: that he is liberal who
   bestows on deserving objects, and on proper occasions, and in
   sufficient quantities; but that he is prodigal who lavishes on
   undeserving objects, and when there is no need, and without any regard
   to his property.

   What then? shall we call him prodigal who through pity gives food to
   the needy? But it makes a great difference, whether on account of lust
   you bestow your money on harlots, or on account of benevolence on the
   wretched; whether profligates, gamesters, and pimps squander your
   money, or you bestow it on piety and God; whether you expend it upon
   your own appetite, [1203] or lay it up in the treasury of justice. As,
   therefore, it is a vice to lay it out badly, so it is a virtue to lay
   it out well. If it is a virtue not to be sparing of riches, which can
   be replaced, that you may support the life of man, which cannot be
   replaced; then parsimony is a vice. Therefore I can call them by no
   other name than mad, who deprive man, a mild and sociable animal, of
   his name; who, having uprooted the affections, in which humanity
   altogether consists, wish to bring him to an immoveable insensibility
   of mind, while they desire to free the soul from perturbations, and, as
   they themselves say, to render it calm and tranquil; which is not only
   impossible, because its force and nature consist in motion, but it
   ought not even to be so. For as water which is always still and
   motionless is unwholesome and more muddy, so the soul which is unmoved
   and torpid is useless even to itself: nor will it be able to maintain
   life itself; for it will neither do nor think anything, since thought
   itself is nothing less than agitation of the mind. In fine, they who
   assert this immoveableness of the soul wish to deprive the soul of
   life; for life is full of activity, but death is quiet. They also
   rightly esteem some things as virtues, but they do not maintain their
   due proportion. [1204]

   Constancy is a virtue; not that we resist those who injure us, for we
   must yield to these; and why this ought to be done I will show
   presently: but that when men command us to act in opposition to the law
   of God, and in opposition to justice, we should be deterred by no
   threats or punishments from preferring the command of God to the
   command of man. Likewise it is a virtue to despise death; not that we
   seek it, and of our own accord inflict it upon ourselves, as many and
   distinguished philosophers have often done, which is a wicked and
   impious thing; but that when compelled to desert God, and to betray our
   faith, we should prefer to undergo death, and should defend our liberty
   against the foolish and senseless violence of those who cannot govern
   themselves, and with fortitude of spirit we should challenge all the
   threats and terrors of the world. Thus with lofty and invincible mind
   we trample upon those things which others fear--pain and death. This is
   virtue; this is true constancy--to be maintained and preserved in this
   one thing alone, that no terror and no violence may be able to turn us
   away from God. Therefore that is a true sentiment of Cicero: [1205] "No
   one," he says, "can be just who fears death, or pain, or exile, or
   want." Also of Seneca, who says, in his books of moral philosophy:
   "This is that virtuous man, not distinguished by a diadem or purple, or
   the attendance of lictors, but in no respect inferior, who, when he
   sees death at hand, is not so disturbed as though he saw a fresh
   object; who, whether torments are to be suffered by his whole body, or
   a flame is to be seized by his mouth, or his hands are to be stretched
   out on the cross, [1206] does not inquire what he suffers, but how
   well." But he who worships God suffers these things without fear.
   Therefore he is just. By these things it is effected, that he cannot
   know or maintain at all either the virtues or the exact limits of the
   virtues, whoever is estranged from the religion of the one God.

    Chap. XVIII.--Of Some Commands of God, and of Patience.

   But let us leave the philosophers, who either know nothing at all, and
   hold forth this very ignorance as the greatest knowledge; or who,
   inasmuch as they think they know that of which they are ignorant, are
   absurdly and arrogantly foolish. Let us therefore (that we may return
   to our purpose), to whom alone the truth has been revealed by God, and
   wisdom has been sent from heaven, practice those things which God who
   enlightens us commands: let us sustain and endure the labours of life,
   by mutual assistance towards each other; nor, however, if we shall have
   done any good work, let us aim at glory from it. For God admonishes us
   that the doer of justice ought not to be boastful, lest he should
   appear to have discharged the duties of benevolence, not so much from a
   desire of obeying the divine commands, as of pleasing men, and should
   already have the reward of glory which he has aimed at, and should not
   receive the recompense of that heavenly and divine reward. The other
   things which the worshipper of God ought to observe are easy, when
   these virtues are comprehended, that no one should ever speak falsely
   for the sake of deceiving or injuring. For it is unlawful for him who
   cultivates truth to be deceitful in anything, and to depart from the
   truth itself which he follows. In this path of justice and all the
   virtues there is no place for falsehood. Therefore the true and just
   traveller will not use the saying of Lucilius: [1207] --


   "It is not for me to speak falsely to a man who is a friend and
   acquaintance;"

   but he will think that it is not his part to speak falsely even to an
   enemy and a stranger; nor will he at any time so act, that his tongue,
   which is the interpreter of his mind, should be at variance with his
   feeling and thought. If he shall have lent any money, he will not
   receive interest, that the benefit may be unimpaired which succours
   necessity, and that he may entirely abstain from the property of
   another. For in this kind of duty he ought to be content with that
   which is his own; since it is his duty in other respects not to be
   sparing of his property, in order that he may do good; but to receive
   more than he has given is unjust. And he who does this lies in wait in
   some manner, that he may gain booty from the necessity of another.

   But the just man will omit no opportunity of doing anything mercifully:
   nor will he pollute himself with gain of this kind; but he will so act
   that without any loss to himself, that which he lends may be reckoned
   among his good works. He must not receive a gift from a poor man; so
   that if he himself has afforded anything, it may be good, inasmuch as
   it is gratuitous. If any one reviles, he must answer him with a
   blessing; [1208] he himself must never revile, that no evil word may
   proceed out of the mouth of a man who reverences the good Word. [1209]
   Moreover, he must also diligently take care, lest by any fault of his
   he should at any time make an enemy; and if any one should be so
   shameless as to inflict injury on a good and just man, he must bear it
   with calmness and moderation, and not take upon himself his revenge,
   but reserve it for the judgment of God. [1210] He must at all times and
   in all places guard innocence. And this precept is not limited to this,
   that he should not himself inflict injury, but that he should not
   avenge it when inflicted on himself. For there sits on the
   judgment-seat a very great and impartial Judge, the observer and
   witness of all. Let him prefer Him to man; let him rather choose that
   He should pronounce judgment respecting his cause, whose sentence no
   one can escape, either by the advocacy of any one or by favour. Thus it
   comes to pass, that a just man is an object of contempt to all; and
   because it will be thought that he is unable to defend himself, he will
   be regarded as slothful and inactive; but if any one shall have avenged
   himself upon his enemy, he is judged a man of spirit and activity--all
   honour and reverence him. And although the good man has it in his power
   to profit many, yet they look up to him who is able to injure, rather
   than to him who is able to profit. But the depravity of men will not be
   able to corrupt the just man, so that he will not endeavour to obey
   God; and he would prefer to be despised, provided that he may always
   discharge the duty of a good man, and never of a bad man. Cicero says
   in those same books respecting Offices: "But if any one should wish to
   unravel this indistinct conception of his soul, [1211] let him at once
   teach himself that he is a good man who profits those whom he can, and
   injures no one [1212] unless provoked by injury."

   Oh how he marred a simple and true sentiment by the addition of two
   words! For what need was there of adding these words, "unless provoked
   by injury?" that he might append vice as a most disgraceful tail to a
   good man and might represent him as without patience, which is the
   greatest of all the virtues. He said that a good man would inflict
   injuries if he were provoked: now he must necessarily lose the name of
   a good man from this very circumstance, if he shall inflict injury. For
   it is not less the part of a bad man to return an injury than to
   inflict it. For from what source do contests, from what source do
   fightings and contentions, arise among men, except that impatience
   opposed to injustice often excites great tempests? But if you meet
   injustice with patience, than which virtue nothing can be found more
   true, nothing more worthy of a man, it will immediately be
   extinguished, as though you should pour water upon a fire. But if that
   injustice which provokes opposition has met with impatience equal
   [1213] to itself, as though overspread with oil, it will excite so
   great a conflagration, that no stream can extinguish it, but only the
   shedding of blood. Great, therefore, is the advantage of patience, of
   which the wise man has deprived the good man. For this alone causes
   that no evil happens; and if it should be given to all, there will be
   no wickedness and no fraud in the affairs of men. What, therefore, can
   be so calamitous to a good man, so opposed to his character, as to let
   loose the reins to anger, which deprives him not only of the title of a
   good man, but even of a man; since to injure another, as he himself
   most truly says, is not in accordance with the nature of man? For if
   you provoke cattle or horses, [1214] they turn against you either with
   their hoof or their horn; and serpents and wild beasts, unless you
   pursue them that you may kill them, give no trouble. And to return to
   examples of men, even the inexperienced and the foolish, if at any time
   they receive an injury, are led by a blind and irrational fury, and
   endeavour to retaliate upon those who injure them. In what respect,
   then, does the wise and good man differ from the evil and foolish,
   except that he has invincible patience, of which the foolish are
   destitute; except that he knows how to govern himself, and to mitigate
   his anger, which those, because they are without virtue, are unable to
   curb? But this circumstance manifestly deceived him, because, when
   inquiry is made respecting virtue, he thought that it is the part of
   virtue to conquer in every kind of contention. Nor was he able in any
   way to see, that a man who gives way to grief and anger, and who
   indulges these affections, against which he ought rather to struggle,
   and who rushes wherever injustice shall have called him, does not
   fulfil the duty of virtue. For he who endeavours to return an injury,
   desires to imitate that very person by whom he has been injured. Thus
   he who imitates a bad man can by no means be good.

   Therefore by two words he has taken away from the good and wise man two
   of the greatest virtues, innocence and patience. But, as Sallustius
   relates was said by Appius, because he himself practised that canine
   [1215] eloquence, be wished man also to live after the manner of a dog,
   so as, when attacked, to bite in return. And to show how pernicious
   this repayment of insult is, and what carnage it is accustomed to
   produce, from what can a more befitting example be sought, than from
   the most melancholy disaster of the teacher himself, who, while he
   desired to obey these precepts of the philosophers, destroyed himself?
   For if, when attacked with injury, he had preserved patience--if he had
   learned that it is the part of a good man to dissemble and to endure
   insult, and his impatience, vanity, and madness had not poured forth
   those noble orations, inscribed with a name derived from another
   source, [1216] he would never, by his head affixed to them, have
   polluted the rostra on which he had formerly distinguished himself, nor
   would that proscription have utterly destroyed the state. Therefore it
   is not the part of a wise and good man to wish to contend, and to
   commit himself to danger, since to conquer is not in our power, and
   every contest is doubtful; but it is the part of a wise and excellent
   man not to wish to remove his adversary, which cannot be done without
   guilt and danger, but to put an end to the contest itself, which may be
   done with advantage and with justice. Therefore patience is to be
   regarded as a very great virtue; and that the just man might obtain
   this, God willed, as has been before said, that he should be despised
   as sluggish. For unless he shall have been insulted, it will not be
   known what fortitude he has in restraining himself. Now if, when
   provoked by injury, he has begun to follow up his assailant with
   violence, he is overcome. But if he shall have repressed that emotion
   by reasoning, he altogether has command over himself: he is able to
   rule himself. And this restraining [1217] of oneself is rightly named
   patience, which single virtue is opposed to all vices and affections.
   This recalls the disturbed and wavering mind to its tranquillity; this
   mitigates, this restores a man to himself. Therefore, since it is
   impossible and useless to resist nature, so that we are not excited at
   all; before, however, the emotion bursts forth to the infliction of
   injury, as far [1218] as is possible let it be calmed [1219] in time.
   God has enjoined us not to let the sun go down upon our wrath, [1220]
   lest he should depart as a witness of our madness. Finally, Marcus
   Tullius, in opposition to his own precept, concerning which I have
   lately spoken, gave the greatest praises to the forgetting of injuries.
   "I entertain hopes," he says, "O Cæsar, who art accustomed to forget
   nothing except injuries." [1221] But if he thus acted--a man most
   widely removed not only from heavenly, but also from public and civil
   justice--how much more ought we to do this, who are, as it were,
   candidates for immortality?

    Chap. XIX.--Of the Affections and Their Use; And of the Three Furies.

   When the Stoics attempt to uproot the affections from man as diseases,
   they are opposed by the Peripatetics, who not only retain, but also
   defend them, and say that there is nothing in man which is not produced
   in him with great reason and foresight. They say this indeed rightly,
   if they know the true limits of each subject. Accordingly they say that
   this very affection of anger is the whetstone of virtue, as though no
   one could fight bravely against enemies unless he were excited by
   anger; by which they plainly show that they neither know what virtue
   is, nor why God gave anger to man. And if this was given to us for this
   purpose, that we may employ it for the slaying of men, what is to be
   thought more savage than man, what more resembling the wild beasts,
   than that animal which God formed for communion and innocence? There
   are, then, three affections which drive men headlong to all crimes: (1)
   anger, (2) desire, and (3) lust. [1222] On which account the poets have
   said that there are three furies which harass the minds of men: anger
   longs for revenge, desire for riches, lust for pleasures. But God has
   appointed fixed limits to all of these; and if they pass these limits
   and begin to be too great, they must necessarily pervert their nature,
   and be changed into diseases and vices. And it is a matter of no great
   labour to show what these limits are. [1223] Cupidity [1224] is given
   us for providing those things which are necessary for life;
   concupiscence, [1225] for the procreation of offspring; the affection
   of indignation, [1226] for restraining the faults of those who are in
   our power, that is, in order that tender age may be formed by a severer
   discipline to integrity and justice: for if this time of life is not
   restrained by fear, [1227] licence will produce boldness, and this will
   break out into every disgraceful and daring action. Therefore, as it is
   both just and necessary to employ anger towards the young, so it is
   both pernicious and impious to use it towards those of our own age. It
   is impious, because humanity is injured; pernicious, because if they
   oppose, it is necessary either to destroy them or to perish. But that
   this which I have spoken of is the reason why the affection of anger
   has been given to man, may be understood from the precepts of God
   Himself, who commands that we should not be angry with those who revile
   and injure us, but that we should always have our hands over the young;
   that is, that when they err, we should correct them with continual
   stripes, [1228] lest by useless love and excessive indulgence they
   should be trained to evil and nourished to vices. But those who are
   inexperienced in affairs and ignorant of reason, have expelled those
   affections which have been given to man for good uses, and they wander
   more widely than reason demands. From this cause they live unjustly and
   impiously. They employ anger against their equals in age: hence
   disagreements, hence banishments, hence wars have arisen contrary to
   justice. They use desire for the amassing of riches: hence frauds,
   hence robberies, hence all kinds of crimes have originated. They use
   lust only for the enjoyment of pleasures: hence debaucheries, hence
   adulteries, hence all corruptions have proceeded. Whoever, therefore,
   has reduced those affections within their proper limits, which they who
   are ignorant of God cannot do, he is patient, he is brave, he is just.

   is not evil; and concupiscence, until it becomes "evil concupiscence"

    Chap. XX.--Of the Senses, and Their Pleasures in the Brutes and in Man; And
    of Pleasures of the Eyes, and Spectacles.

   It remains that I should speak against the pleasures of the five
   senses, and this briefly, for the measure of the book itself now
   demands moderation; all of which, since they are vicious and deadly,
   ought to be overcome and subdued by virtue, or, as I said a little
   before respecting the affections, be recalled to their proper office.
   The other animals have no pleasure, except the one only which relates
   to generation. Therefore they use their senses for the necessity of
   their nature: they see, in order that they may seek those things which
   are necessary for the preservation of life; they hear one another, and
   distinguish one another, that they may be able to assemble together;
   they either discover from the smell, or perceive from the taste, the
   things which are useful for food; they refuse and reject the things
   which are useless, they measure the business of eating and drinking by
   the fulness of their stomach. But the foresight of the most skilful
   Creator gave to man pleasure without limit, and liable to fall into
   vice, because He set before him virtue, which might always be at
   variance with pleasure, as with a domestic enemy. Cicero says, in the
   Cato Major: [1230] "In truth, debaucheries, and adulteries, and
   disgraceful actions are excited by no other enticements than those of
   pleasure. And since nature or some God has given to man nothing more
   excellent than the mind, nothing is so hostile to this divine benefit
   and gift as pleasure. For when lust bears sway there is no place for
   temperance, nor can virtue have any existence when pleasure reigns
   supreme." But, on the other hand, God gave virtue on this account, that
   it might subdue and conquer pleasure, and that, when it passed the
   boundaries assigned to it, it might restrain it within the prescribed
   limits, lest it should soothe and captivate man with enjoyments, render
   him subject to its control, and punish him with everlasting death.

   The pleasure arising from the eyes is various and manifold, which is
   derived from the sight of objects which are pleasant in intercourse
   with men, or in nature or workmanship. The philosophers rightly took
   this away. For they say that it is much more excellent and worthy of
   man to look upon the heaven [1231] rather than carved works, and to
   admire this most beautiful work adorned with the lights of the stars
   shining through, [1232] as with flowers, than to admire things painted
   and moulded, and varied with jewels. But when they have eloquently
   exhorted us to despise earthly things, and have urged us to look up to
   the heaven, nevertheless they do not despise these public spectacles.
   Therefore they are both delighted with these, and are gladly present at
   them; though, since they are the greatest incitement to vices, and have
   a most powerful tendency to corrupt our minds, they ought to be taken
   away from us; for they not only contribute in no respect to a happy
   life, but even inflict the greatest injury. For he who reckons it a
   pleasure, that a man, though justly condemned, should be slain in his
   sight, pollutes his conscience as much as if he should become a
   spectator and a sharer of a homicide which is secretly committed.
   [1233] And yet they call these sports in which human blood is shed. So
   far has the feeling of humanity departed from the men, that when they
   destroy the lives of men, they think that they are amusing themselves
   with sport, being more guilty than all those whose blood-shedding they
   esteem a pleasure. I ask now whether they can be just and pious men,
   who, when they see men placed under the stroke of death, and entreating
   mercy, not only suffer them to be put to death, but also demand it, and
   give cruel and inhuman votes for their death, not being satiated with
   wounds nor contented with bloodshed. Moreover, they order them, even
   though wounded and prostrate, to be attacked again, and their caresses
   to he wasted [1234] with blows, that no one may delude them by a
   pretended death. They are even angry with the combatants, unless one of
   the two is quickly slain; and as though they thirsted for human blood,
   they hate delays. They demand that other and fresh combatants should be
   given to them, that they may satisfy their eyes as soon as possible.
   Being imbued with this practice, they have lost their humanity.
   Therefore they do not spare even the innocent, but practice upon all
   that which they have learned in the slaughter of the wicked. It is not
   therefore befitting that those who strive to keep to the path of
   justice should be companions and sharers in this public homicide. For
   when God forbids us to kill, He not only prohibits us from open
   violence, [1235] which is not even allowed by the public laws, but He
   warns us against the commission of those things which are esteemed
   lawful among men. Thus it will be neither lawful for a just man to
   engage in warfare, since his warfare is justice itself, nor to accuse
   any one of a capital charge, because it makes no difference whether you
   put a man to death by word, or rather by the sword, since it is the act
   of putting to death itself [1236] which is prohibited. Therefore, with
   regard to this precept of God, there ought to be no exception at all;
   but that it is always unlawful to put to death a man, whom God willed
   to be a sacred animal. [1237]

   Therefore let no one imagine that even this is allowed, to strangle
   [1238] newly-born children, which is the greatest impiety; for God
   breathes into their souls for life, and not for death. But men, that
   there may be no crime with which they may not pollute their hands,
   deprive souls as yet innocent and simple of the light which they
   themselves have not given. Can any one, indeed, expect that they would
   abstain from the blood of others who do not abstain even from their
   own? But these are without any controversy wicked and unjust. What are
   they whom a false piety [1239] compels to expose their children? Can
   they be considered innocent who expose their own offspring [1240] as a
   prey to dogs, and as far as it depends upon themselves, kill them in a
   more cruel manner than if they had strangled them? Who can doubt that
   he is impious who gives occasion [1241] for the pity of others? For,
   although that which he has wished should befall the child--namely, that
   it should be brought up--he has certainly consigned his own offspring
   either to servitude or to the brothel? But who does not understand, who
   is ignorant what things may happen, or are accustomed to happen, in the
   case of each sex, even through error? For this is shown by the example
   of OEdipus alone, confused with twofold guilt. It is therefore as
   wicked to expose as it is to kill. But truly parricides complain of the
   scantiness of their means, and allege that they have not enough for
   bringing up more children; as though, in truth, their means were in the
   power of those who possess them, or God did not daily make the rich
   poor, and the poor rich. Wherefore, if any one on account of poverty
   shall be unable to bring up children, it is better to abstain from
   marriage [1242] than with wicked hands to mar the work of God.

   If, then, it is in no way permitted to commit homicide, it is not
   allowed us to be present at all, [1243] lest any bloodshed should
   overspread the conscience, since that blood is offered for the
   gratification of the people. And I am inclined to think that the
   corrupting influence of the stage is still more contaminating. [1244]
   For the subject of comedies are the dishonouring of virgins, or the
   loves of harlots; and the more eloquent they are who have composed the
   accounts of these disgraceful actions, the more do they persuade by the
   elegance of their sentiments; and harmonious and polished verses more
   readily remain fixed in the memory of the hearers. In like manner, the
   stories of the tragedians place before the eyes the parricides and
   incests of wicked kings, and represent tragic [1245] crimes. And what
   other effect do the immodest gestures of the players produce, but both
   teach and excite lusts? whose enervated bodies, rendered effeminate
   after the gait and dress of women, imitate [1246] unchaste women by
   their disgraceful gestures. Why should I speak of the actors of mimes,
   [1247] who hold forth instruction in corrupting influences, who teach
   adulteries while they feign them, and by pretended actions train to
   those which are true? What can young men or virgins do, when they see
   that these things are practised without shame, and willingly beheld by
   all? They are plainly admonished of what they can do, and are inflamed
   with lust, which is especially excited by seeing; and every one
   according to his sex forms [1248] himself in these representations. And
   they approve of these things, while they laugh at them, and with vices
   clinging to them, they return more corrupted to their apartments; and
   not boys only, who ought not to be inured to vices prematurely, but
   also old men, whom it does not become at their age to sin.

   What else does the practice of the Circensian games contain but levity,
   vanity, and madness? For their souls are hurried away to mad excitement
   with as great impetuosity as that with which the chariot races are
   there carried on; so that they who come for the sake of beholding the
   spectacle now themselves exhibit more of a spectacle, when they begin
   to utter exclamations, to be thrown into transports, and to leap from
   their seats. Therefore all spectacles ought to be avoided, not only
   that no vice may settle in our breasts, which ought to be tranquil and
   peaceful; but that the habitual indulgence of any pleasure may not
   soothe and captivate us, and turn us aside from God and from good
   works. [1249] For the celebrations of the games are festivals in honour
   of the gods, inasmuch as they were instituted on account of their
   birthdays, or the dedication of new temples. And at first the huntings,
   which are called shows, were in honour of Saturnus, and the scenic
   games in honour of Liber, but the Circensian in honour of Neptune. By
   degrees, however, the same honour began to be paid also to the other
   gods, and separate games were dedicated to their names, as Sisinnius
   Capito teaches in his book on the games. Therefore, if any one is
   present at the spectacles to which men assemble for the sake of
   religion, he has departed from the worship of God, and has betaken
   himself to those deities whose birthdays and festivals he has
   celebrated. [1250]

    Chap. XXI.--Of the Pleasures of the Ears, and of Sacred Literature.

   Pleasure of the ears is received from the sweetness of voices and
   strains, which indeed is as productive of vice as that delight of the
   eyes of which we have spoken. For who would not deem him luxurious and
   worthless who should have scenic arts at his house? But it makes no
   difference whether you practice luxury alone at home, or with the
   people in the theatre. But we have already spoken of spectacles: [1251]
   there remains one thing which is to be overcome by us, that we be not
   captivated by those things which penetrate to the innermost perception.
   For all those things which are unconnected with words, that is,
   pleasant sounds of the air and of strings, may be easily disregarded,
   because they do not adhere to us, and cannot be written. But a
   well-composed poem, and a speech beguiling with its sweetness,
   captivate the minds of men, and impel them in what direction they
   please. Hence, when learned men have applied themselves to the religion
   of God, unless they have been instructed [1252] by some skilful
   teacher, they do not believe. For, being accustomed to sweet and
   polished speeches or poems, they despise the simple and common language
   of the sacred writings as mean. For they seek that which may soothe the
   senses. But whatever is pleasant to the ear effects persuasion, and
   while it delights fixes itself deeply within the breast. Is God,
   therefore, the contriver both of the mind, and of the voice, and of the
   tongue, unable to speak eloquently? Yea, rather, with the greatest
   foresight, He wished those things which are divine to be without
   adornment, that all might understand the things which He Himself spoke
   to all.

   Therefore he who is anxious for the truth, who does not wish to deceive
   himself, must lay aside hurtful and injurious pleasures, which would
   bind the mind to themselves, as pleasant food does the body: true
   things must be preferred to false, eternal things to those which are of
   short duration, useful things to those which are pleasant. Let nothing
   be pleasing to the sight but that which you see to be done with piety
   and justice; let nothing be agreeable to the hearing but that which
   nourishes the soul and makes you a better man. And especially this
   sense ought not to be distorted to vice, since it is given to us for
   this purpose, that we might gain the knowledge of God. Therefore, if it
   be a pleasure to hear melodies and songs, let it be pleasant to sing
   and hear the praises of God. This is true pleasure, which is the
   attendant and companion of virtue. This is not frail and brief, as
   those which they desire, who, like cattle, are slaves to the body; but
   lasting, and affording delight without any intermission. And if any one
   shall pass its limits, and shall seek nothing else from pleasure but
   pleasure itself, he designs for himself death; for as there is
   perpetual life in virtue, so there is death in pleasure. For he who
   shall choose temporal things will be without things eternal; he who
   shall prefer earthly things will not have heavenly things.

    Chap. XXII.--Of the Pleasures of Taste and Smell.

   But with regard to the pleasures of taste and smell, which two senses
   relate only to the body, there is nothing to be discussed by us; unless
   by chance any one requires us to say that it is disgraceful to a wise
   and good man if he is the slave of his appetite, if he walks along
   besmeared with unguents and crowned with flowers: and he who does these
   things is plainly foolish and senseless, and is worthless, and one whom
   not even a notion of virtue has reached. Perhaps some one will say,
   Why, then, have these things been made, except that we may enjoy them?
   However, it has often been said that there would have been no virtue
   unless it had things which it might overpower. Therefore God made all
   things to supply a contest between two things. Those enticements of
   pleasures, then, are the instruments of that whose only business it is
   to subdue virtue, and to shut out justice from men. With these soothing
   influences and enjoyments it captivates their souls; for it knows that
   pleasure is the contriver of death. For as God calls man to life only
   through virtue and labour, so the other calls us to death by delights
   and pleasures; and as men arrive at real good through deceitful evils,
   so they arrive at real evil through deceitful goods. Therefore those
   enjoyments are to be guarded against, as snares or nets, lest,
   captivated by the softness of enjoyments, we should be brought under
   the dominion of death with the body itself, to which we have enslaved
   ourselves.

    Chap. XXIII. [1253] --De Tactus Voluptate Et Libidine, Atque de Matrimonio
    Et Continentiâ.

   Venio nunc ad eam, quæ percipitur ex tactu, voluptatem: qui sensus est
   quidem totius corporis. Sed ego non de ornamentis, aut vestibus, sed de
   solâ libidine dicendum mihi puto; quæ maxime coercenda est, quia maxime
   nocet. Cure excogitasset Deus duorum sexuum rationero, attribuit iis,
   ut se invicem appeterent, et conjunctione gauderent. Itaque
   ardentissimam cupiditatem cunctorum animantium corporibus admiscuit, ut
   in hos affectus avidissime ruerent, eaque ratione propagari et
   multiplicari genera possent. Quæ cupiditas et appetentia in homine
   vehementior et acrior invenitur; vel quia hominum multitudinem voluit
   esse majorem, vel quoniam virtutem soli homini dedit, ut esset laus et
   gloria in coercendis voluptatibus, et abstinentia sui. Seit ergo
   adversarius ille noster, quanta sit vis hujus cupiditatis, quam quidam
   necessitatem dicere maluerunt; eamque a recto et bono, ad malum et
   pravum transfert. Illicita enim desideria immittit, ut aliena
   contaminent, quibus habere propria sine delicto licet. Objicit quippe
   oculis irritabiles formas, suggeritque fomenta, et vitiis pabulum
   subministrat: tum intimis visceribus stimulos omnes conturbat et
   commovet, et naturalem illum incitat atque inflammat ardorem, donee
   irretitum hominem implicatumque decipiat. Ac ne quis esset, qui
   poenarum metu abstineret alieno, lupanaria quoque constituit; et
   pudorem infelicium mulierum publicavit, ut ludibrio haberet tam eos qui
   faciunt, quam quas pati necesse est.

   His obscoenitatibus animas, ad sanctitatem genitas, velut in coeni
   gurgite demersit, pudorem extinxit, pudicitiam profligavit. Idem etiam
   mares maribus admiscuit; et nefandos coitus contra naturam contraque
   institutum Dei machinatus est: sic imbuit homines, et armavit ad nefas
   omne. Quid enim potest esse sanctum iis, qui ætatem imbecillam et
   præsidio indigentem, libidini suæ depopulandam foedandamque
   substraverint? Non potest hæc res pro magnitudine sceleris enarrari.
   Nihil amplius istos appellare possum, quam implos et parricidas, quibus
   non sufficit sexus a Deo datus, nisi eliare suum profane ac petulanter
   illudant. Hæc tamen apud illos levia, et quasi honesta sunt. Quid dicam
   de iis, qui abominandam non libidinem, sod insaniam potius exercent!
   Piget dicere: sed quid his fore credamus, quos non piget facere? et
   tamen dicendum est, quia fit. De istis loquor, quorum teterrima libido
   et execrabilis furor ne capiti quidem parcit. Quibus hoc verbis, aut
   qua indignatione tantum nefas prosequar? Vincit officium linguæ
   sceleris magnitudo. Cum igitur libido hæc edat opera, et hæc facinora
   designer, armandi adversus earn virtute maxima sumus. Quisquis affectus
   illos frænare non potest, cohibeat eos intra præ scriptum legitimi
   tori, ut et illud, quod avide expetat, consequatur, et tamen in
   peccatum non incidat. Nam quid sibi homines perditi volunt? Nempe
   honesta opera voluptas sequitur: si ipsam per se appetunt, justa et
   legitima frui licet.

   Quod si aliqua necessitas prohibebit tum vero maxima adhibenda virtus
   erit, ut cupiditati continentia reluctetur. Nec tanturn alienis, quæ
   attingere non licet, veriun etiam publicis vulgatisque corporibus
   abstinendum, Deus præcepit; docetque nos, cum duo inter se corpora
   fuerint copulata, unum corpus efficere. Ita qui se coeno immerserit,
   coeno sit oblitus necesse est; et corpus quidem cito ablui potest: mens
   autem contagione impudici corporis inquinata non potest, nisi et longo
   tempore, et multis bonis operibus, ab ea quæ inhæ serit colluvione
   purgari. Oportet ergo sibi quemque proponere, duorum sexuum
   conjunctionem generandi causa datam esse viventibus, eamque legera his
   affectibus positam, ut successionera parent. Sicut autem dedit nobis
   oculos Deus, non ut spectemus, voluptatemque capiamus, sed ut videamus
   propter eos actus, qui pertinent ad vitæ necessitatem, ita genitalem
   corporis partem, quod nomen ipsum docet, nulla alia causa nisi
   efficiendæ sobolis accepimus. Huic divinæ legi summa devotione parendum
   est. Sint omnes, qui se discipulos Dei profitebuntur, ita morati et
   instituti, ut imperare sibi possint. Nam qui voluptatibus indulgent,
   qui libidini obsequuntur, ii animam suam corpori mancipant, ad
   mortemque condemnant: quia se corpori addixerunt, in quod habet mors
   potestatem. Unusquisque igitur, quantum potest, formet se ad
   verecundiam, pudorem colat, castitatem conscientia et mente tueatur;
   nec tantum legibus publicis pareat: sed sit supra omnes leges, qui
   legem Dei sequitur. Quibus bonis si assueverit, jam pudebit eum ad
   deteriora desciscere: modo placeant recta et honesta, quæ melioribus
   jucundiora sunt quam prava et inhonesta pejoribus.

   Nondum omnia castitatis officio exsecutus sum: quam Deus fion modo
   intra privatos parietes, sed etiam præ scripto lectuli terminat; ut cum
   quis hobeat uxorem, neque servam, neque liberam habere insuper velit,
   sed matrimonio fidem server. Non enim, sicut juris publici ratio est,
   solo mulier adultera est, quæ habet allure, maritus outem, etiam si
   plures habeat, a crimine adulterii solutus est. Sed divina lex ira duos
   in matrimonium, quod est in corpus unum, pari jure conjungit, ut
   adulter habeatur, quisquis compagem corporis in diversa distraxerit.
   Nec ob aliam cansam Deus, cam cæteras animantes suscepto foetu maribus
   repugnare voluisset, solam omnium mulierem patientem viri fecit;
   scilicet ne foeminis repugnantibus, libido cogeret viros aliud
   appetere, eoque facto, castitatis gloriam non tenerent. [1254] Sed
   neque mulier virtutem pudicitiæ caperet, si peccare non posset. Nam
   quis mutum animal pudicum esse dixerit, quod suscepto foe tu mari
   repugnat? Quod ideo facit, quia necesse est in dolorem atque in
   periculum veniat, si admiserit. Nulla igitur laus est, non facere quod
   facere non possis. Ideo autem pudicitia in homine laudatur, quia non
   naturalis est, sed voluntaria. Servanda igitur fides ab utroque alteri
   est: immo exemplo continentia: docenda uxor, ut se caste gerat. Iniquum
   est enim, ut id exigas, quod præ stare ipse non possis. Quæ iniquitas
   effecit profecto, ut essent adulteria, foe minis ægre ferentibus præ
   stare se fidem non exhibentibus mutuam charitatem. Denique nulla est
   tam perditi pudoris adultera, quæ non hanc causam vitiis suis præ
   tendat; injuriam se peccando non facere, sed referre. Quod optime
   Quintilianus expressit: Homo, inquit, neque alieni matrimonii
   abstinens, neque sui custos, quæ inter se natura. connexa sunt. Nam
   neque maritus circa corrumpendas aliorum conjuges occupatus potest
   vacare domesticæ sanctitati; et uxor, cum in tale incidit matrimonium,
   exemplo ipso concitara, out imitari se putat, out vindicari.

   Cavendum igitur, ne occasionem vitiis nostra intemperantia demus: sed
   assuescant invicem mores duorum, et jugum paribus animis ferant. Nos
   ipsos in altero cogitemus. Nam fere in hoc justitiæ summa consistit, ut
   non facias alteri, quidquid ipse ab altero pati nolis. Hæc sunt quæ ad
   continentiam præ cipiuntur a Deo. Sed tamen ne quis divina præ cepta
   circumscribere se putet posse, adduntur ilia, ut omnis calumnia, et
   occasio fraudis removeatur, adulterum esse, qui a marito dimissam
   duxerit, et eum qui præ tercrimen adulterii uxorem dimiserit, ut
   alteram ducat; dissociari enim corpus et distrahi Deus noluit. Præ
   terea non tanturn adulterium esse vitandum, sed etiam cogitationem; ne
   quis aspiciat alienam, et animo concupiscat: adulteram enim fieri
   mentem, si vel imaginem voluptatis sibi ipsa depinxerit. Mens est enim
   profecto quæ peccat; quæ immoderata: libidinis fructum cogitatione
   complectitur; in hac crimen est, in hac omne delictum. Nam etsi corpus
   nulla sit lobe maculatum, non constat tamen pudicitiæ ratio, si animus
   incestus est; nec illibata castitas videri potest, ubi conscientiam
   cupiditas inquinavit. Nec verb aliquis existimet, difficile esse fræ
   nos imponere voluptati, eamque vagam et errantem castitatis pudicitiæ
   que limitibus includere, cum propositum sit hominibus etiam vincere, ac
   plurimi beatam atque incorruptam corporis integritatem retinuerint,
   multique sint, qui hoc coe lesti genere vitæ felicissime perfruantur.
   Quod quidem Deus non ira fieri præ cepit, tanquam astringat, quia
   generari homines oportet; sed tanquam sinat. Scit enim, quantam his
   affectibus imposuerit necessitatem. Si quis hoc, inquit, facere
   potuerit, habebit eximiam incomparabilemque mercedem. Quod continentiæ
   genus quasi fastigium est, omniumque consummatio virtutum. Ad quam si
   quis eniti atque eluctari potuerit, hunc servum dominus, hunc
   discipulum magister agnoscet; hic terrain triumphabit, hic erit
   consimilis Deo, qui virtutem Dei cepit. Hæc quidem difficilia videntur;
   sed de eo loquimur, cui calcatis omnibus terrenis, iter in coelum
   paratur. Nam quia virtus in Dei agnitione consistit, omnia gravia sunt,
   dum ignores; ubi cognoveris, facilia: per ipsas difficultates nobis
   exeundum est, qui ad summum bonum tendimus.

    Chap. XXIV.--Of Repentance, of Pardon, and the Commands of God.

   Nor, however, let any one be disheartened, or despair concerning
   himself, if, overcome by passion, or impelled by desire, or deceived by
   error, or compelled by force, he has turned aside to the way of
   unrighteousness. For it is possible for him to be brought back, and to
   be set free, if he repents of his actions, and, turning to better
   things, makes satisfaction to God. Cicero, indeed, thought that this
   was impossible, whose words in the third book of the Academics [1255]
   are: "But if, as in the case of those who have gone astray on a
   journey, it were permitted those who have followed a devious course to
   correct their error by repentance, it would be more easy to amend
   rashness." It is altogether permitted them. For if we think that our
   children are corrected when we perceive that they repent of their
   faults, and though we have disinherited and cast them off, we again
   receive, cherish, and embrace them, why should we despair that the
   mercy of God our Father may again be appeased by repentance? Therefore
   He who is at once the Lord and most indulgent Parent promises that He
   will remit the sins of the penitent, and that He will blot out all the
   iniquities of him who shall begin afresh to practice righteousness. For
   as the uprightness of his past life is of no avail to him who lives
   badly, because the subsequent wickedness has destroyed his works of
   righteousness, so former sins do not stand in the way of him who has
   amended his life, because the subsequent righteousness has effaced the
   stain of his former life. For he who repents of that which he has done,
   understands his former error; and on this account the Greeks better and
   more significantly speak of metanoia, [1256] which we may speak of in
   Latin as a return to a right understanding. [1257] For he returns to a
   right understanding, and recovers his mind as it were from madness, who
   is grieved for his error; and he reproves himself of madness, and
   confirms his mind to a better course of life: then he especially guards
   against this very thing, that he may not again be led into the same
   snares. In short, even the dumb animals, when they are ensnared by
   fraud, if by any means they have extricated themselves so as to escape,
   become more cautious for the future, and always avoid all those things
   in which they have perceived wiles and snares. Thus repentance makes a
   man cautious and diligent to avoid the faults into which he has once
   fallen through deceit.

   For no one can be so prudent and so circumspect as not at some time to
   slip; and therefore God, knowing our weakness, of His compassion [1258]
   has opened a harbour of refuge for man, that the medicine of repentance
   might aid this necessity to which our frailty is liable. [1259]
   Therefore, if any one has erred, let him retrace his step, and as soon
   as possible recover and reform himself.


   "But upward to retrace the way,

   And pass into the light of day,

   Then comes the stress of labour." [1260]

   For when men have tasted sweet pleasures to their destruction, [1261]
   they can scarcely be separated from them: they would more easily follow
   right things if they had not tasted their attractions. But if they tear
   themselves away from this pernicious slavery, all their error will be
   forgiven them, if they shall have corrected their error by a better
   life. And let not any one imagine that he is a gainer if he shall have
   no witness of his fault: for all things are known to Him in whose sight
   we live; and if we are able to conceal anything from all men, we cannot
   conceal it from God, to whom nothing can be hidden, nothing secret.
   Seneca closed his exhortations with an admirable sentiment: "There is,"
   he says, "some great deity, and greater than can be imagined; and for
   him we endeavour to live. Let us approve ourselves to him. For it is of
   no avail that conscience is confirmed; we lie open to the sight of
   God." What can be spoken with greater truth by him who knew God, than
   has been said by a man who is ignorant of true religion? For he both
   expressed the majesty of God, by saying that it is too great for the
   reflecting powers of the human mind to receive; and he touched upon the
   very fountain of truth, by perceiving that the life of men is not
   superfluous, [1262] as the Epicureans will have it, but that they make
   it their endeavour to live to God, if indeed they live with justice and
   piety. He might have been a true worshipper of God, if any one had
   pointed out to him God; [1263] and he might assuredly have despised
   Zeno, and his teacher Sotion, if he had obtained a true guide of
   wisdom. Let us approve ourselves to him, he says. A speech truly
   heavenly, had it not been preceded by a confession of ignorance. It is
   of no avail that conscience is confined; we lie open to the sight of
   God. There is then no room for falsehood, none for dissimulation; for
   the eyes of men are removed by walls, but the divine power of God
   cannot be removed by the inward parts from looking through and knowing
   the entire man. The same writer says, in the first book of the same
   work: "What are you doing? what are you contriving? what are you
   hiding? Your guardian follows you; one is withdrawn from you by foreign
   travel, another by death, another by infirm health; this one adheres to
   you, and you can never be without him. Why do you choose a secret
   place, and remove the witness? Suppose that you have succeeded in
   escaping the notice of all, foolish man! What does it profit you not to
   have a witness, [1264] if you have the witness of your own conscience?

   And Tully speaks in a manner no less remarkable concerning conscience
   and God: "Let him remember," he says, "that he has God as a witness,
   that is, as I judge, his own mind, than which God has given nothing
   more divine to man." [1265] Likewise, in speaking of the just and good
   man, he says: "Therefore such a man will not dare not merely to do, but
   even to think, anything which he would not dare to proclaim." Therefore
   let us cleanse our conscience, which is open to the eyes of God; and,
   as the same writer says, "let us always so live as to remember that we
   shall have to give an account;" [1266] and let us reckon that we are
   looked upon at every moment, not, as he said, in some theatre of the
   world by men, but from above by Him who is about to be both the judge
   and also the witness, to whom, when He demands an account of our life,
   it will not be permitted any one to deny his actions. Therefore it is
   better either to flee from conscience, or ourselves to open our mind of
   our own accord, and tearing open our wounds to pour forth destruction;
   which wounds no one else can heal but He alone who made the lame to
   walk, restored sight to the blind, cleansed the polluted limbs, and
   raised the dead. He will quench the ardour of desires, He will root out
   lusts, He will remove envy, He will mitigate anger. He will give true
   and lasting health. This remedy should be sought by all, inasmuch as
   the soul is harassed by greater danger than the body, and a cure should
   be applied as soon as possible to secret diseases. For if any one has
   his eyesight clear, all his limbs perfect, and his entire body in the
   most vigorous health, nevertheless I should not call him sound if he is
   carried away by anger, swollen and puffed up with pride, the slave of
   lust, and burning with desires; but I should rather call him sound who
   does not raise his eyes to the prosperity of another, who does not
   admire riches, who looks upon another's wife with chaste eye, who
   covets nothing at all, does not desire that which is another's, envies
   no one, disdains no one; who is lowly, merciful, bountiful, mild,
   courteous: peace perpetually dwells in his mind.

   That man is sound, he is just, he is perfect. Whoever, therefore, has
   obeyed all these heavenly precepts, he is a worshipper of the true God,
   whose sacrifices are gentleness of spirit, and an innocent life, and
   good actions. And he who exhibits all these qualities offers a
   sacrifice as often as he performs any good and pious action. For God
   does not desire the sacrifice of a dumb animal, nor of death and blood,
   but of man and life. And to this sacrifice there is neither need of
   sacred boughs, nor of purifications, [1267] nor of sods of turf, which
   things are plainly most vain, but of those things which are put forth
   from the innermost breast. Therefore, upon the altar of God, which is
   truly very great, [1268] and which is placed in the heart of man, and
   cannot be defiled with blood, there is placed righteousness, patience,
   faith, innocence, chastity, and abstinence. This is the truest
   ceremony, this is that law of God, as it is called by Cicero,
   illustrious and divine, which always commands things which are right
   and honourable, and forbids things which are wrong and disgraceful; and
   he who obeys this most holy and certain law cannot fail to live justly
   and lawfully. And I have laid down a few chief points of this law,
   since I promised that I would speak only of those things which
   completed the character [1269] of virtue and righteousness. If any one
   shall wish to comprise all the other parts, let him seek them from the
   fountain itself, from which that stream flowed to us.

    Chap. XXV.--Of Sacrifice, and of an Offering Worthy of God, and of the Form
    of Praising God.

   Now let us speak briefly concerning sacrifice itself. "Ivory," says
   Plato, "is not a pure offering to God." What then? Are embroidered and
   costly textures? Nay, rather nothing is a pure offering to God which
   can be corrupted or taken away secretly. But as he saw this, that
   nothing which was taken from a dead body ought to be offered to a
   living being, why did he not see that a corporeal offering ought not to
   be presented to an incorporeal being? How much better and more truly
   does Seneca speak: "Will you think of God as great and placid, and a
   friend to be reverenced with gentle majesty, and always at hand? not to
   be worshipped with the immolation of victims and with much blood--for
   what pleasure arises from the slaughter of innocent animals?--but with
   a pure mind and with a good and honourable purpose. Temples are not to
   be built to Him with stones piled up on high; He is to be consecrated
   by each man in his own breast." Therefore, if any one thinks that
   garments, and jewels, and other things which are esteemed precious, are
   valued by God, he is altogether ignorant of what God is, since he
   thinks that those things are pleasing to Him which even a man would be
   justly praised for despising. What, then, is pure, what is worthy of
   God, but that which He Himself has demanded in that divine law of His?

   There are two things which ought to be offered, the gift [1270] and the
   sacrifice; the gift as a perpetual offering, the sacrifice for a time.
   But with those who by no means understand the nature of the Divine
   Being, a gift is anything which is wrought of gold or silver; likewise
   anything which is woven of purple and silk: a sacrifice is a victim,
   and as many things as are burnt upon the altar. But God does not make
   use either of the one or the other, because He is free from corruption,
   and that is altogether corruptible. Therefore, in each case, that which
   is incorporeal must be offered to God, for He accepts this. His
   offering is innocency of soul; His sacrifice praise and a hymn. [1271]
   For if God is not seen, He ought therefore to be worshipped with things
   which are not seen. Therefore no other religion is true but that which
   consists of virtue and justice. But in what manner God deals with the
   justice of man is easily understood. For if man shall be just, having
   received immortality, he will serve God for ever. But that men are not
   born except for justice, both the ancient philosophers and even Cicero
   suspects. For, discussing the Laws, [1272] he says: "But of all things
   which are discussed by learned men, nothing assuredly is of greater
   importance than that it should be entirely understood that we are born
   to justice." We ought therefore to hold forth and offer to God that
   alone for the receiving of which He Himself produced us. But how true
   this twofold kind of sacrifice is, Trismegistus Hermes is a befitting
   witness, who agrees with us, that is, with the prophets, whom we
   follow, as much in fact as in words. He thus spoke concerning justice:
   "Adore and worship this word, O son." But the worship of God consists
   of one thing, not to be wicked. Also in that perfect discourse, when he
   heard Asclepius inquiring from his son whether it pleased him that
   incense and other odours for divine sacrifice were offered to his
   father, exclaimed: "Speak words of good omen, O Asclepius. For it is
   the greatest impiety to entertain any such thought concerning that
   being of pre-eminent goodness. For these things, and things resembling
   these, are not adapted to Him. For He is full of all things, as many as
   exist, and He has need of nothing at all. But let us give Him thanks,
   and adore Him. For His sacrifice consists only of blessing." And he
   spoke rightly. [1273]

   For we ought to sacrifice to God in word; inasmuch as God is the Word,
   as He Himself confessed. Therefore the chief ceremonial in the worship
   of God is praise from the mouth of a just man directed towards God.
   [1274] That this, however, may be accepted by God, there is need of
   humility, and fear, and devotion in the greatest degree, lest any one
   should chance to place confidence in his integrity and innocence, and
   thus incur the charge of pride and arrogance, and by this deed lose the
   recompense of his virtue. But that he may obtain the favour of God, and
   be free from every stain, let him always implore the mercy of God, and
   pray for nothing else but pardon for his sins, even though he has none.
   [1275] If he desires anything else, there is no need of expressing it
   in word to one who knows what we wish; if anything good shall happen to
   him, let him give thanks; if any evil, let him make amends, [1276] and
   let him confess that the evil has happened to him on account of his
   faults; and even in evils let him nothing less give thanks, and make
   amends in good things, that he may be the same at all times, and be
   firm, and unchangeable, and unshaken. And let him not suppose that this
   is to be done by him only in the temple, but at home, and even in his
   very bed. In short, let him always have God with himself, consecrated
   in his heart, inasmuch as he himself is a temple of God. But if he has
   served God, his Father and Lord, with this assiduity, obedience, and
   devotion, justice is complete and perfect; and he who shall keep this,
   as we before testified, has obeyed God, and has satisfied the
   obligations of religion and his own duty.

    Chap. I.--Of the World, and Those Who are About to Believe, and Those Who
    are Not; And in This the Censure of the Faithless.

   It is well: the foundations are laid, as the illustrious orator says.
   But we have not only laid the foundations, which might be firm and
   suitable for the support of the work; but we have raised the entire
   edifice, with great and strong buildings, almost to the summit. There
   remains, a matter which is much easier, either to cover or adorn it;
   without which, however, the former works are both useless and
   displeasing. For of what avail is it, either to be freed from false
   religions [1277] or to understand the true [1278] one? Of what avail,
   either to see the vanity of false wisdom, [1279] or to know what is
   true? [1280] Of what avail is it, I say, to defend that heavenly
   justice? [1281] Of what avail to hold the worship of God [1282] with
   great difficulties, which is the greatest virtue, unless the divine
   reward of everlasting blessedness attends it? Of which subject we must
   speak in this book, lest all that is gone before should appear vain and
   unprofitable: if we should leave this, on account of which they were
   undertaken, in uncertainty, lest any one should by chance think that
   such great labours are undertaken in vain; while he distrusts their
   heavenly reward, which God has appointed for him who shall have
   despised the present sweet enjoyments of earth in comparison of
   solitary and unrewarded [1283] virtue. Let us satisfy this part of our
   subject also, both by the testimonies of the sacred writings and also
   by probable arguments, that it may be equally manifest that future
   things are to be preferred to those which are present; heavenly things
   to earthly; and eternal things to those which are temporal: since the
   rewards of vices are temporal, those of virtues are eternal.

   I will therefore set forth the system of the world, that it may easily
   be understood both when and how it was made by God; which Plato, who
   discoursed about the making of the world, could neither know nor
   explain, inasmuch as he was ignorant of the heavenly mystery, which is
   not learned except by the teaching of prophets and God; and therefore
   he said that it was created for eternity. Whereas the case is far
   different, since whatever is of a solid and heavy body, as it received
   a beginning at some time, so it must needs have an end. For Aristotle,
   when he did not see how so great a magnitude of things could perish,
   and wished to escape this objection, [1284] said that the world always
   had existed, and always would exist. He did not at all see, that
   whatever material thing exists must at some time have had a beginning,
   and that nothing can exist at all unless it had a beginning. For when
   we see that earth, and water, and fire perish, are consumed, and
   extinguished, which are clearly parts of the world, it is understood
   that that is altogether mortal the members of which are mortal. Thus it
   comes to pass, that whatever is liable to destruction must have been
   produced. But everything which comes within the sight of the eyes must
   of necessity be material, and capable of dissolution. Therefore
   Epicurus alone, following the authority of Democritus, spoke truly in
   this matter, who said that it had a beginning at some time, and that it
   would at some time perish. Nor, however, was he able to assign any
   reason, either through what causes or at what time this work of such
   magnitude should be destroyed. But since God has revealed this to us,
   and we do not arrive at it by conjectures, but by instruction from
   heaven, we will carefully teach it, that it may at length be evident to
   those who are desirous of the truth, that the philosophers did not see
   nor comprehend the truth; but that they had so slight a knowledge
   [1285] of it, that they by no means perceived from what source that
   fragrance [1286] of wisdom, which was so pleasant and agreeable,
   breathed upon them.

   In the meantime, I think it necessary to admonish those who are about
   to read this, that depraved and vicious minds, since the acuteness of
   their mind is blunted by earthly passions, which weigh down all the
   perceptions and render them weak, will either altogether fail to
   understand these things which we relate, or, even if they shall
   understand them, they will dissemble and be unwilling for them to be
   true: because they are drawn away by vices, and they knowingly favour
   their own evils, by the pleasantness of which they are captivated, and
   they desert the way of virtue, by the bitterness of which they are
   offended. For they who are inflamed with avarice and a certain
   insatiable thirst for riches--because, when they have sold or
   squandered the things in which they delight, they are unable to live in
   a simple style--undoubtedly prefer that by which they are compelled to
   renounce their eager desires. Also, they who, urged on by the
   incitements of lusts, as the poet says, [1287]


   "Rush into madness and fire,"

   say that we bring forward things plainly incredible; because the
   precepts about self-restraint wound their ears, which restrain them
   from their pleasures, to which they have given [1288] up their soul,
   together with their body. But those who, swollen with ambition or
   inflamed with the love of power, have bestowed all their efforts on the
   acquisition of honours, will not, even if we should bear the sun
   himself in our hands, believe that teaching which commands them to
   despise all power and honour, and to live in humility, and in such
   humility that they may be able to receive an injury, and if they have
   received one, be unwilling to return it. These are the men who cry out
   [1289] in any way against the truth with closed eyes. But they who are
   or shall be of sound mind, that is, not so immersed in vices as to be
   incurable, will both believe these things, and will readily approach
   them; and whatever things we say, they will appear to them open, and
   plain, and simple, and that which is chiefly necessary, true and
   unassailable.

   No one favours virtue but he who is able to follow it; but it is not
   easy for all to follow it: they can do so whom poverty and want have
   exercised, and made capable of virtue. For if the endurance of evils is
   virtue, it follows that they are not capable of virtue who have always
   lived in the enjoyment of good things; because they have never
   experienced evils, nor can they endure them, through their
   long-continued use and desire of good things, which alone they know.
   Thus it comes to pass that the poor and humble, who are unencumbered,
   more readily believe God than the rich, who are entangled with many
   hindrances; [1290] yea, rather, in chains and fetters they are enslaved
   to the nod of desire, their mistress, which has ensnared them with
   inextricable bonds; nor are they able to look up to heaven, since their
   mind is bent down to the earth, and fixed on the ground. But the way of
   virtue does not admit those carrying great burthens. The path is very
   narrow by which justice leads man to heaven; no one can keep this
   unless he is unencumbered and lightly equipped. For those wealthy men,
   who are loaded with many and great burthens, proceed along the way of
   death, which is very broad, since destruction rules with extended sway.
   The precepts which God gives for justice, and the things which we bring
   forward under the teaching of God respecting virtue and the truth, are
   bitter and as poisons to these. And if they shall dare to oppose these
   things, they must own themselves to be enemies of virtue and justice. I
   will now come to the remaining part of the subject, that an end may be
   put to the work. But this remains, that we should treat of the judgment
   of God, which will then be established when our Lord shall return to
   the earth to render to every one either a reward or punishment,
   according to his desert. Therefore, as we spoke in the fourth book
   concerning His first advent, [1291] so in this book we will relate His
   second advent, which the Jews also both confess and hope for; but in
   vain, since He must return to the confusion [1292] of those for whose
   call He had before come. For they who impiously treated Him with
   violence in His humiliation, will experience Him in His power as a
   conqueror; and, God requiting them, they will suffer all those things
   which they read and do not understand; inasmuch as, being polluted with
   all sins, and moreover sprinkled with the blood of the Holy One, they
   were devoted to eternal punishment by that very One on whom they laid
   wicked hands. But we shall have a separate subject against the Jews, in
   which we shall convict them of error and guilt.

    Chap. II.--Of the Error of the Philosophers, and of the Divine Wisdom, and
    of the Golden Age.

   Now let us instruct those who are ignorant of the truth. It has been so
   determined by the arrangement of the Most High God, that this
   unrighteous age, having run the course [1293] of its appointed times,
   should come to an end; and all wickedness being immediately
   extinguished, and the souls of the righteous being recalled to a happy
   life, a quiet, tranquil, peaceful, in short, golden age, as the poets
   call it, should flourish, under the rule of God Himself. This was
   especially the cause of all the errors of the philosophers, that they
   did not comprehend the system of the world, which comprises the whole
   of wisdom. But it cannot be comprehended by our own perception and
   innate intelligence, which they wished to do by themselves without a
   teacher. Therefore they fell into various and ofttimes contradictory
   opinions, out of which they had no way of escape,


   And they remained fixed in the same mire,

   as the comic writer [1294] says, since their conclusion does not
   correspond with their assumptions; [1295] inasmuch as they had assumed
   things to be true which could not be affirmed, and proved without the
   knowledge of the truth and of heavenly things. And this knowledge, as I
   have often said already, cannot exist in a man unless it is derived
   from the teaching of God. For if a man is able to understand divine
   things, he will be able also to perform them; for to understand is, as
   it were, to follow in their track. But he is not able to do the things
   which God does, because he is clothed with a mortal body; therefore he
   cannot even understand those things which God does. And whether this is
   possible is easy for every one to measure, from the immensity of the
   divine actions and works. For if you will contemplate the world, with
   all the things which it contains, you will assuredly understand how
   much the work of God surpasses the works of men. Thus, as great as is
   the difference between divine and human works, so great must be the
   distance between the wisdom of God and man. For because God is
   incorruptible and immortal, and therefore perfect because He is
   everlasting, His wisdom also is perfect, as He Himself is; nor can
   anything oppose it, because God Himself is subject to nothing.

   But because man is subject to passion, his wisdom also is subject to
   error; and as many things hinder the life of man, so that it cannot be
   perpetual, so also his wisdom must be hindered by many things: so that
   it is not perfect in entirely perceiving the truth. Therefore there is
   no human wisdom, if it strives by itself to attain to the conception
   and knowledge of the truth; inasmuch as the mind of man, being bound up
   with a frail body, and enclosed in a dark abode, is neither able to
   wander at large, nor clearly to perceive the truth, the knowledge of
   which belongs to the divine nature. For His works are known to God
   alone. But man cannot attain this knowledge by reflection or
   disputation, but by learning and hearing from Him who alone is able to
   know and to teach. Therefore Marcus Tullius, [1296] borrowing from
   Plato the sentiment of Socrates, who said that the time had come for
   himself to depart from life, but that they before whom he was pleading
   his cause were still alive, says: Which is better is known to the
   immortal gods; but I think that no man knows. Wherefore all the sects
   of philosophers must be far removed from the truth, because they who
   established them were men; nor can those things have any foundation or
   firmness which are unsupported by any utterances of divine voices.

    Chap. III.--Of Nature, and of the World; And a Censure of the Stoics and
    Epicureans.

   And since we are speaking of the errors of philosophers, the Stoics
   divide nature into two parts--the one which effects, the other which
   affords itself tractable for action. They say that in the former is
   contained all the power of perception, in the latter the material, and
   that the one cannot act without the other. How can that which handles
   and that which is handled be one and the same thing? If any one should
   say that the potter is the same as the clay, or that the clay is the
   same as the potter, would he not plainly appear to be mad? But these
   men comprehend under the one name of nature two things which are most
   widely different, God and the world, the Maker and the work; and say
   that the one can do nothing without the other, as though God were mixed
   up in nature with the world. For sometimes they so mix them together,
   that God Himself is the mind of the world, and that the world is the
   body of God; as though the world and God began to exist at the same
   time, and God did not Himself make the world. And they themselves also
   confess this at other times, when they say that it was made for the
   sake of men, and that God could, if He willed it, exist without the
   world, inasmuch as God is the divine and eternal mind, separate and
   free from a body. And since they were unable to understand His power
   and majesty, they mixed Him [1297] with the world, that is, with His
   own work. Whence is that saying of Virgil: [1298] --


   "A spirit whose celestial flame

   Glows in each member of the frame,

   And stirs the mighty whole."

   What, then, becomes of their own saying, that the world was both made
   and is governed by the divine providence? For if He made the world, it
   follows that He existed without the world; if He governs it, it is
   plain that it is not as the mind governs the body, but as a master
   rules the house, as a pilot the ship, as a charioteer the chariot. Nor,
   however, are they mixed with those things which they govern. For if all
   these things which we see are members of God, then God is rendered
   insensible by them, since the members are without sensibility, and
   mortal, since we see that the members are mortal.

   I can enumerate how often lands shaken by sudden motions [1299] have
   either opened or sunk down precipitously; how often cities and islands
   have been overwhelmed by waves, and gone into the deep; marshes have
   inundated fruitful plains, rivers and pools have been dried up; [1300]
   mountains also have either fallen precipitously, or have been levelled
   with plains. Many districts, and the foundations of many mountains, are
   laid waste by latent and internal fire. And this is not enough, if God
   does not spare His own members, unless it is permitted man also to have
   some power over the body of God. Seas are built up, mountains are cut
   down, and the innermost bowels of the earth are dug out to draw forth
   riches. Why, should I say that we cannot even plough without lacerating
   the divine body? So that we are at once wicked and impious in doing
   violence to the members of God. Does God, then, suffer His body to be
   harassed, and endure to weaken Himself, or permit this to be done by
   man? Unless by chance that divine intelligence which is mixed with the
   world, and with all parts of the world, abandoned the first outer
   aspect [1301] of the earth, and plunged itself into the lowest depths,
   that it might be sensible of no pain from continual laceration. But if
   this is trifling and absurd, then they themselves were as devoid of
   intelligence as those are who have not perceived that the divine spirit
   is everywhere diffused, and that all things are held together by it,
   not however in such a manner that God, who is incorruptible, should
   Himself be mixed with heavy and corruptible elements. Therefore that is
   more correct which they derived from Plato, that the world was made by
   God, and is also governed by His providence. It was therefore befitting
   that Plato, and those who held the same opinion, should teach and
   explain what was the cause, what the reason, for the contriving of so
   great a work; why or for the sake of whom He made it.

   But the Stoics also say the world was made for the sake of men. I hear.
   But Epicurus is ignorant on what account or who made men themselves.
   For Lucretius, when he said that the world was not made by the gods,
   thus spoke: [1302]


   "To say, again, that for the sake of men they have willed to set in
   order the glorious nature of the world"--

   then he introduced:--


   "Is sheer folly. For what advantage can our gratitude bestow on
   immortal and blessed beings, that for our, sake they should take in
   hand to administer aught?"

   And with good reason. For they brought forward no reason why the human
   race was created or established by God. It is our business to set forth
   the mystery of the world and man, of which they, being destitute, were
   able neither to reach nor see the shrine of truth. Therefore, as I said
   a little before, when they had assumed that which was true, that is,
   that the world was made by God, and was made for the sake of men, yet,
   since their argument failed them in the consequences, they were unable
   to defend that which they had assumed. In fine, Plato, that he might
   not make the work of God weak and subject to ruin, said that it would
   remain for ever. If it was made for the sake of men, and so made as to
   be eternal, why then are not they on whose account it was made eternal?
   If they are mortal on account of whom it was made, it must also itself
   be mortal and subject to dissolution, for it is not of more value than
   those for whose sake it was made. But if his argument [1303] were
   consistent, he would understand that it must perish because it was
   made, and that nothing can remain for ever except that which cannot be
   touched.

   But he who says that it was not made for the sake of men has no
   argument. For if he says that the Creator contrived these works of such
   magnitude on His own account, why then were we produced? Why do we
   enjoy the world itself? what means the creation of the human race, and
   of the other living creatures? why do we intercept the advantages of
   others? why, in short, do we grow, decrease, and perish? What reason is
   implied in our production itself? what in our perpetual succession?
   Doubtless God wished us to be seen, and to frame, as it were,
   impressions [1304] with various representations of Himself, with which
   He might delight Himself. Nevertheless, if it were so, He would esteem
   living creatures as His care, and especially man, to whose command He
   made all things subject. But with regard to those who say that the
   world always existed: I omit that point, that itself cannot exist
   without some beginning, from which they are unable to extricate
   themselves; but I say this, if the world always existed, it can have no
   systematic arrangement. [1305] For what could arrangement have effected
   in that which never had a beginning? For before anything is done or
   arranged, there is need of counsel that it may be determined how it
   should be done; nor can anything be done without the foresight of a
   settled plan. Therefore the plan precedes every work. Therefore that
   which has not been made has no plan. But the world has a plan by which
   it both exists and is governed; therefore also it was made: if it was
   made, it will also be destroyed. Let them therefore assign a reason, if
   they can, why it was either made in the beginning or will hereafter be
   destroyed.

   And because Epicurus or Democritus was unable to teach this, he said
   that it was produced of its own accord, the seeds [1306] coming
   together in all directions; and that when these are again resolved,
   discord and destruction will follow. Therefore he perverted [1307] that
   which he had correctly seen, and by his ignorance of system entirely
   overthrew the whole system, and reduced the world, and all things which
   are done in it, to the likeness of a most trifling dream, if no plan
   exists in human affairs. But since the world and all its parts, as we
   see, are governed by a wonderful plan; since the framing of the heaven,
   and the course of the stars and of the heavenly bodies, which is
   harmonious [1308] even in variety itself, the constant and wonderful
   arrangement of the seasons, the varied fruitfulness of the lands, the
   level plains, the defences and heapings up of mountains, the verdure
   and productiveness of the woods, the most salubrious bursting forth of
   fountains, the seasonable overflowings of rivers, the rich and abundant
   flowing [1309] in of the sea, the opposite and useful breathing [1310]
   of the winds, and all things, are fixed with the greatest regularity:
   who is so blind as to think that they were made without a cause, in
   which a wonderful disposition of most provident arrangement shines
   forth? If, therefore, nothing at all exists nor is done without a
   cause; if the providence of the Supreme God is manifest from the
   disposition of things, His excellency from their greatness, and His
   power from their government: therefore they are dull and mad who have
   said that there is no providence. I should not disapprove if they
   denied the existence of gods with this object, that they might affirm
   the existence of one; but when they did it with this intent, that they
   might say that there is none, he who does not think that they were
   senseless is himself senseless.

    Chap. IV.--That All Things Were Created for Some Use, Even Those Things
    Which Appear Evil; On What Account Man Enjoys Reason in So Frail a Body.

   But we have spoken sufficiently on the subject of providence in the
   first book. For if it has any existence, as appears from the wonderful
   nature of its works, it must be that the same providence created man
   and the other animals. Let us therefore see what reason there was for
   the creation of the human race, since it is evident, as the Stoics say,
   that the world was made for the sake of men, although they make no
   slight error in this very matter, in saying it was not made for the
   sake of man, but of men. For the naming of one individual comprehends
   the whole human race. But this arises from the fact that they are
   ignorant that one man only was made by God, and they think that men
   were produced in all lands and fields like mushrooms. But Hermes was
   not ignorant that man was both made by God and after the likeness of
   God. But I return to my subject. There is nothing, as I imagine, which
   was made on its own account; but whatever is made at all must
   necessarily be made for some purpose. For who is there either so
   senseless or so unconcerned as to attempt to do anything at random,
   from which he expects no utility, no advantage? He who builds a house
   does not build it merely for this purpose, that it may be a house, but
   that it may be inhabited. He who builds a ship does not bestow his
   labour on this account, only that the ship may be visible, but that men
   may sail in it. Likewise he who designs and forms any vessel does not
   do it on this account, that he may only appear to have done it, but
   that the vessel when made may contain something necessary for use. In
   like manner, other things, whatever are made, are plainly not made
   superfluously, but for some useful purposes.

   It is plain, therefore, that the world was made by God, not on account
   of the world itself; for since it is without sensibility, it neither
   needs the warmth of the sun, or light, or the breath of the winds, or
   the moisture of showers, or the nourishment of fruits. But it cannot
   even be said that God made the world for His own sake, since He can
   exist without the world, as He did before it was made; and God Himself
   does not make use of all those things which are contained in it, and
   which are produced. It is evident, therefore, that the world was
   constructed for the sake of living beings, since living beings enjoy
   those things of which it consists; and that these may live and exist,
   all things necessary for them are supplied at fixed times. Again, that
   the other living beings were made for the sake of man, is plain from
   this, that they are subservient to man, and were given for his
   protection and service; since, whether they are of the earth or of the
   water, they do not perceive the system of the world as man does. We
   must here reply to the philosophers, and especially to Cicero, who
   says: "Why should God, when He made all things on our account, make so
   large a quantity of snakes and vipers? why should He scatter so many
   pernicious things by land and by sea?" A very wide subject for
   discussion, but it must be briefly touched upon, as in passing. Since
   man is formed of different and opposing elements, soul and body, that
   is, heaven and earth, that which is slight and that which is
   perceptible to the senses, that which is eternal and that which is
   temporal, that which has sensibility and that which is senseless, that
   which is endued with light and that which is dark, reason itself and
   necessity require that both good and evil things should be set before
   man--good things which he may use, and evil things which he may guard
   against and avoid.

   For wisdom has been given to him on this account, that, knowing the
   nature of good and evil things, he may exercise the force of his reason
   in seeking the good and avoiding the evil. For because wisdom was not
   given to the other animals, they were both defended with natural
   clothing and were armed; but in the place of all these He gave to man
   that which was most excellent, reason only. Therefore He formed him
   naked and unarmed, that wisdom might be both his defence and covering.
   He placed his defence and ornament not without, but within not in the
   body, but in the heart. Unless, therefore, there were evils which he
   might guard against, and which he might distinguish from good and
   useful things, wisdom was not necessary for him. Therefore let Marcus
   Tullius know that reason was either given to man that he might take
   fishes on account of his own use, and avoid snakes and vipers for the
   sake of his own safety; or that good and evil things were set before
   him on this account, because he had received wisdom, the whole force of
   which is occupied in distinguishing things good and evil. [1311] Great,
   therefore, and right, and admirable is the force, and reason, and power
   of man, for whose sake God made the world itself and all things, as
   many as exist, and gave him so much honour that He set him over all
   things, since he alone could admire the works of God. Most excellently,
   therefore, does our Asclepiades, [1312] in discussing the providence of
   the Supreme God in that book which he wrote to me, say: "And on this
   account any one may with good reason think that the divine providence
   gave the place nearest to itself to him who was able to understand its
   arrangement. For that is the sun: who so beholds it as to understand
   why it is the sun, and what amount of influence it has upon the other
   parts of the system? this is the heaven, who looks up to it? this is
   the earth, who inhabits it? this is the sea, who sails upon it? this is
   fire, who makes use of it?" Therefore the Supreme God did not arrange
   these things on account of Himself, because He stands in need of
   nothing, but on account of man, who might fitly make use of them.

    Chap. V.--Of the Creation of Man, and of the Arrangement of the World, and
    of the Chief Good.

   Let us now assign the reason why He made man himself. For if the
   philosophers had known this, they would either have maintained those
   things which they had found to be true, or would not have fallen into
   the greatest errors. For this is the chief thing; this is the point on
   which everything turns. And if any one does not possess this, the truth
   altogether glides away from him. It is this, in short, which causes
   them to be inconsistent with reason; [1313] for if this had shone upon
   them, if they had known all the mystery [1314] of man, the Academy
   would never have been in entire opposition [1315] to their
   disputations, and to all philosophy. As, therefore, God did not make
   the world for His own sake, because He does not stand in need of its
   advantages, but for the sake of man, who has the use of it, so also He
   made man himself for His own sake. What advantage is there to God in
   man, says Epicurus, that He should make him for His own sake? Truly,
   that there might be one who might understand His works; who might be
   able both to admire with his understanding, and to express with his
   voice, the foresight displayed in their arrangement, the order of their
   creation, the power exerted in their completion. And the sum of all
   these things is, that he should worship God. [1316] For he who
   understands these things worships Him; he follows Him with due
   veneration as the Maker of all things, He as his true Father, who
   measures the excellence of His majesty according to the invention, the
   commencement, and completion of His works. What more evident argument
   can be brought forward that God both made the world for the sake of
   man, and man for His own sake, than that he alone of all living
   creatures has been so formed that his eyes are directed towards heaven,
   his face looking towards God, his countenance is in fellowship with his
   Parent, so that God appears, as it were, with outstretched hand to have
   raised man from the ground, and to have elevated him to the
   contemplation of Himself. "What, then," he says, "does the worship paid
   by man confer on God, who is blessed, and in want of nothing? Or if He
   gave such honour to man as to create the world for his sake, to furnish
   him with wisdom, to make him lord of all things living, and to love him
   as a son, why did He make him subject to death and decay? why did He
   expose the object of His love to all evils? when it was befitting that
   man should be happy, as though closely connected with God, and
   everlasting as He is, to the worship and contemplation of whom he was
   formed."

   Although we have taught these things for the most part in a scattered
   manner in the former books, nevertheless, since the subject now
   specially requires it, because we have undertaken to discuss the
   subject of a happy life, these things are to be explained by us more
   carefully and fully, that the arrangement made by God, and His work and
   will, may be known. Though He was always able by His own immortal
   Spirit to produce innumerable souls, as He produced the angels, to whom
   there exists immortality without any danger and fear of evils, yet He
   devised an unspeakable work, in what manner He might create an infinite
   multitude of souls, which being at first united with frail and feeble
   bodies, He might place in the midst between good and evil, that He
   might set virtue before them composed as they were of both natures;
   that they might not attain to immortality by a delicate and easy course
   of life, but might arrive at that unspeakable reward of eternal life
   with the utmost difficulty and great labours. Therefore, that He might
   clothe them with limbs which were heavy and liable to injury, [1317]
   since they were unable to exist in the middle void, the weight and
   gravity of the body sinking downwards, He determined that an abode and
   dwelling-place should first be built for them. And thus with
   unspeakable energy and power He contrived the surpassing works of the
   world; and having suspended the light elements on high, and depressed
   the heavy ones to the depths below, He strengthened the heavenly
   things, and established the earthly. It is not necessary at present to
   follow out each point separately, since we discussed them all together
   in the second book.

   Therefore He placed in the heaven lights, whose regularity, and
   brightness, and motion, were most suitably proportioned to the
   advantage of living beings. Moreover, He gave to the earth, which He
   designed as their dwelling-place, fruitfulness for bringing forth and
   producing various [1318] things, that by the abundance of fruits and
   green herbs it might supply nourishment according to the nature and
   requirements of each kind. Then, when He had completed all things which
   belonged to the condition of the world, He formed man from the earth
   itself, which He prepared for him from the beginning as a habitation;
   that is, He clothed and covered his spirit with an earthly body, that,
   being compacted of different and opposing materials, he might be
   susceptible of good and evil; and as the earth itself is fruitful for
   the bringing forth of grain, so the body of man, which was taken from
   the earth, received the power of producing offspring, that, inasmuch as
   he was formed of a fragile substance, and could not exist for ever,
   when the space of his temporal life was past, he might depart, and by a
   perpetual succession renew that which he bore, which was frail and
   feeble. Why, then, did He make him frail and mortal, when He had built
   the world for his sake? First of all, that an infinite number of living
   beings might be produced, and that He might fill all the earth with a
   multitude; in the next place, that He might set before man virtue, that
   is, endurance of evils and labours, by which he might be able to gain
   the reward of immortality. For since man consists of two parts, body
   and soul, of which the one is earthly, the other heavenly, two lives
   have been assigned to man: the one temporal, which is appointed for the
   body; the other everlasting, which belongs to the soul. We received the
   former at our birth we attain to the latter by striving, that
   immortality might not exist to man without any difficulty. That earthly
   one is as the body, and therefore has an end; but this heavenly one is
   as the soul, and therefore has no limit. We received the first when we
   were ignorant of it, this second knowingly; for it is given to virtue,
   not to nature, because God wished that we should procure life for
   ourselves in life.

   For this reason He has given us this present life, that we may either
   lose that true and eternal life by our vices, or win it [1319] by
   virtue. The chief good is not contained in this bodily life, since, as
   it was given to us by divine necessity, so it will again be destroyed
   by divine necessity. Thus that which has an end does not contain the
   chief good. But the chief good is contained in that spiritual life
   which we acquire by ourselves, because it cannot contain evil, or have
   an end; to which subject nature and the system of the body afford an
   argument. For other animals incline towards the ground, because they
   are earthly, and are incapable of immortality, which is from heaven;
   but man is upright and looks towards heaven, [1320] because immortality
   is proposed to him; which, however, does not come, unless it is given
   to man by God. For otherwise there would be no difference between the
   just and the unjust, since every man who is born would become immortal.
   Immortality, then, is not the consequence [1321] of nature, but the
   reward and recompense of virtue. Lastly, man does not immediately upon
   his birth walk upright, but at first on all fours, [1322] because the
   nature of his body and of this present life is common to us with the
   dumb animals; afterwards, when his strength is confirmed, he raises
   himself, and his tongue is loosened so that he speaks plainly, and he
   ceases to be a dumb animal. And this argument teaches that man is born
   mortal; but that he afterwards becomes immortal, when he begins to live
   in conformity with the will [1323] of God, that is, to follow
   righteousness, [1324] which is comprised in the worship of God, since
   God raised man to a view of the heaven and of Himself. And this takes
   place when man, purified in the heavenly laver, lays aside [1325] his
   infancy together with all the pollution of his past life, and having
   received an increase of divine vigour, becomes a perfect and complete
   man.

   Therefore, because God has set forth virtue before man, although the
   soul and the body are connected together, yet they are contrary, and
   oppose one another. The things which are good for the soul are evil to
   the body, that is, the avoiding of riches, the prohibiting of
   pleasures, the contempt of pain and death. In like manner, the things
   which are good for the body are evil to the soul, that is, desire and
   lust, by which riches are desired, and the enjoyments of various
   pleasures, by which the soul is weakened and destroyed. [1326]
   Therefore it is necessary, that the just and wise man should be engaged
   in all evils, since fortitude is victorious over evils; but the unjust
   in riches, in honours, in power. For these goods relate to the body,
   and are earthly; and these men also lead an earthly life, nor are they
   able to attain to immortality, because they have given themselves up to
   pleasures which are the enemies of virtue. Therefore this temporal life
   ought to be subject to that eternal life, as the body is to the soul.
   Whoever, then, prefers the life of the soul must despise the life of
   the body; nor will he in any other way be able to strive after that
   which is highest, unless he shall have despised the things which are
   lowest. But he who shall have embraced the life of the body, and shall
   have turned his desires downwards [1327] to the earth, is unable to
   attain to that higher life. But he who prefers to live well for
   eternity, will live badly [1328] for a time, and will be subjected to
   all troubles and labours as long as he shall be on earth, that he may
   have divine and heavenly consolation. And he who shall prefer to live
   well [1329] for a time, will live ill to eternity; for he will be
   condemned by the sentence of God to eternal punishment, because he has
   preferred earthly to heavenly goods. On this account, therefore, God
   seeks to be worshipped, and to be honoured by man as a Father, that he
   may have virtue and wisdom, which alone produce immortality. For
   because no other but Himself is able to confer that immortality, since
   He alone possesses it, He will grant [1330] to the piety of the man,
   with which he has honoured God, this reward, to be blessed to all
   eternity, and to be for ever in the presence of God and in the society
   of God.

   N.B.--The following paragraphs to the end of the chapter are wanting
   many mss., and it is very doubtful whether they were written by
   Lactantius.

   Nor can any one shelter himself under the pretext that the fault
   belongs to Him who made both good and evil. For why did He will that
   evil should exist if He hated it? Why did He not make good only, that
   no one might sin, no one commit evil? Although I have explained this in
   almost all the former books, and have touched upon it, though slightly,
   above, yet it must be mentioned repeatedly, because the whole matter
   turns on this point. For there could be no virtue unless He had made
   contrary things; nor can the power of good be at all manifest, except
   from a comparison with evil. Thus evil is nothing else but the
   explanation of good. Therefore if evil is taken away, good must also be
   taken away. If you shall cut off your left hand or foot, your body will
   not be entire, nor will life itself remain the same. Thus, for the due
   adjustment of the framework of the body, the left members are most
   suitably joined with the right. In like manner, if you make chessmen
   [1331] all alike, no one will play. If you shall give one colour [1332]
   only to the circus, no one will think it worth while to be a spectator,
   all the pleasure of the Circensian games being taken away. For he who
   first instituted the games was a favourer of one colour; but he
   introduced another as a rival, that there might be a contest, and some
   partisanship [1333] in the spectacle. Thus God, when He was fixing that
   which was good, and giving virtue, appointed also their contraries,
   with which they might contend. If an enemy and a fight be wanting,
   there is no victory. Take away a contest, and even virtue is nothing.
   How many are the mutual contests of men, and with what various arts are
   they carried on! No one, however, would be regarded as surpassing in
   bravery, swiftness, or excellence, if he bad no adversary with whom he
   might contend. And where victory is wanting, there also glory and the
   reward of victory must be absent together with it. Therefore, that he
   might strengthen virtue itself by continual exercise, and might make it
   perfect from its conflict with evils, He gave both together, because
   each of the two without the other is unable to retain its force.
   Therefore there is diversity, on which the whole system of truth
   depends.

   It does not escape my notice what may here be urged in opposition by
   more skilful persons. If good cannot exist without evil, how do you say
   that, before he had offended God, the first man lived in the exercise
   of good only, or that he will hereafter live in the exercise of good
   only? This question is to be examined by us, for in the former books I
   omitted it, that I might here fill up the subject. We have said above
   that the nature of man is made up of opposing elements; for the body,
   because it is earth, is capable of being grasped, of temporary
   duration, senseless, and dark. But the soul, because it is from heaven,
   is unsubstantial, [1334] everlasting, endued with sensibility, and full
   of lustre; [1335] and because these qualities are opposed to one
   another, it follows of necessity that man is subject to good and evil.
   Good is ascribed to the soul, because it is incapable of dissolution;
   evil to the body, because it is frail. Since, therefore, the body and
   the soul are connected and united together, the good and the evil must
   necessarily hold together; nor can they be separated from one another,
   unless when they (the body and soul) are separated. Finally, the
   knowledge of good and of evil was given at the same time to the first
   man; and when he understood this, he was immediately driven from the
   holy place in which there is no evil; for when he was conversant with
   that which was good only, he was ignorant that this itself was good.
   But after that he had received the knowledge of good and evil, it was
   now unlawful for him to remain in that place of happiness, and he was
   banished to this common world, that he might at once experience both of
   those things with the nature of which he had at once become acquainted.
   It is plain, therefore, that wisdom has been given to man that he may
   distinguish good from evil--that he may discriminate between things
   advantageous and things disadvantageous, between things useful and
   things useless--that he may have judgment and consideration as to what
   he ought to guard against, what to desire, what to avoid, and what to
   follow. Wisdom therefore cannot exist without evil; and that first
   author [1336] of the human race, as long as he was conversant with good
   only, lived as an infant, ignorant of good and evil. But, indeed,
   hereafter man must be both wise and happy without any evil; but this
   cannot take place as long as the soul is clothed with the abode of the
   body.

   But when a separation shall have been made between the body and the
   soul, then evil will be disunited from good; and as the body perishes
   and the soul remains, so evil will perish and good be permanent. Then
   man, having received the garment of immortality, will be wise and free
   from evil, as God is. He, therefore, who wishes that we should be
   conversant with good only, especially desires this, that we should live
   without the body, in which evil is. But if evil is taken away, either
   wisdom, as I have said, or the body, will be taken from man; wisdom,
   that he may be ignorant of evil; the body, that he may not be sensible
   of it. But now, since man is furnished with wisdom to know, and a body
   to perceive, God willed that both should exist alike in this life, that
   virtue and wisdom may be in agreement. Therefore He placed man in the
   midst, between both, that he might have liberty to follow either good
   or evil. But He mingled with evil some things which appear good, that
   is, various and delightful enjoyments, that by the enticements of these
   He might lead men to the concealed evil. And He likewise mingled with
   good some things which appear evil--that is, hardships, and miseries,
   and labours--by the harshness and unpleasantness of which the soul,
   being offended, might shrink back from the concealed good. But here the
   office of wisdom is needed, that we may see more with the mind than
   with the body, which very few are able to do; because while virtue is
   difficult and rarely to be found, pleasure is common and public. Thus
   it necessarily happens that the wise man is accounted as a fool, who,
   while he seeks good things which are not seen, permits those which are
   seen to slip from his hands; and while he avoids evils which are not
   seen, runs into evils which are before the eyes; which happens to us
   when we refuse neither torture nor death in behalf of the faith, since
   we are driven to the greatest wickedness, so as to betray the faith and
   deny the true God, and to sacrifice to dead and death-bearing gods.
   This is the cause why God made man mortal, and made him subject to
   evils, although he had framed the world for his sake, namely, that he
   might be capable of virtue, and that his virtue might reward him with
   immortality. Now virtue, as we have shown, is the worship of the true
   God.

    Chap. VI.--Why the World and Man Were Created. How Unprofitable is the
    Worship of False Gods.

   Now let us mark the whole argument by a brief definition. [1337] The
   world has been created for this purpose, that we may be born; we are
   born for this end, that we may acknowledge the Maker of the world and
   of ourselves--God; we acknowledge Him for this end, that we may worship
   Him; we worship Him for this end, that we may receive immortality as
   the reward of our labours, since the worship of God consists of the
   greatest labours; for this end we are rewarded with immortality, that
   being made like to the angels, we may serve the Supreme Father and Lord
   for ever, and may be to all eternity a kingdom to God. This is the sum
   of all things, this the secret of God, this the mystery of the world,
   from which they are estranged, who, following present gratification,
   have devoted themselves to the pursuit of earthly and frail goods, and
   by means of deadly enjoyments have sunk as it were in mire and mud
   their souls, which were born for heavenly pursuits.

   Let us now, in the next place, inquire whether there is anything
   reasonable in the worship of these gods; for if they are many, if they
   are worshipped only on this account by men, that they may afford them
   riches, victories, honours, and all things, which are of no avail
   except for the present; if we are produced without cause--if no
   providence is employed in the production of men--if we are brought
   forth by chance for ourselves, and for the sake of our own pleasure--if
   we are nothing after death,--what can be so superfluous, so empty, so
   vain, as the affairs of man, and the world itself? which, though it is
   of incredible magnitude, and constructed with such wonderful
   arrangement, is nevertheless occupied with trifling subjects. For why
   should the breathings of the winds put the clouds in motion? Why should
   lightnings shine forth, thunders roar, or showers fall, that the earth
   may bring forth its increase, and nourish its various productions? Why,
   in short, should all nature labour that nothing may be wanting of those
   things by which the life of man is sustained, if it is vain, if we
   utterly perish, if there is in us nothing of greater advantage to God?
   But if it is unlawful to be spoken, and is not to be thought possible,
   that that which you see to be most in accordance with reason was not
   established on account of some reason of importance, what reason can
   there be in these errors of depraved religions, and in this persuasion
   of philosophers, by which they imagine that souls perish? Assuredly
   there is none; for what have they to say why the gods so regularly
   supply to men everything in its season? Is it that we may present to
   them corn and wine, and the odour of incense, and the blood of cattle?
   Which things cannot be acceptable to the immortals, because they are
   perishable; nor can they be of use to beings destitute of bodies,
   because these things have been given for the use of those possessed of
   bodies; and yet if they required these things, they could bestow them
   upon themselves when they wished. Whether, therefore, souls perish or
   exist for ever, what principle is involved in the worship of the gods,
   or by whom was the world established? Why, or when, or how long, or how
   far were men produced, or on what account? Why do they arise, die,
   succeed one another, are renewed? What do the gods obtain from the
   worship of those who after death are about to have no existence? What
   do they perform, what do they promise, what do they threaten, which is
   worthy of men or of gods? Or if souls remain after death, what do they
   do or are they about to do respecting them? What need is there to them
   of a treasure-house of souls? From what source do they themselves
   arise? How, or why, or whence are they so many? Thus it comes to pass,
   that if you depart from that sum of things which we comprised above,
   all system is destroyed, and all things return [1338] to nothing.

    Chap. VII.--Of the Variety of Philosophers, and Their Truth.

   And because the philosophers did not comprehend this main point, they
   were neither able to comprehend truth, although they for the most part
   both saw and explained those things of which the main point itself
   consists. But different persons brought forward all these things, and
   in different ways, not connecting the causes of things, nor the
   consequences, nor the reasons, so that they might join together and
   complete that main point which comprises the whole. But it is easy to
   show that almost the whole truth has been divided by philosophers and
   sects. For we do not overthrow philosophy, as the Academics are
   accustomed to do, whose plan was to reply to everything, which is
   rather to calumniate and mock; but we show that no sect was so much out
   of the way, and no philosopher so vain, as not to see something of the
   truth. [1339] But while they are mad with the desire of contradicting,
   while they defend their own arguments even though false, and overthrow
   those of others even though true, not only has the truth escaped from
   them, which they pretended that they were seeking, but they themselves
   lost it chiefly through their own fault. But if there had been any one
   to collect together the truth which was dispersed amongst individuals
   and scattered amongst sects, and to reduce it to a body, he assuredly
   would not disagree with us. But no one is able to do this, unless he
   has experience [1340] and knowledge of the truth. But to know the truth
   belongs to him only who has been taught by God. For he cannot in any
   other way reject the things which are false, or choose and approve of
   those which are true; but if even by chance he should effect this, he
   would most surely act the part of the philosopher; and though he could
   not defend those things by divine testimonies, yet the truth would
   explain itself by its own light. Wherefore the error of those is
   incredible, who, when they have approved of any sect, and have devoted
   themselves to it, condemn all others as false and vain, and arm
   themselves for battle, neither knowing what they ought to defend nor
   what to refute; and make attacks everywhere, without distinction,
   [1341] upon all things which are brought forward by those who disagree
   with them.

   On account of these most obstinate contentions of theirs, no philosophy
   existed which made a nearer approach to the truth, for the whole truth
   has been comprised by these in separate portions. [1342] Plato said
   [1343] that the world was made by God: the prophets [1344] speak the
   same; and the same is apparent from the verses of the Sibyl. They
   therefore are in error, who have said either that all things were
   produced of their own accord or from an assemblage of atoms; [1345]
   since so great a world, so adorned and of such magnitude, could neither
   have been made nor arranged and set in order without some most skilful
   author, and that very arrangement by which all things are perceived to
   be kept together and to be governed bespeaks [1346] an artificer with a
   most skilful mind. The Stoics say that the world, and all things which
   are in it, were made for the sake of men: the sacred writings [1347]
   teach us the same thing. Therefore Democritus was in error, who thought
   that they were poured forth from the earth like worms, without any
   author or plan. For the reason of man's creation belongs to a divine
   mystery; and because he was unable to know this, he drew [1348] down
   man's life to nothing. Aristo asserted that men were born to the
   exercise of virtue; we are also reminded of and learn the same from the
   prophets. Therefore Aristippus is deceived, who made man subject to
   pleasure, that is, to evil, as though he were a beast. Pherecydes and
   Plato contended that souls were immortal; but this is a peculiar
   doctrine in our religion. Therefore Dicæarchus was mistaken, together
   with Democritus, who argued that souls perished with the body and were
   dissolved, Zeno the Stoic taught that there were infernal regions, and
   that the abodes of the good were separated from the wicked; and that
   the former enjoyed peaceful and delightful regions, but that the latter
   suffered punishment in dark places, and in dreadful abysses of mire:
   the prophets show the same thing. Therefore Epicurus was mistaken, who
   thought that that was an invention [1349] of the poets, and explained
   those punishments of the infernal regions, which are spoken of, as
   happening in this life. Therefore the philosophers touched upon the
   whole truth, and every secret of our holy religion; but when others
   denied it, they were unable to defend that which they had found,
   because the system did not agree [1350] with the particulars; nor were
   they able to reduce to a summary those things which they had perceived
   to be true, as we have done above.

    Chap. VIII.--Of the Immortality of the Soul.

   The one chief good, therefore, is immortality, for the reception of
   which we were originally formed and born. To this we direct our course;
   human nature regards this; to this virtue exalts us. And because we
   have discovered this good, it remains that we should also speak of
   immortality itself. The arguments of Plato, although they contribute
   much to the subject, have little strength to prove and fill up the
   truth, since he had neither summed up and collected into one the plan
   of the whole of this great mystery, nor had he comprehended the chief
   good. For although he perceived the truth respecting the immortality of
   the soul, yet he did not speak respecting it as though it were the
   chief good. We, therefore, are able to elicit the truth by more certain
   signs; for we have not collected it by doubtful surmise, [1351] but
   have known it by divine instruction. Now Plato thus reasoned, that
   whatever has perception by itself, and always moves, is immortal; for
   that that which has no beginning of motion is not about to have an end,
   because it cannot be deserted by itself. But this argument would give
   eternal existence even to dumb animals, unless he had made a
   distinction by the addition of wisdom. He added, therefore, that he
   might escape this common [1352] linking together, that the soul of man
   could not be otherwise than immortal, since its wonderful skill in
   invention, its quickness in reflection, and its readiness in perceiving
   and learning, its memory of the past, and its foresight of the future,
   and its knowledge of innumerable arts and subjects, which other living
   creatures do not possess, appear divine and heavenly; because of the
   soul, which conceives such great things, and contains such great
   things, no origin can be found on earth, since it has nothing of
   earthly admixture united with it. But that which is ponderous in man,
   and liable to dissolution, must be resolved into earth; whereas that
   which is slight and subtle is incapable of division, and when freed
   from the abode of the body, as from prison, it flies to the heaven, and
   to its own nature. This is a brief summary of the tenets of Plato,
   which are widely and copiously explained in his own writings.

   Pythagoras also was previously of the same sentiments, and his teacher
   Pherecydes, whom Cicero reported to have been the first who discoursed
   respecting the immortality of the soul. And although all these excelled
   in eloquence, nevertheless in this contest at least, those who argued
   against this opinion had no less authority; Dicæarchus first, then
   Democritus, and lastly Epicurus: so that the matter itself, respecting
   which they were contending, was called into doubt. Finally, Tullius
   also having set forth the opinions of all these respecting immortality
   and death, declared that he did not know what was the truth. "Which of
   these opinions is true," he said, "some God may see." [1353] And again
   he says in another place: "Since each of these opinions had most
   learned defenders, it cannot be divined what is certainty." But we have
   no need of divination, since the divinity itself has laid open to us
   the truth.

    Chap. IX.--Of the Immortality of the Soul, and of Virtue.

   By these arguments, therefore, which neither Plato nor any other
   invented, the immorality of souls can be proved and perceived: which
   arguments we will briefly collect, since my discourse hastens on to
   relate the great judgment of God, which will be celebrated on the earth
   at the approaching end of the world. [1354] Before all things, since
   God cannot be seen by man, lest any one should imagine from this
   circumstance that God does not exist, because He was not seen by mortal
   eyes, among other wonderful arrangements. [1355] He also made many
   things the power of which is manifest, but the substance is not seen,
   as the voice, smell, the wind, that by the token and example of these
   things we might perceive God from His power and operation and works,
   although He did not fall under the notice of our eyes. What is clearer
   than the voice, or stronger than the wind, or more forcible than smell?
   Yet these, when they are borne through the air and come to our senses,
   and impel them by their efficacy, are not distinguished by the
   eyesight, but are perceived by other parts of the body. In like manner,
   God is not to be perceived by us through the sight or other frail
   sense; but He is to be beheld by the eyes of the mind, since we see His
   illustrious and wonderful works. For as to those who have altogether
   denied the existence of God, I should not only refuse to call them
   philosophers, but even deny them the name of men, who, with a close
   resemblance to dumb animals, consisted of body only, discerning nothing
   with their mind, and referring all things to the bodily senses, who
   thought that nothing existed but that which they beheld with their
   eyes. And because they saw that adversity befell the wicked, or
   prosperity happened to the good, they believed that all things were
   carried on by fortune, and that the world was established by nature,
   and not by providence.

   Hence they at once fell into the absurdities [1356] which necessarily
   followed such a sentiment. But if there is a God who is incorporeal,
   invisible, and eternal, therefore it is credible that the soul, since
   it is not seen, does not perish after its departure from the body; for
   it is manifest that something exists which perceives and is vigorous,
   and yet does not come into sight. But, it is said, it is difficult to
   comprehend with the mind how the soul can retain its perception without
   those parts of the body in which the office of perception is contained.
   What about God? Is it easy to comprehend how He is vigorous without a
   body? But if they believe in the existence of gods who, if they exist,
   are plainly destitute of bodies, it must be that human souls exist in
   the same way, since it is perceived from reason itself, and
   discernment, that there is a certain resemblance in man and God.
   Finally, that proof which even Marcus Tullius [1357] saw is of
   sufficient strength: that the immortality of the soul may be discerned
   from the fact that there is no other animal which has any knowledge of
   God; and religion is almost the only thing which distinguishes man from
   the dumb creation. And since this falls to man alone, it assuredly
   testifies that we may aim at, desire, and cultivate that which is about
   to be familiar and very near.

   Can any one, when he has considered the nature of other animals, which
   the providence of the Supreme God has made abject, with bodies bending
   down and prostrated to the earth, so that it may be understood from
   this that they have no intercourse with heaven, fail to understand that
   man alone of all animals is heavenly and divine, whose body raised from
   the ground, [1358] elevated countenance, and upright position, goes in
   quest of its origin, and despising, as it were, the lowliness of the
   earth, reaches forth to that which is on high, because he perceives
   that the highest good is to be sought by him in the highest place, and
   mindful of his condition in which God made him illustrious, looks
   towards his Maker? And Trismegistus most rightly called this looking a
   contemplation of God, [1359] which has no existence in the dumb
   animals. Since therefore wisdom, which is given to man alone, is
   nothing else but the knowledge of God, it is evident that the soul does
   not perish, nor undergo dissolution, but that it remains for ever,
   because it seeks after and loves God, who is everlasting, by the
   impulse of its very nature perceiving either from what source it has
   sprung, or to what it is about to return. Moreover, it is no slight
   proof of immortality that man alone makes use of the heavenly element.
   For, since the nature of the world consists of two elements [1360]
   which are opposed to one another--fire and water--of which the one is
   assigned to the heaven, the other to the earth, the other living
   creatures, because they are of the earth and mortal, make use of the
   element which is earthly and heavy: man alone makes use of fire, which
   is an element light, rising upward, [1361] and heavenly. But those
   things which are weighty depress to death, and those which are light
   elevate to life; because life is on high, and death below. And as there
   cannot be light without fire, so there cannot be life without light.
   Therefore fire is the element of light and life; from which it is
   evident that man who uses it is a partaker of an immortal condition,
   because that which causes life is familiar to him.

   The gift of virtue also to man alone is a great proof that souls are
   immortal. For this will not be in accordance with nature if the soul is
   extinguished; for it is injurious to this present life. For that
   earthly life, which we lead in common with dumb animals, both seeks
   pleasure, by the varied and agreeable fruits of which it is delighted,
   and avoids pain, the harshness of which, by its unpleasant sensations,
   injures the nature of living beings, and endeavours to lead them to
   death, which dissolves the living being. If, therefore, virtue both
   prohibits man from those goods which are naturally desired, and impels
   him to endure evils which are naturally avoided, it follows that virtue
   is an evil, and opposed to nature; and he must necessarily be judged
   foolish who pursues it, since he injures himself both by avoiding
   present goods, and by seeking equally evils, without hope of greater
   advantage. For when it is permitted us to enjoy the sweetest pleasures,
   should we not appear to be without sense if we should not prefer to
   live in lowliness, in want, in contempt and ignominy, or not to live at
   all, but to be tormented with pain, and to die, when from these evils
   we should gain nothing to compensate us for the pleasure which we have
   given up? But if virtue is not an evil, and acts honourably, inasmuch
   as it despises vicious and shameful pleasures, and bravely, inasmuch as
   it neither fears pain nor death, that it may discharge its duty,
   therefore it must obtain some greater good than those things are which
   it despises. But when death has been undergone, what further good can
   be hoped for except immortality?

    Chap. X.--Of Vices and Virtues, and of Life and Death.

   Let us now in turn pass on to those things which are opposed to virtue,
   that from these also the immortality of the soul may be inferred. All
   vices are for a time; for they are excited for the present. The
   impetuosity of anger is appeased when vengeance has been taken; the
   pleasure of the body puts an end [1362] to lust; desire is destroyed
   either by the full enjoyment of the objects which it seeks, or by the
   excitement of other affections; ambition, when it has gained the
   honours which it wished for, loses [1363] its strength; likewise the
   other vices are unable to stand their ground and remain, but they are
   ended by the very enjoyment which they desire. Therefore they withdraw
   and return. But virtue is perpetual, without any intermission; nor can
   he who has once taken it up depart from it. For if it should have any
   interruption, [1364] if we can at any time do without it, vices, which
   always oppose virtue, will return. Therefore it has not been grasped,
   if it deserts its post, if at any time it withdraws itself. But when it
   has established for itself a firm abode, it must necessarily be engaged
   in every act; nor can it faithfully drive away and put to flight vices,
   unless it shall fortify with a perpetual guard the breast which it
   inhabits. Therefore the uninterrupted duration [1365] of virtue itself
   shows that the soul of man, if it has received virtue, remains
   permanent, because virtue is perpetual, and it is the human mind alone
   which receives virtue. Since, therefore, vices are contrary to virtue,
   the whole systems must of necessity differ from and be contrary to each
   other. Because vices are commotions and perturbations of the soul;
   virtue, on the contrary, is mildness and tranquillity of mind. Because
   vices are temporary, and of short duration; virtue is perpetual and
   constant, and always consistent with itself. Because the fruits of
   vices, that is, pleasures, equally with themselves, are short and
   temporary, therefore the fruit and reward of virtue are everlasting.
   Because the advantage of vices is immediate, therefore that of virtue
   is future.

   Thus it happens that in this life there is no reward of virtue, because
   virtue itself still exists. For as, when vices are completed in their
   performance, pleasure and their rewards follow; so, when virtue has
   been ended, its reward follows. But virtue is never ended except by
   death, since its highest office is in the undergoing of death:
   therefore the reward of virtue is after death. In fine, Cicero, in his
   Tusculan Disputations, [1366] perceived, though with doubt, that the
   chief good does not happen to man except after death. "A man will go,"
   he says, "with confident spirit, if circumstances shall so happen, to
   death, in which we have ascertained that there is either the chief good
   or no evil." Death, therefore, does not extinguish man, but admits him
   to the reward of virtue. But he who has contaminated himself, [1367] as
   the same writer says, with vices and crimes, and has been the slave of
   pleasure, he truly, being condemned, shall suffer eternal punishment,
   which the sacred writings call the second death, which is both eternal
   and full of the severest torments. [1368] For as two lives are proposed
   to man, of which the one belongs to the soul, the other to the body; so
   also two deaths are proposed,--one relating to the body, which all must
   undergo according to nature, the other relating to the soul, which is
   acquired by wickedness and avoided by virtue. As this life is temporary
   and has fixed limits, because it belongs to the body; so also death is
   in like manner temporary and has a fixed end, because it affects the
   body.

    Chap. XI.--Of the Last Times, and of the Soul and Body.

   Therefore, when the times which God has appointed for death shall be
   completed, death itself shall be ended. And because temporal death
   follows temporal life, it follows that souls rise again to everlasting
   life, because temporal death has received an end. Again, as the life of
   the soul is everlasting, in which it receives the divine and
   unspeakable fruits of its immortality; also its death must be eternal,
   in which it suffers perpetual punishments and infinite torments for its
   faults. Therefore things are in this position, that they who are happy
   in this life, pertaining to the body and the earth, are about to be
   miserable for ever, because they have already enjoyed the good things
   which they preferred, which happens to those who adore false gods and
   neglect the true God. In the next place, they who, following
   righteousness, have been miserable, and despised, and poor in this
   life, and have often been harassed with insults and injuries on account
   of righteousness itself, because virtue cannot otherwise be attained,
   are about to be always happy, that since they have already endured
   evils, they may also enjoy goods. Which plainly happens to those who,
   having despised gods of the earth and frail goods, follow the heavenly
   religion of God, whose goods are everlasting, as He Himself who gave
   them. What shall I say of the works of the body and soul? Do not they
   show that the soul is not subject to death? For, as to the body, since
   it is itself frail and mortal, whatever works it contrives are equally
   perishable. For Tullius says that there is nothing which is wrought by
   the hands of man which is not at some time reduced to destruction,
   either through injury caused by men, or through length of time, which
   is the destroyer of all things.

   But truly we see that the productions of the mind are immortal. For as
   many as, devoting themselves to the contempt of present things, have
   handed down to memory the monuments of their genius and great deeds,
   have plainly gained by these an imperishable name for their mind and
   virtue. Therefore, if the deeds of the body are mortal for this reason,
   because the body itself is mortal, it follows that the soul is shown to
   be immortal from this, because we see that its productions are not
   mortal. In the same manner also, the desires of the body and of the
   soul declare that the one is mortal, the other everlasting. For the
   body desires nothing except what is temporal, that is, food, drink,
   clothing, rest, and pleasure; and it cannot desire or attain to these
   very things without the assent and assistance [1369] of the soul. But
   the soul of itself desires many things which do not extend [1370] to
   the duty or enjoyment of the body; and those are not frail, but
   eternal, as the fame of virtue, as the remembrance of the name. For the
   soul even in opposition to the body desires the worship of God, which
   consists in abstinence from desires and lusts, in the enduring of pain,
   in the contempt of death. From which it is credible that the soul does
   not perish, but is separated from the body, because the body can do
   nothing without the soul, but the soul can do many and great things
   without the body. Why should I mention that those things which are
   visible to the eyes, and capable of being touched by the hand, cannot
   be eternal, because they admit of external violence; but those things
   which neither come under the touch nor under the sight, but are
   apparent only in their force and method and effect, are eternal because
   they suffer no violence from without? But if the body is mortal on this
   account, because it is equally open to the sight and to the touch,
   therefore the soul is immortal for this reason, because it can be
   neither touched nor seen.

    Chap. XII.--Of the Soul and the Body, and of Their Union and Separation and
    Return.

   Now let us refute the arguments of those who maintain the opposite
   opinions, which Lucretius has related in his third book. Since, he
   says, the soul is born together with the body, it must necessarily die
   with the body. But the two cases are not similar. For the body is
   solid, and capable of being grasped [1371] both by the eyes and the
   hand; but the soul is slight, [1372] and eluding the touch and sight.
   The body is formed from the earth, and made firm; the soul has in it
   nothing concrete, nothing of earthly weight, as Plato maintained. For
   it could not have such great force, such great skill, such great
   rapidity, unless it derived its origin from heaven. The body,
   therefore, since it is made up of a ponderous and corruptible element,
   and is tangible and visible, is corrupted and dies; nor is it able to
   repel violence, because it comes under the sight and under the touch;
   but the soul, which by its slightness avoids all touch, can be
   dissolved by no attack. Therefore, although they are joined and
   connected together from birth, and the one which is formed of earthly
   material [1373] is, as it were, the vessel of the other, which is drawn
   out from heavenly fineness, when any violence has separated the two,
   which separation is called death, then each returns into its own
   nature; that which was of earth is resolved into earth; that which is
   of heavenly breath remains fixed, and flourishes always, since the
   divine spirit is everlasting. In fine, the same Lucretius, forgetting
   what he asserted, and what dogma he defended, wrote these verses:
   [1374] --


   "That also which before was from the earth passes back into the earth,
   and that which was sent from the borders of ether is carried again by
   the quarters of heaven." [1375]

   But this language was not for him to employ, who contended that souls
   perished with the bodies; but he was overcome by the truth, and the
   true system stole upon him unawares. Moreover, that very inference
   which he draws, that the soul suffers dissolution, that is, that it
   perishes together with the body, since they are produced together, is
   both false, and is capable of being turned to the opposite direction.
   For the body does not perish together with the soul; but when the soul
   departs it remains entire for many days, and frequently by medical
   preparations it remains entire for a very long time. For if they both
   perished together, as they are produced together, the soul would not
   hastily depart and desert the body, but both would be dispersed alike
   at one point of time; and the body also, while the breath still
   remained in it, would dissolve and perish as quickly as the soul
   departs: yes, truly, the body, being dissolved, the soul would vanish,
   as moisture poured forth from a broken vessel. For if the earthly and
   frail body after the departure of the soul does not immediately flow
   away and waste into earth, from which it has its origin, therefore the
   soul, which is not frail, endures to eternity, since its origin is
   eternal. He says, since the understanding increases in boys, and is
   vigorous in young men, and is lessened in the aged, it is evident that
   it is mortal. First, the soul is not the same thing as the mind; for it
   is one thing that we live, another that we reflect. For it is the mind
   of those who are asleep which is at rest, [1376] not the soul; and in
   those who are mad, the mind is extinguished, the soul remains; and
   therefore they are not said to be without a soul, but to be deprived of
   their mind. [1377] Therefore the mind, that is, the understanding, is
   either increased or lessened according to age. The soul is always in
   its own condition; and from the time when it receives the power of
   breathing, it remains the same even to the end, until, being sent forth
   from the confinement of the body, it flies back to its own abode. In
   the next place, the soul, although inspired by God, yet, because it is
   shut up in a dark abode of earthly flesh, does not possess knowledge,
   which belongs to divinity. Therefore it hears and learns all things,
   and receives wisdom by learning and hearing; and old age does not
   lessen wisdom, but increases it, if the age of youth has been passed in
   virtue; and if excessive old age shall have enfeebled the limbs, it is
   not the fault of the mind if the sight has vanished, if the tongue has
   become benumbed, if the hearing has grown deaf, but it is the fault of
   the body. But, it is said, the memory fails. What wonder, if the mind
   is oppressed by the ruin of the falling house, and forgets the past,
   not about to be divine on any other condition than if it shall have
   escaped the prison in which it is confined?

   But the soul, he says, is also subject to pain and grief, and loses its
   senses through drunkenness, whence it is evidently frail and mortal. On
   this account, therefore, virtue and wisdom are necessary, that both
   grief, which is contracted by the suffering and the sight of unworthy
   objects, may be repelled by fortitude, and that pleasure may be
   overcome, not only by abstaining from drinking, but also from other
   things. For if it be destitute of virtue, if it be given up to
   pleasure, and thus rendered effeminate, it will become subject to
   death, since virtue, as we have shown, is the contriver of immortality,
   as pleasure is of death. But death, as I have set forth, does not
   entirely extinguish and destroy, but visits with eternal torments. For
   the soul cannot entirely perish, since it received its origin from the
   Spirit of God, which is eternal. The soul, he says, is sensible even of
   disease of the body, and suffers forgetfulness of itself; and as it
   grows ill, so also it is often healed. This is therefore the reason why
   virtue is especially to be used, that the mind--not the soul [1378]
   --may not be harassed by any pain of the body, or undergo oblivion of
   itself. And since this has its seat in a certain part of the body, when
   any violence of disease has vitiated that part, it is moved from its
   place; and as though shaken, it departs from its station, about to
   return when a cure and health shall have remodelled its abode. For,
   since the soul is united with the body, if it is destitute of virtue,
   it grows sick by the contagion of the body, and from sharing its
   frailty the weakness extends to the mind. But when it shall be
   disunited from the body it will flourish by itself; nor will it now be
   assailed by any condition of frailty, because it has laid aside its
   frail covering. As the eye, he says, when torn out and separated from
   the body, can see nothing, so also the soul, when separated, can
   perceive nothing, because it is itself also a part of the body. This is
   false, and dissimilar to the case supposed; for the soul is not a part
   of the body, but in the body. As that which is contained in a vessel is
   not a part of the vessel, and these things which are in a house are not
   said to be a part of the house; so the mind is not a part of the body,
   because the body is either the vessel or the receptacle of the soul.

   Now, that is a much more empty argument which says that the soul
   appears to be mortal because it is not quickly sent forth from the
   body, but gradually unfolds itself from all the members, beginning from
   the extremity of the feet; as though, if it were eternal, it would
   burst forth in a single moment of time, which takes place in those who
   die by the sword. But they who are slain by disease are longer in
   breathing forth their spirit, so that as the limbs grow cold the soul
   is breathed forth. For, since it is contained in the material of the
   blood, as light is in the oil, that material being consumed by the heat
   of fevers, the extremities of the limbs must grow cold; since the more
   slender veins are extended into the extremities of the body, and the
   extreme and smaller streams are dried up when the fountain-spring
   fails. It must not, however, be supposed that, because the perception
   of the body fails, the sensibility of the soul is extinguished and
   perishes. For it is not the soul that becomes senseless when the body
   fails, but it is the body which becomes senseless when the soul takes
   its departure, because it draws all sensibility with it. But since the
   soul by its presence gives sensibility to the body, and causes it to
   live, it is impossible that it should not live and perceive by itself,
   since it is in itself both consciousness and life. For as to that which
   says,


   "But if our mind were immortal, it would not when dying complain so
   much of its dissolution as it would rejoice in passing abroad and
   quitting its vesture like a snake," [1379]

   I never saw any one who complained of his dissolution in death; but he
   perhaps had seen some Epicurean philosophizing even in death, and with
   his latest breath discoursing about his dissolution.

   How can it be known whether he feels that he is in a state of
   dissolution, or that he is being set free from the body, when his
   tongue grows dumb at his departure? For as long as he perceives and has
   the power of speech, he is not yet dissolved; when he has suffered
   dissolution, he is now unable either to perceive or to speak, so that
   either he is not yet able to complain of his dissolution, or he is no
   longer able. But, it is said, he understands before he undergoes
   dissolution, that he must undergo it. Why should I mention that we see
   many of the dying, not complaining that they are undergoing
   dissolution, but testifying that they are passing out, and setting
   forth on their journey and walking? and they signify this by gesture,
   or if they still are able, they express it also by their voice. From
   which it is evident that it is not a dissolution which takes place, but
   a separation; and this shows that the soul continues to exist. Other
   arguments of the Epicurean system are opposed to Pythagoras, who
   contends that souls migrate from bodies worn out with old age and
   death, and gain admission [1380] into those which are new and recently
   born; and that the same souls are always reproduced at one time in a
   man, at another time in a sheep, at another in a wild beast, at another
   in a bird; and that they are immortal on this account, because they
   often change their abodes, consisting of various and dissimilar bodies.
   And this opinion of a senseless man, since it is ridiculous and more
   worthy of a stage-player than of a school of philosophy, ought not even
   to have been refuted seriously; for he who does this appears to be
   afraid lest any one should believe it. Therefore we must pass by those
   things which have been discussed in behalf of falsehood against
   falsehood; it is sufficient to have refuted those things which are
   against the truth.

    Chap. XIII.--Of the Soul, and the Testimonies Concerning Its Eternity.

   I have made it evident, as I think, that the soul is not subject to
   dissolution. It remains that I bring forward witnesses by whose
   authority my arguments may be confirmed. And I will not now allege the
   testimony of the prophets, whose system and divination consist in this
   alone, the teaching that man was created for the worship of God, and
   for receiving immortality from Him; but I will rather bring forward
   those whom they who reject the truth cannot but believe. Hermes,
   describing the nature of man, that he might show how he was made by
   God, introduced this statement: "And the same out of two natures--the
   immortal and the mortal--made one nature, that of man, making the same
   partly immortal, and partly mortal; and bringing this, he placed it in
   the midst, between that nature which was divine and immortal, and that
   which was mortal and changeable, that seeing all things, he may admire
   all things." But some one may perhaps reckon him in the number of the
   philosophers, although he has been placed among the gods, and honoured
   by the Egyptians under the name of Mercury, and may give no more
   authority to him than to Plato or Pythagoras. Let us therefore seek for
   greater testimony. A certain Polites asked Apollo of Miletus whether
   the soul remains after death or goes to dissolution; and he replied in
   these verses:--


   "As long as the soul is bound by fetters to the body, perceiving
   corruptible sufferings, it yields to mortal pains; but when, after the
   wasting of the body, it has found a very swift dissolution of
   mortality, it is altogether borne into the air, never growing old, and
   it remains always uninjured; for the first-born providence of God made
   this disposition."

   What do the Sibylline poems say? Do they not declare that this is so,
   when they say that the time will come when God will judge the living
   and the dead?--whose authority we will hereafter bring forward. [1381]
   Therefore the opinion entertained by Democritus, and Epicurus, and
   Dicæarchus concerning the dissolution of the soul is false; and they
   would not venture to speak concerning the destruction of souls, in the
   presence of any magician, who knew that souls are called forth from the
   lower regions by certain incantations, and that they are at hand, and
   afford themselves to be seen by human eyes, and speak, and foretell
   future events; and if they should thus venture, they would be
   overpowered by the fact itself, and by proofs presented to them. But
   because they did not comprehend the nature of the soul, which is so
   subtle that it escapes the eyes of the human mind, they said that it
   perishes. What of Aristoxenus, who denied that there is any soul at
   all, even while it lives in the body? But as on the lyre harmonious
   sound, and the strain which musicians call harmony, is produced by the
   tightening of the strings, so he thought that the power of perception
   existed in bodies from the joining together of the vitals, and from the
   vigour of the limbs; than which nothing can be said more senseless.
   Truly he had his eyes uninjured, but his heart was blind, with which he
   did not see that he lived, and had the mind by which he had conceived
   that very thought. But this has happened to many philosophers, that
   they did not believe in the existence of any object which is not
   apparent to the eyes; whereas the sight of the mind ought to be much
   clearer than that of the body, for perceiving those things the force
   and nature of which are rather felt than seen.

    Chap. XIV.--Of the First and Last Times of the World.

   Since we have spoken of the immortality of the soul, it follows that we
   teach how and when it is given to man; that in this also they may see
   the errors of their perverseness and folly, who imagine that some
   mortals have become gods by the decrees and dogmas of mortals; either
   because they had invented arts, or because they had taught the use of
   certain productions of the earth, or because they had discovered things
   useful for the life of men, or because they had slain savage beasts.
   How far these things were from deserving immortality we have both shown
   in the former books, and we will now show, that it may be evident that
   it is righteousness alone which procures for man eternal life, and that
   it is God alone who bestows the reward of eternal life. For they who
   are said to have been immortalized by their merits, inasmuch as they
   possessed neither righteousness nor any true virtue, did not obtain for
   themselves immortality, but death by their sins and lusts; nor did they
   deserve the reward of heaven, but the punishment of hell, which impends
   over them, together with all their worshippers. And I show that the
   time of this judgment draws near, that the due reward may be given to
   the righteous, and the deserved punishment may be inflicted on the
   wicked.

   Plato and many others of the philosophers, since they were ignorant of
   the origin of all things, and of that primal period at which the world
   was made, said that many thousands of ages had passed since this
   beautiful arrangement of the world was completed; and in this they
   perhaps followed the Chaldeans, who, as Cicero has related in his first
   book respecting divination, [1382] foolishly say [1383] that they
   possess comprised in their memorials four hundred and seventy thousand
   years; in which matter, because they thought that they could not be
   convicted, they believed that they were at liberty [1384] to speak
   falsely. But we, whom the Holy Scriptures instruct to the knowledge of
   the truth, know the beginning and the end of the world, respecting
   which we will now speak in the end of our work, since we have explained
   respecting the beginning in the second book. Therefore let the
   philosophers, who enumerate thousands of ages from the beginning of the
   world, know that the six thousandth year is not yet completed, and that
   when this number is completed the consummation must take place, and the
   condition of human affairs be remodelled for the better, the proof of
   which must first be related, that the matter itself may be plain. God
   completed the world and this admirable work of nature in the space of
   six days, as is contained in the secrets of Holy Scripture, and
   consecrated the seventh day, on which He had rested from His works. But
   this is the Sabbath-day, which in the language of the Hebrews received
   its name from the number, [1385] whence the seventh is the legitimate
   and complete number. For there are seven days, by the revolutions of
   which in order the circles of years are made up; and there are seven
   stars which do not set, and seven luminaries which are called planets,
   [1386] whose differing and unequal movements are believed to cause the
   varieties of circumstances and times. [1387]

   Therefore, since all the works of God were completed in six days, the
   world must continue in its present state through six ages, that is, six
   thousand years. For the great day of God is limited by a circle of a
   thousand years, as the prophet shows, who says [1388] "In Thy sight, O
   Lord, a thousand years are as one day." And as God laboured during
   those six days in creating such great works, so His religion and truth
   must labour during these six thousand years, while wickedness prevails
   and bears rule. And again, since God, having finished His works, rested
   the seventh day and blessed it, at the end of the six thousandth year
   all wickedness must be abolished from the earth, and righteousness
   reign for a thousand years; and there must be tranquillity and rest
   from the labours which the world now has long endured. But how that
   will come to pass I will explain in its order. We have often said that
   lesser things and things of small importance are figures and previous
   shadowings forth of great things; as this day of ours, which is bounded
   by the rising and the setting of the sun, is a representation [1389] of
   that great day to which the circuit of a thousand years affixes its
   limits. [1390]

   In the same manner also the fashioning of the earthly man held forth to
   the future the formation of the heavenly people. For as, when all
   things were completed which were contrived for the use of man, last of
   all, on the sixth day, He made man also, and introduced him into this
   world as into a home now carefully prepared; so now on the great sixth
   day the true man is being formed by the word of God, that is, a holy
   people is fashioned for righteousness by the doctrine and precepts of
   God. And as then a mortal and imperfect man was formed from the earth,
   that he might live a thousand years in this world; so now from this
   earthly age is formed a perfect man, that being quickened by God, he
   may bear rule in this same world through a thousand years. But in what
   manner the consummation will take place, and what end awaits the
   affairs of men, if any one shall examine the divine writings he will
   ascertain. But the voices also of prophets of the world, agreeing with
   the heavenly, announce the end and overthrow of all things after a
   short time, describing as it were the last old age of the wearied and
   wasting world. But the things which are said by prophets and seers to
   be about to happen before that last ending comes upon the world, I will
   subjoin, being collected and accumulated from all quarters.

    Chap. XV.--Of the Devastation of the World and Change of the Empires.

   It is contained in the mysteries of the sacred writings, that a prince
   of the Hebrews, compelled by want of corn, passed into Egypt with all
   his family and relatives. And when his posterity, remaining long in
   Egypt, had increased into a great nation, and were oppressed by the
   heavy and intolerable yoke of slavery, God smote Egypt with an
   incurable stroke, and freed His people, leading them through the midst
   of the sea, when, the waves being cut asunder and parted on either
   side, the people went over on dry ground. And the king of the Egyptians
   endeavouring to follow them as they fled, the sea returning to its
   place, he was cut off, with all his people. And this deed so
   illustrious and so wonderful, although for the present it displayed to
   men the power of God, was also a foreshadowing and figure of a greater
   deed, which the same God was about to perform at the last consummation
   of the times, for He will free His people from the oppressive bondage
   of the world. But since at that time the people of God were one, and in
   one nation only, Egypt only was smitten. But now, because the people of
   God are collected out of all languages, and dwell among all nations,
   and are oppressed by those bearing rule over them, it must come to pass
   that all nations, that is, the whole world, be beaten with heavenly
   stripes, that the righteous people, who are worshippers of God, may be
   set free. And as then signs were given by which the coming destruction
   was shown to the Egyptians, so at the last time wonderful prodigies
   will take place throughout all the elements of the world, by which the
   impending destruction may be understood by all nations.

   Therefore, as the end of this world approaches, the condition of human
   affairs must undergo a change, and through the prevalence of wickedness
   become worse; so that now these times of ours, in which iniquity and
   impiety have increased even to the highest degree, may be judged happy
   and almost golden in comparison of that incurable evil. For
   righteousness will so decrease, and impiety, avarice, desire, and lust
   will so greatly increase, that if there shall then happen to be any
   good men, they will be a prey to the wicked, and will be harassed on
   all sides by the unrighteous; while the wicked alone will be in
   opulence, but the good will be afflicted in all calumnies and in want.
   All justice will be confounded, and the laws will be destroyed. No one
   will then have anything except that which has been gained or defended
   by the hand: boldness and violence will possess all things. There will
   be no faith among men, nor peace, nor kindness, nor shame, nor truth;
   and thus also there will be neither security, nor government, nor any
   rest from evils. For all the earth will be in a state of tumult; wars
   will everywhere rage; all nations will be in arms, and will oppose one
   another; neighbouring states will carry on conflicts with each other;
   and first of all, Egypt will pay the penalties of her foolish
   superstitions, and will be covered with blood as if with a river. Then
   the sword will traverse the world, mowing down everything, and laying
   low all things as a crop. And--my mind dreads to relate it, but I will
   relate it, because it is about to happen--the cause of this desolation
   and confusion will be this; because the Roman name, by which the world
   is now ruled, will be taken away from the earth, and the government
   return to Asia; and the East will again bear rule, and the West be
   reduced to servitude. [1391] Nor ought it to appear wonderful to any
   one, if a kingdom founded with such vastness, and so long increased by
   so many and such men, and in short strengthened by such great
   resources, shall nevertheless at some time fall. There is nothing
   prepared by human strength which cannot equally he destroyed by human
   strength, since the works of mortals are mortal. Thus also other
   kingdoms in former times, though they had long flourished, were
   nevertheless destroyed. For it is related that the Egyptians, and
   Persians, and Greeks, and Assyrians had the government of the world;
   and after the destruction of them all, the chief power came to the
   Romans also. And inasmuch as they excel all other kingdoms in
   magnitude, with so much greater an overthrow will they fall, because
   those buildings which are higher than others have more weight for a
   downfall. [1392]

   Seneca therefore not unskilfully divided the times of the Roman city by
   ages. For he said that at first was its infancy under King Romulus, by
   whom Rome was brought into being, and as it were educated; then its
   boyhood under the other kings, by whom it was increased and fashioned
   with more numerous systems of instruction and institutions; but at
   length, in the reign of Tarquinius, when now it had begun as it were to
   be grown up, it did not endure slavery; and having thrown off the yoke
   of a haughty tyranny, it preferred to obey laws rather than kings; and
   when its youth was terminated by the end of the Punic war, then at
   length with confirmed strength it began to be manly. [1393] For when
   Carthage was taken away, which was long its rival in power, it
   stretched out its hands by land and sea over the whole world, until,
   having subdued all kings and nations, when the materials [1394] for war
   now failed, it abused its strength, by which it destroyed itself. This
   was its first old age, when, lacerated by civil wars and oppressed by
   intestine evil, it again fell back to the government of a single ruler,
   as it were revolving to a second infancy. [1395] For, having lost the
   liberty which it had defended under the guidance and authority of
   Brutus, it so grew old, as though it had no strength to support itself,
   unless it depended on the aid of its rulers. But if these things are
   so, what remains, except that death follow old age? And that it will so
   come to pass, the predictions of the prophets briefly announce under
   the cover [1396] of other names, so that no one can easily understand
   them. Nevertheless the Sibyls openly say that Rome is doomed to perish,
   and that indeed by the judgment of God, because it held His name in
   hatred; and being the enemy of righteousness, it destroyed the people
   who kept [1397] the truth. Hystaspes also, who was a very ancient king
   of the Medes, from whom also the river which is now called Hydaspes
   received its name, handed down to the memory of posterity a wonderful
   dream upon the interpretation of a boy who uttered divinations,
   announcing long before the founding of the Trojan nation, that the
   Roman empire and name would be taken away from the world.

    CHAP. XVI.--OF THE DEVASTATION of the World, and Its Prophetic Omens. [1398]

   But, test any one should think this incredible, I will show how it will
   come to pass. First, the kingdom will be enlarged, and the chief power,
   dispersed among many and divided, [1399] will be diminished. Then civil
   discords will perpetually be sown; nor will there be any rest from
   deadly wars, until ten kings arise at the same time, who will divide
   the world, not to govern, but to consume it. These, having increased
   their armies to an immense extent, and having deserted the cultivation
   of the fields, which is the beginning of overthrow and disaster, will
   lay waste and break in pieces and consume all things. Then a most
   powerful enemy will suddenly arise against him from the extreme
   boundaries of the northern region, who, having destroyed three of that
   number who shall then be in possession of Asia, shall be admitted into
   alliance by the others, and shall be constituted prince of all. He
   shall harass the world with an intolerable rule; shall mingle things
   divine and human; shall contrive things impious to relate, and
   detestable; shall meditate new designs in his breast, that he may
   establish the government for himself: he will change the laws, and
   appoint his own; he will contaminate, plunder, spoil, and put to death.
   And at length, the name being changed and the seat of government being
   transferred, confusion and the disturbance of mankind will follow.
   Then, in truth, a detestable and abominable time shall come, in which
   life shall be pleasant to none of men.

   Cities shall be utterly overthrown, and shall perish; not only by fire
   and the sword, but also by continual earthquakes and overflowings of
   waters, and by frequent diseases and repeated famines. For the
   atmosphere will be tainted, and become corrupt and pestilential--at one
   time by unseasonable rains, at another by barren drought, now by colds,
   and now by excessive heats. Nor will the earth give its fruit to man:
   no field, or tree, or vine will produce anything; but after they have
   given the greatest hope in the blossom, they will fail in the fruit.
   Fountains also shall be dried up, together with the rivers; so that
   there shall not be a sufficient supply for drinking; and waters shall
   be changed into blood or bitterness. On account of these things, beasts
   shall fail on the land, and birds in the air, and fishes in the sea.
   Wonderful prodigies also in heaven shall confound the minds of men with
   the greatest terrors, and the trains of comets, and the darkness of the
   sun, and the colour of the moon, and the gliding of the falling stars.
   Nor, however, will these things take place in the accustomed manner;
   but there will suddenly appear stars unknown and unseen by the eyes;
   the sun will be perpetually darkened, so that there will be scarcely
   any distinction between the night and the day; the moon will now fail,
   not for three hours only, but overspread with perpetual blood, will go
   through extraordinary movements, so that it will not be easy for man to
   ascertain the courses of the heavenly bodies or the system of the
   times; for there will either be summer in the winter, or winter in the
   summer. Then the year will be shortened, and the month diminished, and
   the day contracted into a short space; and stars shall fall in great
   numbers, so that all the heaven will appear dark without any lights.
   The loftiest mountains also will fall, and be levelled with the plains;
   the sea will be rendered unnavigable.

   And that nothing may be wanting to the evils of men and the earth, the
   trumpet shall be heard from heaven, which the Sibyl foretells in this
   manner:--


   "The trumpet from heaven shall utter its wailing voice."

   And then all shall tremble and quake at that mournful sound. [1400] But
   then, through the anger of God against the men who have not known
   righteousness, the sword and fire, famine and disease, shall reign;
   and, above all things, fear always overhanging. Then they shall call
   upon God, but He will not hear them; death shall be desired, but it
   will not come; not even shall night give rest to their fear, nor shall
   sleep approach to their eyes, but anxiety and watchfulness shall
   consume the souls of men; they shall deplore and lament, and gnash
   their teeth; they shall congratulate the dead, and bewail the living.
   Through these and many other evils there shall be desolation on the
   earth, and the world shall be disfigured and deserted, which is thus
   expressed in the verses of the Sibyl:--


   "The world shall be despoiled of beauty, through the destruction of
   men."

   For the human race will be so consumed, that scarcely the tenth part of
   men will be left; and from whence a thousand had gone forth, scarcely a
   hundred will go forth. Of the worshippers of God also, two parts will
   perish; and the third part, which shall have been proved, will remain.

    Chap. XVII.--Of the False Prophet, and the Hardships of the Righteous, and
    His Destruction.

   But I will more plainly set forth the manner in which this happens.
   When the close of the times draws nigh, a great prophet shall be sent
   from God to turn men to the knowledge of God, and he shall receive the
   power of doing wonderful things. [1401] Wherever men shall not hear
   him, he will shut up the heaven, and cause it to withhold its rains; he
   will turn their water into blood, and torment them with thirst and
   hunger; and if any one shall endeavour to injure him, fire shall come
   forth out of his mouth, and shall burn that man. By these prodigies and
   powers he shall turn many to the worship of God; and when his works
   shall be accomplished, another king shall arise out of Syria, born from
   an evil spirit, the overthrower and destroyer of the human race, who
   shall destroy that which is left by the former evil, together with
   himself. He shall fight against the prophet of God, and shall overcome,
   and slay him, and shall suffer him to lie unburied; but after the third
   day he shall come to life again; and while all look on and wonder, he
   shall be caught up into heaven. But that king will not only be most
   disgraceful in himself, but he will also be a prophet of lies; and he
   will constitute and call himself God, and will order himself to be
   worshipped as the Son of God; and power will be given him to do signs
   and wonders, by the sight of which he may entice men to adore him. He
   will command fire to come down from heaven, and the sun to stand and
   leave his course, and an image to speak; and these things shall be done
   at his word,--by which miracles [1402] many even of the wise shall be
   enticed by him. Then he will attempt to destroy the temple of God, and
   persecute the righteous people; and there will be distress and
   tribulation, [1403] such as there never has been from the beginning of
   the world.

   As many as shall believe him and unite themselves to him, shall be
   marked by him as sheep; but they who shall refuse his mark will either
   flee to the mountains, or, being seized, will be slain with studied
   [1404] tortures. He will also enwrap righteous men with the books of
   the prophets, and thus burn them; and power will be given him to
   desolate [1405] the whole earth for forty-two months. That will be the
   time in which righteousness shall be cast out, and innocence be hated;
   in which the wicked shall prey upon the good as enemies; neither law,
   nor order, nor military discipline shall be preserved; no one shall
   reverence hoary locks, nor recognise the duty of piety, nor pity sex or
   infancy; all things shall be confounded and mixed together against
   right, and against the laws of nature. Thus the earth shall be laid
   waste, as though by one common robbery. When these things shall so
   happen, then the righteous and the followers of truth shall separate
   themselves from the wicked, and flee into solitudes. And when he hears
   of this, the impious king, inflamed with anger, will come with a great
   army, and bringing up all his forces, will surround all the mountain in
   which the righteous shall be situated, that he may seize them. But
   they, when they shall see themselves to be shut in on all sides and
   besieged, will call upon God with a loud voice, and implore the aid of
   heaven; and God shall hear them, and send from heaven a great king to
   rescue and free them, and destroy all the wicked with fire and sword.

    Chap. XVIII.--Of the Fortunes of the World at the Last Time, and of the
    Things Foretold by the Soothsayers.

   That these things will thus take place, all the prophets have announced
   from the inspiration of God, and also the soothsayers at the
   instigation of the demons. For Hystaspes, whom I have named above,
   having described the iniquity of this last time, says that the pious
   and faithful, being separated from the wicked, will stretch forth their
   hands to heaven with weeping and mourning, and will implore the
   protection of Jupiter: that Jupiter will look to the earth, and hear
   the voices of men, and will destroy the wicked. All which things are
   true except one, that he attributed to Jupiter those things which God
   will do. But that also was withdrawn from the account, not without
   fraud on the part of the demons, viz., that the Son of God would then
   be sent, who, having destroyed all the wicked, would set at liberty the
   pious. Which, however, Hermes did not conceal. For in that book which
   is entitled the Complete Treatise, after an enumeration of the evils
   concerning which we have spoken, he added these things: "But when these
   things thus come to pass, then He who is Lord, and Father, and God, and
   the Creator of the first and one God, looking upon what is done, and
   opposing to the disorder His own will, that is, goodness, and recalling
   the wandering and cleansing wickedness, partly inundating it with much
   water, and partly burning it with most rapid fire, and sometimes
   pressing it with wars and pestilences, He brought His world to its
   ancient state and restored it." The Sibyls also show that it would not
   be otherwise than that the Son of God should be sent by His supreme
   Father, to set free the righteous from the hands of the wicked, and to
   destroy the unrighteous, together with their cruel tyrants. One of whom
   thus wrote:--


   "He shall come also, wishing to destroy the city of the blest; and a
   king sent against him from the gods shall slay all the great kings and
   chief men: then judgment shall thus come from the Immortal to men."

   Also another Sibyl:--


   "And then God shall send a king from the sun, who shall cause all the
   earth to cease from disastrous war."

   And again another:--


   "He will take away the intolerable yoke of slavery which is placed on
   our neck, and he will do away with impious laws and violent chains."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XIX.--Of the Advent of Christ to Judgment, and of the Overcoming of
    the False Prophet.

   The world therefore being oppressed, since the resources of men shall
   be insufficient for the overthrow of a tyranny of immense strength,
   inasmuch as it will press upon the captive world with great armies of
   robbers, that calamity so great will stand in need of divine
   assistance. Therefore God, being aroused both by the doubtful danger
   and by the wretched lamentation of the righteous, will immediately send
   a deliverer. Then the middle of the heaven shall be laid open in the
   dead and darkness of the night, that the light of the descending God
   may be manifest in all the world as lightning: of which the Sibyl spoke
   in these words:--


   "When He shall come, there will be fire and darkness in the midst of
   the black night."

   This is the night which is celebrated by us in watchfulness on account
   of the coming of our King and God: [1406] of which night there is a
   twofold meaning; because in it He then received life when He suffered,
   and hereafter He is about to receive the kingdom of the world. For He
   is the Deliverer, and Judge, and Avenger, and King, and God, whom we
   call Christ, who before He descends will give this sign: There shall
   suddenly fall from heaven a sword, that the righteous may know that the
   leader of the sacred warfare is about to descend; and He shall descend
   with a company of angels to the middle of the earth, and there shall go
   before Him an unquenchable fire, and the power of the angels shall
   deliver into the hands of the just that multitude which has surrounded
   the mountain, and they shall be slain from the third hour until the
   evening, and blood shall flow like a torrent; and all his forces being
   destroyed, the wicked one shall alone escape, and his power shall
   perish from him.

   Now this is he who is called Antichrist; but he shall falsely call
   himself Christ, and shall fight against the truth, and being overcome
   shall flee; and shall often renew the war, and often be conquered,
   until in the fourth battle, all the wicked being slain, subdued, and
   captured, he shall at length pay the penalty of his crimes. But other
   princes also and tyrants who have harassed the world, together with
   him, shall be led in chains to the king; and he shall rebuke them, and
   reprove them, and upbraid them with their crimes, and condemn them, and
   consign them to deserved tortures. Thus, wickedness being extinguished
   and impiety suppressed, the world will be at rest, which having been
   subject to error and wickedness for so many ages, endured dreadful
   slavery. No longer shall gods made by the hands be worshipped; but the
   images being thrust out from their temples and couches, shall be given
   to the fire, and shall be burnt, together with their wonderful gifts:
   which also the Sibyl, in accordance with the prophets, announced as
   about to take place:--


   "But mortals shall break in pieces the images and all the wealth."

   The Erythræan Sibyl also made the same promise:--


   "And the works made by the hand of the gods shall be burnt up."

    Chap. XX.--Of the Judgment of Christ, of Christians, and of the Soul.

   After these things the lower regions shall be opened, and the dead
   shall rise again, on whom the same King and God shall pass judgment, to
   whom the supreme Father shall give the great power both of judging and
   of reigning. And respecting this judgment and reign, it is thus found
   in the Erythræan Sibyl:--


   "When this shall receive its fated accomplishment, and the judgment of
   the immortal God shall now come to mortals, the great judgment shall
   come upon men, and the beginning."

   Then in another:--


   "And then the gaping earth shall show a Tartarean chaos; and all kings
   shall come to the judgment-seat of God."

   And in another place in the same:--


   "Rolling along the heavens, I will open the caverns of the earth; and
   then I will raise the dead, loosing fate and the sting of death; and
   afterwards I will call them into judgment, judging the life of pious
   and impious men."

   Not all men, however, shall then be judged by God, but those only who
   have been exercised in the religion of God. For they who have not known
   God, since sentence cannot be passed upon them for their acquittal, are
   already judged and condemned, since the Holy Scriptures testify that
   the wicked shall not arise to judgment. [1407] Therefore they who have
   known God shall be judged, and their deeds, that is, their evil works,
   shall be compared and weighed against their good ones: so that if those
   which are good and just are more [1408] and weighty, they may be given
   to a life of blessedness; but if the evil exceed, they may be condemned
   to punishment. Here, perhaps, some one will say, If the soul is
   immortal, how is it represented as capable of suffering, and sensible
   of punishment? For if it shall be punished on account of its deserts,
   it is plain that it will be sensible of pain, and even of death. If it
   is not liable to death, not even to pain, it follows that it is not
   capable of suffering.

   This question or argument is thus met by the Stoics: that the souls of
   men continue to exist, and are not annihilated [1409] by the
   intervention of death: that the souls, moreover, of those who have been
   just, being pure, and incapable of suffering, and happy, return to the
   heavenly abodes from which they had their origin, or are borne to some
   happy plains, where they may enjoy wonderful pleasures; but that the
   wicked, since they have defiled themselves with evil passions, have a
   kind of middle nature, between that of an immortal and a mortal, and
   have something of weakness, from the contagion of the flesh; and being
   enslaved to its desires and lusts, they contract an indelible stain and
   earthly blot; and when this has become entirely inherent through length
   of time, souls are given over to its nature, so that, though they
   cannot altogether be extinguished, inasmuch as they are from God,
   nevertheless they become liable to torment through the taint of the
   body, which being burnt in by means of sins, produces a feeling of
   pain. Which sentiment is thus expressed by the poet: [1410] --


   "Nay, when at last the life has fled,

   And left the body cold and dead,

   E'en then there passes not away

   The painful heritage of clay:

   Full many a long contracted stain

   Perforce must linger deep in grain.

   So penal sufferings they endure

   For ancient crime, to make them pure."

   These things are near to the truth. [1411] For the soul, when separated
   from the body, is, as the same poet says, [1412] such as


   "No vision of the drowsy night,

   No airy current half so light,"

   because it is a spirit, and by its very slightness incapable of being
   perceived, but only by us who are corporeal but capable of being
   perceived by God, since it belongs to Him to be able to do all things.

    Chap. XXI.--Of the Torments and Punishments of Souls.

   First of all, therefore, we say that the power of God is so great, that
   He perceives even incorporeal things, and manages them as He will. For
   even angels fear God, because they can be chastised by Him in some
   unspeakable manner; and devils dread Him, because they are tormented
   and punished by Him. What wonder is it, therefore, if souls, though
   they are immortal, are nevertheless capable of suffering at the hand of
   God? For since they have nothing solid and tangible in themselves, they
   can suffer no violence from solid and corporeal beings; but because
   they live in their spirits only, they are capable of being handled by
   God alone, whose energy and substance is spiritual. But, however, the
   sacred writings inform us in what manner the wicked are to undergo
   punishment. For because they have committed sins in their bodies, they
   will again be clothed with flesh, that they may make atonement in their
   bodies; and yet it will not be that flesh with which God clothed man,
   like this our earthly body, but indestructible, and abiding for ever,
   that it may be able to hold out against tortures and everlasting fire,
   the nature of which is different from this fire of ours, which we use
   for the necessary purposes of life, and which is extinguished unless it
   be sustained by the fuel of some material. But that divine fire always
   lives by itself, and flourishes without any nourishment; nor has it any
   smoke mixed with it, but it is pure and liquid, and fluid, after the
   manner of water. For it is not urged upwards by any force, as our fire,
   which the taint of the earthly body, by which it is held, and smoke
   intermingled, compels to leap forth, and to fly upwards to the nature
   of heaven, with a tremulous movement. [1413]

   The same divine fire, therefore, with one and the same force and power,
   will both burn the wicked and will form them again, and will replace as
   much as it shall consume of their bodies, and will supply itself with
   eternal nourishment: which the poets transferred to the vulture of
   Tityus. Thus, without any wasting of bodies, which regain their
   substance, it will only burn and affect them with a sense of pain. But
   when He shall have judged the righteous, He will also try them with
   fire. Then they whose sins shall exceed either in weight or in number,
   shall be scorched by the fire and burnt: [1414] but they whom full
   justice and maturity of virtue has imbued will not perceive that fire;
   for they have something of God in themselves which repels and rejects
   the violence of the flame. So great is the force of innocence, that the
   flame shrinks from it without doing harm; which has received from God
   this power, that it burns the wicked, and is under the command of the
   righteous. Nor, however, let any one imagine that souls are immediately
   judged after death. For all are detained in one and a common place of
   confinement, until the arrival of the time in which the great Judge
   shall make an investigation of their deserts. [1415] Then they whose
   piety shall have been approved of will receive the reward of
   immortality; but they whose sins and crimes shall have been brought to
   light will not rise again, but will be hidden in the same darkness with
   the wicked, being destined to certain punishment.

    Chap. XXII.--Of the Error of the Poets, and the Return of the Soul from the
    Lower Regions.

   Some imagine that these things are figments of the poets, not knowing
   whence the poets received them, and they say that these things are
   impossible; and it is no wonder that it so appears to them. For the
   matter is related by the poets in a manner which is different from the
   truth; for although they are much more ancient than the historians and
   orators, and other kinds of writers, yet because they were ignorant of
   the secret of the divine mystery, and mention of a future resurrection
   had reached them by an obscure rumour, yet they handed it down, when
   carelessly and lightly heard, after the manner of a feigned story. And
   yet they also testified that they did not follow a sure authority, but
   mere opinion, as Maro, who says, [1416]


   "What ear has heard let tongue make known."

   Although, therefore, they have partly corrupted the secrets of the
   truth, yet the matter itself is found to be more true, because it
   partly agrees with the prophets: which is sufficient for us as a proof
   of the matter. Yet some reason is contained in their error. For when
   the prophets proclaimed with continual announcements that the Son of
   God was about to judge the dead, and this announcement did not escape
   their notice; inasmuch as they supposed that there was no other ruler
   of heaven but Jupiter, they reported that the son of Jupiter was king
   in the lower regions, but not Apollo, or Liber, or Mercurius, who are
   supposed to be gods of heaven, but one who was both mortal and just,
   either Minos, or Æacus, or Rhadamanthus. Therefore with poetic licence
   they corrupted that which they had received; or, the opinion being
   scattered through different mouths and various discourses, changed the
   truth. For inasmuch as they foretold that, when a thousand years had
   been passed in the lower regions, they should again be restored to
   life, as Maro said: [1417] --


   "All these, when centuries ten times told

   The wheel of destiny have rolled,

   The voice divine from far and wide

   Calls up to Lethe's river side,

   That earthward they may pass once more,

   Remembering not the things before,

   And with a blind propension yearn

   To fleshly bodies to return:"

   this matter escaped their notice, that the dead will rise again, not
   after a thousand years from their death, but that, when again restored
   to life, they may reign with God a thousand years. For God will come,
   that, having cleansed the world from all defilement, He may restore the
   souls of the righteous to their renewed bodies, and raise them to
   everlasting blessedness. Therefore the other things are true, except
   the water of oblivion, which they feigned on this account, that no one
   might make this objection: why, therefore, did they not remember that
   they were at one time alive, or who they were, or what things they
   accomplished? But nevertheless it is not thought probable, and the
   whole matter is rejected, as though licentiously and fabulously
   invented. But when we affirm the doctrine of the resurrection, and
   teach that souls will return to another life, not forgetful of
   themselves, but possessed of the same perception and figure, we are met
   with this objection: So many ages have now passed; what individual ever
   arose from the dead, that through his example we may believe it to be
   possible? But the resurrection cannot take place while unrighteousness
   still prevails. For in this world men are slain by violence, by the
   sword, by ambush, by poisons, and are visited with injuries, with want,
   with imprisonment, with tortures, and with proscriptions. Add to this
   that righteousness is hated, that all who wish to follow God are not
   only held in hatred, but are harassed with all reproaches, and are
   tormented by manifold kinds of punishments, and are driven to the
   impious worship of gods made with hands, not by reason or truth, but by
   dreadful laceration of their bodies.

   Ought men therefore to rise again to these same things, or to return to
   a life in which it is impossible for them to be safe? Since the
   righteous, then, are so lightly esteemed, and so easily taken away,
   what can we suppose would have happened if any one returning from the
   dead had recovered life by a recovery [1418] of his former condition?
   He would assuredly be taken away from the eyes of men, lest, if he were
   seen or heard, all men with one accord should leave the gods and betake
   themselves to the worship and religion of the one God. Therefore it is
   necessary that the resurrection should take place once only when evil
   shall have been taken away, since it is befitting that those who have
   risen again should neither die any more, nor be injured in any way,
   that they may be able to pass a happy life whose death has been
   annulled. [1419] But the poets, knowing that this life abounds with all
   evils, introduced the river of oblivion, lest the souls, remembering
   their labours and evils, should refuse to return to the upper regions;
   whence Virgil says: [1420] --


   "O Father! and can thought conceive

   That happy souls this realm would leave,

   And seek the upper sky,

   With sluggish clay to reunite?

   This dreadful longing for the light,

   Whence comes it, say, and why?"

   For they did not know how or when it must take place; and therefore
   they supposed that souls were born again, and that they returned afresh
   to the womb, and went back to infancy. Whence also Plato, while
   discussing the nature of the soul, says that it may be known from this
   that souls are immortal and divine, because in boys minds are pliant,
   and easy of perception, and because they so quickly comprehend the
   subjects which they learn, that they appear not then to be learning for
   the first time, but to be recalling them to mind and recollecting them:
   in which matter the wise man most foolishly believed the poets.

    Chap. XXIII.--Of the Resurrection of the Soul, and the Proofs of This Fact.

   Therefore they will not be born again, which is impossible, but they
   will rise again, and be clothed by God with bodies, and will remember
   their former life, and all its actions; and being placed in the
   possession of heavenly goods, and enjoying the pleasure of innumerable
   resources, they will give thanks to God in His immediate presence,
   because He has destroyed all evil, and because He has raised them to
   His kingdom and to perpetual life. Respecting which resurrection the
   philosophers also attempted to speak as corruptly as the poets. For
   Pythagoras asserted that souls passed into new bodies; but foolishly,
   that they passed from men into cattle, and from cattle into men; and
   that he himself was restored from Euphorbus. Chrysippus says better,
   whom Cicero speaks of as supporting the portico of the Stoics, who, in
   the books which he wrote concerning providence, when he was speaking of
   the renewing of the world, introduced these words: "But since this is
   so, it is evident that nothing is impossible, and that we, after our
   death, when certain periods of time have again come round, are restored
   to this state in which we now are." But let us return from human to
   divine things. The Sibyl thus speaks:--


   "For the whole race of mortals is hard to be believed; but when the
   judgment of the world and of mortals shall now come, which God Himself
   shall institute, judging the impious and the holy at the same time,
   then at length He shall send the wicked to darkness in fire. But as
   many as are holy shall live again on the earth, God giving them at the
   same time a spirit, and honour, and life."

   But if not only prophets, but even bards, and poets, and philosophers,
   agree that there will be a resurrection of the dead, let no one ask of
   us how this is possible: for no reason can be assigned for divine
   works; but if from the beginning God formed man in some unspeakable
   manner, we may believe that the old man can be restored by Him who made
   the new man.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXIV.--Of the Renewed World.

   Now I will subjoin the rest. Therefore the Son of the most high and
   mighty God shall come to judge the quick and the dead, as the Sibyl
   testifies and says:--


   "For then there shall be confusion of mortals throughout the whole
   earth, when the Almighty Himself shall come on His judgment-seat to
   judge the souls of the quick and dead, and all the world."

   But He, when He shall have destroyed unrighteousness, and executed His
   great judgment, and shall have recalled to life the righteous, who have
   lived from the beginning, will be engaged among men a thousand years,
   and will rule them with most just command. Which the Sibyl proclaims in
   another place, as she utters her inspired predictions:--


   "Hear me, ye mortals; an everlasting King reigns."

   Then they who shall be alive in their bodies shall not die, but during
   those thousand years shall produce an infinite multitude, and their
   offspring shall be holy, and beloved by God; but they who shall be
   raised from the dead shall preside over the living as judges. [1421]
   But the nations shall not be entirely extinguished, but some shall be
   left as a victory for God, that they may be the occasion of triumph to
   the righteous, and may be subjected to perpetual slavery. About the
   same time also the prince of the devils, who is the contriver of all
   evils, shall be bound with chains, and shall be imprisoned during the
   thousand years of the heavenly rule in which righteousness shall reign
   in the world, so that he may contrive no evil against the people of
   God. After His coming the righteous shall be collected from all the
   earth, and the judgment being completed, the sacred city shall be
   planted in the middle of the earth, in which God Himself the builder
   may dwell together with the righteous, bearing rule in it. And the
   Sibyl marks out this city when she says:--


   "And the city which God made, this He made more brilliant than the
   stars, and sun, and moon."

   Then that darkness will be taken away from the world with which the
   heaven will be overspread and darkened, and the moon will receive the
   brightness of the sun, nor will it be further diminished: but the sun
   will become seven times brighter than it now is; and the earth will
   open its fruitfulness, and bring forth most abundant fruits of its own
   accord; the rocky mountains shall drop with honey; streams of wine
   shall run down, and rivers flow with milk: in short, the world itself
   shall rejoice, and all nature exult, being rescued and set free from
   the dominion of evil and impiety, and guilt and error. Throughout this
   time beasts shall not be nourished by blood, nor birds by prey; but all
   things shall be peaceful and tranquil. Lions and calves shall stand
   together at the manger, the wolf shall not carry off the sheep, the
   hound shall not hunt for prey; hawks and eagles shall not injure; the
   infant shall play with serpents. In short, those things shall then come
   to pass which the poets spoke of as being done in the reign of
   Saturnus. Whose error arose from this source,--that the prophets bring
   forward and speak of many future events as already accomplished. For
   visions were brought before their eyes by the divine Spirit, and they
   saw these things, as it were, done and completed in their own sight.
   And when fame had gradually spread abroad their predictions, since
   those who were uninstructed in the mysteries [1422] of religion did not
   know why they were spoken, they thought that all those things were
   already fulfilled in the ancient ages, which evidently could not be
   accomplished and fulfilled under the reign of a man. [1423] But when,
   after the destruction of impious religions and the suppression of
   guilt, the earth shall be subject to God,--


   "The sailor [1424] himself also shall renounce the sea, nor shall the
   naval pine

   Barter merchandise; all lands shall produce all things.

   The ground shall not endure the harrow, nor the vineyard the pruning
   hook;

   The sturdy ploughman also shall loose the bulls from the yoke.

   The plain shall by degrees grow yellow with soft ears of corn,

   The blushing grape shall hang on the uncultivated brambles,

   And hard oaks shall distil the dewy honey.

   Nor shall the wool learn to counterfeit various colours;

   But the ram himself in the meadows shall change his fleece,

   Now for a sweetly blushing purple, now for saffron dye;

   Scarlet of its own accord shall cover the lambs as they feed.

   The goats of themselves shall bring back home their udders distended
   with milk;

   Nor shall the herds dread huge lions." [1425]

   Which things the poet foretold according to the verses of the Cumæan
   Sibyl. But the Erythræan thus speaks:--


   "But wolves shall not contend with lambs on the mountains, and lynxes
   shall eat grass with kids; boars shall feed with calves, and with all
   flocks; and the carnivorous lion shall eat chaff at the manger, and
   serpents shall sleep with infants deprived of their mothers."

   And in another place, speaking of the fruitfulness of all things:--


   "And then shall God give great joy to men; for the earth, and the
   trees, and the numberless flocks of the earth shall give to men the
   true fruit of the vine, and sweet honey, and white milk, and corn,
   which is the best of all things to mortals."

   And another in the same manner:--


   "The sacred land of the pious only will produce all these things, the
   stream of honey from the rock and from the fountain, and the milk of
   ambrosia will flow for all the just."

   Therefore men will live a most tranquil life, abounding with resources,
   and will reign together with God; and the kings of the nations shall
   come from the ends of the earth with gifts and offerings, to adore and
   honour the great King, whose name shall be renowned and venerated by
   all the nations which shall be under heaven, and by the kings who shall
   rule on earth.

    Chap. XXV.--Of the Last Times, and of the City of Rome.

   These are the things which are spoken of by the prophets as about to
   happen hereafter: but I have not considered it necessary to bring
   forward their testimonies and words, since it would be an endless task;
   nor would the limits of my book receive so great a multitude of
   subjects, since so many with one breath speak similar things; and at
   the same time, lest weariness should be occasioned to the readers if I
   should heap together things collected and transferred from all;
   moreover, that I might confirm those very things which I said, not by
   my own writings, but in an especial manner by the writings of others,
   and might show that not only among us, but even with those very persons
   who revile us, the truth is preserved, [1426] which they refuse to
   acknowledge. [1427] But he who wishes to know these things more
   accurately may draw from the fountain itself, and he will know more
   things worthy of admiration than we have comprised in these books.
   Perhaps some one may now ask when these things of which we have spoken
   are about to come to pass? I have already shown above, that when six
   thousand years shall be completed this change must take place, and that
   the last day of the extreme conclusion is now drawing near. It is
   permitted us to know respecting the signs, which are spoken by the
   prophets, for they foretold signs by which the consummation of the
   times is to be expected by us from day to day, and to be feared. When,
   however, this amount will be completed, those teach, who have written
   respecting the times, collecting them from the sacred writings and from
   various histories, how great is the number of years from the beginning
   of the world. And although they vary, and the amount of the number as
   reckoned by them differs considerably, yet all expectation does not
   exceed the limit of two hundred years. The subject itself declares that
   the fall and ruin of the world will shortly take place; except that
   while the city of Rome remains it appears that nothing of this kind is
   to be feared. [1428] But when that capital of the world shall have
   fallen, and shall have begun to be a street, [1429] which the Sibyls
   say shall come to pass, who can doubt that the end has now arrived to
   the affairs of men and the whole world? It is that city, that only,
   which still sustains all things; and the God of heaven is to be
   entreated by us and implored--if, indeed, His arrangements and decrees
   can be delayed--lest, sooner than we think for, that detestable tyrant
   should come who will undertake so great a deed, and dig out that eye,
   by the destruction of which the world itself is about to fall. Now let
   us return, to set forth the other things which are then about to
   follow.

    Chap. XXVI.--Of the Loosing of the Devil, and of the Second and Greatest
    Judgment.

   We have said, a little before, that it will come to pass at the
   commencement of the sacred reign, that the prince of the devils will be
   bound by God. But he also, when the thousand years of the kingdom, that
   is, seven thousand of the world, shall begin to be ended, will be
   loosed afresh, and being sent forth from prison, will go forth and
   assemble all the nations, which shall then be under the dominion of the
   righteous, that they may make war against the holy city; and there
   shall be collected together from all the world an innumerable company
   of the nations, and shall besiege and surround the city. Then the last
   anger of God shall come upon the nations, and shall utterly [1430]
   destroy them; and first He shall shake the earth most violently, and by
   its motion the mountains of Syria shall be rent, and the hills shall
   sink down precipitously, and the walls of all cities shall fall, and
   God shall cause the sun to stand, so that he set not for three days,
   and shall set it on fire; and excessive heat and great burning shall
   descend upon the hostile and impious people, and showers of brimstone,
   and hailstones, and drops of fire; and their spirits shall melt through
   the heat, and their bodies shall be bruised by the hail, and they shall
   smite one another with the sword. The mountains shall be filled with
   carcases, and the plains shall be covered with bones; but the people of
   God during those three days shall be concealed under caves of the
   earth, until the anger of God against the nations and the last judgment
   shall be ended.

   Then the righteous shall go forth from their hiding-places, and shall
   find all things covered with carcases and bones. But the whole race of
   the wicked shall utterly perish; and there shall no longer be any
   nation in this world, but the nation of God alone. Then for seven
   continuous years the woods shall be untouched, nor shall timber be cut
   from the mountains, but the arms of the nations shall be burnt; and now
   there shall be no war, but peace and everlasting rest. But when the
   thousand years shall be completed, the world shall be renewed by God,
   and the heavens shall be folded together, and the earth shall be
   changed, and God shall transform men into the similitude of angels, and
   they shall be white as snow; and they shall always be employed in the
   sight of the Almighty, and shall make offerings to their Lord, and
   serve Him for ever. At the same time shall take place that second and
   public resurrection [1431] of all, in which the unrighteous shall be
   raised to everlasting punishments. These are they who have worshipped
   the works of their own hands, who have either been ignorant of, or have
   denied the Lord and Parent of the world. But their lord with his
   servants shall be seized and condemned to punishment, together with
   whom all the band of the wicked, in accordance with their deeds, shall
   be burnt for ever with perpetual fire in the sight of angels and the
   righteous.

   This is the doctrine of the holy prophets which we Christians follow;
   this is our wisdom, which they who worship frail objects, or maintain
   an empty philosophy, deride as folly and vanity, because we are not
   accustomed to defend and assert it in public, since God orders us in
   quietness and silence to hide His secret, and to keep it within our own
   conscience; and not to strive with obstinate contention against those
   who are ignorant of the truth, and who rigorously assail God and His
   religion not for the sake of learning, but of censuring and jeering.
   For a mystery ought to be most faithfully concealed and covered,
   especially by us, who bear the name of faith. [1432] But they accuse
   this silence of ours, as though it were the result of an evil
   conscience; whence also they invent some detestable things respecting
   those who are holy and blameless, and willingly believe their own
   inventions.


   The address to Constantine is wanting in some mss. and editions, but is
   inserted in the text by Migne, as found in some important mss., and as
   in accordance with the style and spirit of Lactantius.

   But all fictions have now been hushed, most holy Emperor, since the
   time when the great God raised thee up for the restoration of the house
   of justice, and for the protection of the human race; for while thou
   rulest the Roman state, we worshippers of God are no more regarded as
   accursed and impious. Since the truth now comes forth [1433] from
   obscurity, and is brought into light, we are not censured as
   unrighteous who endeavour to perform the works of righteousness. No one
   any longer reproaches us with the name of God. None of us, who are
   alone of all men religious, is any more called irreligious; since
   despising the images of the dead, we worship the living and true God.
   The providence of the supreme Deity has raised thee to the imperial
   dignity, that thou mightest be able with true piety to rescind the
   injurious decrees of others, to correct faults, to provide with a
   father's clemency for the safety of men,--in short, to remove the
   wicked from the state, whom being cast down by pre-eminent piety, God
   has delivered into your hands, that it might be evident to all in what
   true majesty consists.

   For they who wished to take away the worship of the heavenly and
   matchless [1434] God, that they might defend impious superstitions, lie
   in ruin. [1435] But thou, who defendest and lovest His name, excelling
   in virtue and prosperity, enjoyest thy immortal glories with the
   greatest happiness. They suffer and have suffered the punishment of
   their guilt. The powerful right hand of God protects thee from all
   dangers; He bestows on thee a quiet and tranquil reign, with the
   highest congratulations of all men. And not undeservedly has the Lord
   and Ruler of the world chosen thee in preference to all others, by whom
   He might renew His holy religion, since thou alone didst exist of all,
   who mightest afford a surpassing example of virtue and holiness: in
   which thou mightest not only equal, but also, which is a very great
   matter, excel the glory of ancient princes, whom nevertheless fame
   reckons among the good. They indeed perhaps by nature only resembled
   the righteous. For he who is ignorant of God, the Ruler of the
   universe, may attain to a resemblance of righteousness, but he cannot
   attain to righteousness itself. But thou, both by the innate sanctity
   of thy character, and by thy acknowledgment of the truth and of God in
   every action, dost fully perform [1436] the works of righteousness.
   [1437] It was therefore befitting that, in arranging the condition of
   the human race, the Deity should make use of thy authority and service.
   Whom we supplicate with daily prayers, that He may especially guard
   thee whom He has wished to be the guardian of the world: then that He
   may inspire thee with a disposition by which thou mayest always
   continue in the love of the divine name. For this is serviceable to
   all, both to thee for happiness, and to others for repose.

    Chap. XXVII.--An Encouragement and Confirmation of the Pious.

   Since we have completed the seven courses [1438] of the work which we
   undertook, and have advanced to the goal, it remains that we exhort all
   to undertake wisdom together with true religion, the strength and
   office of which depends on this, that, despising earthly things, and
   laying aside the errors by which we were formerly held while we served
   frail things, and desired frail things, we may be directed to the
   eternal rewards of the heavenly treasure. And that we may obtain these,
   the alluring pleasures of the present life must as soon as possible be
   laid aside, which soothe the souls of men with pernicious sweetness.
   How great a happiness must it be thought, to be withdrawn from these
   stains of the earth, and to go to that most just Judge and indulgent
   Father, who in the place of labours gives rest, in the place of death
   life, in the place of darkness brightness, and in the place of short
   and earthly goods, gives those which are eternal and heavenly: with
   which reward the hardships and miseries which we endure in this world,
   in accomplishing the works of righteousness, can in no way be compared
   and equalled. Therefore, if we wish to be wise and happy, not only must
   those sayings of Terence be reflected upon and proposed to us,


   "That we must ever grind at the mill, we must be beaten, and put in
   fetters;" [1439]

   but things much more dreadful than these must be endured, namely, the
   prison, chains, and tortures: pains must be undergone, in short, death
   itself must be undertaken and borne, when it is clear to our conscience
   that that frail pleasure will not be without punishment, nor virtue
   without a divine reward. All, therefore, ought to endeavour either to
   direct themselves to the right way as soon as possible, or, having
   undertaken and exercised virtues, and having patiently performed the
   labours of this life, to deserve to have God as their comforter. For
   our Father and Lord, who built and strengthened the heaven, who placed
   in it the sun, with the other heavenly bodies, who by His power weighed
   the earth and fenced it with mountains, surrounded it with the sea, and
   divided it with rivers, and who made and completed out of nothing
   whatever there is in this workmanship of the world; having observed the
   errors of men, sent a Guide, who might open to us the way of
   righteousness: let us all follow Him, let us hear Him, let us obey Him
   with the greatest devotedness, since He alone, as Lucretius says,
   [1440]


   "Cleansed men's breasts with truth-telling precepts, and fixed a limit
   to lust and fear, and explained what was the chief good which we all
   strive to reach, and pointed out the road by which, along a narrow
   track, we might arrive at it in a straightforward course."

   And not only pointed it out, but also went before us in it, that no one
   might dread the path of virtue on account of its difficulty. Let the
   way of destruction and deceit, if it is possible, be deserted, in which
   death is concealed, being covered by the attractions of pleasure.

   And the more nearly each one, as his years incline to old age, sees to
   be the approach of that day in which he must depart from this life, let
   him reflect how he may leave it in purity, how he may come to the Judge
   in innocency; not as they do, to whose dark minds the light is denied,
   [1441] who, when the strength of their body now fails, are admonished
   in this of the last pressing necessity, that they should with greater
   eagerness and ardour apply themselves to the satisfying of their lusts.
   From which abyss let everyone free himself while it is permitted him,
   while the opportunity is present, and let him turn himself to God with
   his whole mind, that he may without anxiety await that day, in which
   God, the Ruler and Lord of the world, shall judge the deeds and
   thoughts of each. Whatever things are here desired, let him not only
   neglect, but also avoid them, and let him judge that his soul is of
   greater value than those deceitful goods, the possession of which is
   uncertain and transitory; for they take their departure every day, and
   they go forth much more quickly than they had entered, and if it is
   permitted us to enjoy them even to the last, they must still, without
   doubt, be left to others. We can take nothing with us, except a well
   and innocently spent life. That man will appear before God with
   abundant resources, that man will appear in opulence, to whom there
   shall belong self-restraint, mercy, patience, love, and faith. This is
   our inheritance, which can neither be taken away from any one, nor
   transferred to another. And who is there who would wish to provide and
   acquire for himself these goods?

   Let those who are hungry come, that being fed with heavenly food, they
   may lay aside their lasting hunger; let those who are athirst come,
   that they may with full mouth draw forth the water of salvation from an
   ever-flowing fountain. [1442] By this divine food and drink the blind
   shall both see, and the deaf hear, and the dumb speak, and the lame
   walk, and the foolish shall be wise, and the sick shall be strong, and
   the dead shall come to life again. For whoever by his virtue has
   trampled upon the corruptions of the earth, the supreme and truthful
   arbiter will raise him to life and to perpetual light. Let no one trust
   in riches, no one in badges of authority, no one even in royal power:
   these things do not make a man immortal. For whosoever shall cast away
   the conduct becoming a man, [1443] and, following present things, shall
   prostrate himself upon the ground, will be punished as a deserter from
   his Lord, his commander, and his Father. Let us therefore apply
   ourselves to righteousness, which will alone, as an inseparable
   companion, lead us to God; and "while a spirit rules these limbs,"
   [1444] let us serve God with unwearied service, let us keep our posts
   and watches, let us boldly engage with the enemy whom we know, that
   victorious and triumphant over our conquered adversary, we may obtain
   from the Lord that reward of valour which He Himself has promised.

   Addressed to His Brother Pentadius.
     __________________________________________________________________

    The Preface.--The Plan and Purport of the Whole Epitome, [1445] And of the
    Institutions.

   Although the books of the Divine Institutions which we wrote a long
   time since to illustrate the truth and religion, may so prepare and
   mould the minds of the readers, that their length may not produce
   disgust, nor their copiousness be burthensome; nevertheless you desire,
   O brother Pentadius, that an epitome of them should be made for you, I
   suppose for this reason, that I may write something to you, and that
   your name may be rendered famous by my work, such as it is. I will
   comply with your desire, although it seems a difficult matter to
   comprise within the compass of one book those things which have been
   treated of in seven large volumes. [1446] For the whole matter becomes
   less full when so great a multitude of subjects is to be compressed
   within a narrow space; and it becomes less clear by its very brevity,
   especially since many arguments and examples, on which the elucidation
   of the proofs depends, must of necessity be omitted, since their
   copiousness is so great, that even by themselves they are enough to
   make up a book. And when these are removed, what can appear useful,
   what plain? But I will strive as much as the subject permits, both to
   contract that which is diffuse and to shorten that which is long; in
   such a manner, however, that in this work, in which truth is to be
   brought to light, matter may not seem to be wanting for copiousness,
   nor clearness for understanding it. [1447]

    Chap. I.--Of the Divine Providence.

   First a question arises: Whether there is any providence which made or
   governs the world? That there is, no one doubts, since of almost all
   the philosophers, except the school of Epicurus, there is but one voice
   and one opinion, that the world could not have been made without a
   contriver, and that it cannot exist without a ruler. Therefore Epicurus
   is refuted not only by the most learned men, but also by the
   testimonies and perceptions of all mortals. For who can doubt
   respecting a providence, when he sees that the heavens and the earth
   have been so arranged and that all things have been so regulated, that
   they might be most befittingly adapted, not only to wonderful beauty
   and adornment, but also to the use of men, and the convenience of the
   other living creatures? That, therefore, which exists in accordance
   with a plan, cannot have had its beginning without a plan: thus [1448]
   it is certain that there is a providence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1448] Quoniam. This word appears to be out of place, as its proper
   meaning is "since." Either it must be taken as above, or, with some
   editors, the last clause of this chapter may be taken as the beginning
   of the next chapter--"Since there is a providence," etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. II.--That There is But One God, and that There Cannot Be More.

   Another question follows: Whether there be one God or more? And this
   indeed contains much ambiguity. For not only do individuals differ
   among themselves, but also peoples and nations. But he who shall follow
   the guidance of reason will understand that there cannot be a Lord
   except one, nor a Father except one. For if God, who made all things,
   is also Lord and Father, He must be one only, so that the same may be
   the head and source of all things. Nor is it possible for the world
   [1449] to exist unless all things be referred to one person, unless one
   hold the rudder, unless one guide the reins, and, as it were, one mind
   direct all the members of the body. If there are many kings in a swarm
   of bees, they will perish or be scattered abroad, while


   "Discord attacks the kings with great commotion." [1450]

   If there are several leaders in a herd, they will contend until one
   gains the mastery. [1451] If there are many commanders in an army, the
   soldiers cannot obey, since different commands are given; nor can unity
   be maintained by themselves, since each consults his own interests
   according to his humours. [1452] Thus, in this commonwealth of the
   world, unless there were one ruler, who was also its founder, either
   this mass would be dissolved, or it could not have been put together at
   all.

   Moreover, the whole authority could not exist in many deities, since
   they separately maintain their own duties and their own prerogatives.
   No one, therefore, of them can be called omnipotent, which is the true
   title of God, since he will be able to accomplish that only which
   depends upon himself, and will not venture to attempt that which
   depends upon others. Vulcan will not claim for himself water, nor
   Neptune fire; nor will Ceres claim acquaintance with the arts, nor
   Minerva with fruits; nor will Mercury lay claim to arms, nor Mars to
   the lyre; Jupiter will not claim medicine, nor Æsculapius the
   thunderbolt: he will more easily endure it when thrown by another, than
   he will brandish it himself. If, therefore, individuals cannot do all
   things, they have less strength and less power; but he is to be
   regarded as God who can accomplish the whole, and not he who can only
   accomplish the smallest part of the whole.

    Chap. III.--The Testimonies of the Poets Concerning the One God.

   There is, then, one God, perfect, eternal, incorruptible, incapable of
   suffering, subject to no circumstance or power, Himself possessing all
   things, ruling all things, whom the human mind can neither estimate in
   thought nor mortal tongue describe in speech. For He is too elevated
   and great to be conceived by the thought, or expressed by the language
   of man. In short, not to speak of the prophets, the preachers of the
   one God, poets also, and philosophers, and inspired women, [1453] utter
   their testimony to the unity of God. Orpheus speaks of the surpassing
   God who made the heaven and the sun, with the other heavenly bodies;
   who made the earth and the seas. Also our own Maro calls the Supreme
   God at one time a spirit, at another time a mind, and says that it, as
   though infused into limbs, puts in motion the body of the whole world;
   also, that God permeates the heights of heaven, the tracts of the sea
   and lands, and that all living creatures derive their life from Him.
   Even Ovid was not ignorant that the world was prepared by God, whom he
   sometimes calls the framer of all things, sometimes the fabricator of
   the world. [1454]

     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. IV.--The Testimonies of the Philosophers to the Unity of God.

   But let us come to the philosophers, whose authority is regarded as
   more certain than that of the poets. Plato asserts His monarchy, saying
   that there is but one God, by whom the world was prepared and completed
   with wonderful order. Aristotle, his disciple, admits that there is one
   mind which presides over the world. Antisthenes says that there is one
   who is God by nature, [1455] the governor of the whole system. It would
   be a long task to recount the statements which have been made
   respecting the Supreme God, either by Thales, or by Pythagoras and
   Anaximenes before him, or afterwards by the Stoics Cleanthes and
   Chrysippus and Zeno, or of our countrymen, by Seneca following the
   Stoics, and by Tullius himself, since all these attempted to define the
   being of God, [1456] and affirmed that the world is ruled by Him alone,
   and that He is not subject to any nature, since all nature derives its
   origin from Him.

   Hermes, who, on account of his virtue and his knowledge of many arts,
   deserved the name of Trismegistus, who preceded the philosophers in the
   antiquity of his doctrine, and who is reverenced by the Egyptians as a
   god, in asserting the majesty of the one God with infinite praises,
   calls Him Lord and Father, and says that He is without a name because
   He does not stand in need of a proper name, inasmuch as He is alone,
   and that He has no parents, since He exists of Himself and by Himself.
   In writing to his son he thus begins: To understand God is difficult,
   to describe Him in speech is impossible, even for one to whom it is
   possible to understand Him; for the perfect cannot be comprehended by
   the imperfect, nor the invisible by the visible.

    Chap. V.--That the Prophetic Women--That Is, the Sibyls--Declare that There
    is But One God.

   It remains to speak of the prophetic women. Varro relates that there
   were ten Sibyls,--the first of the Persians, the second the Libyan, the
   third the Delphian, the fourth the Cimmerian, the fifth the Erythræan,
   the sixth the Samian, the seventh the Cumæan, the eighth the
   Hellespontian, the ninth the Phrygian, the tenth the Tiburtine, who has
   the name of Albunea. Of all these, he says that there are three books
   of the Cumæan alone which contain the fates of the Romans, and are
   accounted sacred, but that there exist, and are commonly regarded as
   separate, books of almost all the others, but that they are entitled,
   as though by one name, Sibylline books, excepting that the Erythræan,
   who is said to have lived in the times of the Trojan war, placed her
   name in her book: the writings of the others are mixed together. [1457]

   All these Sibyls of whom I have spoken, except the Cumæan, whom none
   but the Quindecemviri [1458] are allowed to read, bear witness that
   there is but one God, the ruler, the maker, the parent, not begotten of
   any, but sprung from Himself, who was from all ages, and will be to all
   ages; and therefore is alone worthy of being worshipped, alone of being
   feared, alone of being reverenced, by all living beings;--whose
   testimonies I have omitted because I was unable to abridge them; but if
   you wish to see them, you must have recourse to the books themselves.
   Now let us follow up the remaining subjects.

    Chap. VI.--Since God is Eternal and Immortal, He Does Not Stand in Need of
    Sex and Succession.

   These testimonies, therefore, so many and so great, clearly teach that
   there is but one government in the world, and one power, the origin of
   which cannot be imagined, or its force described. They are foolish,
   therefore, who imagine that the gods were born of marriage, since the
   sexes themselves, and the intercourse between them, were given to
   mortals by God for this reason, that every race might be preserved by a
   succession of offspring. But what need have the immortals either of sex
   or succession since neither pleasure nor death affects them? Those,
   therefore, who are reckoned as gods, since it is evident that they were
   born as men, and that they begat others, were plainly mortals: but they
   were believed to be gods, because, when they were great and powerful
   kings, on account of the benefits which they had conferred upon men,
   they deserved to obtain divine honours after death; and temples and
   statues being erected to them, their memory was retained and celebrated
   as that of immortals.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. VII.--Of the Wicked Life and Death of Hercules.

   But though almost all nations are persuaded that they are gods, yet
   their actions, as related both by poets and historians, declare that
   they were men. Who is ignorant of the times in which Hercules lived,
   since he both sailed with the Argonauts on their expedition, and having
   stormed Troy, slew Laomedon, the father of Priam, on account of his
   perjury? From that time rather more than fifteen hundred years are
   reckoned. He is said not even to have been born honourably, but to have
   been sprung from Alcmena by adultery, and to have been himself addicted
   to the vices of his father. He never abstained from women, or males,
   and traversed the whole world, not so much for the sake of glory as of
   lust, nor so much for the slaughter of beasts as for the begetting of
   children. And though he was unvanquished, yet he was triumphed over by
   Omphale alone, to whom he gave up his club and lion's skin; and being
   clothed in a woman's garment, and crouching at a woman's feet, he
   received his task [1459] to execute. He afterwards, in a transport of
   frenzy, killed his little children and his wife Megara. At last, having
   put on a garment sent by his wife Deianyra, when he was perishing
   through ulcers, being unable to endure the pain, he constructed for
   himself a funeral pile on Mount OEta, and burnt himself alive. Thus it
   is effected, that although on account of his excellence [1460] he might
   have been believed to be a god, nevertheless on account of these things
   be is believed to have been a man.

    Chap. VIII.--Of Æsculapius, Apollo, Mars, Castor and Pollux, and of
    Mercurius and Bacchus.

   Tarquitius relates that Æsculapius was born of doubtful parents, and
   that on this account he was exposed; and being taken up by hunters, and
   fed by the teats of a hound, was given to Chiron for instruction. He
   lived at Epidaurus, and was buried at Cynosuræ, as Cicero says, [1461]
   when he had been killed by lightning. But Apollo, his father, did not
   disdain to take charge of another's flock that he might receive a wife;
   [1462] and when he had unintentionally killed a boy whom he loved, he
   inscribed his own lamentations on a flower. Mars, a man of the greatest
   bravery, was not free from the charge of adultery, since he was made a
   spectacle, being bound with a chain together with the adulteress.

   Castor and Pollux carried off the brides of others, but not with
   impunity, to whose death and burial Homer bears witness, not with
   poetical, but simple faith. Mercurius, who was the father of Androgynus
   by his intrigue with Venus, deserved to be a god, because he invented
   the lyre and the palæstra. Father Bacchus, after subduing India as a
   conqueror, having by chance come to Crete, saw Ariadne on the shore,
   whom Theseus had forced and deserted. Then, being inflamed by love, he
   united her in marriage to himself, and placed her crown, as the poets
   say, conspicuously among the stars. The mother of the gods [1463]
   herself, while she lived in Phrygia after the banishment and death of
   her husband, though a widow, and aged, was enamoured of a beautiful
   youth; and because he was not faithful, she mutilated, and rendered him
   effeminate: on which account even now she delights in the Galli [1464]
   as her priests.

    Chap. IX.--Of the Disgraceful Deeds of the Gods.

   Whence did Ceres bring forth Proserpine, except from debauchery? Whence
   did Latona bring forth her twins, except from crime? Venus having been
   subject to the lusts of gods and men, when she reigned in Cyprus,
   invented the practice of courtesanship, and commanded women to make
   traffic of themselves, that she might not alone be infamous. Were the
   virgins themselves, Minerva and Diana, chaste? Whence, then, did
   Erichthonius arise? Did Vulcan shed his seed upon the ground, and was
   man born from that as a fungus? Or why did Diana banish Hippolytus
   either to a retired place, or give him up to a woman, where he might
   pass his life in solitude among unknown groves, and having now changed
   his name, might be called Virbius? What do these things signify but
   impurity, which the poets do not venture to confess?

    Chap. X.--Of Jupiter, and His Licentious Life.

   But respecting the king and father of all these, Jupiter, whom they
   believe to possess the chief power in heaven,--what power [1465] had
   he, who banished his father Saturnus from his kingdom, and pursued him
   with arms when he fled? What self-restraint had he, who indulged every
   kind of lust? For he made Alcmena and Leda, the wives of great men,
   infamous through his adultery: he also, captivated with the beauty of a
   boy, carried him off with violence as he was hunting and meditating
   manly things, that he might treat him as a woman. Why should I mention
   his debaucheries of virgins? and how great a multitude of these there
   was, is shown by the number of his sons. In the case of Thetis alone he
   was more temperate. For it bad been predicted that the son whom she
   should bring forth would be more powerful than his father. Therefore he
   struggled with his love, that one might not be born greater than
   himself. He knew, therefore, that he was not of perfect virtue,
   greatness, and power, since he feared that which he himself had done to
   his father. Why, therefore, is he called best and greatest, since he
   both contaminated himself with faults, which is the part of one who is
   unjust and bad, and feared a greater than himself, which is the part of
   one who is weak and inferior?

    Chap. XI.--The Various Emblems Under Which the Poets Veiled the Turpitude of
    Jupiter.

   But some one will say that these things are feigned by the poets. This
   is not the usage of the poets, to feign in such a manner that you
   fabricate the whole, but so that you cover the actions themselves with
   a figure, and, as it were, with a variegated veil. Poetic licence has
   this limit, not that it may invent the whole, which is the part of one
   who is false and senseless, but that it may change something
   consistently with reason. They said that Jupiter changed himself into a
   shower of gold, that he might deceive Danae. What is a shower of gold?
   Plainly golden coins, by offering a great quantity of which, and
   pouring them into her bosom, he corrupted the frailty of her virgin
   soul by this bribe. Thus also they speak of a shower of iron, when they
   wish to signify a multitude of javelins. He carried off his catamite
   upon an eagle. What is the eagle? Truly a legion, since the figure of
   this animal is the standard of the legion. He carried Europa across the
   sea on a bull. What is the bull? Clearly a ship, which had its tutelary
   image [1466] fashioned in the shape of a bull. So assuredly the
   daughter of Inachus was not turned into a cow, nor as such did she swim
   across, but she escaped the anger of Juno in a ship which had the form
   of a cow. Lastly, when she had been conveyed to Egypt, she became Isis,
   whose voyage is celebrated on a fixed day, in memory of her flight.

    Chap. XII.--The Poets Do Not Invent All Those Things Which Relate to the
    Gods.

   You see, then, that the poets did not invent all things, and that they
   prefigured some things, that, when they spoke the truth, they might add
   something like this of divinity to those whom they called gods; as they
   did also respecting their kingdoms. For when they say that Jupiter had
   by lot the kingdom of Coelus, they either menu Mount Olympus, on which
   ancient stories relate that Saturnus, and afterwards Jupiter, dwelt, or
   a part of the East, which is, as it were, higher, because the light
   arises thence; but the region of the West is lower, and therefore they
   say that Pluto obtained the lower regions; but that the sea was given
   to Neptune, because he had the maritime coast, with all the islands.
   Many things are thus coloured by the poets; and they who are ignorant
   of this, censure them as false, but only in word: for in fact they
   believe them, since they so fashion the images of the gods, that when
   they make them male and female, and confess that some are married, some
   parents, and some children, they plainly assent to the poets; for these
   relations cannot exist without intercourse and the generation of
   children.

    Chap. XIII.--The Actions of Jupiter are Related from the Historian
    Euhemerus.

   But let us leave the poets; let us come to history, which is supported
   both by the credibility of the facts and by the antiquity of the times.
   Euhemerus was a Messenian, a very ancient writer, who gave an account
   of the origin of Jupiter, and his exploits, and all his posterity,
   gathered from the sacred inscriptions of ancient temples; he also
   traced out the parents of the other gods, their countries, actions,
   commands, and deaths, and even their sepulchres. And this history
   Ennius translated into Latin, whose words are these:--


   "As these things are written, so is the origin and kindred of Jupiter
   and his brothers; after this manner it is handed clown to us in the
   sacred writing."

   The same Euhemerus therefore relates that Jupiter, when he had five
   times gone round the world, and had distributed governments to his
   friends and relatives, and had given laws to men, and had wrought many
   other benefits, being endued with immortal glory and everlasting
   remembrance, ended his life in Crete, and departed to the gods, and
   that his sepulchre is in Crete, in the town of Gnossus, and that upon
   it is engraved in ancient Greek letters Zankronou, which is Jupiter the
   son of Saturnus. It is plain, therefore, from the things which I have
   related, that he was a man, and reigned on the earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XIV.--The Actions of Saturnus and Uranus Taken from the Historians.

   Let us pass on to former things, that we may discover the origin of the
   whole error. Saturnus is said to have been born of Coelus and Terra.
   This is plainly incredible; but there is a certain reason why it is
   thus related, and he who is ignorant of this rejects it as a fable.
   That Uranus was the father of Saturnus, both Hermes affirms, and sacred
   history teaches. When Trismegistus said that there were very few men of
   perfect learning, he enumerated among them his relatives, Uranus,
   Saturnus, and Mercurius. Euhemerus relates that the same Uranus was the
   first who reigned on earth, using these words: "In the beginning Coelus
   first had the chief power on earth: he instituted and prepared that
   kingdom for himself together with his brothers." [1467]

    Chap. XX.--Of the Gods Peculiar to the Romans.

   I have spoken of the religious rites which are common to all nations. I
   will now speak of the gods which the Romans have peculiar to
   themselves. Who does not know that the wife of Faustulus, the nurse of
   Romulus and Remus, in honour of whom the Larentinalia were instituted,
   was a harlot? And for this reason she was called Lupa, and represented
   in the form of a wild beast. Faula also and Flora were harlots, of whom
   the one was the mistress of Hercules, as Verrius relates; the other,
   having acquired great wealth by her person, made the people her heir,
   and on this account the games called Floralia are celebrated in her
   honour.

   Tatius consecrated the statue of a woman which had been found in the
   principal sewer, and called it by the name of the goddess Cloacina. The
   Romans, being besieged by the Gauls, made engines for throwing weapons
   of the hair of women; and on this account they erected an altar and
   temple to Venus Calva: [1468] also to Jupiter Pistor, [1469] because he
   had advised them in a dream to make all their corn into bread, and to
   throw it upon the enemy; and when this had been done, the Gauls,
   despairing of being able to reduce the Romans by famine, had abandoned
   the siege. Tullus Hostilius made Fear and Pallor gods. Mind is also
   worshipped; but if they had possessed it, they would never, I believe,
   have thought that it ought to be worshipped. Marcellus originated
   Honour and Virtue.

    Chap. XXI.--Of the Sacred Rites of the Roman Gods.

   But the senate also instituted other false gods of this kind,--Hope,
   Faith, Concord, Peace, Chastity, Piety; all of which, since they ought
   truly to be in the minds of men, they have falsely placed within walls.
   But although these have no substantial existence outside of man,
   nevertheless I should prefer that they should be worshipped, rather
   than Blight or Fever, which ought not to be consecrated, but rather to
   be execrated; than Fornax, together with her sacred ovens; than
   Stercutus, who first showed men to enrich the ground with manure; than
   the goddess Muta, who brought forth the Lares; than Cumina, who
   presides over the cradles of infants; than Caca, who gave information
   to Hercules respecting the stealing of his cattle, that he might slay
   her brother. How many other monstrous and ludicrous fictions there are,
   respecting which it is grievous to speak! I do not, however, wish to
   omit notice of Terminus, since it is related that he did not give way
   even to Jupiter, though he was an unwrought stone. They suppose that he
   has the custody of the boundaries, and public prayers are offered to
   him, that he may keep the stone of the Capitol immoveable, and preserve
   and extend the boundaries of the Roman empire.

    Chap. XXII.--Of the Sacred Rites Introduced by Faunus and Numa.

   Faunas was the first in Latium who introduced these follies, who both
   instituted bloody sacrifices to his grandfather Saturnus, and wished
   that his father Picus should be worshipped as a god, and placed Fatua
   Fauna his wife and sister among the gods, and named her the good
   goddess. Then at Rome, Numa, who burthened those rude and rustic then
   with new superstitions, instituted priesthoods, and distributed the
   gods into families and nations, that he might call off the fierce
   spirits of the people from the pursuits of arms. Therefore Lucilius, in
   deriding the folly of those who are slaves to vain superstitions,
   introduced these verses:--


   "Those bugbears [1470] the Lamiæ, which Faunus and Numa Pompilius and
   others instituted, at these he trembles; he places everything in this.
   As infant boys believe that every statue of bronze is a living man, so
   these imagine that all things reigned are true: they believe that
   statues of bronze contain a heart. It is a painter's [1471] gallery;
   nothing is real, everything fictitious."

   Tullius also, writing of the nature of the gods, complains that false
   and fictitious gods have been introduced, and that from thus source
   have arisen false opinions, and turbulent errors, and almost old
   womanly superstitions, which opinion ought in comparison [1472] with
   others to be esteemed more weighty, because these things were spoken by
   one who was both a philosopher and a priest.

    Chap. XXIII.--Of the Gods and Sacred Rites of the Barbarians.

   We have spoken respecting the gods: now we will speak of the rites and
   practices of their sacred institutions. A human victim used to be
   immolated to the Cyprian Jupiter, as Teucer had appointed. Thus also
   the Tauri used to offer strangers to Diana; the Latian Jupiter also was
   propitiated with human blood. Also before Saturnus, men of sixty years
   of age, according to the oracle [1473] of Apollo, were thrown from a
   bridge into the Tiber. And the Carthaginians not only offered infants
   to the same Saturnus; but being conquered by the Sicilians, to make an
   expiation, they immolated two hundred sons of nobles. And not more mild
   than these are those offerings which are even now made to the Great
   Mother and to Bellona, in which the priests make an offering, not with
   the blood of others, but with their own blood; when, mutilating
   themselves, they cease to be men, and yet do not pass over to the
   women; or, cutting their shoulders, they sprinkle the loathsome altars
   with their own blood. But these things are cruel.

   Let us come to those which are mild. The sacred rites of Isis show
   nothing else than the manner in which she lost and found her little
   son, who is called Osiris. For first her priests and attendants, having
   shaved all their limbs, and beating their breasts, howl, lament, and
   search, imitating the manner in which his mother was affected;
   afterwards the boy is found by Cynocephalus. Thus the mournful rites
   are ended with gladness. The mystery of Ceres also resembles these, in
   which torches are lighted, and Proserpine is sought for through the
   night; and when she has been found, the whole rite is finished with
   congratulations and the throwing about of torches. The people of
   Lampsacus, offer an ass to Priapus as an appropriate victim. [1474]
   Lindus is a town of Rhodes, where sacred rites in honour of Hercules
   are celebrated with revilings. For when Hercules had taken away his
   oxen from a ploughman, and had slain them, he avenged his injury by
   taunts; and afterwards having been himself appointed priest, it was
   ordained that he himself, and other priests after him, should celebrate
   sacrifices with the same revilings. But the mystery of the Cretan
   Jupiter represents the manner in which he was withdrawn from his
   father, or brought up. The goat is beside him, by the teats of which
   Amalthea nourished the boy. The sacred rites of the mother of the gods
   also show the same thing. For because the Corybantes then drowned the
   cry of the boy by the tinkling of their helmets and the striking of
   their shields, a representation of this circumstance is now repeated in
   the sacred rites; but cymbals are beaten instead of helmets, and drums
   instead of shields, that Saturnus may not hear the cries of the boy.

    Chap. XXIV.--Of the Origin of Sacred Rites and Superstitions.

   These are the mysteries of the gods. Now let us inquire also into the
   origin of superstitions, that we may search out by whom and at what
   times they were instituted. Didymus, in those books which are inscribed
   Of the Explanation of Pindar, relates that Melisseus was king of the
   Cretans, whose daughters were Amalthea and Melissa, who nourished
   Jupiter with goats' milk and honey; that he introduced new rites and
   ceremonies of sacred things, and was the first who sacrificed to gods,
   that is, to Vesta, who is called Tellus,--whence the poet says:--


   "And the first of the gods,

   Tellus,"--

   and afterwards to the mother of the gods. But Euhemerus, in his sacred
   history, says that Jupiter himself, after that he received the
   government, erected temples in honour of himself in many places. For in
   going about the world, as he came to each place he united the chiefs of
   the people to himself in friendship and the right of hospitality; and
   that the remembrance of this might be preserved, he ordered that
   temples should be built to him, and annual festivals be celebrated by
   those connected with him in a league of hospitality. Thus he spread the
   worship of himself through all lands. But at what time they lived can
   easily be inferred. For Thallus writes in his history, that Belus, the
   king of the Assyrians, whom the Babylonians worship, and who was the
   contemporary and friend of Saturnus, was three hundred and twenty-two
   years before the Trojan war, and it is fourteen hundred and seventy
   years since the taking of Troy. From which it is evident, that it is
   not more than eighteen hundred years from the time when mankind fell
   into error by the institution of new forms of divine worship.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXV.--Of the Golden Age, of Images, and Prometheus, Who First
    Fashioned Man.

   The poets, therefore, with good reason say that the golden age, which
   existed in the reign of Saturnus, was changed. For at that time no gods
   were worshipped, but they knew of one God only. After that they
   subjected themselves to frail and earthly things, worshipping idols of
   wood, and brass, and stone, a change took place from the golden age to
   that of iron. For having lost the knowledge of God, and broken off that
   one bond of human society, they began to harass one another, to plunder
   and subdue. But if they would raise their eyes aloft and behold God,
   who raised them up to the sight of heaven and Himself, they never would
   bend and prostrate themselves by worshipping earthly things, whose
   folly Lucretius severely rebukes, saying: [1475]


   "And they abase their souls with fear of the gods, and weigh and press
   them down to the earth." [1476]

   Wherefore they tremble, and do not understand how foolish it is to fear
   those things which you have made, or to hope for any protection from
   those things which are dumb and insensible, and neither see nor hear
   the suppliant. What majesty, therefore, or deity can they have, which
   were in the power of a man, that they should not be made, or that they
   should be made into some other thing, and are so even now? For they are
   liable to injury and might be carried off by theft, were it not that
   they are protected by the law and the guardianship of man. Does he
   therefore appear to be in possession of his senses, who sacrifices to
   such deities the choicest victims, consecrates gifts, offers costly
   garments, as if they who are without motion could use them? With
   reason, then, did Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily plunder and deride the
   gods of Greece when he had taken possession of it as conqueror; and
   after the sacrilegious acts which he had committed, he returned to
   Sicily with a prosperous voyage, and held the kingdom even to his old
   age: nor were the injured gods able to punish him.

   How much better is it to despise vanities, and to turn to God, to
   maintain the condition which you have received from God, to maintain
   your name! For on this account he is called anthropos, [1477] because
   he looks upward. But he looks upward who looks up to the true and
   living God, who is in heaven; who seeks after the Maker and Parent of
   his soul, not only with his perception and mind, but also with his
   countenance and eyes raised aloft. But he who enslaves himself to
   earthly and humble things, plainly prefers to himself that which is
   below him. For since he himself is the workmanship of God, whereas an
   image is the workmanship of man, the human workmanship cannot be
   preferred to the divine; and as God is the parent of man, so is the man
   of the statue. Therefore he is foolish and senseless who adores that
   which he himself has made, of which detestable and foolish handicraft
   Prometheus was the author, who was born from Iapetus the uncle of
   Jupiter. For when first of all Jupiter, having obtained supreme
   dominion, wished to establish himself as a god, and to found temples,
   and was seeking for some one who was able to imitate the human figure,
   at that time Prometheus lived, who fashioned the image of a man from
   thick clay with such close resemblance, that the novelty and cleverness
   of the art was a wonder. At length the men of his own time, and
   afterwards the poets, handed him down as the maker of a true and living
   man; and we, as often as we praise wrought statues, say that they live
   and breathe. And he indeed was the inventor of earthenware images. But
   posterity, following him, both carved them out of marble, and moulded
   them out of bronze; then in process of time ornament was added of gold
   and ivory, so that not only the likenesses, but also the gleam itself,
   might dazzle the eyes. Thus ensnared by beauty, and forgetful of true
   majesty, sensible beings considered that insensible objects, rational
   beings that irrational objects, living beings that lifeless objects,
   were to be worshipped and reverenced by them.

    Chap. XXVI.--Of the Worship of the Elements and Stars.

   Now let us refute those also who regard the elements of the world as
   gods, that is, the heaven, the sun, and the moon; for being ignorant of
   the Maker of these things, they admire and adore the works themselves.
   And this error belongs not to the ignorant only, but also to
   philosophers; since the Stoics are of opinion that all the heavenly
   bodies are to be considered as among the number of the gods, since they
   all have fixed and regular motions, by which they most constantly
   preserve the vicissitudes of the times which succeed them. They do not
   then possess voluntary motion, since they obey prescribed laws, and
   plainly not by their own sense, but by the workmanship of the supreme
   Creator, who so ordered them that they should complete unerring [1478]
   courses and fixed circuits, by which they might vary the alternations
   of days and nights, of summer and winter. But if men admire the effects
   of these, if they admire their courses, their brightness, their
   regularity, their beauty, they ought to have understood how much more
   beautiful, more illustrious, and more powerful than these is the maker
   and contriver Himself, even God. But they estimated the Divinity by
   objects which fall under the sight of men; [1479] not knowing that
   objects which come within the sight cannot be eternal, and that those
   which are eternal cannot be discerned by mortal eyes.

    Chap. XXVII.--Of the Creation, Sin, and Punishment of Man; And of Angels,
    Both Good and Bad.

   One subject remains, and that the last: that, since it usually happens,
   as we read in histories, that the gods appear to have displayed their
   majesty by auguries, by dreams, by oracles, and also by the punishments
   of those who had committed sacrilege, I may show what cause produced
   this effect, so that no one even now may fall into the same snares into
   which those of old fell. When God, according to His excellent majesty,
   had framed the world out of nothing, and had decked the heaven with
   lights, and had filled the earth and the sea with living creatures,
   then He formed man out of clay, and fashioned him after the resemblance
   of His own likeness, and breathed into him that he might live, [1480]
   and placed him in a garden [1481] which He had planted with every kind
   of fruit-bearing tree, and commanded him not to eat of one tree in
   which He had placed the knowledge of good and evil, warning him that it
   would come to pass, that if he did so he would lose his life, but that
   if he observed the command of God he would remain immortal. Then the
   serpent, who was one of the servants of God, envying man because he was
   made immortal, enticed him by stratagem to transgress the command and
   law of God. And in this manner he did indeed receive the knowledge of
   good and evil, but he lost the life which God had given him to be for
   ever.

   Therefore He drove out the sinner from the sacred place, and banished
   him into this world, that he might seek sustenance by labour, that he
   might according to his deserts undergo difficulties and troubles; and
   He surrounded the garden itself with a fence of fire, that none of men
   even till the day of judgment might attempt secretly [1482] to enter
   into that place of perpetual blessedness. Then death came upon man
   according to the sentence of God; and yet his life, though it had begun
   to be temporary, had as its boundary a thousand years, and that was the
   extent of human life even to the deluge. For after the flood the life
   of men was gradually shortened, and was reduced to a hundred and twenty
   years. But that serpent, who from his deeds received the name of devil,
   that is, accuser or informer, did not cease to persecute the seed of
   man, whom he had deceived from the beginning. At length he urged him
   who was first born in this world, under the impulse of envy, to the
   murder of his brother, that of the two men who were first born he might
   destroy the one, and make the other a parricide. [1483] Nor did he
   cease upon this from infusing the venom of malice into the breasts of
   men through each generation, from corrupting and depraving them; in
   short, from overwhelming them with such crimes, that an instance of
   justice was now rare, but men lived after the manner of the beasts.

   But when God saw this, He sent His angels to instruct the race of men,
   and to protect them from all evil. He gave these a command to abstain
   from earthly things, lest, being polluted by any taint, they should be
   deprived of the honour of angels. But that wily accuser, while they
   tarried among men, allured these also to pleasures, so that they might
   defile themselves with women. Then, being condemned by the sentence of
   God, and cast forth on account of their sins, they lost both the name
   and substance of angels. Thus, having become ministers of the devil,
   that they might have a solace of their ruin, they betook themselves to
   the ruining of men, for whose protection they had come. [1484]

    Chap. XXVIII.--Of the Demons, and Their Evil Practices.

   These are the demons, of whom the poets often speak in their poems,
   whom Hesiod calls the guardians of men. For they so persuaded men by
   their enticements and deceits, that they believed that the same were
   gods. In fine, Socrates used to give out that he had a demon as the
   guardian and director of his life from his first childhood, and that he
   could do nothing without his assent and command. They attach
   themselves, therefore, to individuals, and occupy houses under the name
   of Genii or Penates. To these temples are built, to these libations are
   daily offered as to the Lares, to these honour is paid as to the
   averters of evils. These from the beginning, that they might turn away
   men from the knowledge of the true God, introduced new superstitions
   and worship of gods. These taught that the memory of dead kings should
   be consecrated, temples be built, and images made, not that they might
   lessen the honour of God, or increase their own, which they lost by
   sinning, but that they might take away life from men, deprive them of
   the hope of true light, lest men should arrive at that heavenly reward
   of immortality from which they fell. They also brought to light
   astrology, and augury, and divination; and though these things are in
   themselves false, yet they themselves, the authors of evils, so govern
   and regulate them that they are believed to be true. They also invented
   the tricks of the magic art, to deceive the eyes. By their aid it comes
   to pass, that that which is appears not to be, and that which is not
   appears to be. They themselves invented necromancies, responses, and
   oracles, to delude the minds of men with lying divination by means of
   ambiguous issues. They are present in the temples and at all
   sacrifices; and by the exhibition of some deceitful prodigies, to the
   surprise of those who are present, they so deceive men, that they
   believe that a divine power is present in images and statues. They even
   enter secretly into bodies, as being slight spirits; and they excite
   diseases in the vitiated limbs, which when appeased with sacrifices and
   vows they may again remove. They send dreams either full of terror,
   [1485] that they themselves may be invoked, or the issues of which may
   correspond with the truth, that they may increase the veneration paid
   to themselves. Sometimes also they put forth something of vengeance
   against the sacrilegious, that whoever sees it may become more timid
   and superstitious. Thus by their frauds they have drawn darkness over
   the human race, that truth might be oppressed, and the name of the
   supreme and matchless God might be forgotten.

    Chap. XXIX.--Of the Patience and Providence of God.

   But some one says: Why, then, does the true God permit these things to
   be done? Why does He not rather remove or destroy the wicked? Why, in
   truth, did He from the beginning give power [1486] to the demon, so
   that there should be one who might corrupt and destroy all things? I
   will briefly say why He willed that this should be so. I ask whether
   virtue is a good or an evil. It cannot be denied that it is a good. If
   virtue is a good, vice, on the contrary, is an evil. If vice is an evil
   on this account, because it opposes virtue, and virtue is on this
   account a good, because it overthrows vice, it follows that virtue
   cannot exist without vice; and if you take away vice, the merits of
   virtue will be taken away. For there can be no victory without an
   enemy. Thus it comes to pass, that good cannot exist without an evil.

   Chrysippus, a man of active mind, saw this when discussing the subject
   of providence, and charges those with folly who think that good is
   caused by God, but say that evil is not thus caused. Aulus Gellius
   [1487] has interpreted his sentiment in his books of Attic Nights; thus
   saying: "They to whom it does not appear that the world was made for
   the sake of God and men, and that human affairs are governed by
   providence, think that they use a weighty argument when they thus
   speak: If there were a providence, there would be no evils. For they
   say that nothing is less in agreement with providence, than that in
   this world, on account of which it is said that God made men, [1488]
   the power of troubles and evils should be so great. In reply to these
   things, Chrysippus, when he was arguing, in his fourth book respecting
   providence, said: Nothing can be more foolish than those who think that
   good things could have existed, if there were not evils in the same
   place. For since good things are contrary to evil, they must of
   necessity be opposed to each other, and must stand resting, as it were,
   on mutual and opposite support. [1489] Thus there is no contrary
   without another contrary. For how could there be any perception of
   justice, unless there were injuries? or what else is justice, but the
   removal of injustice? In like manner, the nature of fortitude cannot be
   understood, except by placing [1490] beside it cowardice, or the nature
   of self-control except by intemperance. Likewise, in what manner would
   there be prudence, unless there were the contrary, imprudence? On the
   same principle, he says, why do the foolish men not require this also,
   that there should be truth and not falsehood? For there exist together
   good and evil things, prosperity and trouble, pleasure and pain. For
   the one being bound to the other at opposite poles, as Plato says, if
   you take away one, you take away both." You see, therefore, that which
   I have often said, that good and evil are so connected with one
   another, that the one cannot exist without the other. Therefore God
   acted with the greatest foresight in placing the subject-matter of
   virtue in evils which He made for this purpose, that He might establish
   for us a contest, in which He would crown the victorious with the
   reward of immortality. [1491]

    Chap. XXX.--Of False Wisdom.

   I have taught, as I imagine, that the honours paid to gods are not only
   impious, but also vain, either because they were men whose memory was
   consecrated after death; or because the images themselves are
   insensible and deaf, inasmuch as they are formed of earth, and that it
   is not right for man, who ought to look up to heavenly things, to
   subject himself to earthly things; or because the spirits who claim to
   themselves those acts of religious service are unholy and impure, and
   on this account, being condemned by the sentence of God, fell to the
   earth, and that it is not lawful to submit to the power of those to
   whom you are superior, if you wish to be a follower of the true God. It
   remains that, as we have spoken of false religion, we should also
   discuss the subject of false wisdom, which the philosophers
   profess,--men endued with the greatest learning and eloquence, but far
   removed from the truth, because they neither know God nor the wisdom of
   God. And although they are clever and learned, yet, because their
   wisdom is human, I shall not fear to contend with them, that it may be
   evident that falsehood can be easily overcome by truth, and earthly
   things by heavenly.

   They thus define the nature of philosophy. Philosophy is the love or
   pursuit of wisdom. Therefore it is not wisdom itself; for that which
   loves must be different from that which is loved. If it is the pursuit
   of wisdom, not even thus is philosophy identical with wisdom. For
   wisdom is the object itself which is sought, but the pursuit is that
   which seeks it. Therefore the very definition or meaning of the word
   plainly shows that philosophy is not wisdom itself. I will say that it
   [1492] is not even the pursuit of wisdom, in which wisdom is not
   comprised. For who can be said to devote himself to the pursuit of that
   to which he can by no means attain? He who gives himself to the pursuit
   of medicine, or grammar, or oratory, may be said to be studious of that
   art which he is learning; but when he has learned, he is now said to be
   a physician, a grammarian, or an orator. Thus also those who are
   studious of wisdom, after they had learned it, ought to have been
   called wise. But since they are called students of wisdom as long as
   they live, it is manifest that that is not the pursuit, because it is
   impossible to arrive at the object itself which is sought for in the
   pursuit, unless by chance they who pursue wisdom even to the end of
   life are about to be wise in another world. Now every pursuit is
   connected with some end. That, therefore, is not a right pursuit which
   has no end.

    Chap. XXXI.--Of Knowledge and Supposition.

   Moreover, there are two things which appear to fall under the subject
   of philosophy--knowledge and supposition; and if these are taken away,
   philosophy altogether falls to the ground. But the chief of the
   philosophers themselves have taken away both from philosophy. Socrates
   took away knowledge, Zeno supposition. Let us see whether they were
   right in doing so. Wisdom is, as Cicero defined it, [1493] the
   knowledge of divine and human things. Now if this definition is true,
   wisdom does not come within the power of man. For who of mortals can
   assume this to himself, to profess that he knows divine and human
   things? I say nothing of human affairs; for although they are connected
   with divine, yet, since they belong to man, let us grant that it is
   possible for man to know them. Certainly he cannot know divine things
   by himself, since he is a man; whereas he who knows them must be
   divine, and therefore God. But man is neither divine nor God. Man,
   therefore, cannot thoroughly know divine things by himself. No one,
   therefore, is wise but God, or certainly that man whom God has taught.
   But they, because they are neither gods, nor taught by God, cannot be
   wise, that is, acquainted with divine and human things. Knowledge,
   therefore, is rightly taken away by Socrates and the Academics.
   Supposition also does not agree with the wise man. For every one
   supposes that of which he is ignorant. Now, to suppose that you know
   that of which you are ignorant, is rashness and folly. Supposition,
   therefore, was rightly taken away by Zeno. If, therefore, there is no
   knowledge in man, and there ought to be no supposition, philosophy is
   cut up by the roots.

    Chap. XXXII.--Of the Sects of Philosophers, and Their Disagreement.

   To this is added, that it [1494] is not uniform; but being divided into
   sects, and scattered into many and discordant opinions, it has no fixed
   state. For since they all separately attack and harass one another, and
   there is none of them which is not condemned of folly in the judgment
   of the rest, while the members are plainly at variance with one
   another, the whole body of philosophy is brought to destruction. Hence
   the Academy afterwards originated. For when the leading men of that
   sect saw that philosophy was altogether overthrown by philosophers
   mutually opposing each other, they undertook war against all, that they
   might destroy all the arguments of all; while they themselves assert
   nothing except one thing--that nothing can be known. Thus, having taken
   away knowledge, they overthrew the ancient philosophy. But they did not
   even themselves retain the name of philosophers, since they admitted
   their ignorance, because to be ignorant of all things is not only not
   the part of a philosopher, but not even of a man. Thus the
   philosophers, because they have no defence, must destroy one another
   with mutual wounds, and philosophy itself must altogether consume and
   put an end to itself by its own arms. But they say it is only natural
   philosophy which thus gives way. How is it with moral? Does that rest
   on any firm foundation? Let us see whether philosophers are agreed in
   this part at any rate, which relates to the condition of life.

    Chap. XXXIII.--What is the Chief Good to Be Sought in Life.

   What is the chief good must be an object of inquiry, that our whole
   life and actions may be directed to it. When inquiry is made respecting
   the chief good of man, it ought to be settled to be of such a kind,
   first, that it have reference to man alone; in the next place, that it
   belong peculiarly to the mind; lastly, that it be sought by virtue. Let
   us see, therefore, whether the chief good which the philosophers mark
   out be such that it has reference neither to a dumb animal nor to the
   body, and cannot be attained without virtue.

   Aristippus, the founder of the Cyrenaic sect, who thought that bodily
   pleasure was the chief good, ought to be removed from the number of
   philosophers, and from the society of men, because he compared himself
   to a beast. The chief good of Hieronymus is to be without pain, that of
   Diodorus to cease to be in pain. But the other animals avoid pain; and
   when they are without pain, or cease to be in pain, are glad. What
   distinction, then, will be given to man, if his chief good is judged to
   be common with the beasts? Zeno thought that the chief good was to live
   agreeably to nature. But this definition is a general one. For all
   animals live agreeably to nature, and each has its own nature.

   Epicurus maintained that it was pleasure of the soul. What is pleasure
   of the soul but joy, in which the soul for the most part luxuriates,
   and unbends itself either to sport or to laughter? But this good
   befalls even dumb animals, which, when they are satisfied with pasture,
   relax themselves to joy and wantonness. Dinomachus and Callipho
   approved of honourable pleasure; but they either said the same that
   Epicurus did, that bodily pleasure is dishonourable; or if they
   considered bodily pleasures to be partly base and partly honourable,
   then that is not the chief good which is ascribed to the body. The
   Peripatetics make up the chief good of goods of the soul, and body, and
   fortune. The goods of the soul may be approved of; but if they require
   assistance for the completion of happiness, they are plainly weak. But
   the goods of the body and of fortune are not in the power of man; nor
   is that now the chief good which is assigned to the body, or to things
   placed without us, because this double good extends even to the cattle,
   which have need of being well, and of a due supply of food. The Stoics
   are believed to have entertained much better views, who said that
   virtue was the chief good. But virtue cannot be the chief good, since,
   if it is the endurance of evils and of labours, it is not happy of
   itself; but it ought to effect and produce the chief good, because it
   cannot be attained without the greatest difficulty and labour. But, in
   truth, Aristotle wandered far from reason, who connected honour with
   virtue, as though it were possible for virtue at any time to be
   separated from honour, or to be united with baseness.

   Herillus the Pyrrhonist made knowledge the chief good. This indeed
   belongs to man, and to the soul only, but it may happen to him without
   virtue. For he is not to be considered happy who has either learnt
   anything by hearing, or has gained the knowledge of it by a little
   reading; nor is it a definition of the chief good, because there may be
   a knowledge either of bad things, or at any rate of things that are
   useless. And if it is the knowledge of good and useful things which you
   have acquired by labour, nevertheless it is not the chief good, because
   knowledge is not sought on its own account, but on account of something
   else. For the arts are learnt on this account, that they may be to us
   the means of gaining support, or a source of glory, or even of
   pleasure; and it is plain that these things cannot be the chief goods.
   Therefore the philosophers do not observe the rule even in moral
   philosophy, inasmuch as they are at variance with one another on the
   main point [1495] itself, that is, in that discussion by which the life
   is moulded. For the precepts cannot be equal, or resembling one
   another, when some train men to pleasure, others to honour, others
   indeed to nature, others to knowledge; some to the pursuit, others to
   the avoiding of riches; some to entire insensibility to pain, others to
   the endurance of evils: in all which, as I have shown before, they turn
   aside from reason, because they are ignorant of God.

    Chap. XXXIV.--That Men are Born to Justice.

   Let us now see what is proposed to the wise man as the chief good.
   [1496] That men are born to justice is not only taught by the sacred
   writings, but is sometimes acknowledged even by these same
   philosophers. Thus Cicero says: "But of all things which fall under the
   discussion of learned men, nothing assuredly is more excellent than
   that it should be clearly understood that we are born to justice." This
   is most true. [1497] For we are not born to wickedness, since we are a
   social and sociable animal. The wild beasts are produced to exercise
   their fierceness; for they are unable to live in any other way than by
   prey and bloodshed. These, however, although pressed by extreme hunger,
   nevertheless refrain from animals of their own kind. Birds also do the
   same, which must feed upon the carcases of others. How much more is it
   befitting, that man, who is united with man both in the interchange of
   language and in communion of feeling, should spare man, and love him!
   For this is justice.

   But since wisdom has been given to man alone, that he may understand
   God, and this alone makes the difference between man and the dumb
   animals, justice itself is bound up in two duties. He owes the one to
   God as to a father, the other to man as to a brother; for we are
   produced by the same God. Therefore it has been deservedly and rightly
   said, that wisdom is the knowledge of divine and human affairs. For it
   is right that we should know what we owe to God, and what to man;
   namely, to God religion, to man affection. But the former belongs to
   wisdom, the latter to virtue; and justice comprises both. If,
   therefore, it is evident that man is born to justice, it is necessary
   that the just man should be subject to evils, that he may exercise the
   virtue with which he is endued. For virtue is the enduring of evils. He
   will avoid pleasures as an evil: he will despise riches, because they
   are frail; and if he has them, he will liberally bestow them, to
   preserve the wretched: he will not be desirous of honours, because they
   are short and transitory; he will do injury to no one; if he shall
   suffer, he will not retaliate; and he will not take vengeance upon one
   who plunders his property. For he will deem it unlawful to injure a
   man; and if there shall be any one who would compel him to depart from
   God, he will not refuse tortures nor death. Thus it will come to pass,
   that he must necessarily live in poverty and lowliness, and in insults,
   or even tortures.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXXV.--That Immortality is the Chief Good.

   What, then, will be the advantage of justice and virtue, if they shall
   have nothing but evil in life? But if virtue, which despises all
   earthly goods, most wisely endures all evils, and endures death itself
   in the discharge of duty, cannot be without a reward, what remains but
   that immortality alone is its reward? For if a happy life falls to the
   lot of man, as the philosophers will have it, and in this point alone
   they do not disagree, therefore also immortality falls to him. For that
   only is happy which is incorruptible; that only is incorruptible which
   is eternal. Therefore immortality is the chief good, because it belongs
   both to man, and to the soul, and to virtue. We are only directed to
   this; we are born to the attainment of this. Therefore God proposes to
   us virtue and justice, that we may obtain that eternal reward for our
   labours. But concerning that immortality [1498] itself we will speak in
   the proper place. There remains the philosophy of Logic, [1499] which
   contributes nothing to a happy life. For wisdom does not consist in the
   arrangement of speech, but in the heart and the feeling. But if natural
   philosophy is superfluous, and this of logic, and the philosophers have
   erred in moral philosophy, which alone is necessary, because they have
   been unable in any way to find out the chief good; therefore all
   philosophy is found to be empty and useless, which was unable to
   comprehend the nature of man, or to fulfil its duty and office.

    Chap. XXXVI.--Of the Philosophers,--Namely, Epicurus and Pythagoras.

   Since I have spoken briefly of philosophy, now also I will speak a few
   things about the philosophers. This is especially the doctrine of
   Epicurus, that there is no providence. And at the same time he does not
   deny the existence of gods. In both respects he acts contrary to
   reason. For if there are gods, it follows that there is a providence.
   For otherwise we can form no intelligible idea of God, for it is His
   peculiar province to foresee. [1500] But Epicurus says He takes no care
   about anything. Therefore He disregards not only the affairs of men,
   but also heavenly things. How, therefore, or from what, do you affirm
   that He exists? For when you have taken away the divine providence and
   care, it would naturally follow that you should altogether deny the
   existence of God; whereas now you have left Him in name, but in reality
   you have taken Him away. Whence, then, did the world derive its origin,
   if God takes no care of anything? There are, he says, minute atoms,
   which can neither be seen nor touched, and from the fortuitous meeting
   of these all things arose, and are continually arising. If they are
   neither seen nor perceived by any part of the body, how could you know
   of their existence? In the next place, if they exist, with what mind do
   they meet together to effect anything? If they are smooth, they cannot
   cohere: if they are hooked and angular, then they are divisible; for
   hooks and angles project, and can be cut off. But these things are
   senseless and unprofitable. Why should I mention that he also makes
   souls capable of extinction? who is refuted not only by all
   philosophers and general persuasion, but also by the answers of bards,
   by the predictions of the Sibyls, and lastly, by the divine voices of
   the prophets themselves; so that it is wonderful that Epicurus alone
   existed, who should place the condition of man on a level with the
   flocks and beasts.

   What of Pythagoras, who was first called a philosopher, who judged that
   souls were indeed immortal, but that they passed into other bodies,
   either of cattle, or of birds, or of beasts? Would it not have been
   better that they should be destroyed, together with their bodies, than
   thus to be condemned to pass into the bodies of other animals? Would it
   not be better not to exist at all, than, after having had the form of a
   man, to live as a swine or a dog? And the foolish man, to gain credit
   for his saying, said that he himself had been Euphorbus in the Trojan
   war, and that, when he had been slain, he passed into other figures of
   animals, and at last became Pythagoras. O happy man! to whom alone so
   great a memory was given; or rather unhappy, who, when changed into a
   sheep, was not permitted to be ignorant of what he was! And would to
   Heaven that he alone had been thus senseless! He found also some to
   believe him, and some indeed among the learned, [1501] to whom the
   inheritance of folly passed.

    Chap. XXXVII.--Of Socrates and His Contradiction.

   After him Socrates held the first place in philosophy, who was
   pronounced most wise even by the oracle, because he confessed that he
   knew one thing only,--namely, that he knew nothing. And on the
   authority of this oracle it was right that the natural philosophers
   should restrain themselves, lest they should either inquire into those
   things which they could not know, or should think that they knew things
   which they did not know. Let us, however, see whether Socrates was most
   wise, as the Pythian god proclaimed. He often made use of this proverb,
   that that which is above us has also no reference to us. He has now
   passed beyond the limits of his opinion. For he who said that he knew
   one thing only, found another thing to speak of, as though he knew it;
   but that in vain. For God, who is plainly above us, is to be sought
   for; and religion is to be undertaken, which alone separates us from
   the brutes, which indeed Socrates not only rejected, but even derided,
   in swearing by a goose and a dog, as if in truth he could not have
   sworn by Æsculapius, to whom he had vowed a cock. Behold the sacrifice
   of a wise man! And because he was unable to offer this in his own
   person, since he was at the point of death, he entreated his friends to
   perform the vow after his death, lest forsooth he should be detained as
   a debtor in the lower regions. He assuredly both pronounced that he
   knew nothing, and made good his statement. [1502]

    Chap. XXXVIII.--Of Plato, Whose Doctrine Approaches More Nearly to the
    Truth.

   His disciple Plato, whom Tully speaks of as the god of philosophers,
   alone of all so studied philosophy that he approached nearer to the
   truth; and yet, because he was ignorant of God, he so failed in many
   things, that no one fell into worse errors, especially because in his
   books respecting the state he wished all things to be common to all.
   This is endurable concerning property, though it is unjust. For it
   ought not to be an injury to any one, if he possesses more than another
   through his own industry; or to be a profit to any one, if through his
   own fault he possesses less. But, as I have said, this is capable of
   being endured in some way. Shall there be a community of wives also,
   and of children? Shall there be no distinction of blood, or certainty
   of race? Shall there be neither families, nor relationships, nor
   affinities, but all things confused and indiscriminate, as in herds of
   cattle? Shall there be no self-restraint in men, no chastity in women?
   What conjugal affection can there be in these, between whom on either
   side there is no sure or peculiar [1503] love? Who will he dutiful
   towards a father, when he knows not from whom he was born? Who will
   love a son, whom he will reckon as not his own? [1504] Moreover, he
   opened [1505] the senate house to women, and entrusted to them warfare,
   magistracies, and commands. [1506] But how great will be the calamity
   of that city, in which women shall discharge the duties of men! But of
   this more fully at another opportunity.

   Zeno, the master of the Stoics, who praises virtue, judged that pity,
   which is a very great virtue, should be cut away, as though it were a
   disease of the mind, whereas it is at the same time dear to God and
   necessary for men. For who is there who, when placed in any evil, would
   be unwilling to be pitied, and would not desire the assistance of those
   who might succour them, which is not called forth so as to render aid,
   except by the feeling of pity? Although he calls this humanity and
   piety, he does not change the matter itself, only the name. This is the
   affection which has been given to man alone, that by mutual assistance
   we might alleviate our weakness; and he who removes this affection
   reduces us to the life of the beasts. For his assertion that all faults
   are equal, proceeds from that inhumanity with which also be assails
   pity as a disease. For he who makes no difference in faults, either
   thinks that light offences ought to be visited with severe punishments,
   which is the part of a cruel judge, or that great offences should be
   visited with slight punishments, which is the part of a worthless
   judge. In either case there is injury to the state. For if the greatest
   crimes are lightly punished, the boldness of the wicked will increase,
   and go on to deeds of greater daring; and if a punishment of too great
   severity is inflicted for slight offences, inasmuch as no one can be
   exempt from fault, many citizens will incur peril, who by correction
   might become better.

    Chap. XXXIX.--Of Various Philosophers, and of the Antipodes.

   These things, truly, are of small importance, but they arise from the
   same falsehood. Xenophanes said that the orb of the moon is eighteen
   times larger than this earth of ours; and that within its compass is
   contained another earth, which is inhabited by men and animals of every
   kind. About the antipodes also one can neither hear nor speak without
   laughter. It is asserted as something serious, that we should believe
   that there are men who have their feet opposite to ours. The ravings of
   Anaxagoras are more tolerable, who said that snow was black. And not
   only the sayings, but the deeds, of some are ridiculous. Democritus
   neglected his land which was left to him by his father, and suffered it
   to become a public pasture. Diogenes with his company of dogs, [1507]
   who professes that great and perfect virtue in the contempt of all
   things, preferred to beg for his support, rather than to seek it by
   honest labour, or to have any property. Undoubtedly the life of a wise
   man ought to be to others an example of living. If all should imitate
   the wisdom of these, how will states exist? But perhaps the same Cynics
   were able to afford an example of modesty, who lived with their wives
   in public. I know not how they could defend virtue, who took away
   modesty.

   Nor was Aristippus better than these, who, I believe, that he might
   please his mistress Lais, instituted the Cyrenaic system, by which he
   placed the end of the chief good in bodily pleasure, that authority
   might not be wanting to his faults, or learning to his vices. Are those
   men of greater fortitude to be more approved, who, that they might be
   said to have despised death, died by their own hands? Zeno, Empedocles,
   Chrysippus, Cleanthes, Democritus, and Cato, imitating these, did not
   know that he who put himself to death is guilty of murder, according to
   the divine right and law. For it was God who placed us in this abode of
   flesh: it was He who gave us the temporary habitation of the body, that
   we should inhabit it as long as He pleased. Therefore it is to be
   considered impious, to wish to depart from it without the command of
   God. Therefore violence must not be applied to nature. He knows how to
   destroy [1508] His own work. And if any one shall apply impious hands
   to that work, and shall tear asunder the bonds of the divine
   workmanship, he endeavours to flee from God, whose sentence no one will
   be able to escape, whether alive or dead. Therefore they are accursed
   and impious, whom I have mentioned above, who even taught what are the
   befitting reasons for voluntary death; so that it was not enough of
   guilt that they were self-murderers, unless they instructed others also
   to this wickedness. [1509]

    Chap. XL.--Of the Foolishness of the Philosophers.

   There are innumerable sayings and doings of the philosophers, by which
   their foolishness may be shown. Therefore, since we are unable to
   enumerate them all, a few will be sufficient. It is enough that it is
   understood that the philosophers were neither teachers of justice, of
   which they were ignorant, nor of virtue, of which they falsely boast.
   For what can they teach, who often confess their own ignorance? I omit
   to mention Socrates, whose opinion is well known. Anaxagoras proclaims
   that all things are over-spread with darkness. Empedocles says that the
   paths for finding out the truth of the senses are narrow. Democritus
   asserts that truth lies sunk in a deep well; and because they nowhere
   find it, they therefore affirm that no wise man has as yet existed.
   Since, therefore, human wisdom has no existence (Socrates says in the
   writings of Plato), let us follow that which is divine, and let us give
   thanks to God, who has revealed and delivered it to us; and let us
   congratulate ourselves, that through the divine bounty we possess the
   truth and wisdom, which, though sought by so many intellects through so
   many ages, philosophy [1510] was not able to discover.

    Chap. XLI.--Of True Religion and Wisdom.

   Now, since we have refuted false religion, which is in the worship of
   the gods, and false wisdom, which is in the philosophers, let us come
   to true religion and wisdom. And, indeed, we must speak of them both
   conjointly, because they are closely connected. For to worship the true
   God, that and nothing else is wisdom. For that God who is supreme and
   the Maker of all things, who made man as the image of Himself, on this
   account conferred on him alone of all animals the gift of reason, that
   he might pay back honour to Him as his Father and his Lord, and by the
   exercise of this piety and obedience might gain the reward of
   immortality. This is a true and divine mystery. But among those, [1511]
   because they are not true, there is no agreement. Neither are sacred
   rites performed in philosophy, nor is philosophy treated of in sacred
   things; and on this account their religion is false, because it does
   not possess wisdom; and on this account their wisdom is false, because
   it does not possess religion. But where both are joined together, there
   the truth must necessarily be; so that if it is asked what the truth
   itself is, it may be rightly said to be either wise religion or
   religious wisdom.

    Chap. XLII.--Of Religious Wisdom: the Name of Christ Known to None, Except
    Himself and His Father.

   I will now say what wise religion, or religious wisdom, is. God, in the
   beginning, before He made the world, from the fountain of His own
   eternity, and from the divine and everlasting Spirit, [1512] begat for
   Himself a Son incorruptible, faithful, corresponding to His Father's
   excellence and majesty. He is virtue, He is reason, He is the word of
   God, He is wisdom. With this artificer, as Hermes says, and counsellor,
   as the Sibyl says, He contrived the excellent and wondrous fabric of
   this world. In fine, of all the angels, whom the same God formed from
   His own breath, [1513] He alone was admitted into a participation of
   His supreme power, He alone was called God. For all things were through
   Him, and nothing was without Him. In fine, Plato, not altogether as a
   philosopher, but as a seer, spoke concerning the first and second God,
   perhaps following Trismegistus in this, whose words I have translated
   from the Greek, and subjoined: "The Lord and Maker of all things, whom
   we have thought to be called God, created [1514] a second God, who is
   visible and sensible. But by sensible I mean, not that He Himself
   receives sensation, but that He causes sensation and sight. When,
   therefore, He had made this, the first, and one, and only one, He
   appeared to Him most excellent, and full of all good qualities." The
   Sibyl also says that God the guide of all was made by God, and another,
   that


   "God the Son of God must be known,"

   as those examples which I have brought forward in my books declare. Him
   the prophets, filled with the inspiration of the Divine Spirit,
   proclaimed; of whom especially Solomon in the book of Wisdom, and also
   his father, the writer of divine hymns--both most renowned kings, who
   preceded the times of the Trojan war by a hundred and eighty years
   [1515] --testify that He was born of God. His name is known to none,
   except to Himself and the Father, as John teaches in the Revelation.
   [1516] Hermes says that His name cannot be uttered by mortal mouth. Yet
   by men He is called by two names--Jesus, which is Saviour, and Christ,
   which is King. He is called Saviour on this account, because He is the
   health and safety of all who believe in God through Him. He is called
   Christ on this account, because He Himself will come from heaven at the
   end of this dispensation [1517] to judge the world, and, having raised
   the dead, to establish for Himself an everlasting kingdom.

    Chap. XLIII.--Of the Name of Jesus Christ, and His Twofold Nativity.

   But lest by any chance there should be any doubt in your mind why we
   call Him Jesus Christ, who was born of God before the world, and who
   was born of man three hundred years ago, I will briefly explain to you
   the reason. The same person is the son of God and of man. For He was
   twice born: first of God, in the spirit, before the origin of the
   world; afterwards in the flesh of man, in the reign of Augustus; and in
   connection with this fact is an illustrious and great mystery, in which
   is contained both the salvation of men and the religion of the Supreme
   God, and all truth. For when first the accursed and impious worship of
   gods crept in through the treachery of the demons, then the religion of
   God remained with the Hebrews alone, who, not by any law, but after the
   manner of their fathers, observed the worship handed down to them by
   successive generations, [1518] even until the time when they went forth
   out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses, the first of all the
   prophets, through whom the law was given to them from God; and they
   were afterwards called Jews. Therefore they served God, being bound by
   the chains of the law. But they also, by degrees going astray to
   profane rites, undertook the worship of strange gods, and, leaving the
   worship of their father, sacrificed to senseless images. Therefore God
   sent to them prophets filled with the Divine Spirit, to upbraid them
   with their sins and proclaim repentance, to threaten them with the
   vengeance which would follow, and announce that it would come to pass,
   if they persisted in the same faults, that He would send another as the
   bearer of a new law; and having removed the ungrateful people from
   their inheritance, He would assemble to Himself a more faithful people
   from foreign nations. But they not only persisted in their course, but
   even slew the messengers themselves. Therefore He condemned them on
   account of these deeds: nor did He any longer send messengers to a
   stubborn people; but He sent His own Son, to call all nations to the
   favour of God. Nor, however, did He shut them out, impious and
   ungrateful as they were, from the hope of salvation: but He sent Him to
   them before all others, [1519] that if they should by chance obey, they
   might not lose that which they had received; but if they should refuse
   to receive their God, then, the heirs being removed, [1520] the
   Gentiles would come into possession. Therefore the supreme Father
   ordered Him to descend to the earth, and to put on a human body, that,
   being subject to the sufferings of the flesh, He might teach virtue and
   patience not only by words, but also by deeds. Therefore He was born a
   second time as man, of a virgin, without a father, that, as in His
   first spiritual birth, being born of God alone, He was made a sacred
   spirit, so in His second and fleshly birth, being born of a mother
   only, He might become holy flesh, that through Him the flesh, which had
   become subject to sin, might be freed from destruction.

    Chap. XLIV.--The Twofold Nativity of Christ is Proved from the Prophets.

   That these things should thus take place as I have set them forth, the
   prophets had before predicted. In the writings of Solomon it is thus
   written: [1521] "The womb of a virgin was strengthened, and conceived:
   and a virgin was impregned, and became a mother in great pity." In
   Isaiah [1522] it is thus written: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and
   bear a son, and ye shall call His name Immanuel;" which, being
   interpreted, is God with us. [1523] For He was with us on the earth,
   when He assumed flesh; and He was no less God in man, and man in God.
   That He was both God and man was declared before by the prophets. That
   He was God, Isaiah [1524] thus declares: "They shall fall down unto
   Thee, they shall make supplication unto Thee; since God is in Thee, and
   we knew it not, even the God of Israel. They shall be ashamed and
   confounded, all of them who oppose themselves to Thee, and shall go to
   confusion." Also Jeremiah: [1525] "This is our God, and there shall
   none other be compared unto Him; He hath found out all the way of
   knowledge, and hath given it unto Jacob His servant, and to Israel His
   beloved. Afterward He was seen upon earth, and dwelt among men."
   Likewise that He was man, the same Jeremiah [1526] says: "And He is
   man, and who knew Him?" Isaiah also thus speaks: [1527] "And the Lord
   shall send them a man who shall save them, and with judgment shall He
   heal them." Also Moses himself in the book of Numbers: [1528] "There
   shall come a star out of Jacob, and a man shall arise out of Israel."
   For this cause, therefore, being God, He took upon Him flesh, that,
   becoming a mediator [1529] between God and man, having overcome death,
   He might by His guidance lead man to God.

    Chap. XLV.--The Power and Works of Christ are Proved from the Scriptures.

   We have spoken of His nativity; now let us speak of His power and
   works, which, when He wrought them among men, the Jews, seeing them to
   be great and wonderful, supposed that they were done by the influence
   of magic, not knowing that all those things which were done by Him had
   been foretold by the prophets. He gave strength to the sick, and to
   those languishing under various diseases, not by any healing remedy,
   but instantaneously, by the force and power of His word; He restored
   the weak, He made the lame to walk, He gave sight to the blind, He made
   the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear; He cleansed the polluted and
   unclean, He restored their right mind to those who were maddened with
   the attack of demons, He recalled to life and light those who were dead
   or now buried. He also fed and satisfied [1530] five thousand men with
   five loaves and two fishes. He also walked upon the sea. He also in a
   tempest commanded the wind to be still, and immediately there was a
   calm; all which things we find predicted both in the books of the
   prophets and in the verses of the Sibyls.

   When a great multitude resorted to Him on account of these miracles,
   and, as He truly was, believed Him to be the Son of God, and sent from
   God, the priests and rulers of the Jews, filled with envy, and at the
   same time excited with anger, because He reproved their sins and
   injustice, conspired to put Him to death; and that this would happen,
   Solomon had foretold a little more than a thousand years before, in the
   book of Wisdom, using these words: [1531] "Let us defraud the
   righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and upbraideth us with our
   offences against the law. He maketh his boast that he has the knowledge
   of God, and he calleth himself the Son of God. He is made to reprove
   our thoughts: it grieveth us even to look upon him; for his life is not
   like the life of others, his ways are of another fashion. We are
   counted by him as triflers; he withdraweth himself from our ways, as
   from filthiness; he commendeth greatly the latter end of the just, and
   boasteth that he has God for his father. Let us see, therefore, if his
   words be true; let us prove what end he shall have; let us examine him
   with rebukes and torments, that we may know his meekness and prove his
   patience; let us condemn him to a shameful death. Such things have they
   imagined, and have gone astray; for their own folly hath blinded them,
   and they do not understand the mysteries of God."

   Therefore, being unmindful of these writings which they read, they
   incited the people as though against an impious man, so that they
   seized and led Him to trial, and with impious words demanded His death.
   But they alleged against Him as a crime this very thing, that He said
   that He was the Son of God, and that by healing on the Sabbath He broke
   the law, which He said that He did not break, but fulfilled. And when
   Pontius Pilate, who then as legate had authority in Syria, perceived
   that the cause did not belong to the office of the Roman judge, he sent
   Him to Herod the Tetrarch, and permitted the Jews themselves to be the
   judges of their own law: who, having received the power of punishing
   His guilt, sentenced [1532] Him to the cross, but first scourged and
   struck him with their hands, put on Him a crown of thorns, spat upon
   His face, gave Him gall and vinegar to eat and drink; and amidst these
   things no word was heard to fall from His lips. Then the executioners,
   having cast lots over His tunic and mantle, suspended Him on the cross,
   and affixed Him to it, though on the next day they were about to
   celebrate the Passover, that is, their festival. Which crime was
   followed by prodigies, that they might understand the impiety which
   they had committed; for at the same moment in which He expired, there
   was a great earthquake, and a withdrawing [1533] of the sun, so that
   the day was turned into night.

    Chap. XLVI.--It is Proved from the Prophets that the Passion and Death of
    Christ Had Been Foretold.

   And the prophets had predicted that all these things would thus come to
   pass. Isaiah thus speaks: [1534] "I am not rebellious, nor do I oppose:
   I gave my back to the scourge, and my cheeks to the hand: I turned not
   away my face from the foulness of spitting." The same prophet says
   respecting His silence: [1535] "I was brought as a sheep to the
   slaughter, and as a lamb before its shearers is dumb, so He opened not
   His mouth." David also, in the xxxivth Psalm: [1536] "The abjects were
   gathered together against me, and they knew me not: they were
   scattered, yet felt no remorse: they tempted me, and gnashed upon me
   with their teeth." The same also says respecting food and drink in the
   lxviiith Psalm: [1537] "They gave me also gall for my meat, and in my
   thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." Also respecting the cross of
   Christ: [1538] "And they pierced my hands and my feet, they numbered
   all my bones: they themselves have looked and stared upon me; they
   parted my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture." Moses
   also says in Deuteronomy: [1539] " And thy life shall hang in doubt
   before thine eyes, and thou shall fear day and night, and shall have
   none assurance of thy life." Also in Numbers: [1540] "God is not in
   doubt as a man, nor does He suffer threats as the son of man." Also
   Zechariah says: [1541] "And they shall look on me whom they pierced."
   Amos [1542] thus speaks of the obscuring of the sun: "In that day,
   saith the Lord, the sun shall go down at noon, and the clear day shall
   be dark; and I will turn your feasts into mourning, and your songs into
   lamentation." Jeremiah [1543] also speaks of the city of Jerusalem, in
   which He suffered: "Her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she hath
   been confounded and reviled, and the residue of them will I deliver to
   the sword." Nor were these things spoken in vain. For after a short
   time the Emperor Vespasian subdued the Jews, and laid waste their lands
   with the sword and fire, besieged and reduced them by famine, overthrew
   Jerusalem, led the captives in triumph, and prohibited the others who
   were left from ever returning to their native land. And these things
   were done by God on account of that crucifixion of Christ, as He before
   declared this to Solomon in their Scriptures, saying, [1544] "And
   Israel shall be for perdition and a reproach [1545] to the people, and
   this house shall be desolate; and every one that shall pass by shall be
   astonished, and shall say, Why hath God done these evils to this land,
   and to this house? And they shall say, Because they forsook the Lord
   their God, and persecuted their King, who was dearly beloved by God,
   and crucified Him with great degradation, therefore hath God brought
   upon them these evils." For what would they not deserve who put to
   death their Lord, who had come for their salvation?

    Chap. XLVII.--Of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Sending of the
    Apostles, and the Ascension of the Saviour into Heaven.

   After these things they took His body down from the cross, and buried
   it in a tomb. But on the third day, before daybreak, there was an
   earthquake, and the stone with which they had closed the sepulchre was
   removed, and He arose. But nothing was found in the sepulchre except
   the clothes in which the body had been wrapped. [1546] But that He
   would rise again on the third day, the prophets had long ago foretold.
   David, in the xvth Psalm: [1547] "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell,
   neither wilt Thou suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption." Likewise
   Hosea: [1548] This my Son is wise, therefore He shall not stay long in
   the anguish of His sons: and I will ransom Him from the hand of the
   grave. Where is thy judgment, O death, where is thy sting? "The same
   again says: [1549] "After two days He will revive us on the third day."

   Therefore, after His resurrection He went into Galilee, and again
   assembled His disciples, who had fled through fear; and having given
   them commands which He wished to be observed, and having arranged for
   the preaching of the Gospel throughout the whole world, He breathed
   into them the Holy Spirit, [1550] and gave them the power of working
   miracles, that they might act for the welfare of men as well by deeds
   as words; and then at length, on the fortieth day, He returned to His
   Father, being carried up into a cloud. The prophet Daniel [1551] had
   long before shown this, saying, "I saw in the night vision, and,
   behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and
   came to the Ancient of days; and they who stood beside Him brought Him
   near before Him. And there was given Him a kingdom, and glory, and
   dominion, and all people, tribes, and languages shall serve Him; and
   His power is an everlasting one, which shall not pass away, and His
   kingdom that which shall not be destroyed." Also David in the cixth
   Psalm: [1552] "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand,
   until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."

    Chap. XLVIII.--Of the Disinheriting of the Jews, and the Adoption of the
    Gentiles.

   Since, therefore, He sits at the right hand of God, about to tread down
   His enemies, who tortured Him, when He shall come to judge the world,
   it is evident that no hope remains to the Jews, unless, turning
   themselves to repentance, and being cleansed from the blood with which
   they polluted themselves, they shall begin to hope in Him whom they
   denied. [1553] Therefore Esdras thus speaks: [1554] "This passover is
   our Saviour and our refuge. Consider and let it come into your heart,
   that we have to abase Him in a figure: and after these things we have
   hoped [1555] in Him."

   Now that the Jews were disinherited, because they rejected Christ, and
   that we, who are of the Gentiles, were adopted into their place, is
   proved by the Scriptures. Jeremiah [1556] thus speaks: "I have forsaken
   mine house, I have given mine heritage into the hands of her enemies.
   Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it hath given
   forth its voice against me: therefore have I hated it." Also Malachi:
   [1557] "I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I
   accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun even
   unto the going down thereof, my name shall be great among the
   Gentiles." Isaiah also thus speaks: [1558] "I come to gather all
   nations and tongues: and they shall come and see my glory." The same
   says in another place, [1559] speaking in the person of the Father to
   the Son: "I the Lord have called Thee in righteousness, and will hold
   Thine hand, and will keep Thee, and give Thee for a covenant of my
   people, for a light of the Gentiles; to open the eyes of the blind, to
   bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness
   out of the prison-house."

    Chap. XLIX.--That God is One Only.

   If therefore the Jews have been rejected by God, as the faith due to
   the sacred writings shows, and the Gentiles, as we see, brought in, and
   freed from the darkness of this present life and from the chains of
   demons, it follows that no other hope is proposed to man, unless he
   shall follow true religion and true wisdom, which is in Christ, and he
   who is ignorant of Him is always estranged from the truth and from God.
   Nor let the Jews, or philosophers, flatter themselves respecting the
   Supreme God. He who has not acknowledged the Son has been unable to
   acknowledge the Father. [1560] This is wisdom, and this is the mystery
   of the Supreme God. God willed that He should be acknowledged and
   worshipped through Him. [1561] On this account He sent the prophets
   beforehand to announce His coming, that when the things which had been
   foretold were fulfilled in Him, then He might be believed by men to be
   both the Son of God and God.

   Nor, however, must the opinion be entertained that there are two Gods,
   for the Father and the Son are one. For since the Father loves the Son,
   and gives all things to Him, and the Son faithfully obeys the Father,
   and wills nothing except that which the Father does, it is plain that
   so close a relationship cannot be separated, so that they should be
   said to be two in whom there is but one substance, and will, and faith.
   Therefore the Son is through the Father, and the Father through the
   Son. One honour is to be given to both, as to one God, and is to be so
   divided through the worship of the two, that the division itself may be
   bound by an inseparable bond of union. He will leave nothing to
   himself, who separates either the Father from the Son, or the Son from
   the Father. [1562]

    Chap. L.--Why God Assumed a Mortal Body, and Suffered Death.

   It remains to answer those also, who deem that it was unbecoming and
   unreasonable that God should be clothed with a mortal body; that He
   should be in subjection to men; that He should endure insults; that He
   should even suffer tortures and death. I will speak my sentiments, and
   I will sum up, as I shall be able, an immense subject in few words. He
   who teaches anything, ought, as I think, himself to practice what he
   teaches, that he may compel men to obey. For if he shall not practice
   them, he will detract from the faith due to his precepts. Therefore
   there is need of examples, that the precepts which are given may have
   firmness, and if any one shall prove contumacious, and shall say that
   they cannot be carried out in practice, the instructor may refute him
   by actual fact. [1563] Therefore a system of teaching cannot be
   perfect, when it is delivered by words only; but it then becomes
   perfect, when it is completed by deeds.

   Since therefore Christ was sent to men as a teacher of virtue, for the
   perfection of His teaching it was plainly befitting that He should act
   as well as teach. But if He had not assumed a human body, He would not
   have been able to practice what He taught,--that is, not to be angry,
   not to desire riches, not to be inflamed with lust, not to fear pain,
   to despise death. These things are plainly virtues, but they cannot be
   done without flesh. Therefore He assumed a body on this account, that,
   since He taught that the desires of the flesh must be overcome, He
   might in person first practice it, that no one might allege the frailty
   of the flesh as an excuse.

    Chap. LI.--Of the Death of Christ on the Cross.

   I will now speak of the mystery of the cross, lest any one should
   happen to say, If death must be endured by Him, it should have been not
   one that was manifestly infamous and dishonourable, but one which had
   some honour. I know, indeed, that many, while they dislike the name of
   the cross, shrink from the truth, though there is in it great
   reasonableness and power. For since He was sent for this purpose, that
   He might open to the lowest men the way to salvation, He made Himself
   humble that He might free them. Therefore He underwent that kind of
   death which is usually inflicted on the humble, that an opportunity of
   imitation might be given to all. Moreover, since He was about to rise
   again, it was not allowable that His body should be in any way
   mutilated, or a bone broken, which happens to those who are beheaded.
   Therefore the cross was preferred, which reserved the body with the
   bones uninjured for the resurrection.

   To these grounds it was also added, that having undertaken to suffer
   and to die, it was befitting that He should be lifted up. Thus the
   cross exalted Him both in fact and in emblem, [1564] so that His
   majesty and power became known to all, together with His passion. For
   in that He extended His hands on the cross, He plainly stretched out
   His wings towards the east and the west, under which all nations from
   either side of the world might assemble and repose. But of what great
   weight this sign is, and what power it has, is evident, since all the
   host of demons is expelled and put to flight by this sign. And as He
   Himself before His passion put to confusion demons by His word and
   command, so now, by the name and sign of the same passion, unclean
   spirits, having insinuated themselves into the bodies of men, are
   driven out, when racked and tormented, and confessing themselves to be
   demons, they yield themselves to God, who harasses them. What therefore
   can the Greeks expect from their superstitions and with their wisdom,
   when they see that their gods, whom they do not deny to be demons also,
   are subdued by men through the cross?

    Chap. LII.--The Hope of the Salvation of Men Consists in the Knowledge of
    the True God, and of the Hatred of the Heathens Against the Christians.

   There is therefore but one hope of life for men, one harbour of safety,
   one refuge of liberty, if, laying aside the errors by which they were
   held, they open the eyes of their mind and recognise God, in whom alone
   is the abode of truth; despise earthly things, and those made from the
   ground esteem as nothing philosophy, which is foolishness with God; and
   having undertaken true wisdom, that is, religion, become heirs of
   immortality. But indeed they are not so much opposed to the truth as to
   their own safety; and when they hear these things, they abominate them
   as some inexpiable wickedness. But they do not even endure [1565] to
   hear: they think that their ears are polluted with impiety [1566] if
   they hear; nor do they now refrain from reproaches, but assail them
   with the most insulting words; and also, if they have obtained the
   power, persecute them as public enemies, yea, even as worse than
   enemies; for enemies, when they have been vanquished, are punished with
   death or slavery; nor is there any torturing after the laying down of
   arms, although those deserved to suffer all things who wished so to
   act, that piety might have place among swords.

   Cruelty, combined with innocence, is unheard of, nor is it worthy of
   the condition of victorious enemies. What is the so powerful cause of
   this fury? Doubtless, because they cannot contend on the ground of
   reason, they urge forward their cause by means of violence; and, with
   the subject not understood, they condemn those as most pernicious
   persons who have declined to make a stand respecting the fact of their
   innocence. Nor do they deem it sufficient that those whom they
   unreasonably hate should die by a speedy and simple death; but they
   lacerate them with refined tortures, that they may satisfy their
   hatred, which is not produced by any fault, but by the truth, which is
   hateful to those who live wickedly, because they take it ill that there
   are some whom their deeds cannot please. They desire in every way to
   destroy these, that they may be able to sin without restraint in the
   absence of any witness.

    Chap. LIII.--The Reasons of the Hatred Against the Christians are Examined
    and Refuted.

   But they say that they do these things for the defence of their gods.
   In the first place, if they are gods, and have any power and influence,
   they have no need of the defence and protection of men, but they
   manifestly defend themselves. Or how is man able to hope for aid from
   them, if they are unable to average even their own injuries? Therefore
   it is a vain and foolish thing to wish to be avengers of the gods,
   except that their distrust is more apparent from this. For he who
   undertakes the protection of the god whom he worships, admits the
   worthlessness of that god; but if he worships him on this account,
   because he thinks him powerful, he ought not to wish to defend him, by
   whom he himself ought to be defended. We therefore act rightly. For
   when those defenders of false gods, who are rebellious against the true
   God, persecute His name in us, we resist not either in deed or in word,
   but with meekness, and silence, and patience, we endure whatever
   cruelty is able to contrive against us. For we have confidence in God,
   from whom we expect that retribution will hereafter follow. Nor is this
   confidence ungrounded, since we have in some cases heard, and in other
   cases seen, the miserable ends of all those who have dared to commit
   this crime. Nor has any one had it in his power to insult God with
   impunity; but he who has been unwilling to learn by word has learned by
   his own punishment who is the true God.

   I should wish to know, when they compel men to sacrifice against their
   will, what reasoning they have with themselves, or to whom they make
   that offering. If it is made to the gods, that is not worship, nor an
   acceptable sacrifice, which is made by those who are displeasing to
   them, which is extorted by injury, which is enforced by pain. But if it
   is done to those whom they compel, it is plainly not a benefit, which
   any one would not receive, he even prefers rather to die. If it is a
   good to which you call me, why do you invite me with evil? why with
   blows, and not with words? why not by argument, but by bodily tortures?
   Whence it is manifest that that is an evil, to which you do not allure
   me willing, but drag me refusing. What folly is it to wish to consult
   the good of any one against his will! If any one, under the pressure of
   evils, attempts to have recourse to death, can you, if you either wrest
   the sword from his hand, or cut the halter, or drag him away from the
   precipice, or pour out the poison, boast yourself as the preserver of
   the man, when he, whom you think that you have preserved, does not
   thank you, and thinks that you have acted ill towards him, in averting
   from him the death which be desired, and in not permitting him to reach
   the end and rest from his labours? For a benefit ought not to be
   weighed according to the quality of the action, but according to the
   feelings of him who receives it. Why should you reckon as a benefit
   that which is an injury to me? Do you wish me to worship your gods,
   which I consider deadly to myself? If it is a good, I do not envy it.
   Enjoy your good by yourself. There is no reason why you should wish to
   succour my error, which I have undertaken by my judgment and
   inclination. If it is evil, why do you drag me to a participation in
   evil? Use your own fortune. I prefer to die in the practice of that
   which is good, than to live in evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. LIV.--Of the Freedom of Religion in the Worship of God.

   These things may indeed be said with justice. But who will hear, when
   men of furious and unbridled spirit think that their authority is
   diminished if there is any freedom in the affairs of men? But it is
   religion alone in which freedom has placed its dwelling. For it is a
   matter which is voluntary above all others, nor can necessity be
   imposed upon any, so as to worship that which he does not wish to
   worship. [1567] Some one may perhaps pretend, he cannot wish it. In
   short, some, through fear of torments, or overcome by tortures, have
   assented to detestable sacrifices: they never do that voluntarily which
   they did from necessity; but when the opportunity is again given to
   them, and liberty restored, they again betake themselves to God, and
   appease Him with prayers and tears, repenting not of the will, which
   they had not, but of the necessity which they endured; and pardon is
   not denied to those who make satisfaction. What then does he accomplish
   who pollutes the body, since he cannot change the will?

   But, in fact, men of weak understanding, if they have induced any man
   of spirit [1568] to sacrifice to their gods, with incredible alacrity
   insolently exult, and rejoice, as though they had sent an enemy under
   the yoke. But if any one, neither frightened by threats nor by
   tortures, shall have chosen to prefer his faith to his life, cruelty
   puts forth all its ingenuity against him, plans dreadful and
   intolerable things; and because they know that death for the cause of
   God is glorious, and that this is a victory on our side, if, having
   overcome the torturers, we lay down our life in behalf of the faith and
   religion, they also themselves strive to conquer us. They do not put us
   to death, but they search out new and unheard-of tortures, that the
   frailty of the flesh may yield to pains, and if it does not yield, they
   put off further punishment, and apply diligent care to the wounds, that
   while the scars are yet fresh, a repetition of the torture may inflict
   more pain; and while they practice this torture [1569] upon the
   innocent, they evidently consider themselves pious, and just, and
   religious (for they are delighted with such sacrifices to their gods),
   but they term the others impious and desperate. What perversity is
   this, that he who is punished, though innocent, should be called
   desperate and impious, and that the torturer, on the other hand, should
   be called just and pious!

    Chap. LV.--The Heathens Charge Justice with Impiety in Following God.

   But they say that those are rightly and deservedly punished, who
   dislike the public rites of religion handed down to them by their
   ancestors. What if those ancestors were foolish in undertaking vain
   religious rites, as we have shown before, shall we be prohibited from
   following true and better things? Why do we deprive ourselves of
   liberty, and become enslaved to the errors of others, as though bound
   [1570] to them? Let it be permitted us to be wise, let it be permitted
   us to inquire into the truth. But, however, if it pleases them to
   defend the folly [1571] of their ancestors, why are the Egyptians
   suffered to escape, who worship cattle and beasts of every kind as
   deities? Why are the gods themselves made the subjects of comic [1572]
   representations? and why is he honoured who derides them most wittily?
   Why are philosophers attended to, who either say that there are no
   gods, or that, if there are any, they take no interest in, and do not
   regard the affairs of men, or argue that there is no providence at all,
   which rules the world?

   But they alone of all are judged impious who follow God and the truth.
   And since this is at once justice, and wisdom, they lay to its charge
   either impiety or folly, and do not perceive what it is which deceives
   them, when they call evil good, and good evil. Many indeed of the
   philosophers, and especially Plato and Aristotle, spoke many things
   about justice, asserting and extolling that virtue with the greatest
   praise, because it gives to each its due, because it maintains equity
   in all things; and whereas the other virtues are as it were silent, and
   shut up within, that it is justice alone which is neither concerned
   [1573] for itself only, nor hidden, but altogether shows itself [1574]
   abroad, and is ready for conferring a benefit, so as to assist as many
   as possible: as though in truth justice ought to be in judges only, and
   those placed in any post of authority, and not in all men.

   And yet there is no one of men, not even of the lowest and of beggars,
   who is not capable of justice. But because they did not know what it
   was, from what source it proceeded, and what was its mode of operation,
   they assigned to a few only that highest virtue, that is, the common
   good of all, and said that it aimed at [1575] no advantages peculiar to
   itself, but only the interests of others. And not without reason was
   Carneades raised up, a man of the greatest talent and penetration, to
   refute their speech, and overthrow the justice, which had no firm
   foundation; not because he thought that justice was to be blamed, but
   that he might show that its defenders brought forward no firm or
   certain argument respecting justice.

    Chap. LVI.--Of Justice, Which is the Worship of the True God.

   For if justice is the worship of the true God (for what is so just with
   respect to equity, so pious with respect to honour, so necessary with
   respect to safety, as to acknowledge God as a parent, to reverence Him
   as Lord, and to obey His law or precepts?), it follows that the
   philosophers were ignorant of justice, for they neither acknowledged
   God Himself, nor observed His worship and law; and on this account they
   might have been refuted by Carneades, whose disputation was to this
   effect, that there is no natural justice, and therefore that all
   animals defended their own interests by the guidance of nature itself,
   and therefore that justice, if it promotes the advantages of others and
   neglects its own, is to be called foolishness. But if all people who
   are possessed of power, and the Romans themselves, who are masters of
   the whole world, were willing to follow justice, and to restore to
   every one his property which they have seized by force and arms, they
   will return to cottages and a condition of want. And if they did this,
   they might indeed be just, but they must of necessity be considered
   foolish, who proceed to injure themselves for the advantage of others.
   Then, if any one should find a man who was through a mistake offering
   for sale gold as mountain-brass, or silver as lead, and necessity
   should compel him to buy it, will he conceal his knowledge and buy it
   for a small sum, or will he rather inform the seller of its value? If
   he shall inform him, he will manifestly be called just; but he will
   also be foolish, for conferring an advantage upon another, and injuring
   himself. But it is easy to judge in a case of injury. What if he shall
   incur danger of his life, so that it shall be necessary for him either
   to kill another or to die, what will he do? It may happen that, having
   suffered shipwreck, he may find some feeble person clinging to a plank;
   or, his army having been defeated, in his flight he may find a wounded
   man on horseback: will he thrust the one from the plank, the other from
   his horse, that he himself may be able to escape? If he shall wish to
   be just, he will not do it; but he will also be judged foolish, who in
   sparing the life of another shall lose his own. If he shall do it, he
   will indeed appear wise, because he will provide for his own interests;
   but he will also be wicked, because he will commit a wrong.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. LVII.--Of Wisdom and Foolishness.

   These things indeed are said with acuteness; but we are able very
   readily to reply to them. For the imitation of names causes it thus to
   appear. For justice bears a resemblance to foolishness, and yet it is
   not foolishness; and at the same time malice bears a resemblance to
   wisdom, and yet it is not wisdom. But as that malice is intelligent and
   shrewd in preserving its own interests, it is not wisdom, but cunning
   and craftiness; so likewise justice ought not to be called foolishness,
   but innocence, because the just man must be wise, and the foolish man
   unjust. For neither reason nor nature itself permits that he who is
   just should not be wise, since it is plain that the just man does
   nothing except that which is right and good, and always avoids that
   which is perverted [1576] and evil. But who will be able to distinguish
   between good and evil, depravity and rectitude, but he who shall be
   wise? But the fool acts badly, because he is ignorant of what is good
   and evil. Therefore he does wrong, because he is unable to distinguish
   between things which are perverted and those which are right. Therefore
   justice cannot be befitting to the foolish man, nor wisdom to the
   unjust. He is not then a foolish person who has not thrust off a
   shipwrecked man from a plank, nor a wounded man from his horse, because
   he has abstained from injury, which is a sin; and it is the part of the
   wise man to avoid sin.

   But that he should appear foolish at first sight is caused by this,
   that they suppose the soul to be extinguished together with the body;
   and for this reason they refer all advantage to this life. For if there
   is no existence after death, it is plain that he acts foolishly who
   spares the life of another to his own loss, or who consults the gain of
   another more than his own. If death destroys the soul, we must use our
   endeavours to live for a longer time, and more to our own advantage;
   but if there remains after death a life of immortality and blessedness,
   the just and wise man will certainly despise this corporeal existence,
   with all earthly goods, because he will know what kind of a reward he
   is about to receive from God. Therefore let us maintain innocency, let
   us maintain justice, let us undergo the appearance of foolishness, that
   we may be able to maintain true wisdom. And if it appears to men
   senseless and foolish to prefer torture and death rather than to
   sacrifice to gods, and to escape without harm, let us however strive to
   exhibit faithfulness towards God by all virtue and by all patience. Let
   not death terrify us, nor pain subdue us, so as to prevent the vigour
   of our mind and constancy from being preserved unshaken. Let them call
   us foolish, whilst they themselves are most foolish, and blind and
   dull, and like sheep; who do not understand that it is a deadly thing
   to leave the living God, and prostrate themselves in the adoration of
   earthly objects; who do not know that eternal punishment awaits those
   who have worshipped senseless images; and that those who have neither
   refused tortures nor death for the worship and honour of the true God
   will obtain eternal life. This is the highest faith; this is true
   wisdom; this is perfect justice. It matters nothing to us what fools
   may judge, what trifling men may think. We ought to await the judgment
   of God, that we may hereafter judge those who have passed judgment on
   us.

    Chap. LVIII.--Of the True Worship of God, and Sacrifice.

   I have spoken of justice, what was its nature. It follows that I show
   what is true sacrifice to God, what is the most just manner of
   worshipping Him, lest any one should think that victims, or odours, or
   precious gifts, are desired by God, who, if He is not subject to
   hunger, and thirst, and cold, and desire of all earthly things, does
   not therefore make use of all these things which are presented in
   temples and to gods of earth; but as corporeal offerings are necessary
   for corporeal beings, so manifestly an incorporeal sacrifice is
   necessary for an incorporeal being. But God has no need of those things
   which He has given to man for his use, since all the earth is under His
   power: He needs not a temple, since the world is His dwelling; He needs
   not an image, since He is incomprehensible both to the eyes and to the
   mind; He needs not earthly lights, for He was able to kindle the light
   of the sun, with the other stars, for the use of man. What then does
   God require from man but worship of the mind, which is pure and holy?
   For those things which are made by the hands, or are outside of man,
   are senseless, frail, and displeasing. This is true sacrifice, which is
   brought forth not from the chest but from the heart; not that which is
   offered by the hand, but by the mind. This is the acceptable victim,
   which the mind sacrifices of itself. For what do victims bestow? What
   does incense? What do garments? What does silver? What gold? What
   precious stones,--if there is not a pure mind on the part of the
   worshipper? Therefore it is justice only which God requires. In this is
   sacrifice; in this the worship of God, respecting which I must now
   speak, and show in what works justice must necessarily be contained.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. LIX.--Of the Ways of Life, and the First Times of the World.

   That there are two ways [1577] of human life was unknown neither to
   philosophers nor to poets, but both introduced them in a different
   manner. The philosophers wished the one to be the way of industry, the
   other of idleness; but in this respect they were less correct in their
   statements, that they referred them to the advantages of this life
   only. The poets spoke better who said that one of them was the way of
   the just, the other of the unjust; but they err in this, that they say
   that they are not in this life, but in the shades below. We manifestly
   speak more correctly, who say that the one is the way of life, the
   other that of death. And here, however, we say that there are two ways;
   but the one on the right hand, in which the just walk, does not lead to
   Elysium, but to heaven, for they become immortal; the other on the left
   leads to Tartarus, [1578] for the unjust are sentenced to eternal
   tortures. Therefore the way of justice, which leads to life, is to be
   held by us. Now the first duty of justice is to acknowledge God as a
   parent, and to fear Him as a master, to love Him as a father. For the
   same Being who begat us, who animated us with vital breath, who
   nourishes and preserves us, has over us, not only as a father but also
   as a master, authority to correct us, and the power of life and death;
   wherefore twofold honour is due to Him from man, that is, love combined
   with fear. The second duty of justice is to acknowledge man as a
   brother. For if the same God made us, and produced all men on equal
   terms to justice and eternal life, it is manifest that we are united by
   the relationship of brotherhood; and he who does not acknowledge this
   is unjust. But the origin of this evil, by which the mutual society of
   men, by which the bond of relationship has been torn asunder, arises
   from ignorance of the true God. For he who is ignorant of that fountain
   of bounty can by no means be good. Hence it is that, from the time when
   a multitude of gods began to be consecrated and worshipped by men,
   justice, as the poets relate, being put to flight, every compact was
   destroyed, the fellowship of human justice was destroyed. Then every
   one, consulting his own interest, reckoned might to be right, injured
   another, attacked by frauds, deceived [1579] by treachery, increased
   his own advantages by the inconvenience of others, did not spare
   relatives, or children, or parents, prepared poisoned cups for the
   destruction of men, beset the ways with the sword, infested the seas,
   gave the rein to his lust, wherever passion led him,--in short,
   esteemed nothing sacred which his dreadful desire did not violate. When
   these things were done, then men instituted laws for themselves to
   promote the public advantage, that they might meanwhile protect
   themselves from injuries. But the fear of laws did not suppress crimes,
   but it checked licentiousness. For laws were able to punish offences,
   they were unable to punish the conscience. Therefore the things which
   before were done openly began to be done secretly. Justice also was
   evaded by stealth, since they who themselves presided over the
   administration of the laws, corrupted by, gifts and rewards, made a
   traffic of their sentences, either to the escape [1580] of the evil or
   to the destruction of the good. To these things were added dissensions,
   and wars, and mutual depredations; and the laws being crushed, the
   power of acting with violence was assumed without restraint.

    Chap. LX.--Of the Duties of Justice.

   When the affairs of men were in this condition, God pitied us, revealed
   and displayed Himself to us, that in Himself we might learn religion,
   faith, purity, and mercy; that having laid aside the error of our
   former life, together with God Himself we might know ourselves, whom
   impiety had disunited from Him, and we might choose [1581] the divine
   law, which unites human affairs with heavenly, the Lord Himself
   delivering it to us; by which law all the errors with which we have
   been ensnared, together with vain and impious superstitions, might be
   taken away. What we owe to man, therefore, is prescribed by that same
   divine law which teaches that whatever you render to man is rendered to
   God. But the root of justice, and the entire foundation of equity, is
   that you should not do that which you would be unwilling to suffer, but
   should measure the feelings of another by your own. If it is an
   unpleasant thing to bear an injury, and he who has done it appears
   unjust, transfer to the person of another that which you feel
   respecting yourself, and to your own person that which you judge
   respecting another, and you will understand that you act as unjustly if
   you injure another as another would if he should injure you. If we
   consider these things, we shall maintain innocence, in which the first
   step of justice is, as it were, contained. For the first thing is, not
   to injure; the next is, to be of service. And as in uncultivated lands,
   before you begin to sow, the fields must be cleansed by tearing up the
   thorns and cutting off all the roots of trunks, so vices must first be
   thrust out from our souls, and then at length virtues must be
   implanted, from which the fruits of immortality, being engendered by
   the word of God, may spring up.

    Chap. LXI.--Of the Passions.

   There are three passions, or, so to speak, three furies, which excite
   such great perturbations in the souls of men, and sometimes compel them
   to offend in such a manner, as to permit them to have regard neither
   for their reputation nor for their personal safety: these are anger,
   which desires vengeance; love of gain, which longs for riches; lust,
   which seeks for pleasures. We must above all things resist these vices:
   these trunks must be rooted up, that virtues may be implanted. The
   Stoics are of opinion that these passions must be cut off; the
   Peripatetics think that they must be restrained. Neither of them judge
   rightly, because they cannot entirely be taken away, since they are
   implanted by nature, and have a sure and great influence; nor can they
   be diminished, since, if they are evil, we ought to be without them,
   even though restrained and used with moderation; if they are good, we
   ought to use them in their completeness. [1582] But we say that they
   ought not to be taken away nor lessened. For they are not evil of
   themselves, since God has reasonably implanted them in us; but inasmuch
   as they are plainly good by nature,--for they are given us for the
   protection of life,--they become evil by their evil use. And as
   bravery, if you fight in defence of your country, is a good, if against
   your country, is an evil, so the passions, if you employ them to good
   purposes, will be virtues, if to evil uses, they will be called vices.
   Anger therefore has been given by God for the restraining of offences,
   that is, for controlling the discipline of subjects, that fear may
   suppress licentiousness and restrain audacity. But they who are
   ignorant of its limits are angry with their equals, or even with their
   superiors. Hence they rush to deeds of cruelty, hence they rise to
   slaughters, hence to wars. The love of gain also has been given that we
   may desire and seek for the necessaries of life. But they who are
   unacquainted with its boundaries strive insatiably to heap up riches.
   Hence poisoning, hence defraudings, [1583] hence false wills, hence all
   kinds of frauds have burst forth. Moreover, the passion of lust is
   implanted and innate in us for the procreation of children; but they
   who do not fix its limits in the mind use it for pleasure only. Thence
   arise unlawful loves, thence adulteries and debaucheries, thence all
   kinds of corruption. These passions, therefore, must be kept within
   their boundaries and directed into their right course, in which, even
   though they should be vehement, they cannot incur blame.

    Chap. LXII.--Of Restraining the Pleasures of the Senses.

   Anger is to be restrained when we suffer an injury, that the evil may
   be suppressed which is imminent from a contest, and that we may retain
   two of the greatest virtues, harmlessness and patience. Let the desire
   of gain be broken when we have that which is enough. For what madness
   is it to labour in heaping up those things which must pass to others,
   either by robbery, or theft, or by proscription, or by death? Let lust
   not go beyond the marriage-bed, but be subservient to the procreation
   of children. For a too great eagerness for pleasure both produces
   danger and generates disgrace, and that which is especially to be
   avoided, leads to eternal death. Nothing is so hateful to God as an
   unchaste mind and an impure soul. Nor let any one think that he must
   abstain from this pleasure only, quæ capitur ex foeminei corporis
   copulatione, but also from the other pleasures which arise from the
   rest of the senses, because they also are of themselves vicious, and it
   is the part of the same virtue to despise them. The pleasure of the
   eyes is derived from the beauty of objects, that of the ears from
   harmonious and pleasant sounds, that of the nostrils from pleasant
   odour, that of taste from sweet food,--all of which virtue ought
   strongly to resist, lest, ensnared by these attractions, the soul
   should be depressed from heavenly to earthly things, from things
   eternal to things temporal, from life immortal to perpetual punishment.
   In pleasures of the taste and smell there is this danger, that they are
   able to draw us to luxury. For he who shall be given up to these
   things, either will have no property, or, if he shall have any, he will
   expend it, and afterwards live a life to be abominated. But he who is
   carried away by hearing (to say nothing respecting songs, [1584] which
   often so charm the inmost senses that they even disturb with madness a
   settled state of the mind by certain elaborately composed speeches and
   harmonious poems, or skilful disputations) is easily led aside to
   impious worship. Hence it is that they who are either themselves
   eloquent, or prefer to read eloquent writings, do not readily believe
   the sacred writings, because they appear unpolished; they do not seek
   things that are true, but things that are pleasant; nay, to them those
   things appear to be most true which soothe the ears. Thus they reject
   the truth, while they are captivated by the sweetness of the discourse.
   But the pleasure which has reference to the sight is manifold. For that
   which is derived from the beauty of precious objects excites avarice,
   which ought to be far removed from a wise and just man; but that which
   is received from the appearance of woman hurries a man to another
   pleasure, of which we have already spoken above.

    Chap. LXIII.--That Shows are Most Powerful to Corrupt the Minds.

   It remains to speak of public shows, which, since they have a more
   powerful influence on the corruption of the mind, ought to be avoided
   by the wise, and to be altogether guarded against, because it is said
   that they were instituted in celebration of the honours of the gods.
   For the exhibitions of shows are festivals of Saturnus. The stage
   belongs to Father Liber; but the Circensian games are supposed to be
   dedicated to Neptunus: so that now he who takes part in these shows
   appears to have left the worship of God, and to have passed over to
   profane rites. But I prefer to speak of the matter itself rather than
   of its origin. What is so dreadful, what so foul, as the slaughter of
   man? Therefore our life is protected by the most severe laws; therefore
   wars are detestable. Yet custom finds how a man may commit homicide
   without war, and without laws; and this is a pleasure to him, that he
   has avenged guilt. But if to be present at homicide implies a
   consciousness of guilt, and the spectator is involved in the same guilt
   as the perpetrator, then in these slaughters of gladiators, he who is a
   spectator is no less sprinkled with blood than he who sheds it; nor can
   he be free from the guilt of bloodshed who wished it to be poured out,
   or appear not to have slain, who both favoured the slayer and asked a
   reward for him. What of the stage? Is it more holy,--on which comedy
   converses on the subject of debaucheries and amours, tragedy of incest
   and parricide? The immodest gestures also of players, with which they
   imitate disreputable women, teach the lusts, which they express by
   dancing. For the pantomime is a school of corruption, [1585] in which
   things which are shameful are acted by a figurative representation,
   [1586] that the things which are true may be done without shame. These
   spectacles are viewed by youths, whose dangerous age, which ought to be
   curbed and governed, is trained by these representations to vices and
   sins. The circus, in truth, is considered more innocent, but there is
   greater madness in this, since the minds of the spectators are
   transported with such great madness, that they not only break out into
   revilings, but often rise to strifes, and battles, and contentions.
   Therefore all shows are to be avoided, that we may be able to maintain
   a tranquil state of mind. We must renounce hurtful pleasures, lest,
   charmed by pestilential sweetness, we fall into the snares of death.

    Chap. LXIV.--The Passions are to Be Subdued, and We Must Abstain from
    Forbidden Things.

   Let virtue alone please us, whose reward is immortal when it has
   conquered pleasure. But when the passions have been overcome and
   pleasures subdued labour in suppressing other things is easy to him who
   is a follower of God and of truth: he will never revile, who shall hope
   for a blessing from God; he will not commit perjury, lest he should
   mock God; but he will not even swear, lest at any time, either by
   necessity or through habit, he should fall into perjury. He will speak
   nothing deceitfully, nothing with dissimulation; he will not refuse
   that which he has promised, nor will he promise that which he is unable
   to perform; he will envy no one, since he is content with himself and
   with his own possessions; nor will he take away from, or wish ill to
   another, upon whom, perhaps, the benefits of God are more plenteously
   [1587] bestowed. He will not steal, nor will he covet anything at all
   belonging to another. He will not give his money to usury, for that is
   to seek after gain from the evils of others; nor, however, will he
   refuse to lend, if necessity shall compel any one to borrow. He must
   not be harsh towards a son, nor towards a slave: he must remember that
   he himself has a Father and a Master. He will so act towards these as
   he will wish that others should act towards him. He will not receive
   excessive gifts from those who have less resources than himself; for it
   is not just that the estates of the wealthy should be increased by the
   losses of the wretched.

   It is an old precept not to kill, which ought not to be taken in this
   light, as though we are commanded to abstain only from homicide, which
   is punished even by public laws. But by the intervention of this
   command, it will not be permitted us to apply peril of death by word,
   nor to put to death or expose an infant, nor to condemn one's self by a
   voluntary death. We are likewise commanded not to commit adultery; but
   by this precept we are not only prohibited from polluting the marriage
   of another, which is condemned even by the common law of nations, but
   even to abstain from those who prostitute their persons. For the law of
   God is above all laws; it forbids even those things which are esteemed
   lawful, that it may fulfil justice. It is a part of the same law not to
   utter false witness, and this also itself has a wider meaning. For if
   false witness by falsehood is injurious to him against whom it is
   spoken, and deceives him in whose presence it is spoken, we must
   therefore never speak falsely, because falsehood always deceives or
   injures. Therefore he is not a just man who, even without inflicting
   injury, speaks in idle discourse. Nor indeed is it lawful for him to
   flatter, for flattery is pernicious and deceitful; but he will
   everywhere guard the truth. And although this may for the present be
   unpleasant, nevertheless, when its advantage and usefulness shall
   appear, it will not produce hatred, as the poet says, [1588] but
   gratitude.

    Chap. LXV.--Precepts About Those Things Which are Commanded, and of Pity.

   I have spoken of those things which are forbidden; I will now briefly
   say what things are commanded. Closely connected with harmlessness is
   pity. For the former does not inflict injury, the latter works good;
   the former begins justice, the latter completes it. For since the
   nature of men is more feeble than that of the other animals, which God
   has provided with means of inflicting violence, and with defences for
   repelling it, He has given to us the affection of pity, that we might
   place the whole protection of our life in mutual aid. For if we are
   created by one God, and descended from one man, and are thus connected
   by the law of consanguinity, we ought on this account to love every
   man; and therefore we are bound not only to abstain from the infliction
   of injury, but not even to avenge it when inflicted on us, that there
   may be in us complete harmlessness. And on this account God commands us
   to pray always even for our enemies. Therefore we ought to be an animal
   fitted for companionship and society, that we may mutually protect
   ourselves by giving and receiving assistance. For our frailty is liable
   to many accidents and inconveniences. Expect that that which you see
   has happened to another may happen to you also. Thus you will at length
   be excited to render aid, if you shall assume the mind of him who,
   being placed in evils, implores your aid. If any one is in need of
   food, let us bestow it; if any one meets us who is naked, let us clothe
   him; if any one suffers injury from one who is more powerful than
   himself, let us rescue him. Let our house be open to strangers, or to
   those who are in need of shelter. Let our defence not be wanting to
   wards, or our protection to the defenceless. [1589] To ransom captives
   is a great work of pity, and also to visit and comfort the sick who are
   in poverty. If the helpless or strangers die, we should not permit them
   to lie unburied. These are the works, these the duties, of pity; and if
   any one undertakes these, he will offer unto God a true and acceptable
   sacrifice. This victim is more adapted for an offering to God, who is
   not appeased with the blood of a sheep, but with the piety of man, whom
   God, because He is just, follows up with His own law, and with His own
   condition. He shows mercy to him whom He sees to be merciful; He is
   inexorable to him whom He sees to be harsh to those who entreat him.
   Therefore, that we may be able to do all these things, which are
   pleasing to God, money is to be despised, and to be transferred to
   heavenly treasures, where neither thief can break through, nor rust
   corrupt, nor tyrant take away, but it may be preserved for us under the
   guardianship of God to our eternal wealth.

    Chap. LXVI.--Of Faith in Religion, and of Fortitude.

   Faith also is a great part of justice; and this ought especially to be
   preserved by us, who bear the name of faith, especially in religion,
   because God is before and to be preferred to man. And if it is a
   glorious thing to undergo death in behalf of friends, of parents, and
   of children, that is, in behalf of man, and if he who has done this
   obtains lasting memory and praise, how much more so in behalf of God,
   who is able to bestow eternal life in return for temporal death?
   Therefore, when a necessity of this kind happens, that we are compelled
   to turn aside from God, and to pass over to the rites of the heathens,
   no fear, no terror should turn us aside from guarding the faith
   delivered to us. Let God be before our eyes, in our heart, by whose
   inward help we may overcome the pain of our flesh, and the torments
   applied to our body. Then let us think of nothing else but the rewards
   of an immortal life. And thus, even though our limbs should be torn in
   pieces, or burnt, we shall easily endure all things which the madness
   of tyrannical cruelty shall contrive against us. Lastly, let us strive
   to undergo death itself, not unwillingly or timidly, but willingly and
   undauntedly, as those who know what glory we are about to have in the
   presence of God, having triumphed over the world and coming to the
   things promised us; with what good things and how great blessedness we
   shall be compensated for these brief evils of punishments, and the
   injuries of this life. But if the opportunity of this glory shall be
   wanting, faith will have its reward even in peace.

   Therefore let it be observed in all the duties of life, let it be
   observed in marriage. For it is not sufficient if you abstain from
   another's bed, or from the brothel. Let him who has a wife seek nothing
   further, but, content with her alone, let him guard the mysteries of
   the marriage-bed chaste and undefiled. For he is equally an adulterer
   in the sight of God and impure, who, having thrown off the yoke,
   wantons in strange pleasure either with a free woman or a slave. But as
   a woman is bound by the bonds of chastity not to desire any other man,
   so let the husband be bound by the same law, since God has joined
   together the husband and the wife in the union of one body. On this
   account He has commanded that the wife shall not be put away unless
   convicted of adultery, and that the bond of the conjugal compact shall
   never be dissolved, unless unfaithfulness have broken it. [1590] This
   also is added for the completion of chastity, that there should be an
   absence not only of the offence, but even of the thought. For it is
   evident that the mind is polluted by the desire, though unaccomplished;
   and so that a just man ought neither to do, nor to wish to do, that
   which is unjust. Therefore the conscience must be cleansed; for God,
   who cannot be deceived, inspects it. The breast must be cleared from
   every stain, that it may be a temple of God, which is enlightened not
   by the gleam of gold or ivory, but by the brightness of faith and
   purity.

    Chap. LXVII.--Of Repentance, the Immortality of the Soul, and of Providence.

   But it is true all these things are difficult to man, nor does the
   condition of his frailty permit that any one should be without blemish.
   Therefore the last remedy is this, that we have recourse to repentance,
   which has not the least place among the virtues, because it is a
   correction of oneself; that when we have happened to fail either in
   deed or in word, we may immediately come to a better mind, and confess
   that we have offended, and entreat pardon from God, which according to
   His mercy He will not deny, except to those who persist in their error.
   Great is the aid, great the solace of repentance. That is the healing
   of wounds and offences, that hope, that the harbour of safety; and he
   who takes away this cuts off from himself the way of salvation, because
   no one can be so just that repentance is never necessary for him. But
   we, even though there is no offence of ours, yet ought to confess to
   God, and to entreat pardon for our faults, and to give thanks even in
   evils. Let us always offer this obedience to our Lord. For humility is
   dear and lovely in the sight of God; for since He rather receives the
   sinner who confesses his fault, than the just man who is haughty, how
   much more will He receive the just man who confesses, and exalt him in
   His heavenly kingdom in proportion to his humility! These are the
   things which the worshipper of God ought to hold forth; these are the
   victims, this the sacrifice, which is acceptable; this is true worship,
   when a man offers upon the altar of God the pledges of his own mind.
   That supreme Majesty rejoices in such a worshipper as this, as it takes
   him as a son and bestows upon him the befitting reward of immortality,
   concerning which I must now speak, and refute the persuasion of those
   who think that the soul is destroyed together with the body. For
   inasmuch as they neither knew God nor were able to perceive the mystery
   of the world, they did not even comprehend the nature of man and of the
   soul. For how could they see the consequences, who did not hold the
   main point? [1591] Therefore, in denying the existence of a providence,
   they plainly denied the existence of God, who is the fountain and
   source of all things. It followed that they should either affirm that
   those things which exist have always existed, or were produced of their
   own accord, or arose from a meeting together of minute seeds.

   It cannot be said that that which exists, and is visible, always
   existed; for it cannot exist of itself without some beginning. But
   nothing can be produced of its own accord, because there is no nature
   without one who generates it. But how could there be original [1592]
   seeds, since both the seeds arise from objects, [1593] and, in their
   turn, objects from seeds? Therefore there is no seed which has not
   origin. Thus it came to pass, that when they supposed that the world
   was produced by no providence, they did not suppose that even man was
   produced by any plan. [1594] But if no plan was made use of in the
   creation of man, therefore the soul cannot be immortal. But others, on
   the other hand, thought there was but one God, and that the world was
   made by Him, and made for the sake of men, and that souls are immortal.
   But though they entertained true sentiments, nevertheless they did not
   perceive the causes, or reasons, or issues of this divine work and
   design, so as to complete the whole mystery of the truth, and to
   comprise it within some limit. But that which they were not able to do,
   because they did not hold the truth in its integrity, [1595] must be
   done by us, who know it on the announcement of God.

    Chap. LXVIII.--Of the World, Man, and the Providence of God.

   Let us therefore consider what was the plan of making this so great and
   so immense a work. God made the world, as Plato thought, but he does
   not show why He made it. Because He is good, he says, and envying no
   one, He made the things which are good. But we see that there are both
   good and evil things in the system of nature. Some perverse person may
   stand forth, such as that atheist Theodorus was, and answer Plato: Nay,
   because He is evil, He made the things which are evil. How will he
   refute him? If God made the things which are good, whence have such
   great evils burst forth, which, for the most part, even prevail over
   those which are good? They were contained, he says, in the matter. If
   there were evil, therefore there were also good things; so that either
   God made nothing, or if He made only good things, the evil things which
   were not made are more eternal than the good things which had a
   beginning. Therefore the things which at one time began will have an
   end, and those which always existed will be permanent. Therefore evils
   are preferable. But if they cannot be preferable, they cannot indeed be
   more eternal. Therefore they either always existed, and God has been
   inactive, [1596] or they both flowed from one source. For it is more in
   accordance with reason that God made all things, than that He made
   nothing.

   Therefore, according to the sentiments of Plato, the same God is both
   good, because He made good things, and evil, because He made evil
   things. And if this cannot be so, it is evident that the world was not
   made by God on this account, because He is good. For He comprised all
   things, both good and evil; nor did He make anything for its own sake,
   but on account of something else. A house is built not for this purpose
   only, that there may be a house, but that it may receive and shelter an
   inhabitant. Likewise a ship is built not for this purpose, that it may
   appear only to be a ship, but that men may be able to sail in it.
   Vessels also are made, not only that the vessels may exist, but that
   they may receive things which are necessary for use. Thus also God must
   have made the world for some use. The Stoics say that it was made for
   the sake of men; and rightly so. For men enjoy all these good things
   which the world contains in itself. But they do not explain why men
   themselves were made, or what advantage Providence, the Maker of all
   things, has in them.

   Plato also affirms that souls are immortal, but why, or in what manner,
   or at what time, or by whose instrumentality they attain to
   immortality, or what is the nature of that great mystery, why those who
   are about to become immortal are previously born mortal, and then,
   having completed the course [1597] of their temporal life, and having
   laid aside the covering [1598] of their frail bodies, are transferred
   to that eternal blessedness,--of all this he has no comprehension.
   Finally, he did not explain the judgment of God, nor the distinction
   between the just and the unjust, but supposed that the souls which have
   plunged themselves into crimes are condemned thus far, that they may be
   reproduced in the lower animals, and thus atone for their offences,
   until they again return to the forms of men, and that this is always
   taking place, and that there is no end of this transmigration. In my
   opinion, he introduces some sport resembling a dream, in which there
   appears to be neither plan, nor government of God, nor any design.

    Chap. LXIX.--That the World Was Made on Account of Man, and Man on Account
    of God.

   I will now say what is that chief [1599] point which not even those who
   spoke the truth were able to connect together, bringing into one view
   causes and reasons. The world was made by God, that men might be born;
   again, men are born, that they may acknowledge God as a Father, in whom
   is wisdom; they acknowledge Him, that they may worship Him, in whom is
   justice; they worship Him, that they may receive the reward of
   immortality; they receive immortality, that they may serve God for
   ever. Do you see how closely connected the first are with the middle,
   and the middle with the last? Let us look into them separately, and see
   whether they are consistent [1600] with each other. God made the world
   on account of man. He who does not see this, does not differ much from
   a beast. Who but man looks up to the heaven? who views with admiration
   the sun, who the stars, who all the works of God? Who inhabits the
   earth? who receives the fruit from it? Who has in his power the fishes,
   who the winged creatures, who the quadrupeds, except man? Therefore God
   made all things on account of man, because all things have turned out
   for the use of man.

   The philosophers saw this, but they did not see the consequence, that
   He made man himself on His own account. For it was befitting, and
   pious, and necessary, that since He contrived such great works for the
   sake of man, when He gave him so much honour, and so much power, that
   he should bear rule in the world, man should both acknowledge God, the
   Author of such great benefits, who made the world itself on his
   account, and should pay Him the worship and honour due to Him. Here
   Plato erred; here he lost the truth which he had at first laid hold of,
   when he was silent concerning the worship of that God whom he confessed
   to be the framer and parent of all things, and did not understand that
   man is bound to God by the ties of piety, whence religion itself
   receives its name, and that this is the only thing on account of which
   souls become immortal. He perceived, however, that they are eternal,
   but he did not descend by the regular gradations to that opinion. For
   the middle arguments being taken away, he rather fell into the truth,
   as though by some abrupt precipice; nor did he advance further, since
   he had found the truth by accident, and not by reason. Therefore God is
   to be worshipped, that by means of religion, which is also justice, man
   may receive from God immortality, nor is there any other reward of a
   pious mind; and if this is invisible, it cannot be presented by the
   invisible God with any reward but that which is invisible.

    Chap. LXX.--The Immortality of the Soul is Confirmed.

   It may in truth be collected from many arguments that souls are
   eternal. Plato says that that which always moves by itself, and has no
   beginning of motion, also has no end; but that the soul of man always
   moves by itself, and because it is flexible for reflection, subtle for
   discovery, easy of perception, adapted to learning, and because it
   retains the past, comprehends the present, foresees the future, and
   embraces the knowledge of many subjects and arts, that it is immortal,
   since it contains nothing which is mixed with the contagion of earthly
   weight. Moreover, the eternity of the soul is understood from virtue
   and pleasure. Pleasure is common to all animals, virtue belongs only to
   man; the former is vicious, the latter is honourable; the former is in
   accordance with nature, the latter is opposed to nature, unless the
   soul is immortal. For in defence of faith and justice, virtue neither
   fears want, nor is alarmed at exile, nor dreads imprisonment, nor
   shrinks from pain, nor refuses death; and because these things are
   contrary to nature, either virtue is foolishness, if it stands in the
   way of advantages, and is injurious to life; or if it is not
   foolishness, then the soul is immortal, and despises present goods,
   because other things are preferable which it attains after the
   dissolution of the body. But that is the greatest proof of immortality,
   that man alone has the knowledge of God. In the dumb animals there is
   no notion [1601] of religion, because they are earthly and bent down to
   the earth. Man is upright, and beholds the heaven for this purpose,
   that he may seek God. Therefore he cannot be other than immortal, who
   longs for the immortal. He cannot be liable to dissolution, who is
   connected [1602] with God both in countenance and mind. Finally, man
   alone makes use of the heavenly element, which is fire. For if light is
   through fire, and life through light, it is evident that he who has the
   use of fire is not mortal, since this is closely connected, this is
   intimately related to Him without whom neither light nor life can
   exist.

   But why do we infer from arguments that souls are eternal, when we have
   divine testimonies? For the sacred writings and the voices of the
   prophets teach this. And if this appears to any one insufficient, let
   him read the poems of the Sibyls, let him also weigh the answers of the
   Milesian Apollo, that he may understand that Democritus, and Epicurus,
   and Dicæarchus raved, who alone of all mortals denied that which is
   evident. Having proved the immortality of the soul, it remains to teach
   by whom, and to whom, and in what manner, and at what time, it is
   given. Since fixed and divinely appointed times have begun to be filled
   up, a destruction and consummation of all things must of necessity take
   place, that the world may be renewed by God. But that time is at hand,
   as far as may be collected from the number of years, and from the signs
   which are foretold by the prophets. But since the things which have
   been spoken concerning the end of the world and the conclusion of the
   times are innumerable, those very things which are spoken are to be
   laid down without adornment, since it would be a boundless task to
   bring forward the testimonies. If any one wishes for them, or does not
   place full confidence in us, let him approach to the very shrine of the
   heavenly letters, and being more fully instructed through their
   trustworthiness, let him perceive that the philosophers have erred, who
   thought either that this world was eternal, or that there would be
   numberless thousands of years from the time when it was prepared. For
   six thousand years have not yet been completed, and when this number
   shall be made up, then at length all evil will be taken away, that
   justice alone may reign. And how this will come to pass, I will explain
   in few words.

    Chap. LXXI.--Of the Last Times.

   These things are said by the prophets, but as seers, to be about to
   happen. When the last end shall begin to approach to the world,
   wickedness will increase; all kinds of vices and frauds will become
   frequent; justice will perish; faith, peace, mercy, modesty, truth,
   will have no existence; violence and daring will abound; no one will
   have anything, unless it is acquired by the hand, and defended by the
   hand. If there shall be any good men, they will be esteemed as a prey
   and a laughing-stock. No one will exhibit filial affection to parents,
   no one will pity an infant or an old man; avarice and lust will corrupt
   all things. There will be slaughter and bloodshed. There will be wars,
   and those not only between foreign and neighbouring states, but also
   intestine wars. States will carry on wars among themselves, every sex
   and age will handle arms. The dignity of government will not be
   preserved, nor military discipline; but after the manner of robbery,
   there will be depredation and devastation. Kingly power will be
   multiplied, and ten men will occupy, portion out, and devour the world.
   There will arise another by far more powerful and wicked, who, having
   destroyed three, will obtain Asia, and having reduced and subdued the
   others under his own power, will harass all the earth. He will appoint
   new laws, abrogate old ones; he will make the state his own, and will
   change the name and seat of the government.

   Then there will be a dreadful and detestable time, in which no one
   would choose to live. In fine, such will be the condition of things,
   that lamentation will follow the living, and congratulation the dead.
   Cities and towns will be destroyed, at one time by fire and the sword,
   at another by repeated earthquakes; now by inundation of waters, now by
   pestilence and famine. The earth will produce nothing, being barren
   either through excessive cold or heat. All water will be partly changed
   into blood, partly vitiated by bitterness, so that none of it can be
   useful for food, or wholesome for drinking. To these evils will also be
   added prodigies from heaven, that nothing may be wanting to men for
   causing fear. Comets will frequently appear. The sun will be
   overshadowed with perpetual paleness. The moon will be stained with
   blood, nor will it repair the losses of its light taken away. All the
   stars will fall, nor will the seasons preserve their regularity, winter
   and summer being confused. Then both the year, and the month, and the
   day will be shortened. And Trismegistus has declared that this is the
   old age and decline of the world. And when this shall have come, it
   must be known that the time is at hand in which God will return to
   change the world. But in the midst of these evils there will arise an
   impious king, hostile not only to mankind, but also to God. He will
   trample upon, torment, harass and put to death those who have been
   spared by that former tyrant. Then there will be ever-flowing tears,
   perpetual wailings and lamentations, and useless prayers to God; there
   will be no rest from fear, no sleep for a respite. The day will always
   increase disaster, the night alarm. Thus the world will be reduced
   almost to solitude, certainly to fewness of men. Then also the impious
   man will persecute the just and those who are dedicated to God, and
   will give orders that he himself shall be worshipped as God. For he
   will say that he is Christ, though he will be His adversary. [1603]
   That he may be believed, he will receive the power of doing wonders, so
   that fire may descend from heaven, the sun retire from his course, and
   the image which he shall have set up may speak. And by these prodigies
   he shall entice many to worship him, and to receive his sign in their
   hand or forehead. And he who shall not worship him and receive his sign
   will die with refined tortures. Thus he will destroy nearly two parts,
   the third will flee into desolate solitudes. But he, frantic and raging
   with implacable anger, will lead an army and besiege the mountain to
   which the righteous shall have fled. And when they shall see themselves
   besieged, they will implore the aid of God with a loud voice, and God
   shall hear them, and shall send to them a deliverer.

    Chap. LXXII.--Of Christ Descending from Heaven to the General Judgment, and
    of the Millenarian Reign. [1604]

   Then the heaven shall be opened in a tempest, [1605] and Christ shall
   descend with great power, and there shall go before Him a fiery
   brightness and a countless host of angels, and all that multitude of
   the wicked shall be destroyed, and torrents of blood shall flow, and
   the leader himself shall escape, and having often renewed his army,
   shall for the fourth time engage in battle, in which, being taken, with
   all the other tyrants, he shall be delivered up to be burnt. But the
   prince also of the demons himself, the author and contriver of evils,
   being bound with fiery chains, shall be imprisoned, that the world may
   receive peace, and the earth, harassed through so many years, may rest.
   Therefore peace being made, and every evil suppressed, that righteous
   King and Conqueror will institute a great judgment on the earth
   respecting the living and the dead, and will deliver all the nations
   into subjection to the righteous who are alive, and will raise the
   righteous dead to eternal life, and will Himself reign with them on the
   earth, and will build the holy city, and this kingdom of the righteous
   shall be for a thousand years. Throughout that time the stars shall be
   more brilliant, and the brightness of the sun shall be increased, and
   the moon shall not be subject to decrease. Then the rain of blessing
   shall descend from God at morning and evening, and the earth shall
   bring forth all her fruit without the labour of men. Honey shall drop
   from rocks, fountains of milk and wine shall abound. The beasts shall
   lay aside their ferocity and become mild, the wolf shall roam among the
   flocks without doing harm, the calf shall feed with the lion, the dove
   shall be united with the hawk, the serpent shall have no poison; no
   animal shall live by bloodshed. For God shall supply to all abundant
   and harmless [1606] food. But when the thousand years shall be
   fulfilled, and the prince of the demons loosed, the nations will rebel
   against the righteous, and an innumerable multitude will come to storm
   the city of the saints. Then the last judgment of God will come to pass
   against the nations. For He will shake the earth from its foundations,
   and the cities shall be overthrown, and He shall rain upon the wicked
   fire with brimstone and hail, and they shall be on fire, and slay each
   other. But the righteous shall for a little space be concealed under
   the earth, until the destruction of the nations is accomplished, and
   after the third day they shall come forth, and see the plains covered
   with carcases. Then there shall be an earthquake, and the mountains
   shall be rent, and valleys shall sink down to a profound depth, and
   into this the bodies of the dead shall be heaped together, and its name
   shall be called Polyandrion. [1607] After these things God will renew
   the world, and transform the righteous into the forms of angels, that,
   being presented with the garment of immortality, they may serve God for
   ever; and this will be the kingdom of God, which shall have no end.
   Then also the wicked shall rise again, not to life but to punishment;
   for God shall raise these also, when the second resurrection takes
   place, that, being condemned to eternal torments and delivered to
   eternal fires, they may suffer the punishments which they deserve for
   their crimes.

    Chap. LXXIII.--The Hope of Safety is in the Religion and Worship of God.

   Wherefore, since all these things are true and certain, in harmony with
   the predicted announcement of the prophets, since Trismegistus and
   Hystaspes and the Sibyls have foretold the same things, it cannot be
   doubted that all hope of life and salvation is placed in the religion
   of God alone. Therefore, unless a man shall have received Christ, whom
   God has sent, and is about to send for our redemption, unless he shall
   have known the Supreme God through Christ, unless he shall have kept
   His commandments and law, he will fall into those punishments of which
   we have spoken. Therefore frail things must be despised, that we may
   gain those which are substantial; earthly things must be scorned, that
   we may be honoured with heavenly things; temporal things must be
   shunned, that we may reach those which are eternal. Let every one train
   himself to justice, mould himself to self-restraint, prepare himself
   for the contest, equip himself for virtue, that if by any chance an
   adversary shall wage war, he may be driven from that which is upright
   and good by no force, no terror, and no tortures, may give [1608]
   himself up to no senseless fictions, but in his uprightness acknowledge
   the true and only God, may cast away pleasures, by the attractions of
   which the lofty soul is depressed to the earth, may hold fast
   innocency, may be of service to as many as possible, may gain for
   himself incorruptible treasures by good works, that he may be able,
   with God for his judge, to gain for the merits of his virtue either the
   crown of faith, or the reward of immortality.

    Elucidations.

      I.

   (Princes and kings, [154]p. 13.)

   How memorable the histories, moreover, of Nebuchadnezzar [1609] and his
   decrees; of Darius [1610] and his also; but especially of Cyrus and his
   great monumental edict! [1611] The beautiful narratives of the Queen of
   Sheba and of the Persian consort of Queen Esther (probably Xerxes) are
   also manifestations of the ways of Providence in giving light to the
   heathen world through that "nation of priests" in Israel.

   But Lactantius, who uses the Sibyls so freely, should not have omitted
   to show what Sibylline oracles God drew forth from "the princes of this
   world" also, by the illumination of the pharos which he established in
   Sion, "to be a light to lighten the Gentiles" until the great Epiphany
   should rise upon them in "the dayspring from on high."

   I extract from a paradoxical but most entertaining author, whom I have
   often quoted, certain extracts from Philo, which I translate from his
   note in the Soirées. Thus:--

   "Agrippa," says Philo, [1612] "having visited Jerusalem in Herod's
   time, was enchanted by the religion of the Jews, and could never cease
   to speak of it....Augustus ordered that every day, at his own expense,
   and under the legal forms, a bull and two lambs should be offered in
   holocaust to the Most High God on the altar at Jerusalem, though he
   knew that it contained no image, whether exposed or within the veil;
   for this great prince, surpassed by none in the philosophic spirit,
   felt the actual necessity in this world of an altar dedicated to a God
   invisible."

   Philo also says:--

   "Your great-grandmother Julia [1613] also made superb presents to the
   temple; and although women very reluctantly detach themselves from
   images, and rarely conceive of anything apart from sensation, this
   lady, nevertheless, greatly superior to her sex in culture and in
   natural endowments, arrived at that point in which she preferred to
   contemplate such things in the mind rather than in sensible objects,
   regarding these as mere shadows of the realities."

   In the same discourse, wasting words on Caligula, Philo reminds him
   that Augustus "not only admired, nay, rather, he adored (ethau'maze
   kai` prose'kunei, k.t.l.), this custom of employing no sort of image to
   represent, materially, a nature invisible in itself." Poor De Maistre,
   who quotes this testimony against images from Philo with intense
   appreciation, will yet sophisticate himself and others into the very
   contrary in behalf of his one predominant idea of (prosku'nesis) canine
   self-abasement to the decrees of the Vatican. On this account I am
   forced to consider him a sophist as well as a fanatic; but I delight to
   render justice to his genius, for, wherever he talks and reasons as a
   Christian merely, he fascinates and instructs me. He never conceived of
   "Catholicity," and lived under the delusion of the Decretals, a
   disciple of the Jesuits.

      II.

   (Therefore they were neglected for many ages, [155]p. 116.)

   The explicit statements of Lactantius, and his profuse quotations from
   the Sibyllina, persuade me that these curious fragments deserve a
   degree of scientific attention which they have not yet received. The
   Fathers all cite them, when it must have exposed them to scorn and
   overwhelming refutation had their quotations not been found in the
   Sibylline books of their adversaries. The influence of the Jewish
   religion upon the Gentiles under the Babylonian and Medo-Persian
   monarchies must have been considerable, but after Alexander's time it
   was vastly increased. Many versions of select prophets were doubtless
   produced in Greek before the authorized Septuagint. These were soon
   embedded in the Sibyls' books; and I cannot think the interpolations of
   early Christians were all frauds, by any means. Their numerous marginal
   annotations crept into other copies; and very likely, in the time of
   our author, they were inextricably confused with the text in the
   greater part of the "editions," so to speak, then current with
   booksellers.

   But in vol. viii. we shall have occasion to recur again to this
   interesting inquiry.

      III.

   (We made proclamation before him as children, [156]p. 117.)

   "Sicut pueri." This is not according to the Septuagint, hos paidi'on.
   It is not the Vulgate, of course; but its radical difference with that
   raises interesting inquiries: Is it a specimen of one of many African
   or old Italic versions? Does our author endeavour to translate from the
   Septuagint? May he not have had in hand a copy of Isaiah from among
   those which preceded the Septuagint?

   The Septuagint reading finds its key in cap. lii. 7, and in the tenth
   verse, where the "Arm of the Lord" ("His Holy Arm") is introduced as
   the personal Logos Incarnate. The thirteenth and fourteenth verses
   predict the amazing sequel, and its practical and blessed results; and
   then begins cap. liii., "Who hath believed" our message. To whom is
   "the Arm of the Lord" revealed? "Going before Him (i.e., as heralds),
   we have proclaimed Him as a child, and, as it were, a root in a thirsty
   land; He has no form nor glory," etc. In other words, "We have
   prophesied of Him who is elsewhere predicted ("unto us a child is
   born") as one who from His childhood is as a rush without
   water,--prematurely withered,--a man of sorrows, and the Carpenter's
   Son."

   It does not hint, therefore, the "obscurity" of the Messiah's birth,
   but rather what Irenæus insists upon, i.e., His (premature) old age;
   the worn and stricken appearance of senility in comparative youth.
   [1614] This is just what the messengers (Isa. lii. 7) had said in their
   proclamation (Isa. lii. 14) just before: "His visage was so marred more
   than any man, and His form more than the sons of men."

      IV.

   (There was darkness, etc., pp. [157]122, [158]240.)

   In former instances, where thought has turned to Phlegon the Trallian,
   [1615] I have failed to refer to an author whose excess of candour
   sometimes gives away more than is called for, in questions on which
   adversaries have contrived to fasten undue importance, in order to
   elicit indiscreet defences. But it is due to my readers that I should
   refer them to a most learned work, to be found in public libraries
   only, by my revered friend and instructor Dr. Jarvis. The sixth chapter
   (part ii.) of his Chronological Introduction to Church History [1616]
   is devoted to this matter, and I can do no better than give the summary
   of its contents as follows:--

   "Who Phlegon was; his work lost; extracts from it by Julius Africanus
   and Eusebius; their works, containing these extracts, lost; all we know
   is from versions and later writers; collation of extracts as given by
   the Armenian version of the Chronicon of Eusebius, St. Jerome's Latin
   version, the Chronographia of Syncellus, and the Chronicon Paschale;
   extract by Syncellus from Julius Africanus; remarks upon it; testimony
   of Origen concerning Phlegon's account; of John Philoponus (St.
   Maximus) Malala; summary of the whole; account of Phlegon's testimony;
   not noticed by the learned and voluminous writers of the fourth and
   fifth centuries when they speak of the darkness, etc.; Dr. Lardner's
   judgment [1617] adopted."

   Lardner's view, it will be observed, is thus sustained by an
   independent and most competent critic. This decision puts honour on the
   early writers: he thinks they were unwilling to claim a corroboration
   from evidence about which they were not well assured.

      V.

   (Divine and ethnic oracles, p. 210, note 2; p. 112, note 9.)

   The whole subject of ethnic oracles needs fresh study and illustration.
   Nothing would be more fascinating in theological inquiry, and Divine
   Inspiration might be richly illustrated by it, as anatomical science is
   clarified by "comparative anatomy." I commend this subject to men of
   faith, learning, and intellectual vigour. Notably, let it be observed:
   (1) That Balaam's ass is instanced by St. Peter as miraculously enabled
   to rebuke the madness of his master; and the same Apostle shortly
   before gives us the law as to divine inspiration in contrast. [1618]
   (2) Balaam himself, as mechanically as the beast he rode, [1619] had
   his own mouth opened (see Num. xxiv. 16-19). (3) The wicked Caiaphas in
   like manner (St. John xi. 51, 52) spoke prophetically, "not of
   himself." (4) St. Paul (Acts xvii. 28) quotes a heathen oracle very
   much as does our author. [1620] Now, in view of the boldness with which
   the early Christians follow the example of the Apostle in quoting the
   Orphica and Sibyllina, I cannot imagine that these citations were not
   honestly believed by them to be oracles of a certain sort, by which God
   permitted the heathen to be enlightened. [1621] Observe our author's
   moderate but most pregnant remark about such inspiration (on p. 170,
   supra, note 8), "almost with a divine voice;" then (on [159]p. 192)
   compare other almost inspired words of poor Tully (at note 2), and of
   Seneca also. [1622]

   Finally, and to close the subject, the reader will readily forgive me
   for introducing the following citations from the "Warburton Lecture" of
   Dr. Edersheim, on Prophecy and History [1623] in Relation to the
   Messiah Discussing the pseudepigraphic writings (in Lecture Eleventh),
   he says as follows: [1624] --

   "The Sibylline oracles, in Greek hexameters, consist, in their present
   form, of twelve books. They are full of interpolations, the really
   ancient portions forming part of the first two books and the largest
   part of book third (verses 97-807). These sections are deeply imbued
   with the Messianic spirit. [1625] They date from about the year 140
   before our era, while another small portion of the same book is
   supposed to date from the year 32 b.c.

   "As regards the promise of the Messiah, we turn in the first place, and
   with special interest, to the Sibylline Oracles. In the third book of
   these (such portions as I shall quote date from about 140 b.c.) the
   Messiah is described as the King sent from heaven, who would judge
   every man in blood and splendour of fire.' And the Vision of Messianic
   times opens with a reference to the King whom God will send from the
   Sun,' where we cannot fail to perceive a reference to the
   Seventy-second Psalm, [1626] especially as we remember that the Greek
   of the Seventy, which must have been present to the Hellenist Sibyl,
   fully adapted the Messianic application of the passage to a premundane
   Messiah. We also think of the picture drawn in the prophecies of
   Isaiah. According to the Sibylline books, King Messiah was not only to
   come, but He was to be specifically sent of God. He is supermundane, a
   King and a Judge [1627] of superhuman glory and splendour. And, indeed,
   that a superhuman kingdom, such as the Sibylline oracles paint, should
   have a superhuman king, seems only a natural and necessary
   inference....If, as certain modern critics contend, the book of Daniel
   is not authentic, [1628] but dates from Maccabean times, ...it may well
   be asked to what king the Sibylline oracles point, for they certainly
   date from that period; and what is the relationship between the
   (supposed Maccabean) prophecies of the book of Daniel and the certainly
   Messianic anticipations of the undoubted literature of that period?"

   Dr. Edersheim gives us the reference in the margin, to which I would
   call attention, as directing to the whole pseudepigraphic literature.
   [1629] But who can wonder, after what we thus learn, that Constantine
   [1630] was so profoundly impressed with Virgil's Pollio? In spite of
   all that has been said, [1631] I cannot but see Isaiah in its entire
   spirit.

A Treatise on the Anger of God

    Chap. I.--Of Divine and Human Wisdom.

   I have often observed, Donatus, that many persons hold this opinion,
   which some philosophers also have maintained, that God is not subject
   to anger; since the divine nature is either altogether beneficent, and
   that it is inconsistent with His surpassing and excellent power to do
   injury to any one; or, at any rate, He takes no notice of us at all, so
   that no advantage comes to us from His goodness, and no evil from His
   ill-will. But the error of these men, because it is very great, and
   tends to overthrow the condition of human life, must be refuted by us,
   lest you yourself also should be deceived, being incited by the
   authority of men who deem themselves wise. Nor, however, are we so
   arrogant as to boast that the truth is comprehended by our intellect;
   but we follow the teaching of God, who alone is able to know and to
   reveal secret things. But the philosophers, being destitute of this
   teaching, have imagined that the nature of things can be ascertained by
   conjecture. But this is impossible; because the mind of man, enclosed
   in the dark abode of the body, is far removed from the perception of
   truth: and in this the divine nature differs from the human, that
   ignorance is the property of the human, knowledge of the divine nature.

   On which account we have need of some light to dispel the darkness by
   which the reflection of man is overspread, since, while we live in
   mortal flesh, we are unable to divine by our senses. But the light of
   the human mind is God, and he who has known and admitted Him into his
   breast will acknowledge the mystery of the truth with an enlightened
   heart; but when God and heavenly instruction are removed, all things
   are full of errors. And Socrates, though he was the most learned of all
   the philosophers, yet, that he might prove the ignorance of the others,
   who thought that they possessed something, rightly said that he knew
   nothing, except one thing--that he knew nothing. For he understood that
   that learning had nothing certain, nothing true in itself; nor, as some
   imagine, did he pretend [1633] to learning that he might refute others,
   but he saw the truth in some measure. And he testified even on his
   trial (as is related by Plato) that there was no human wisdom. He so
   despised, derided, and cast aside the learning in which the
   philosophers then boasted, that he professed that very thing as the
   greatest learning, that he had learnt that he knew nothing. If,
   therefore, there is no human wisdom, as Socrates taught, as Plato
   handed down, it is evident that the knowledge of the truth is divine,
   and belongs to no other than to God. Therefore God must be known, in
   whom alone is the truth. He is the Parent of the world, and the Framer
   of all things; who is not seen with the eyes, and is scarcely
   distinguished by the mind; whose religion is accustomed to be attacked
   in many ways by those who have neither been able to attain true wisdom,
   nor to comprehend the system of the great and heavenly secret.

    Chap. II.--Of the Truth and Its Steps, and of God.

   For since there are many steps by which the ascent is made to the abode
   of truth, it is not easy for any one to reach the summit. For when the
   eyes are darkened by the brightness of the truth, they who are unable
   to maintain a firm step fall back to the level ground. [1634] Now the
   first step is to understand false religions, and to throw aside the
   impious worship of gods which are made by the hand of man. But the
   second step is to perceive with the mind that there is but one Supreme
   God, whose power and providence made the world from the beginning, and
   afterwards continues to govern it. The third step is to know His
   Servant and Messenger, [1635] whom He sent as His ambassador to the
   earth, by whose teaching being freed from the error in which we were
   held entangled, and formed to the worship of the true God, we might
   learn righteousness. From all of these steps, as I have said, there is
   a rapid and easy gliding to a downfall, [1636] unless the feet are
   firmly planted with unshaken stedfastness.

   We see those shaken off from the first step, who, though they
   understand things which are false, do not, however, discover that which
   is true; and though they despised earthly and frail images, do not
   betake themselves to the worship of God, of whom they are ignorant. But
   viewing with admiration the elements of the universe, they worship the
   heaven, the earth, the sea, the sun, the moon, and the other heavenly
   bodies.

   But we have already reproved their ignorance in the second book of the
   Divine Institutes. [1637] But we say that those fall from the second
   step, who, though they understand that there is but one Supreme God,
   nevertheless, ensnared by the philosophers, and captivated by false
   arguments, entertain opinions concerning that excellent majesty far
   removed from the truth; who either deny that God has any figure, or
   think that He is moved by no affection, because every affection is a
   sign of weakness, which has no existence in God. But they are
   precipitated from the third step, who, though they know the Ambassador
   of God, who is also the Builder of the divine and immortal temple,
   [1638] either do not receive Him, or receive Him otherwise than faith
   demands; whom we have partly refuted in the fourth book of the
   above-named work. [1639] And we will hereafter refute more carefully,
   when we shall begin to reply to all the sects, which, while they
   dispute, [1640] have destroyed the truth.

   But now we will argue against those who, falling from the second step,
   entertain wrong sentiments respecting the Supreme God. For some say
   that He neither does a kindness to any one, nor becomes angry, but in
   security and quietness enjoys the advantages of His own immortality.
   Others, indeed, take away anger, but leave to God kindness; for they
   think that a nature excelling in the greatest virtue, while it ought
   not to be malevolent, ought also to be benevolent. Thus all the
   philosophers are agreed on the subject of anger, but are at variance
   respecting kindness. But, that my speech may descend in order to the
   proposed subject, a division of this kind must be made and followed by
   me, since anger and kindness are different, and opposed to one another.
   Either anger must be attributed to God, and kindness taken from Him; or
   both alike must be taken from Him; or anger must be taken away, and
   kindness attributed to Him; or neither must be taken away. The nature
   of the case admits of nothing else besides these; so that the truth,
   which is sought for, must necessarily be found in some one of these.
   Let us consider them separately, that reason and arrangement may
   conduct us to the hiding-place of truth.

    Chap. III.--Of the Good and Evil Things in Human Affairs, and of Their
    Author.

   First, no one ever said this respecting God, that He is only subject to
   anger, and is not influenced by kindness. For it is unsuitable to God,
   that He should be endowed with a power of this kind, by which He may
   injure and do harm, but be unable to profit and to do good. What means,
   therefore, what hope of safety, is proposed to men, if God is the
   author of evils only? For if this is so, that venerable majesty will
   now be drawn out, not to the power of the judge, to whom it is
   permitted to preserve and set at liberty, but to the office of the
   torturer and executioner. But whereas we see that there are not only
   evils in human affairs, but also goods, it is plain that if God is the
   author of evils, there must be another who does things contrary to God,
   and gives to us good things. If there is such a one, by what name must
   he be called? Why is he who injures us more known to us than He who
   benefits us? But if this can be nothing besides God, it is absurd and
   vain to suppose that the divine power, than which nothing is greater or
   better, is able to injure, but unable to benefit; and accordingly no
   one has ever existed who ventured to assert this, because it is neither
   reasonable nor in any way credible. And because this is agreed upon,
   let us pass on and seek after the truth elsewhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. IV.--Of God and His Affections, and the Censure of Epicurus.

   That which follows is concerning the school of Epicurus; that as there
   is no anger in God, so indeed there is no kindness. For when Epicurus
   thought that it was inconsistent with God to injure and to inflict
   harm, which for the most part arises from the affection of anger, he
   took away from Him beneficence also, since he saw that it followed that
   if God has anger, He must also have kindness. Therefore, lest he should
   concede to Him a vice, he deprived Him also of virtue. [1641] From
   this, he says, He is happy and uncorrupted, because He cares about
   nothing, and neither takes trouble Himself nor occasions it to another.
   Therefore He is not God, if He is neither moved, which is peculiar to a
   living being, nor does anything impossible for man, which is peculiar
   to God, if He has no will at all, no action, in short, no
   administration, which is worthy of God. And what greater, what more
   worthy administration can be attributed to God, than the government of
   the world, and especially of the human race, to which all earthly
   things are subject?

   What happiness, then, can there be in God, if He is always inactive,
   being at rest and unmoveable? if He is deaf to those who pray to Him,
   and blind to His worshippers? What is so worthy of God, and so
   befitting to Him, as providence? But if He cares for nothing, and
   foresees nothing, He has lost all His divinity. What else does he say,
   who takes from God all power and all substance, except that there is no
   God at all? In short, Marcus Tullius relates that it was said by
   Posidonius, [1642] that Epicurus understood that there were no gods,
   but that he said those things which he spoke respecting the gods for
   the sake of driving away odium; and so that he leaves the gods in
   words, but takes them away in reality, since he gives them no motion,
   no office. But if this is so, what can be more deceitful than him? And
   this ought to be foreign to the character of a wise and weighty man.
   But if he understood one thing and spoke another, what else is he to be
   called than a deceiver, double-tongued, wicked, and moreover foolish?
   But Epicurus was not so crafty as to say those things with the desire
   of deceiving, when he consigned these things also by his writings to
   everlasting remembrance; but he erred through ignorance of the truth.
   For, being led from the beginning by the probability [1643] of a single
   opinion, he necessarily fell into those things which followed. For the
   first opinion was, that anger was not consistent with the character of
   God. And when this appeared to him to be true and unassailable, [1644]
   he was unable to refuse the consequences; because one affection being
   removed, necessity itself compelled him to remove from God the other
   affections also. Thus, he who is not subject to anger is plainly
   uninfluenced by kindness, which is the opposite feeling to anger. Now,
   if there is neither anger nor kindness in Him, it is manifest that
   there is neither fear, nor joy, nor grief, nor pity. For all the
   affections have one system, one motion, [1645] which cannot be the case
   with God. But if there is no affection in God, because whatever is
   subject to affections is weak, it follows that there is in Him neither
   the care of anything, nor providence.

   The disputation of the wise man [1646] extends thus far: he was silent
   as to the other things which follow; namely, that because there is in
   Him neither care nor providence, therefore there is no reflection nor
   any perception in Him, by which it is effected that He has no existence
   at all. Thus, when he had gradually descended, he remained on the last
   step, because he now saw the precipice. But what does it avail to have
   remained silent, and concealed the danger? Necessity compelled him even
   against his will to fall. For he said that which he did not mean,
   because he so arranged his argument that he necessarily came to that
   point which he wished to avoid. You see, therefore, to what point he
   comes, when anger is removed and taken away from God. In short, either
   no one believes that, or a very few, and they the guilty and the
   wicked, who hope for impunity for their sins. But if this also is found
   to be false, that there is neither anger nor kindness in God, let us
   come to that which is put in the third place.

    Chap. V.--The Opinion of the Stoics Concerning God; Of His Anger and
    Kindness.

   The Stoics and some others are supposed to have entertained much better
   sentiments respecting the divine nature, who say that there is kindness
   in God, but not anger. A very pleasing and popular speech, that God is
   not subject to such littleness of mind as to imagine that He is injured
   by any one, since it is impossible for Him to be injured; so that that
   serene and holy majesty is excited, disturbed, and maddened, which is
   the part of human frailty. For they say that anger is a commotion and
   perturbation of the mind, which is inconsistent with God. Since, when
   it falls upon the mind of any one, as a violent tempest it excites such
   waves that it changes the condition of the mind, the eyes gleam, the
   countenance trembles, the tongue stammers, the teeth chatter, the
   countenance is alternately stained now with redness spread over it, now
   with white paleness. But if anger is unbecoming to a man, provided he
   be of wisdom and authority, how much more is so foul a change
   unbecoming to God! And if man, when he has authority and power,
   inflicts widespread injury through anger, sheds blood, overthrows
   cities, destroys communities, reduces provinces to desolation, how much
   more is it to be believed that God, since He has power over the whole
   human race, and over the universe itself, would have been about to
   destroy all things if He were angry.

   Therefore they think that so great and so pernicious an evil ought to
   be absent from Him. And if anger and excitement are absent from Him,
   because it is disfiguring and injurious, and He inflicts injury on no
   one, they think that nothing else remains, except that He is mild,
   calm, propitious, beneficent, the preserver. For thus at length He may
   be called the common Father of all, and the best and greatest, which
   His divine and heavenly nature demands. For if among men it appears
   praiseworthy to do good rather than to injure, to restore to life
   [1647] rather than to kill, to save rather than to destroy, and
   innocence is not undeservedly numbered among the virtues,--and he who
   does these things is loved, esteemed, honoured, and celebrated with all
   blessings and vows,--in short, on account of his deserts and benefits
   is judged to be most like to God; how much more right is it that God
   Himself, who excels in divine and perfect virtues, and who is removed
   from all earthly taint, should conciliate [1648] the whole race of man
   by divine and heavenly benefits! Those things are spoken speciously and
   in a popular manner, and they allure many to believe them; but they who
   entertain these sentiments approach nearer indeed to the truth, but
   they partly fail, not sufficiently considering the nature of the case.
   For if God is not angry with the impious and the unrighteous, it is
   clear that He does not love the pious and the righteous. Therefore the
   error of those is more consistent who take away at once both anger and
   kindness. For in opposite matters it is necessary to be moved to both
   sides or to neither. Thus, he who loves the good also hates the wicked,
   and he who does not hate the wicked does not love the good; because the
   loving of the good arises from the hatred of the wicked, and the hating
   of the wicked has its rise from the love of the good. There is no one
   who loves life without a hatred of death, nor who is desirous of light,
   but he who avoids darkness. These things are so connected by nature,
   that the one cannot exist without the other.

   If any master has in his household a good and a bad servant, it is
   evident that he does not hate them both, or confer upon both benefits
   and honours; for if he does this, he is both unjust and foolish. But he
   addresses the one who is good with friendly words, and honours him and
   sets him over his house and household, and all his affairs; but
   punishes the bad one with reproaches, with stripes, with nakedness,
   with hunger, with thirst, with fetters: so that the latter may be an
   example to others to keep them from sinning, and the former to
   conciliate them; so that fear may restrain some, and honour may excite
   others. He, therefore, who loves also hates, and he who hates also
   loves; for there are those who ought to be loved, and there are those
   who ought to be hated. And as he who loves confers good things on those
   whom he loves, so he who hates inflicts evils upon those whom he hates;
   which argument, because it is true, can in no way be refuted. Therefore
   the opinion of those is vain and false, who, when they attribute the
   one to God, take away the other, not less than the opinion of those who
   take away both. But the latter, [1649] as we have shown, in part do not
   err, but retain that which is the better of the two; whereas the
   former, [1650] led on by the accurate method of their reasoning, fall
   into the greatest error, because they have assumed premises which are
   altogether false. For they ought not to have reasoned thus: Because God
   is not liable to anger, therefore He is not moved by kindness; but in
   this manner: Because God is moved by kindness, therefore He is also
   liable to anger. For if it had been certain and undoubted that God is
   not liable to anger, then the other point would necessarily be arrived
   at. But since the question as to whether God is angry is more open to
   doubt, while it is almost perfectly plain that He is kind, it is absurd
   to wish to subvert that which is certain by means of an uncertainty,
   since it is easier to confirm uncertain things by means of those which
   are certain.

    Chap. VI.--That God is Angry.

   These are the opinions entertained by the philosophers respecting God.
   But if we have discovered that these things which have been spoken are
   false, there remains that one last resource, in which alone the truth
   can be found, which has never been embraced by philosophers, nor at any
   time defended: that it follows that God is angry, since He is moved by
   kindness. This opinion is to be maintained and asserted by us; for
   [1651] this is the sum and turning-point on which the whole of piety
   and religion depend: and no honour can be due to God, if He affords
   nothing to His worshippers; and no fear, if He is not angry with him
   who does not worship Him. [1652]

    Chap. VII.--Of Man, and the Brute Animals, and Religion.

   Though philosophers have often turned aside from reason through their
   ignorance of the truth, and have fallen into inextricable errors (for
   that is wont to happen to these which happens to a traveller ignorant
   of the way, and not confessing that he is ignorant ,--namely, that he
   wanders about, while he is ashamed to inquire from those whom he
   meets), no philosopher, however, has ever made the assertion that there
   is no difference between man and the brutes. Nor has any one at all,
   provided that he wished to appear wise, reduced a rational animal to
   the level of the mute and irrational; which some ignorant persons do,
   resembling the brutes themselves, who, wishing to give themselves up to
   the indulgence of their appetite and pleasure, say that they are born
   on the same principle as all living animals, which it is impious for
   man to say. For who is so unlearned as not to know, who is so void of
   understanding as not to perceive, that there is something divine in
   man? I do not as yet come to the excellences of the soul and of the
   intellect, by which there is a manifest affinity between man and God.
   Does not the position of the body itself, and the fashion of the
   countenance, declare that we are not on a level with the dumb creation?
   Their nature is prostrated to the ground and to their pasture, and has
   nothing in common with the heaven, which they do not look upon. But
   man, with his erect position, with his elevated countenance raised to
   the contemplation of the universe, compares his features with God, and
   reason recognises reason. [1653]

   And on this account there is no animal, as Cicero says, [1654] except
   man, which has any knowledge of God. For he alone is furnished with
   wisdom, so that he alone understands religion; and this is the chief or
   only difference between man and the dumb animals. For the other things
   which appear to be peculiar to man, even if there are not such in the
   dumb animals, nevertheless may appear to be similar. Speech is peculiar
   to man; yet even in these there is a certain resemblance to speech. For
   they both distinguish one another by their voices; and when they are
   angry, they send forth a sound resembling altercation; and when they
   see one another after an interval of time, they show the office of
   congratulation by their voice. To us, indeed, their voices appear
   uncouth, [1655] as ours perhaps do to them; but to themselves, who
   understand one another, they are words. In short, in every affection
   they utter distinct expressions of voice [1656] by which they may show
   their state of mind. Laughter also is peculiar to man; and yet we see
   certain indications of joy in other animals, when they use passionate
   gestures [1657] with a view to sports, hang down [1658] their ears,
   contract their mouth, smooth their forehead, relax their eyes to
   sportiveness. What is so peculiar to man as reason and the foreseeing
   of the future? But there are animals which open several outlets in
   different directions from their lairs, that if any danger comes upon
   them, an escape may be open for them shut in; but they would not do
   this unless they possessed intelligence and reflection. Others are
   provident for the future, as


   "Ants, when they plunder a great heap of corn, mindful of the winter,
   and lay it up in their dwelling;" [1659]

   again,--


   "As bees, which alone know a country and fixed abodes; and mindful of
   the winter which is to come, they practice labour in the summer, and
   lay up their gains as a common stock." [1660]

   It would be a long task if I should wish to trace out the things most
   resembling the skill of man, which are accustomed to be done by the
   separate tribes of animals. But if, in the case of all these things
   which are wont to be ascribed to man, there is found to be some
   resemblance even in the dumb animals, it is evident that religion is
   the only thing of which no trace can be found in the dumb animals, nor
   any indication. For justice is peculiar to religion, and to this no
   other animal attains. For man alone bears rule; the other animals are
   subjected [1661] to him. But the worship of God is ascribed to justice;
   and he who does not embrace this, being far removed from the nature of
   man, will live the life of the brutes under the form of man. But since
   we differ from the other animals almost in this respect alone, that we
   alone of all perceive the divine might and power, while in the others
   there is no understanding of God, it is surely impossible that in this
   respect either the dumb animals should have more wisdom, or human
   nature should be unwise, since all living creatures, and the whole
   system of nature, are subject to man on account of his wisdom.
   Wherefore if reason, if the force of man in this respect, excels and
   surpasses the rest of living creatures, inasmuch as he alone is capable
   of the knowledge of God, it is evident that religion can in no way be
   overthrown.

    Chap. VIII.--Of Religion.

   But religion is overthrown if we believe Epicurus speaking thus:--


   "For the nature of gods must ever in itself of necessity enjoy
   immortality together with supreme repose, far removed and withdrawn
   from our concerns; since, exempt from every pain, exempt from all
   dangers, strong in its own resources, not wanting aught of us, it is
   neither gained by favours nor moved by anger." [1662]

   Now, when he says these things, does he think that any worship is to be
   paid to God, or does he entirely overthrow religion? For if God confers
   nothing good on any one, if He repays the obedience of His worshipper
   with no favour, what is so senseless, what so foolish, as to build
   temples, to offer sacrifices, to present gifts, to diminish our
   property, that we may obtain nothing? [1663] But (it will be said) it
   is right that an excellent nature should be honoured. What honour can
   be due to a being who pays no regard to us, and is ungrateful? Can we
   be bound in any manner to him who has nothing in common with us?
   "Farewell to God," says Cicero, [1664] "if He is such as to be
   influenced by no favour, and by no affection of men. For why should I
   say 'may He be propitious? ' for He can be propitious to no one." What
   can be spoken more contemptible with respect to God? Farewell to Him,
   he says, that is, let Him depart and retire, since He is able to profit
   no one. But if God takes no trouble, nor occasions trouble to another,
   why then should we not commit crimes as often as it shall be in our
   power to escape the notice of men [1665] and to cheat the public laws?
   Wherever we shall obtain a favourable opportunity of escaping notice,
   let us take advantage of the occasion: let us take away the property of
   others, either without bloodshed or even with blood, if there is
   nothing else besides the laws to be reverenced.

   While Epicurus entertains these sentiments, he altogether destroys
   religion; and when this is taken away, confusion and perturbation of
   life will follow. But if religion cannot be taken away without
   destroying our hold of wisdom, by which we are separated from the
   brutes, and of justice, by which the public life may be more secure,
   how can religion itself be maintained or guarded without fear? For that
   which is not feared is despised, and that which is despised is plainly
   not reverenced. Thus it comes to pass that religion, and majesty, and
   honour exist together with fear; but there is no fear where no one is
   angry. Whether, therefore, you take away from God kindness, or anger,
   or both, religion must be taken away, without which the life of men is
   full of folly, of wickedness, and enormity. For conscience greatly
   curbs men, if we believe that we are living in the sight of God; if we
   imagine not only that the actions which we perform are seen from above,
   but also that our thoughts and our words are heard by God. But it is
   profitable to believe this, as some imagine, not for the sake of the
   truth, but of utility, since laws cannot punish conscience unless some
   terror from above hangs over to restrain offences. Therefore religion
   is altogether false, and there is no divinity; but all things are made
   up by skilful men, in order that they may live more uprightly and
   innocently. This is a great question, and foreign to the subject which
   we have proposed; but because it necessarily occurs, it ought to be
   handled, however briefly.

    Chap. IX.--Of the Providence of God, and of Opinions Opposed to It.

   When the philosophers of former times had agreed in their opinions
   respecting providence, and there was no doubt but that the world was
   set in order by God and reason, and was governed by reason, Protagoras,
   in the times of Socrates, was the first of all who said that it was not
   clear to him whether there was any divinity or not. And this
   disputation of his was judged so impious, and so contrary to the truth
   and to religion, that the Athenians both banished him from their
   territories, and burnt in a public assembly those books of his in which
   these statements were contained. But there is no need to speak
   respecting his opinions, because he pronounced nothing certain. After
   these things Socrates and his disciple Plato, and those who flowed
   forth from the school of Plato like rivulets into different directions,
   namely, the Stoics and Peripatetics, were of the same opinion as those
   who went before them. [1666]

   Afterwards Epicurus said that there was indeed a God, because it was
   necessary that there should be in the world some being of surpassing
   excellence, distinction, and blessedness; yet that there was no
   providence, and thus that the world itself was ordered by no plan, nor
   art, nor workmanship, but that the universe was made up of certain
   minute and indivisible seeds. But I do not see what can be said more
   repugnant to the truth. For if there is a God, as God He is manifestly
   provident; nor can divinity be attributed to Him in any other way than
   if He retains the past, and knows the present, and foresees the future.
   Therefore, in taking away providence, he also denied the existence of
   God. But when he openly acknowledged the existence of God, at the same
   time he also admitted His providence for the one cannot exist at all,
   or be understood, without the other. But in those later times in which
   philosophy had now lost its vigour [1667] there lived a certain
   Diagoras of Melos, [1668] who altogether denied the existence of God,
   and on account of this sentiment was called atheist; [1669] also
   Theodorus [1670] of Cyrene: both of whom, because they were unable to
   discover anything new, all things having already been said and found
   out, preferred even, in opposition to the truth, to deny that in which
   all preceding philosophers had agreed without any ambiguity. These are
   they who attacked providence, which had been asserted and defended
   through so many ages by so many intellects. What then? Shall we refute
   those trifling and inactive philosophers by reason, or by the authority
   of distinguished men, or rather by both? But we must hasten onwards,
   lest our speech should wander too far from our subject.

    Chap. X.--Of the Origin of the World, and the Nature of Affairs, and the
    Providence of God.

   They who do not admit that the world was made by divine providence,
   either say that it is composed of first principles coming together at
   random, or that it suddenly came into existence by nature, but hold, as
   Straton [1671] does, that nature has in itself the power of production
   and of diminution, but that it has neither sensibility nor figure, so
   that we may understand that all things were produced spontaneously,
   without any artificer or author. Each opinion is vain and impossible.
   But this happens to those who are ignorant of the truth, that they
   devise anything, rather than perceive that which the nature of the
   subject [1672] requires. First of all, with respect to those minute
   seeds, by the meeting together of which they say that the whole world
   came into existence, [1673] I ask where or whence they are. Who has
   seen them at any time? Who has perceived them? Who has heard them? Had
   none but Leucippus [1674] eyes? Had he alone a mind, who assuredly
   alone of all men was blind and senseless, since he spoke those things
   which no sick man could have uttered in his ravings, [1675] or one
   asleep in his dreams?

   The ancient philosophers argued that all things were made up of four
   elements. [1676] He would not admit this, lest he should appear to
   tread in the footsteps of others; but he held that there were other
   first principles of the elements themselves, which can neither be seen,
   nor touched, nor be perceived by any part of the body. They are so
   minute, he says, that there is no edge of a sword so fine that they can
   be cut and divided by it. From which circumstance he gave them the name
   of atoms. But it occurred to him, that if they all had one and the same
   nature, they could not make up different objects of so great a variety
   as we see to be present in the world. He said, therefore, that there
   were smooth and rough ones, and round, and angular, and hooked. How
   much better had it been to be silent, than to have a tongue for such
   miserable and empty uses! And, indeed, I fear lest he who thinks these
   things worthy of refutation, should appear no less to rave. Let us,
   however, reply as to one who says something. [1677] If they are soft
   [1678] and round, it is plain that they cannot lay hold of one another,
   so as to make some body; as, though any one should wish to bind
   together millet into one combination, [1679] the very softness of the
   grains would not permit them to come together into a mass. If they are
   rough, and angular, and hooked, so that they may be able to cohere,
   then they are divisible, and capable of being cut; for hooks and angles
   must project, [1680] so that they may possibly be cut off.

   Therefore that which is able to be cut off and torn away, will be able
   both to be seen and held. "These," he says, "flutter about with
   restless motions through empty space, and are carried hither and
   thither, just as we see little particles of dust in the sun when it has
   introduced its rays and light through a window. From these there arise
   trees and herbs, and all fruits of the earth; from these, animals, and
   water, and fire, and all things are produced, and are again resolved
   into the same elements." This can be borne as long as the inquiry is
   respecting small matters. Even the world itself was made up of these.
   He has reached to the full extent of perfect madness: it seems
   impossible that anything further should be said, and yet he found
   something to add. "Since everything," he says, "is infinite, and
   nothing can be empty, it follows of necessity that there are
   innumerable worlds." What force of atoms had been so great, that masses
   so incalculable should be collected from such minute elements? And
   first of all I ask, What is the nature or origin of those seeds? For if
   all things are from them, whence shall we say that they themselves are?
   What nature supplied such an abundance of matter for the making of
   innumerable worlds? But let us grant that he raved with impunity
   concerning worlds; let us speak respecting this in which we are, and
   which we see. He says that all things are made from minute bodies which
   are incapable of division.

   If this were so, no object would ever need the seed of its own kind.
   Birds would be born without eggs, or eggs without bringing forth;
   likewise the rest of the living creatures without coition: trees and
   the productions of the earth would not have their own seeds, which we
   daily handle and sow. Why does a corn-field arise from grain, and again
   grain from a corn-field? In short, if the meeting together and
   collecting of atoms would effect all things, all things would grow
   together in the air, since atoms flutter about through empty space. Why
   cannot the herb, why cannot the tree or grain, arise or be increased
   without earth, without roots, without moisture, without seed? From
   which it is evident that nothing is made up from atoms, since
   everything has its own peculiar and fixed nature, its own seed, its own
   law given from the beginning. Finally, Lucretius, as though forgetful
   of atoms, [1681] which he was maintaining, in order that he might
   refute those who say that all things are produced from nothing,
   employed these arguments, which might have weighed against himself. For
   he thus spoke:--


   "If things came from nothing, any kind might be born of anything;
   nothing would require seed." [1682]

   Likewise afterwards:--


   "We must admit, therefore, that nothing can come from nothing, since
   things require seed before they can severally be born, and be brought
   out into the buxom fields of air." [1683]

   Who would imagine that he had brain when he said these things, and did
   not see that they were contrary to one another? For that nothing is
   made by means of atoms, is apparent from this, that everything has a
   definite [1684] seed, unless by chance we shall believe that the nature
   both of fire and water is derived from atoms. Why should I say, that if
   materials of the greatest hardness are struck together with a violent
   blow, fire is struck out? Are atoms concealed in the steel, or in the
   flint? Who shut them in? Or why do they not leap forth spontaneously?
   Or how could the seeds of fire remain in a material of the greatest
   coldness?

   I leave the subject of the flint and steel. If you hold in the sun an
   orb of crystal filled with water, fire is kindled from the light which
   is reflected from the water, even in the most severe cold. Must we then
   believe that fire is contained in the water? And yet fire cannot be
   kindled from the sun even in summer. If you shall breathe upon wax, or
   if a light vapour shall touch anything--either the hard surface [1685]
   of marble or a plate of metal--water is gradually condensed by means of
   the most minute drops. Also from the exhalation of the earth or sea
   mist is formed, which either, being dispersed, moistens whatever it has
   covered, or being collected, is carried aloft by the wind to high
   mountains, and compressed into cloud, and sends down great rains.
   Where, then, do we say that fluids are produced? Is it in the vapour?
   Or in the exhalation? Or in the wind? But nothing can be formed in that
   which is neither touched nor seen. Why should I speak of animals, in
   whose bodies we see nothing formed without plan, without arrangement,
   without utility, without beauty, so that the most skilful and careful
   marking out [1686] of all the parts and members repels the idea of
   accident and chance? But let us suppose it possible that the limbs, and
   bones, and nerves, and blood should be made up of atoms. What of the
   senses, the reflection, the memory, the mind, the natural capacity:
   from what seeds can they be compacted? [1687] He says, From the most
   minute. There are therefore others of greater size. How, then, are they
   indivisible?

   In the next place, if the things which are not seen are formed from
   invisible seeds, it follows that those which are seen are from visible
   seeds. Why, then, does no one see them? But whether any one regards the
   invisible parts which are in man, or the parts which can be touched,
   and which are visible, who does not see that both parts exist in
   accordance with design? [1688] How, then, can bodies which meet
   together without design effect anything reasonable? [1689] For we see
   that there is nothing in the whole world which has not in itself very
   great and wonderful design. And since this is above the sense and
   capacity of man, to what can it be more rightly attributed than to the
   divine providence? If a statue, the resemblance of man, is made by the
   exercise of design and art, shall we suppose that man himself is made
   up of fragments which come together at random? And what resemblance to
   the truth is there in the thing produced, [1690] when the greatest and
   most surpassing skill [1691] can imitate nothing more than the mere
   outline and extreme lineaments [1692] of the body? Was the skill of man
   able to give to his production any motion or sensibility? I say nothing
   of the exercise of the sight, of hearing, and of smelling, and the
   wonderful uses of the other members, either those which are in sight or
   those which are hidden from view. What artificer could have fabricated
   either the heart of man, or the voice, or his very wisdom? Does any man
   of sound mind, therefore, think that that which man cannot do by reason
   and judgment, may be accomplished by a meeting together of atoms
   everywhere adhering to each other? You see into what foolish ravings
   they have fallen, while they are unwilling to assign to God the making
   and the care of all things

   Let us, however, concede to them that the things which are earthly are
   made from atoms: are the things also which are heavenly? They say that
   the gods are without contamination, eternal, and blessed; and they
   grant to them alone an exemption, so that they do not appear to be made
   up of a meeting together of atoms. For if the gods also had been made
   up of these, they would be liable to be dispersed, the seeds at length
   being resolved, and returning to their own nature. Therefore, if there
   is something which the atoms could not produce, why may we not judge in
   the same way of the others? But I ask why the gods did not build for
   themselves a dwelling-place before those first elements produced the
   world? It is manifest that, unless the atoms had come together and made
   the heaven, the gods would still be suspended through the midst of
   empty space. By what counsel, then, by what plan, did the atoms from a
   confused mass collect themselves, so that from some the earth below was
   formed into a globe, and the heaven stretched out above, adorned with
   so great a variety of constellations that nothing can be conceived more
   embellished? Can he, therefore, who sees such and so great objects,
   imagine that they were made without any design, without any providence,
   without any divine intelligence, but that such great and wonderful
   things arose out of fine and minute atoms? Does it not resemble a
   prodigy, that there should be any human being who might say these
   things, or that there should be those who might believe them--as
   Democritus, who was his hearer, or Epicurus, to whom all folly flowed
   forth from the fountain of Leucippus? But, as others say, the world was
   made by Nature, which is without perception and figure. [1693] But this
   is much more absurd. If Nature made the world, it must have made it by
   judgment and intelligence; for it is he that makes something who has
   either the inclination to make it, or knowledge. If nature is without
   perception and figure, how can that be made by it which has both
   perception and figure, unless by chance any one thinks that the fabric
   of animals, which is so delicate, could have been formed and animated
   by that which is without perception, or that that figure of heaven,
   which is prepared with such foresight for the uses of living beings,
   suddenly came into existence by some accident or other, without a
   builder, without an artificer? [1694]

   "If there is anything," says Chrysippus, "which effects those things
   which man, though he is endowed with reason, cannot do, that assuredly
   is greater, and stronger, and wiser than man." But man cannot make
   heavenly things; therefore that which shall produce or has produced
   these things surpasses man in art, in design, in skill, and in power.
   Who, therefore, can it be but God? But Nature, which they suppose to
   be, as it were, the mother of all things, if it has not a mind, will
   effect nothing, will contrive nothing; for where there is no reflection
   there is neither motion nor efficacy. But if it uses counsel for the
   commencement of anything, reason for its arrangement, art for its
   accomplishment, energy for its consummation, and power to govern and
   control, why should it be called Nature rather than God? Or if a
   concourse of atoms, or Nature without mind, made those things which we
   see, I ask why it was able to make the heaven, but unable to make a
   city or a house? [1695] Why it made mountains of marble, but did not
   make columns and statues? But ought not atoms to have come together to
   effect these things, since they leave no position untried? For
   concerning Nature, which has no mind, it is no wonder that it forgot to
   do these things. What, then, is the case? It is plain that God, when He
   commenced this work of the world,--than which nothing can be better
   arranged with respect to order, nor more befitting as to utility, nor
   more adorned as to beauty, nor greater as to bulk,--Himself made the
   things which could not be made by man; and among these also man
   himself, to whom He gave a portion of His own wisdom, and furnished him
   with reason, as much as earthly frailty was capable of receiving, that
   he might make for himself the things which were necessary for his own
   uses.

   But if in the commonwealth of this world, so to speak, there is no
   providence which rules, no God who administers, no sense at all
   prevails in this nature of things. From what source therefore will it
   be believed that the human mind, with its skill and its intelligence,
   had its origin? For if the body of man was made from the ground, from
   which circumstance man received his name; [1696] it follows that the
   soul, which has intelligence, and is the ruler of the body, which the
   limbs obey as a king and commander, which can neither be looked upon
   nor comprehended, could not have come to man except from a wise nature.
   But as mind and soul govern everybody, so also does God govern the
   world. For it is not probable that lesser and humble things bear rule,
   but that greater and highest things do not bear rule. In short, Marcus
   Cicero, in his Tusculan Disputations, [1697] and in his Consolation,
   says: "No origin of souls can be found on earth. For there is nothing,
   he says, mixed and compound [1698] in souls, or which may appear to be
   produced and made up from the earth; nothing moist or airy, [1699] or
   of the nature of fire. For in these natures there is nothing which has
   the force of memory, of mind and reflection, which both retains the
   past and foresees the future, and is able to comprise the present;
   which things alone are divine. For no source will ever be found from
   which they are able to come to man, unless it be from God." Since,
   therefore, with the exception of two or three vain calumniators, it is
   agreed upon that the world is governed by providence, as also it was
   made, and there is no one who ventures to prefer the opinion of
   Diagoras and Theodorus, or the empty fiction of Leucippus, or the
   levity of Democritus and Epicurus, either to the authority of those
   seven ancient men who were called wise, [1700] or to that of Pythagoras
   or of Socrates or Plato, and the other philosophers who judged that
   there is a providence; therefore that opinion also is false, by which
   they think that religion was instituted by wise men for the sake of
   terror and fear, in order that ignorant men might abstain from sins.

   But if this is true, it follows that we are derided by the wise men of
   old. But if they invented religion for the sake of deceiving us, and
   moreover of deceiving the whole human race, therefore they were not
   wise, because falsehood is not consistent with the character of the
   wise man. But grant that they were wise; what great success in
   falsehood was it, that they were able to deceive not only the
   unlearned, but Plato also, and Socrates, and so easily to delude
   Pythagoras, Zeno, and Aristotle, the chiefs of the greatest sects?
   There is therefore a divine providence, as those men whom I have named
   perceived, by the energy and power of which all things which we see
   were both made and are governed. For so vast a system of things [1701]
   such arrangement and such regularity in preserving the settled orders
   and times, could neither at first have arisen without a provident
   artificer, or have existed so many ages without a powerful inhabitant,
   or have been perpetually governed without a skilful and intelligent
   [1702] ruler; and reason itself declares this. For whatever exists
   which has reason, must have arisen from reason. Now reason is the part
   of an intelligent and wise nature; but a wise and intelligent nature
   can be nothing else than God. Now the world, since it has reason, by
   which it is both governed and kept together, was therefore made by God.
   But if God is the maker and ruler of the world, then religion is
   rightly and truly established; for honour and worship are due to the
   author and common parent of all things.

    Chap. XI.--Of God, and that the One God, and by Whose Providence the World
    is Governed and Exists.

   Since it is agreed upon concerning providence, it follows that we show
   whether it is to be believed that it belongs to many, or rather to one
   only. We have sufficiently taught, as I think, in our Institutions,
   that there cannot be many gods; because, if the divine energy and power
   be distributed among several, it must necessarily be diminished. But
   that which is lessened is plainly mortal; but if He is not mortal, He
   can neither be lessened nor divided. Therefore there is but one God, in
   whom complete energy and power can neither be lessened nor increased.
   But if there are many, while they separately have something of power
   and authority, the sum itself decreases; nor will they separately be
   able to have the whole, which they have in common with others: so much
   will be wanting to each as the others shall possess. There cannot
   therefore be many rulers in this world, nor many masters in one house,
   nor many pilots in one ship, nor many leaders in one herd or flock, nor
   many queens in one swarm. But there could not have been many suns in
   heaven, as there are not several souls in one body; so entirely does
   the whole of nature agree in unity. But if the world


   "Is nourished by a soul,

   A spirit whose celestial flame

   Glows in each member of the frame,

   And stirs the mighty whole," [1703]

   it is evident from the testimony of the poet, that there is one God who
   inhabits the world, since the whole body cannot be inhabited and
   governed except by one mind. Therefore all divine power must be in one
   person, by whose will and command all things are ruled; and therefore
   He is so great, that He cannot be described in words by man, or
   estimated by the senses. From what source, therefore, did the opinion
   or persuasion [1704] respecting many gods come to men? Without doubt,
   all those who are worshipped as gods were men, and were also the
   earliest and greatest kings; but who is ignorant that they were
   invested with divine honours after death, either on account of the
   virtue by which they had profited the race of men, or that they
   obtained immortal memory on account of the benefits and inventions by
   which they had adorned human life? And not only men, but women also.
   And this, both the most ancient writers of Greece, whom they call
   theologi; [1705] and also Roman writers following and imitating the
   Greeks, teach; of whom especially Euhemerus and our Ennius, who point
   out the birthdays, marriages, offspring, governments, exploits, deaths,
   and tombs [1706] of all of them. And Tullius, following them, in his
   third book, On the Nature of the Gods, destroyed the public religions;
   but neither he himself nor any other person was able to introduce the
   true one, of which he was ignorant. And thus he himself testified that
   that which was false was evident; that the truth, however, lay
   concealed. "Would to heaven," he says, "that I could as easily discover
   true things as refute those that are false!" [1707] And this he
   proclaimed not with dissimulation as an Academic, but truly and in
   accordance with the feeling of his mind, because the truth cannot be
   uprooted from human perceptions: that which the foresight of man was
   able to attain to, he attained to, that he might expose false things.
   For whatever is fictitious and false, because it is supported by no
   reason, is easily destroyed. There is therefore one God, the source and
   origin of all things, as Plato both felt and taught in the Timoeus,
   whose majesty he declares to be so great, that it can neither be
   comprehended by the mind nor be expressed by the tongue.

   Hermes bears the same testimony, whom Cicero asserts [1708] to be
   reckoned by the Egyptians among the number of the gods. I speak of him
   who, on account of his excellence and knowledge of many arts, was
   called Trismegistus; and he was far more ancient not only than Plato,
   but than Pythagoras, and those seven wise men. [1709] In Xenophon,
   [1710] Socrates, as he discourses, says that "the form of God ought not
   to be inquired about: "and Plato, in his Book of Laws, [1711] says:
   "What God is, ought not to be the subject of inquiry, because it can
   neither be found out nor related." Pythagoras also admits that there is
   but one God, saying that there is an incorporeal mind, which, being
   diffused and stretched through all nature, gives vital perception to
   all living creatures; but Antisthenes, in his Physics, said that there
   was but one natural God, although the nations and cities have gods of
   their own people. Aristotle, with his followers the Peripatetics, and
   Zeno with his followers the Stoics, say nearly the same things. Truly
   it would be a long task to follow up the opinions of all separately,
   who, although they used different names, nevertheless agreed in one
   power which governed the world. But, however, though philosophers and
   poets, and those, in short, who worship the gods, often acknowledge the
   Supreme God, yet no one ever inquired into, no one discussed, the
   subject of His worship and honours; with that persuasion, in truth,
   with which, always believing Him to be bounteous and incorruptible,
   they think [1712] that He is neither angry with any one, nor stands in
   need of any worship. Thus there can be no religion where there is no
   fear. [1713]

    Chap. XII.--Of Religion and the Fear of God.

   Now, since we have replied to the impious and detestable wisdom, [1714]
   or rather senselessness of some, let us return to our proposed subject.
   We have said that, if religion is taken away, neither wisdom nor
   justice can be retained: wisdom, because the understanding of the
   divine nature, in which we differ from the brutes, is found in man
   alone; justice, because unless God, who cannot be deceived, shall
   restrain our desires, we shall live wickedly and impiously. Therefore,
   that our actions should be viewed by God, pertains not only to the
   usefulness of common life, but even to the truth; because, if religion
   and justice are taken away, having lost our reason, we either descend
   to the senselessness [1715] of the herds; or to the savageness of the
   beasts, yea, even more so, since the beasts spare animals of their own
   kind. What will be more savage, what more unmerciful, than man, if, the
   fear of a superior being taken away, he shall be able either to escape
   the notice of or to despise the might of the laws? It is therefore the
   fear of God alone which guards the mutual society of men, by which life
   itself is sustained, protected, and governed. But that fear is taken
   away if man is persuaded that God is without anger; for that He is
   moved and indignant when unjust actions are done, not only the common
   advantage, but even reason itself, and truth, persuade us. We must
   again return to the former subjects, that, as we have taught that the
   world was made by God, we may teach why it was made.

    Chap. XIII.--Of the Advantage and Use of the World and of the Seasons.

   If any one considers the whole government of the world, he will
   certainly understand how true is the opinion of the Stoics, who say
   that the world was made on our account. For all the things of which the
   world is composed, and which it produces from itself, are adapted to
   the use of man. Man, accordingly, uses fire for the purpose of warmth
   and light, and of softening his food, and for the working of iron; he
   uses springs for drinking, and for baths; he uses rivers for irrigating
   the fields, and assigning boundaries to countries; he uses the earth
   for receiving a variety of fruits, the hills for planting vineyards,
   the mountains for the use of trees and firewood, [1716] the plains for
   crops of grain; he uses the sea not only for commerce, and for
   receiving supplies from distant countries, but also for abundance of
   every kind of fish. But if he makes use of these elements to which he
   is nearest, there is no doubt that he uses the heaven also, since the
   offices even of heavenly things are regulated for the fertility of the
   earth from which we live. The sun, with its ceaseless courses and
   unequal intervals, [1717] completes its annual circles, and either at
   his rising draws forth the day for labour, or at his setting brings on
   the night for repose; and at one time by his departure farther towards
   the south, at another time by his approach nearer towards the north, he
   causes the vicissitudes of winter and summer, so that both by the
   moistures and frosts of winter the earth becomes enriched for
   fruitfulness, and by the heats of summer either the produce of grass
   [1718] is hardened by maturity, or that which is in moist places, being
   seethed and heated, becomes ripened. The moon also, which governs the
   time of night, regulates her monthly courses by the alternate loss and
   recovery of light, [1719] and by the brightness of her shining
   illumines the nights obscure with gloomy darkness, so that journeys in
   the summer heat, and expeditions, and works, may be performed without
   labour and inconvenience; since


   "By night the light stubble, by night

   The dry meadows are better mown." [1720]

   The other heavenly bodies also, either at their rising or setting,
   supply favourable times [1721] by their fixed positions. [1722]
   Moreover, they also afford guidance to ships, that they may not wander
   through the boundless deep with uncertain course, since the pilot duly
   observing them arrives at the harbour of the shore at which he aims.
   [1723] Clouds are attracted by the breath of the winds, that the fields
   of sown grain may be watered with showers, that the vines may abound
   with produce, and the trees with fruits. And these things are exhibited
   by a succession of changes throughout the year, that nothing may at any
   time be wanting by which the life of men is sustained. But [1724] (it
   is said) the same earth nourishes the other living creatures, and by
   the produce of the same even the dumb animals are fed. Has not God
   laboured also for the sake of the dumb animals? By no means; because
   they are void of reason. On the contrary, we understand that even these
   themselves in the same manner were made by God for the use of man,
   partly for food, partly for clothing, partly to assist him in his work;
   so that it is manifest that the divine providence wished to furnish and
   adorn the life of men with an abundance of objects and resources, and
   on this account He both filled the air with birds, and the sea with
   fishes, and the earth with quadrupeds. But the Academics, arguing
   against the Stoics, are accustomed to ask why, if God made all things
   for the sake of men, many things are found even opposed, and hostile,
   and injurious to us, as well in the sea as on the land. And the Stoics,
   without any regard to the truth, most foolishly repelled this. For they
   say that there are many things among natural productions, [1725] and
   reckoned among animals, the utility of which hitherto [1726] escapes
   notice, but that this is discovered in process of the times, as
   necessity and use have already discovered many things which were
   unknown in former ages. What utility, then, can be discovered in mice,
   in beetles, in serpents, which are troublesome and pernicious to man?
   Is it that some medicine lies concealed in them? If there is any, it
   will at some time be found out, namely, as a remedy against evils,
   whereas they complain that it is altogether evil. They say that the
   viper, when burnt and reduced to ashes, is a remedy for the bite of the
   same beast. How much better had it been that it should not exist at
   all, than that a remedy should be required against it drawn from
   itself?

   They might then have answered with more conciseness and truth after
   this manner. When God had formed man as it were His own image, that
   which was the completion of His workmanship, He breathed wisdom into
   him alone, so that he might bring all things into subjection to his own
   authority and government, and make use of all the advantages of the
   world. And yet He set before him both good and evil things, inasmuch as
   He gave to him wisdom, the whole nature of which is employed in
   discerning things evil and good: for no one can choose better things,
   and know what is good, unless he at the same time knows to reject and
   avoid the things which are evil. [1727] They are both mutually
   connected with each other, so that, the one being taken away, the other
   must also be taken away. Therefore, good and evil things being set
   before it, then at length wisdom discharges its office, and desires the
   good for usefulness, but rejects the evil for safety. Therefore, as
   innumerable good things have been given which it might enjoy, so also
   have evils, against which it might guard. For if there is no evil, no
   danger--nothing, in short, which can injure man--all the material of
   wisdom is taken away, and will be unnecessary for man. For if only good
   things are placed in sight, what need is there of reflection, of
   understanding, of knowledge, of reason? since, wherever he shall extend
   his hand, that is befitting and adapted to nature; so that if any one
   should wish to place a most exquisite dinner before infants, who as yet
   have no taste, it is plain that each will desire that to which either
   impulse, or hunger, or even accident, shall attract them; and whatever
   they shall take, it will be useful and salutary to them. What injury
   will it therefore be for them always to remain as they are, and always
   to be infants and unacquainted with affairs? But if you add a mixture
   either of bitter things, or things useless, or even poisonous, they are
   plainly deceived through their ignorance of good and evil, unless
   wisdom is added to them, by which they may have the rejection of evil
   things and the choice of good things.

   You see, therefore, that we have greater need of wisdom on account of
   evils; and unless these things had been proposed to us, we should not
   be a rational animal. But if this account is true, which the Stoics
   were in no manner able to see, that argument also of Epicurus is done
   away. God, he says, either wishes to take away evils, and is unable; or
   He is able, and is unwilling; or He is neither willing nor able, or He
   is both willing and able. If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble,
   which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is able and
   unwilling, He is envious, which is equally at variance with God; if He
   is neither willing nor able, He is both envious and feeble, and
   therefore not God; if He is both willing and able, which alone is
   suitable to God, from what source then are evils? or why does He not
   remove them? I know that many of the philosophers, who defend
   providence, are accustomed to be disturbed by this argument, and are
   almost driven against their will to admit that God takes no interest in
   anything, which Epicurus especially aims at; but having examined the
   matter, we easily do away with this formidable argument. For God is
   able to do whatever He wishes, and there is no weakness or envy in God.
   He is able, therefore, to take away evils; but He does not wish to do
   so, and yet He is not on that account envious. For on this account He
   does not take them away, because He at the same time gives wisdom, as I
   have shown; and there is more of goodness and pleasure in wisdom than
   of annoyance in evils. For wisdom causes us even to know God, and by
   that knowledge to attain to immortality, which is the chief good.
   Therefore, unless we first know evil, we shall be unable to know good.
   But Epicurus did not see this, nor did any other, that if evils are
   taken away, wisdom is in like manner taken away; and that no traces of
   virtue remain in man, the nature of which consists in enduring and
   overcoming the bitterness of evils. And thus, for the sake of a slight
   gain [1728] in the taking away of evils, we should be deprived of a
   good, which is very great, and true, and peculiar to us. It is plain,
   therefore, that all things are proposed for the sake of man, as well
   evils as also goods.

    Chap. XIV.--Why God Made Man.

   It follows that I show for what purpose God made man himself. As He
   contrived the world for the sake of man, so He formed man himself on
   His own account, as it were a priest of a divine temple, a spectator of
   His works and of heavenly objects. For he is the only being who, since
   he is intelligent and capable of reason, is able to understand God, to
   admire His works, and perceive His energy and power; for on this
   account he is furnished with judgment, intelligence, and prudence. On
   this account he alone, beyond the other living creatures, has been made
   with an upright body and attitude, so that he seems to have been raised
   up for the contemplation of his Parent. [1729] On this account he alone
   has received language, and a tongue the interpreter of his thought,
   that he may be able to declare the majesty of his Lord. Lastly, for
   this cause all things were placed under his control, that he himself
   might be under the control of God, their Maker and Creator. If God,
   therefore, designed man to be a worshipper of Himself, and on this
   account gave him so much honour, that he might rule over all things; it
   is plainly most just that he should worship Him [1730] who bestowed
   upon him such great gifts, and love man, who is united with us in the
   participation of the divine justice. For it is not right that a
   worshipper of God should he injured by a worshipper of God. From which
   it is understood that man was made for the sake of religion and
   justice. And of this matter Marcus Tullius is a witness in his books
   respecting the Laws, since he thus speaks: [1731] "But of all things
   concerning which learned men dispute, nothing is of greater consequence
   than that it should be altogether understood that we are born to
   justice." And if this is most true, it follows that God will have all
   men to be just, that is, to have God and man as objects of their
   affection; to honour God in truth as a Father, and to love man as a
   brother: for in these two things the whole of justice is comprised. But
   he who either fails to acknowledge God or acts injuriously to man,
   lives unjustly and contrary to his nature, and in this manner disturbs
   the divine institution and law.

    Chap. XV.--Whence Sins Extended to Man.

   Here perhaps some one may ask, Whence sins extended to man, or what
   perversion distorted the rule of the divine institution to worse
   things, so that, though he was born to justice, he nevertheless
   performs unjust works. I have already in a former place explained, that
   God at the same time set before him good and evil, and that He loves
   the good, and hates the evil which is contrary to this; but that He
   permitted the evil on this account, that the good also might shine
   forth, since, as I have often taught, we understand that the one cannot
   exist without the other; in short, that the world itself is made up of
   two elements opposing and connected with one another, of fire and
   moisture, and that light could not have been made unless there has also
   been darkness, since there cannot be a higher place without a lower,
   nor a rising without a setting, nor warmth without cold, nor softness
   without hardness. Thus also we are composed of two substances equally
   opposed to one another--soul and body: the one of which is assigned to
   the heaven, because it is slight and not to be handled; the other to
   the earth, because it is capable of being laid hold of: the one is firm
   [1732] and eternal, the other frail and mortal. Therefore good clings
   to the one, and evil to the other: light, life, and justice to the one;
   darkness, death, and injustice to the other. Hence there arose among
   men the corruption of their nature, so that it was necessary that a law
   should be established, by which vices might be prohibited, and the
   duties of virtue be enjoined. Since, therefore, there are good and evil
   things in the affairs of men, the nature of which I have set forth, it
   must be that God is moved to both sides, both to favour when He sees
   that just things are done, and to anger when He perceives unjust
   things.

   But Epicurus opposes us, and says: "If there is in God the affection of
   joy leading Him to favour, and of hatred influencing Him to anger, He
   must of necessity have both fear, and inclination, and desire, and the
   other affections which belong to human weakness." It does not follow
   that he who is angry must fear, or that he who feels joy must grieve;
   in short, they who are liable to anger are less timid, and they who are
   of a joyful temperament are less affected with grief. What need is
   there to speak of the affections of humanity, to which our nature
   yields? Let us weigh the divine necessity; for I am unwilling to speak
   of nature, since it is believed that our God was never born. The
   affection of fear has a subject-matter in man, but it has none in God.
   Man, inasmuch as he is liable to many accidents and dangers, fears lest
   any greater violence should arise which may strike, despoil, lacerate,
   dash down, and destroy him. But God, who is liable neither to want, nor
   injury, nor pain, nor death, can by no means fear, because there is
   nothing which can offer violence to Him. Also the reason and cause of
   desire is manifest in man. For, inasmuch as he was made frail and
   mortal, it was necessary that another and different sex should be made,
   by union with which offspring might be produced to continue the
   perpetuity of his race. But this desire has no place in God, because
   frailty and death are far removed from Him; nor is there with Him any
   female in whose union He is able to rejoice; nor does He stand in need
   of succession, since He will live for ever. The same things may be said
   respecting envy and passion, to which, from sure and manifest causes,
   man is liable, but to which God is by no means liable. But, in truth,
   favour and anger and pity have their substance [1733] in God, and that
   greatest and matchless power employs them for the preservation of the
   world.

    Chap. XVI.--Of God, and His Anger and Affections.

   Some one will ask what this substance is. First of all, when evils
   befall them, men in their dejected state for the most part have
   recourse to God: they appease and entreat Him, believing that He is
   able to repel injuries from them. He has therefore an occasion of
   exercising pity; for He is not so unmerciful and a despiser of men as
   to refuse aid to those who are in distress. Very many, also, who are
   persuaded that justice is pleasing to God, both worship Him who is Lord
   and Parent of all, and with continual prayers and repeated vows offer
   gifts and sacrifices, follow up His name with praises, striving to gain
   His favour by just and good works. There is therefore a reason, on
   account of which God may and ought to favour them. For if there is
   nothing so befitting God as beneficence, and nothing so unsuited to His
   character as to be ungrateful, it is necessary that He should make some
   return for the services of those who are excellent, and who lead a holy
   life, that He may not be liable to the charge of ingratitude which is
   worthy of blame [1734] even in the case of a man. But, on the contrary,
   others are daring [1735] and wicked, who pollute all things with their
   lusts, harass with slaughters, practice fraud, plunder, commit perjury,
   neither spare relatives nor parents, neglect the laws, and even God
   Himself. Anger, therefore, has a befitting occasion [1736] in God.

   For it is not right that, when He sees such things, He should not be
   moved, and arise to take vengeance upon the wicked, and destroy the
   pestilent and guilty, so as to promote the interests of all good men.
   Thus even in anger itself there is also contained a showing of
   kindness. [1737] Therefore the arguments are found to be empty and
   false, either of those who, when they will not admit that God is angry,
   will have it that He shows kindness, because this, indeed, cannot take
   place without anger; or of those who think that there is no emotion of
   the mind in God. And because there are some affections to which God is
   not liable, as desire, fear, avarice, grief, and envy, they have said
   that He is entirely free from all affection. For He is not liable to
   these, because they are vicious affections; but as to those which
   belong to virtue,--that is, anger towards the wicked, regard towards
   the good, pity towards the afflicted,--inasmuch as they are worthy of
   the divine power, He has affections of His own, [1738] both just and
   true. And if He is not possessed of them, the life of man will be
   thrown into confusion, and the condition of things will come to such
   disturbance that the laws will be despised and overpowered, and
   audacity alone reign, so that no one can at length be in safety unless
   he who excels [1739] in strength. Thus all the earth will be laid
   waste, as it were, by a common robbery. But now, since the wicked
   expect punishment, and the good hope for favour, and the afflicted look
   for aid, there is place for virtues, and crimes are more rare. But
   [1740] it is said, ofttimes the wicked are more prosperous, and the
   good more wretched, and the just are harassed with impunity by the
   unjust. We will hereafter consider why these things happen. In the
   meantime let us explain respecting anger, whether there be any in God;
   whether He takes no notice at all, and is unmoved at those things which
   are done with impiety.

    Chap. XVII.--Of God, His Care and Anger.

   God, says Epicurus, regards nothing; therefore He has no power. For he
   who has power must of necessity regard affairs. For if He has power,
   and does not use it, what so great cause is there that, I will not say
   our race, but even the universe itself, should be contemptible in His
   sight? On this account he says He is pure [1741] and happy, because He
   is always at rest. [1742] To whom, then, has the administration of so
   great affairs been entrusted, [1743] if these things which we see to be
   governed by the highest judgment are neglected by God? or how can he
   who lives and perceives be at rest? For rest belongs either to sleep or
   to death. But sleep has not rest. For when we are asleep, the body
   indeed is at rest, but the soul is restless and agitated: it forms for
   itself images which it may behold, so that it exercises its natural
   power of motion by a variety of visions, and calls itself away from
   false things, until the limbs are satiated, and receive vigour from
   rest. Therefore eternal rest belongs to death alone. Now if death does
   not affect God, it follows that God is never at rest. But in what can
   the action of God consist, but in the administration of the world? But
   if God carries on the care of the world, it follows that He cares for
   the life of men, and takes notice of the acts of individuals, and He
   earnestly desires that they should be wise and good. This is the will
   of God, this the divine law; and he who follows and observes this is
   beloved by God. It is necessary that He should be moved with anger
   against the man who has broken or despised this eternal and divine law.
   If, he says, God does harm to any one, therefore He is not good. They
   are deceived by no slight error who defame all censure, whether human
   or divine, with the name of bitterness and malice, thinking that He
   ought to be called injurious [1744] who visits the injurious with
   punishment. But if this is so, it follows that we have injurious laws,
   which enact punishment for offenders, and injurious judges who inflict
   capital punishments on those convicted of crime. But if the law is just
   which awards to the transgressor his due, and if the judge is called
   upright and good when he punishes crimes,--for he guards the safety of
   good men who punishes the evil,--it follows that God, when He opposes
   the evil, is not injurious; but he himself is injurious who either
   injures an innocent man, or spares an injurious person that he may
   injure many.

   I would gladly ask from those who represent God as immoveable, [1745]
   if any one had property, a house, a household [1746] of slaves, and his
   slaves, despising the forbearance of their master, should attack all
   things, and themselves take the enjoyment of his goods, if his
   household should honour them, while the master was despised by all,
   insulted, and deserted: could he be a wise man who should not avenge
   the insults, but permit those over whom he had power to have the
   enjoyment of his property? Can such forbearance be found in any one?
   If, indeed, it is to be called forbearance, and not rather a kind of
   insensible stupor. But it is easy to endure contempt. What if those
   things were done which are spoken of by Cicero? [1747] "For I ask, if
   any head of a family, [1748] when his children had been put to death by
   a slave, his wife slain and his house set on fire, should not exact
   most severe punishment from that slave, whether he would appear to be
   kind and merciful, or inhuman and most cruel? "But if to pardon deeds
   of this kind is the part of cruelty rather than of kindness, [1749] it
   is not therefore the part of goodness in God not to be moved at those
   things which are done unjustly. For the world is, as it were, the house
   of God, and men, as it were, His slaves; and if His name is a mockery
   to them, what kind or amount of forbearance is it to give [1750] up His
   own honours, to see wicked and unjust things done, and not to be
   indignant, which is peculiar and natural to Him who is displeased with
   sins! To be angry, therefore, is the part of reason: for thus faults
   are removed, and licentiousness is curbed; and this is plainly in
   accordance with justice and wisdom.

   But the Stoics did not see that there is a distinction between right
   and wrong, that there is a just and also an unjust anger; and because
   they did not find a remedy for the matter, they wished altogether to
   remove it. But the Peripatetics said that it was not to be cut out, but
   moderated; to whom we have made a sufficient reply in the sixth book of
   the Institutions. [1751] Now, that the philosophers were ignorant of
   the nature of anger, is plain from their definitions, which Seneca
   enumerated in the books which he composed on the subject of anger.
   "Anger is," he says, "the desire of avenging an injury." Others, as
   Posidonius says, describe it as the desire of punishing him by whom you
   think that you have been unfairly injured. Some have thus defined it:
   "Anger is an incitement of the mind to injure him who either has
   committed an injury, or who has wished to do so." The definition of
   Aristotle does not differ greatly from ours; [1752] for he says that
   "anger is the desire of requiting pain." This is the unjust anger,
   concerning which we spoke before, which is contained even in the dumb
   animals; but it is to be restrained in man, lest he should rush to some
   very great evil through rage. This cannot exist in God, because He
   cannot be injured; [1753] but it is found in man, inasmuch as he is
   frail. For the inflicting [1754] of injury inflames [1755] anguish, and
   anguish produces a desire of revenge. Where, then, is that just anger
   against offenders? For this is evidently not the desire of revenge,
   inasmuch as no injury precedes. I do not speak of those who sin against
   the laws; for although a judge may be angry with these without
   incurring blame, let us, however, suppose that he ought to be of a
   sedate mind when he sentences the guilty to punishment, because he is
   the executor [1756] of the laws, not of his own spirit or power; for so
   they wish it who endeavour to extirpate anger. But I speak of those in
   particular who are in our own power, as slaves, children, wives, and
   pupils; for when we see these offend, we are incited to restrain them.

   For it cannot fail to be, that he who is just and good is displeased
   with things which are bad, and that he who is displeased with evil is
   moved when he sees it practised. Therefore we arise to take vengeance,
   not because we have been injured, but that discipline may be preserved,
   morals may be corrected, and licentiousness be suppressed. This is just
   anger; and as it is necessary in man for the correction of wickedness,
   so manifestly is it necessary in God, from whom an example comes to
   man. For as we ought to restrain those who are subject to our power, so
   also ought God to restrain the offences of all. And in order that He
   may do this, He must be angry; because it is natural for one who is
   good to be moved and incited at the fault of another. Therefore they
   ought to have given this definition: Anger is an emotion of the mind
   arousing itself for the restraining of faults. [1757] For the
   definition given by Cicero, "Anger is the desire of taking vengeance,"
   does not differ much from those already mentioned. [1758] But that
   anger which we may call either fury or rage ought not to exist even in
   man, because it is altogether vicious; but the anger which relates to
   the correction of vices ought not to be taken away from man; nor can it
   be taken away from God, because it is both serviceable for the affairs
   of men, and necessary.

    Chap. XVIII.--Of the Punishment of Faults, that It Cannot Take Place Without
    Anger.

   What need is there, they say, of anger, since faults can be corrected
   without this affection? But there is no one who can calmly see any one
   committing an offence. This may perhaps be possible in him who presides
   over the laws, because the deed is not committed before his eyes, but
   it is brought before him as a doubtful matter from another quarter. Nor
   can any wickedness be so manifest, that there is no place for a
   defence; and therefore it is possible that a judge may not be moved
   against him who may possibly be found to be innocent; and when the
   detected crime shall have come to light, he now no longer uses his own
   opinion, but that of the laws. It may be granted that he does that
   which he does without anger; for he has that which he may follow. We,
   undoubtedly, when an offence is committed by our household at home,
   whether we see or perceive it, must be indignant; for the very sight of
   a sin is unbecoming. For he who is altogether unmoved either approves
   of faults, which is more disgraceful and unjust, or avoids the trouble
   of reproving them, which a tranquil spirit and a quiet mind despises
   and refuses, unless anger shall have aroused and incited it. But when
   any one is moved, and yet through unseasonable leniency grants pardon
   more frequently than is necessary, or at all times, he evidently both
   destroys the life of those whose audacity he is fostering for greater
   crimes, and furnishes himself with a perpetual source of annoyances.
   Therefore the restraining of one's anger in the case of sins is faulty.

   Archytas of Tarentum is praised, who, when he had found everything
   ruined [1759] on his estate, rebuking the fault of his bailiff, said,
   "Wretch, I would have beaten you to death if I had not been angry."
   They consider this to be a singular example of forbearance; but
   influenced by authority, they do not see how foolishly he spoke and
   acted. For if (as Plato says) no prudent man punishes because there is
   an offence, but to prevent the occurrence of an offence, it is evident
   how evil an example this wise man put forth. For if slaves shall
   perceive that their master uses violence when he is not angry, and
   abstains from violence [1760] when he is angry, it is evident that they
   will not commit slight offences, lest they should be beaten; but will
   commit the greatest offences, that they may arouse the anger of the
   perverse man, and escape with impunity. But I should praise him if,
   when he was enraged, he had given space to his anger, that the
   excitement of his mind might calm down through the interval of time,
   and his chastisement might be confined within moderate limits.
   Therefore, on account of the magnitude of the anger, punishment ought
   not to have been inflicted, but to have been delayed, lest it should
   inflict [1761] upon the offender pain greater than is just, or occasion
   an outburst of fury in the punisher. But how, how is it equitable or
   wise, that any one should be punished on account of a slight offence,
   and should be unpunished on account of a very great one? But if he had
   learned the nature and causes of things, he never would have professed
   so unsuitable a forbearance, that a wicked slave should rejoice that
   his master has been angry with him. For as God has furnished the human
   body with many and various senses which are necessary for the use of
   life, so also He has assigned to the soul various affections by which
   the course of life might be regulated; and as He has given desire for
   the sake of producing offspring, so has He given anger for the sake of
   restraining faults.

   But they who are ignorant of the ends of good and evil things, as they
   employ sensual desire for the purposes of corruption and pleasure, in
   the same manner make use of anger and passion for the inflicting of
   injury, while they are angry with those whom they regard with hatred.
   Therefore they are angry even with those who commit no offence, even
   with their equals, or even with their superiors. Hence they daily rush
   to monstrous [1762] deeds; hence tragedies often arise. Therefore
   Archytas would be deserving of praise, if, when he had been enraged
   against any citizen or equal who injured him, he had curbed himself,
   and by forbearance mitigated the impetuosity of his fury. This
   self-restraint is glorious, by which any great evil which impends is
   restrained; but it is a fault not to check the faults of slaves and
   children; for through their escaping without punishment they will
   proceed to greater evil. In this case anger is not to be restrained;
   but even if it is in a state of inactivity, [1763] it must be aroused.
   But that which we say respecting man, we also say respecting God, who
   made man like to Himself. I omit making mention of the figure of God,
   because the Stoics say that God has no form, and another great subject
   will arise if we should wish to refute them. I only speak respecting
   the soul. If it belongs [1764] to God to reflect, to be wise, to
   understand, to foresee. to excel, and of all animals man alone has
   these qualities, it follows that he was made after the likeness of God;
   but on this account he goes on to vice, because, being mingled with
   frailty derived from earth, he is unable to preserve pure and
   uncontaminated that which he has received from God, unless he is imbued
   with the precepts of justice by the same God.

    Chap. XIX.--Of the Soul and Body, and of Providence.

   But since he is made up, as we have said, of two parts, soul and body,
   the virtues are contained in the one, and vices in the other, and they
   mutually oppose each other. For the good properties of the soul, which
   consist in restraining lusts, are contrary to the body; and the good
   properties of the body, which consist in every kind of pleasure, are
   hostile to the soul. But if the virtue of the soul shall have resisted
   the desires, and suppressed them, he will be truly like to God. From
   which it is evident that the soul of man, which is capable of divine
   virtue, is not mortal. But there is this distinction, that since virtue
   is attended with bitterness, and the attraction of pleasure is sweet,
   great numbers are overcome and are drawn aside to the pleasantness; but
   they who have given themselves up to the body and earthly things are
   pressed to the earth, and are unable to attain to the favour of the
   divine bounty, because they have polluted themselves with the
   defilements of vices. But they who, following God, and in obedience to
   Him, have despised the desires of the body, and, preferring virtue to
   pleasures, have preserved innocence and righteousness, these God
   recognises as like to Himself.

   Since, therefore, He has laid down a most holy law, and wishes all men
   to be innocent and beneficent, is it possible that He should not be
   angry when He sees that His law is despised, that virtue is rejected,
   and pleasure made the object of pursuit? But if He is the governor of
   the world, as He might to be, He surely does not despise that which is
   even of the greatest importance in the whole world. If He has
   foresight, as it is befitting that God should have, it is plain that He
   consults the interests of the human race, in order that our life may be
   more abundantly supplied, and better, and safer. If He is the Father
   and God of all, He is undoubtedly delighted with the virtues of men,
   and provoked by their vices. Therefore He loves the just, and hates the
   wicked. There is no need (one says) of hatred; for He once for all has
   fixed a reward for the good, and punishment for the wicked. But if any
   one lives justly and innocently, and at the same time neither worships
   God nor has any regard for Him, as Aristides, and Timon, [1765] and
   others of the philosophers, will he escape [1766] with impunity,
   because, though he has obeyed the law of God, he has nevertheless
   despised God Himself? There is therefore something on account of which
   God may be angry with one rebelling against Him, as it were, in
   reliance upon His integrity. If He can be angry with this man on
   account of his pride, why not more so with the sinner, who has despised
   the law together with the Lawgiver? The judge cannot pardon offences,
   because he is subject to the will of another. But God can pardon,
   because He is Himself the arbitrator [1767] and judge of His own law;
   and when He laid down this, He did not surely deprive Himself of all
   power, but He has the liberty of bestowing pardon.

    Chap. XX.--Of Offences, and the Mercy of God.

   If He is able to pardon, He is therefore able also to be angry. Why,
   then, some one will say, does it often occur, that they who sin are
   prosperous, and they who live piously are wretched? Because fugitives
   and disinherited [1768] persons live without restraint, and they who
   are under the discipline of a father or master live in a more strict
   and frugal manner. For virtue is proved and fixed [1769] by means of
   ills; vices by means of pleasure. Nor, however, ought he who sins to
   hope for lasting impunity, because there is no lasting happiness.


   "But, in truth, the last day is always to be looked for by man and no
   one ought to be called happy before his death and last funeral rites,"
   [1770]

   as the not inelegant poet says. It is the end which proves happiness,
   and no one is able to escape the judgment of God, either when alive or
   after death. For He has the power both to cast down the living from on
   high, and to punish the dead with eternal torments. Nay, he says, if
   God is angry, He ought to have inflicted vengeance at once, and to have
   punished every one according to his desert. But (it is replied) if He
   had done this, no one would survive. For there is no one who offends in
   no respect, and there are many things which excite to the commission of
   sin--age, intemperance, want, opportunity, reward. To such an extent is
   the frailty of the flesh with which we are clothed liable to sin, that
   unless God were indulgent to this necessity, perhaps too few would
   live. On this account He is most patient, and restrains His anger. For
   because there is in Him perfect virtue, it follows of necessity that
   His patience also is perfect, which is itself also a virtue. How many
   men, from having been sinners, have afterwards become righteous; from
   being injurious, have become good; from being wicked, have become
   temperate! How many who were in early life base, and condemned by the
   judgment of all, afterwards have turned out praiseworthy? But it is
   plain that this could not happen if punishment followed every offence.

   The public laws condemn those who are manifestly guilty; but there are
   great numbers whose offences are concealed, great numbers who restrain
   the accuser either by entreaties or by reward, great numbers who elude
   justice by favour or influence. But if the divine censure should
   condemn all those who escape the punishment of men, there would be few
   or even no men on the earth. In short, even that one reason for
   destroying the human race might have been a just one, that men,
   despising the living God, pay divine honour to earthly and frail
   images, as though they were of heaven, adoring works made by human
   hands. And though God their Creator made them of elevated countenance
   and upright figure, and raised them to the contemplation of the heaven
   and the knowledge of God, they have preferred, like cattle, to bend
   themselves to the earth. [1771] For he is low, and curved, and bent
   downward, who, turning away from the sight of heaven and God his
   Father, worships things of the earth, which he ought to have trodden
   upon, that is, things made and fashioned from earth. Therefore, amidst
   such great impiety and such great sins of men, the forbearance of God
   attains this object, that men, condemning the errors of their past
   life, correct themselves. In short, there are many who are just and
   good; and these, having laid aside the worship of earthly things,
   acknowledge the majesty of the one and only God. But though the
   forbearance of God is very great and most useful; yet, although late,
   He punishes the guilty, and does not suffer them to proceed further,
   when He sees that they are incorrigible.

    Chap. XXI.--Of the Anger of God and Man.

   There remains one question, and that the last. For some one will
   perhaps say, that God is so far from being angry, that in His precepts
   He even forbids man to be angry. I might say that the anger of man
   ought to be curbed, because he is often angry unjustly; and he has
   immediate emotion, because he is only for a time. [1772] Therefore,
   lest those things should be done which the low, and those of moderate
   station, and great kings do in their anger, his rage ought to have been
   moderated and suppressed, lest, being out of his mind, [1773] he should
   commit some inexpiable crime. But God is not angry for a short time,
   [1774] because He is eternal and of perfect virtue, and He is never
   angry unless deservedly. But, however, the matter is not so; for if He
   should altogether prohibit anger, He Himself would have been in some
   measure the censurer of His own workmanship, since He from the
   beginning had inserted anger in the liver [1775] of man, since it is
   believed that the cause of this emotion is contained in the moisture of
   the gall. Therefore He does not altogether prohibit anger, because that
   affection is necessarily given, but He forbids us to persevere in
   anger. For the anger of mortals ought to be mortal; for if it is
   lasting, enmity is strengthened to lasting destruction. Then, again,
   when He enjoined us to be angry, and yet not to sin, [1776] it is plain
   that He did not tear up anger by the roots, but restrained it, that in
   every correction we might preserve moderation and justice. Therefore He
   who commands us to be angry is manifestly Himself angry; He who enjoins
   us to be quickly appeased is manifestly Himself easy to be appeased:
   for He has enjoined those things which are just and useful for the
   interests of society. [1777]

   But because I had said that the anger of God is not for a time [1778]
   only, as is the case with man, who becomes inflamed with an immediate
   [1779] excitement, and on account of his frailty is unable easily to
   govern himself, we ought to understand that because God is eternal, His
   anger also remains to eternity; but, on the other hand, that because He
   is endued with the greatest excellence, He controls His anger, and is
   not ruled by it, but that He regulates it according to His will. And it
   is plain that this is not opposed to that which has just been said. For
   if His anger had been altogether immortal, there would be no place
   after a fault for satisfaction or kind feeling, though He Himself
   commands men to be reconciled before the setting of the sun. [1780] But
   the divine anger remains for ever against those who ever sin. Therefore
   God is appeased not by incense or a victim, not by costly offerings,
   which things are all corruptible, but by a reformation of the morals:
   and he who ceases to sin renders the anger of God mortal. For this
   reason He does not immediately [1781] punish every one who is guilty,
   that man may have the opportunity of coming to a right mind, [1782] and
   correcting himself.

    Chap. XXII.--Of Sins, and the Verses of the Sibyls Respecting Them Recited.

   This is what I had to say, most beloved Donatus, respecting the anger
   of God, that you might know how to refute those who represent God as
   being without emotions. [1783] It only remains that, after the practice
   of Cicero, I should use an epilogue by way of peroration. As he did in
   the Tusculan Disputations, [1784] when discoursing on the subject of
   death, so we in this work ought to bring forward divine testimonies,
   which may be believed, to refute the persuasion of those who, believing
   that God is without anger, destroy all religion, without which, as we
   have shown, we are either equal to the brutes in savageness, or to the
   cattle in foolishness; for it is in religion only--that is, in the
   knowledge of the Supreme God--that wisdom consists. All the prophets,
   being filled with the Divine Spirit, speak nothing else than of the
   favour of God towards the righteous, and His anger against the ungodly.
   And their testimony is indeed sufficient for us; but because it is not
   believed by those who make a display of wisdom by their hair and dress,
   [1785] it was necessary to refute them by reason and arguments. For
   they act so preposterously, [1786] that human things give authority to
   divine things, whereas divine things ought rather to give authority to
   human. But let us now leave these things, lest we should produce no
   effect upon them, and the subject should be indefinitely drawn out. Let
   us therefore seek those testimonies which they can either believe, or
   at any rate not oppose.

   Authors of great number and weight have made mention of the Sibyls; of
   the Greeks, Aristo the Chian, and Apollodorus the Erythræan; of our
   writers, Varro and Fenestella. All these relate that the Erythræan
   Sibyl was distinguished and noble beyond the rest. Apollodorus, indeed,
   boasts of her as his own citizen and countrywoman. But Fenestella also
   relates that ambassadors were sent by the senate to Erythræ, that the
   verses of this Sibyl might be conveyed to Rome, and that the consuls
   Curio and Octavius might take care that they should be placed in the
   Capitol, which had then been restored under the care of Quintus
   Catulus. In her writings, verses of this kind are found respecting the
   Supreme God and Maker of the world:--


   "The incorruptible and eternal Maker who dwells in the heaven, holding
   forth good to the good, a much greater reward, but stirring up anger
   and rage against the evil and unjust."

   Again, in another place, enumerating the deeds by which God is
   especially moved to anger, she introduced these things:--


   "Avoid unlawful services, and serve the living God. Abstain from
   adultery and impurity; bring up a pure generation of children; do not
   kill: for the Immortal will be angry with every one who may sin."

   Therefore He is angry with sinners.

    Chap. XXIII.--Of the Anger of God and the Punishment of Sins, and a Recital
    of the Verses of the Sibyls Respecting It; And, Moreover, a Reproof and
    Exhortation.

   But because it is related by most learned men that there have been many
   Sibyls, the testimony of one may not be sufficient to confirm the
   truth, as we purpose to do. The volumes, indeed, of the Cumæan Sibyl,
   in which are written the fates of the Romans are kept secret; but the
   writings of all the others are, for the most part, not prohibited from
   being in common use. And of these another, denouncing the anger of God
   against all nations on account of the impiety of men, thus began:--


   "Since great anger is coming upon a disobedient world, I disclose the
   commands of God to the last age, prophesying to all men from city to
   city."

   Another Sibyl also said, that the deluge was caused by the indignation
   of God against the unrighteous in a former age, that the wickedness of
   the human race might be extinguished:--


   "From the time when, the God of heaven being enraged against the cities
   themselves and all men, a deluge having burst forth, the sea covered
   the earth."

   In like manner she foretold a conflagration about to take place
   hereafter, in which the impiety of men should again be destroyed:--


   " And at some time, God no longer soothing His anger, but increasing
   it, and destroying the race of men, and laying waste the whole of it by
   fire."

   From which mention is thus made concerning Jupiter by Ovid: [1787] --


   "He remembers also that it is fated that the time shall come in which
   the sea, the earth, and the palace of heaven, being caught by fire,
   shall be burnt, and the curiously wrought framework of the world [1788]
   be in danger."

   And this must come to pass at the time when the honour and worship of
   the Supreme shall have perished among men. The same Sibyl, however,
   testifying that He was appeased by reformation [1789] of conduct and
   self-improvement, added these things :--


   "But, ye mortals, in pity [1790] turn yourselves now, and do not lead
   the great God to every kind of anger."

   And also a little later:--


   "He will not destroy, but will again restrain His anger, if you all
   practice valuable piety in your minds."

   Then another Sibyl declares that the Father of heavenly and earthly
   things ought to be loved, lest His indignation should arise, to the
   destruction of men:--


   "Lest by chance the immortal God should be angry, and destroy the whole
   race of men, their life and shameless race, it is befitting that we
   love the wise, ever-living God the Father."

   From these things it is evident that the arguments of the philosophers
   are vain, who imagine that God is without anger, and among His other
   praises reckon that which is most useless, detracting from Him that
   which is most salutary for human affairs, by which majesty itself
   exists. For this earthly kingdom and government, unless guarded by
   fear, is broken down. Take away anger from a king, and he will not only
   cease to be obeyed, but he will even be cast down headlong from his
   height. Yea, rather take away this affection from any person of low
   degree, and who will not plunder him? Who will not deride him? Who will
   not treat him with injury? Thus he will be able to have neither
   clothing, nor an abode, nor food, since others will deprive him of
   whatever he has; much less can we suppose that the majesty of the
   heavenly government can exist without anger and fear. The Milesian
   Apollo being consulted concerning the religion of the Jews, inserted
   these things in his answer:--


   "God, the King and Father of all, before whom the earth trembles, and
   the heaven and sea, and whom the recesses of Tartarus and the demons
   dread."

   If He is so mild, as the philosophers will have it, how is it that not
   only the demons and ministers of such great power, but even the heaven
   and earth, and the whole system of the universe, tremble at His
   presence? For if no one submits to the service of another except by
   compulsion, it follows that all government exists by fear, and fear by
   anger. For if any one is not aroused against one who is unwilling to
   obey, it will not be possible for him to be compelled to obedience. Let
   any one consult his own feelings; he will at once understand that no
   one can be subdued to the command of another without anger and
   chastisement. Therefore, where there shall be no anger, there will be
   no authority. But God has authority; therefore also He must have anger,
   in which authority consists. Therefore let no one, induced by the empty
   prating [1791] of the philosophers, train himself to the contempt of
   God, which is the greatest impiety. We all are bound both to love Him,
   because He is our Father; and to reverence Him, because He is our Lord:
   both to pay Him honour, because He is bounteous; and to fear Him,
   because He is severe: each character in Him is worthy of reverence.
   [1792] Who can preserve his piety, and yet fail to love the parent of
   his life? or who can with impunity despise Him who, as ruler of all
   things, has true and everlasting power over all? If you consider Him in
   the character of Father, He supplies to us our entrance to the light
   which we enjoy: through Him we live, through Him we have entered into
   the abode [1793] of this world. If you contemplate Him as God, it is He
   who nourishes us with innumerable resources: it is He who sustains us,
   we dwell in His house, we are His household; [1794] and if we are less
   obedient than was befitting, and less attentive to our duty [1795] than
   the endless merits of our Master and Parent demanded: nevertheless it
   is, of great avail to our obtaining pardon, if we retain the worship
   and knowledge of Him; if, laying aside low and earthly affairs and
   goods, we meditate upon heavenly and divine things which are
   everlasting. And that we may be able to do this, God must be followed
   by us, God must be adored and loved; since there is in Him the
   substance [1796] of things, the principle [1797] of the virtues, and
   the source of all that is good.

   For what is greater in power than God, or more perfect in reason, or
   brighter in clearness? And since He begat us to wisdom, and produced us
   to righteousness, it is not allowable for man to forsake God, who is
   the giver of intelligence and life and to serve earthly and frail
   things, or, intent upon seeking temporal goods, to turn aside from
   innocence and piety. Vicious and deadly pleasures do not render a man
   happy; nor does opulence, which is the inciter of lusts; nor empty
   ambition; nor frail honours, by which the human soul, being ensnared
   and enslaved to the body, is condemned [1798] to eternal death: but
   innocence and righteousness alone, the lawful and due reward of which
   is immortality, which God from the beginning appointed for holy and
   uncorrupted minds, which keep themselves pure and uncontaminated from
   vices, and from every earthly impurity. Of this heavenly and eternal
   reward they cannot be partakers, who have polluted their conscience by
   deeds of violence, frauds, rapine, and deceits; and who, by injuries
   inflicted upon men, by impious actions, have branded themselves [1799]
   with indelible stains. Accordingly it is befitting that all who wish
   deservedly to be called wise, who wish to be called men, should despise
   frail things, should trample upon earthly things, and should look down
   upon base [1800] things, that they may be able to be united in a most
   blissful relationship with God.

   Let impiety and discords be removed; let turbulent and deadly
   dissensions be allayed, [1801] by which human societies and the divine
   union of the public league are broken in upon, divided, and dispersed;
   as far as we can, let us aim at being good and bounteous: if we have a
   supply of wealth and resources, let it not be devoted to the pleasure
   of a single person, but bestowed on the welfare of many. For pleasure
   is as short lived as the body to which it does service. But justice and
   kindness are as immortal as the mind and soul, which by good works
   attain to the likeness of God. Let God be consecrated by us, not in
   temples, but in our heart. All things which are made by the hand are
   destructible. [1802] Let us cleanse this temple, which is defiled not
   by smoke or dust, but by evil thoughts which is lighted not by blazing
   tapers [1803] but by the brightness and light of wisdom. And if we
   believe that God is always present in this temple, to whose divinity
   the secrets of the heart are open, we shall so live as always to have
   Him propitious, and never to fear His anger.

      Note by the American Editor.

   It is worth while to direct attention to (book vi. cap. 2) what our
   author has said of "true worship," just now, when the most violent and
   persistent efforts are made to sensualize Christian worship, and to
   explain away the testimony of the Ante-Nicene Fathers on this important
   subject. The argument of our author, in its entire drift, is as
   applicable to our own times as to his; and, deeply as I value beauty in
   the public worship of God, I cannot, as a Nicene Catholic, do less than
   adopt the universal sentiment of the early Fathers as to the limits of
   decoration.

On the Workmanship of God, or the Formation of Man

    A Treatise Addressed to His Pupil Demetrianus.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. I.--The Introduction, and Exhortation to Demetrianus. [1804]

   How disturbed I am, and in the greatest necessities, you will be able
   to judge from this little book which I have written to you,
   Demetrianus, almost in unadorned words, as the mediocrity of my talent
   permitted, that you might know my daily pursuit, and that I might not
   be wanting to you, even now an instructor, but of a more honourable
   subject and of a better system. For if you afforded yourself a ready
   hearer in literature, which did nothing else than form the style, how
   much more teachable ought you to be in these true studies, which have
   reference even to the life! And I now profess to you, that I am
   hindered by no necessity of circumstance or time from composing
   something by which the philosophers of our sect [1805] which we uphold
   may become better instructed and more learned for the future, although
   they now have a bad reputation, and are commonly reproved, as living
   otherwise than is befitting for wise men, and as concealing their vices
   under the covering of a name; whereas they ought either to have
   remedied them, or to have altogether avoided them, that they might
   render the name of wisdom happy and uncorrupted, their life itself
   agreeing with their precepts. I, however, shrink from no labour that I
   may at once instruct ourselves and others. For I am not able to forget
   myself, and especially at that time when it is most necessary for me to
   remember; as also you do not forget yourself, as I hope and wish. For
   although the necessity of the state may turn you aside from true and
   just works, yet it is impossible that a mind conscious of rectitude
   should not from time to time look to the heaven.

   I indeed rejoice that all things which are esteemed blessings turn out
   prosperously to you, but only on condition of their changing nothing of
   your state of mind. For I fear lest custom and the pleasantness of
   these subjects should, as usually happens, creep by degrees into your
   mind. Therefore I advise you,


   "And repeating it, will again and again advise you," [1806]

   not to believe that you have these enjoyments of the earth as great or
   true blessings, since they are not only deceitful because they are
   doubtful, but also treacherous because they are pleasant. For you know
   how crafty that wrestler and adversary of ours is, and also often
   violent, as we now see that he is. He employs all these things which
   are able to entice as snares, and with such subtilty that they escape
   the notice of the eyes of the mind, so that they cannot be avoided by
   the foresight of man. Therefore it is the highest prudence to advance
   step by step, since he occupies the passes on both sides, and secretly
   places stumbling-blocks for our feet. Accordingly I advise you, either
   to disregard, if you are able according to your virtue, your prosperity
   in which you live, or not to admire it greatly. Remember your true
   parent, and in what [1807] city you have given your name, and of what
   rank you have been. You understand assuredly what I say. For I do not
   charge you with pride, of which there is not even a suspicion in your
   case; but the things which I say are to be referred to the mind, not to
   the body, the whole system of which has been arranged on this account,
   that it may be in subjection to the soul as to a master, and may be
   ruled by its will. For it is in a certain manner an earthen vessel in
   which the soul, that is, the true man himself, is contained, and that
   vessel indeed not made by Prometheus, as the poets say, but by that
   supreme Creator and Artificer of the world, God, whose divine
   providence and most perfect excellence it is neither possible to
   comprehend by the perception, nor to express in word.

   I will attempt, however, since mention has been made of the body and
   soul, to explain the nature of each, as far as the weakness of my
   understanding sees through; and I think that this duty is especially to
   be undertaken on this account, because Marcus Tullius, a man of
   remarkable talent, in his fourth book on the Republic, when he had
   attempted to do this, concluded a subject of wide extent within narrow
   limits, lightly selecting the chief points. And that there might be no
   excuse, because he had not followed up this subject, he testified that
   neither inclination nor attention had been wanting to him. For in his
   first book concerning the Laws, when he was concisely summing up the
   same subject, he thus spoke: "Scipio, as it appears to me, has
   sufficiently expressed this subject in those books which you have
   read." Afterwards, however, in his second book concerning the Nature of
   the Gods, he endeavoured to follow up the same subject more
   extensively. But since he did not express it sufficiently even there, I
   will approach this office, and will take upon myself boldly to explain
   that which a man of the greatest eloquence has almost left untouched.
   Perhaps you may blame me for attempting to discuss something in matters
   of obscurity, when you see that there have been men of such rashness
   who are commonly called philosophers, that they scrutinized those
   things which God willed to be abstruse and hidden, and investigated the
   nature of things in heaven and on earth, which are far removed from us,
   and cannot be examined [1808] by the eyes, nor touched by the hand, nor
   perceived by the senses; and yet they so dispute concerning the nature
   of these things, as to wish that the things which they bring forward
   may appear to be proved and known. What reason is there, I pray, why
   any one should think it an invidious thing in us, if we wish to look
   into and contemplate the system of our body, [1809] which is not
   altogether obscure, because from the very offices of the limbs, and the
   uses of the several parts, it is permitted us to understand with what
   great power of providence each part has been made?

    Chap. II.--Of the Production of the Beasts and of Man.

   For our Creator and Parent, God, has given to man perception and
   reason, that it might be evident from this that we are descended from
   Him, because He Himself is intelligence, He Himself is perception and
   reason. Since He did not give that power of reason to the other
   animals, He provided beforehand in what manner their life might be more
   safe. For He clothed them all with their own natural hair, [1810] in
   order that they might more easily be able to endure the severity of
   frosts and colds. Moreover, He has appointed to every kind its own
   peculiar defence for the repelling of attacks from without; so that
   they may either oppose the stronger animals with natural weapons, or
   the feebler ones may withdraw themselves from danger by the swiftness
   of their flight, or those which require at once both strength and
   swiftness may protect themselves by craft, or guard themselves in
   hiding-places. [1811] And so others of them either poise themselves
   aloft with light plumage, or are supported by hoofs, [1812] or are
   furnished with horns; some have arms in their mouth--namely, their
   teeth [1813] --or hooked talons on their feet; and none of them is
   destitute of a defence for its own protection.

   But if any fall as a prey to the greater animals, that their race might
   not utterly perish, they have either been banished to that region where
   the greater ones cannot exist, or they have received a more abundant
   fruitfulness in production, that food might be supplied from them to
   the beasts which are nourished by blood, and yet their very multitude
   might survive the slaughter inflicted upon them, so as to preserve the
   race. [1814] But He made man--reason being granted to him, and the
   power of perceiving and speaking being given to him--destitute of those
   things which are given to the other animals, because wisdom was able to
   supply those things which the condition of nature had denied to him. He
   made him naked and defenceless, because he could be armed by his
   talent, and clothed by his reason. [1815] But it cannot be expressed
   how wonderfully the absence of those things which are given to the
   brutes contributes to the beauty of man. For if He had given to man the
   teeth of wild beasts, or horns, or claws, or hoofs, or a tail, or hairs
   of various colour, who cannot perceive how misshapen an animal he would
   be, as the dumb animals, if they were made naked and defenceless? For
   if you take from these the natural clothing of their body, or those
   things by which they are armed of themselves, they can be neither
   beautiful nor safe, so that they appear wonderfully furnished if you
   think of utility, and wonderfully adorned if you think of appearance:
   in such a wonderful manner is utility combined with beauty.

   But with reference to man, whom He formed an eternal and immortal
   being, He did not arm him, as the others, without, but within; nor did
   He place his protection in the body, but in the soul: since it would
   have been superfluous, when He had given him that which was of the
   greatest value, to cover him with bodily defences, especially when they
   hindered the beauty of the human body. On which account I am accustomed
   to wonder at the senselessness of the philosophers who follow Epicurus,
   who blame the works of nature, that they may show that the world is
   prepared and governed by no providence; [1816] but they ascribe the
   origin of all things to indivisible and solid bodies, from the
   fortuitous meetings of which they say that all things are and were
   produced. I pass by the things relating to the work itself with which
   they find fault, in which matter they are ridiculously mad; I assume
   that which belongs to the subject of which we are now treating.

    Chap. III.--Of the Condition of the Beasts and Man.

   They complain that man is born in a more feeble and frail condition
   than that in which the other animals are born: for that these, as soon
   as they are produced from the womb, immediately raise themselves on
   their feet, and express their joy by running to and fro, and are at
   once fit for enduring the air, inasmuch as they have come forth to the
   light protected by natural coverings; but man, on the contrary, being
   naked and defenceless, is cast forth, and driven, as it were, from a
   shipwreck, to the miseries of this life; who is neither able to move
   himself from the place where he has been born, [1817] nor to seek the
   nourishment of milk, nor to endure the injury of time. Therefore they
   say that Nature is not the mother of the human race, but a stepmother,
   who has dealt so liberally with the dumb creation, but has so produced
   man, that, without resources, and without strength, and destitute of
   all aid, he can do nothing else than give tokens [1818] of the state of
   his frailty by wailing and lamentations; "as well he may, whose destiny
   it is to go through in life so many ills." [1819]

   And when they say these things they are believed to be very wise,
   because every one without consideration is displeased with his own
   condition; but I contend that they are never more foolish than when
   they say these things. [1820] For when I consider the condition of
   things, I understand that nothing ought to have been otherwise than it
   is--not to say could have been otherwise, for God is able to do all
   things: but it must be, that that most provident majesty made that
   which was better and more right.

   I should like, therefore, to ask those censurers of the divine works,
   what they think to be wanting in man, on account of his being born in a
   more feeble condition. Do they think that men are, on this account,
   brought up worse? Or that they advance the less to the greatest
   strength of age? Or that weakness is a hindrance to their growth or
   safety, since reason bestows [1821] the things which are wanting? But,
   they say, the bringing up of man costs the greatest labours: in truth,
   the condition of the brute creation is better, because all these, when
   they have brought forth their young, have no care except for their own
   food; from which it is effected that, their teats being spontaneously
   distended, the nourishment of milk is supplied to their offspring, and
   that they seek this nourishment by the compulsion of nature, without
   any trouble on the part of the mothers. How is it with birds, which
   have a different nature? do they not undergo the greatest labours in
   bringing up their young, so that they sometimes appear to have
   something of human intelligence? For they either build their nests of
   mud, or construct them with twigs and leaves, and they sit upon the
   eggs without taking food; and since it has not been given to them to
   nourish their young from their own bodies, they convey to them food,
   and spend whole days in going to and fro in this manner; but by night
   they defend, cherish, and protect them. What more can men do? unless it
   be this only, that they do not drive away their young when grown up,
   but retain them bound by perpetual relationship and the bond of
   affection. Why should I say that the offspring of birds is much more
   fragile than that of man? Inasmuch as they do not bring forth the
   animal itself from the body of the mother, but that which, being warmed
   by the nourishment and heat of the body of the mother, produces the
   animal; and this, even when animated by breath, being unfledged and
   tender, is not only without the power of flying, but even of walking.
   Would he not, therefore, be most senseless, if any one should think
   that nature has dealt badly with birds, first, because they are twice
   born, and then because they are so weak, that they have to be nourished
   by food sought with labour by their parents? But they select the
   stronger, and pass by the more feeble animals.

   I ask, therefore, from those who prefer the condition of the beasts to
   their own, what they would choose if God should give them the choice:
   would they prefer the wisdom of man together with his weakness, or the
   strength of the beasts together with their nature? In truth, they are
   not so much like the beasts as not to prefer even a much more fragile
   condition, provided that it be human, to that strength of theirs
   unattended with reason. But, in truth, prudent men neither desire the
   reason of man together with frailty, nor the strength of the dumb
   animals without reason. Therefore it is nothing so repugnant or
   contradictory, [1822] that either reason or the condition of nature
   should of necessity prepare each animal. If it is furnished with
   natural protection, reason is superfluous. For what will it contrive?
   [1823] What will it do? Or what will it plan? Or in what will it
   display that light of the intellect, when Nature of its own accord
   grants those things which are able to be the result of reason? But if
   it be endued with reason, what need will there be of defences for the
   body, when reason once granted is able to supply the office of nature?
   And this has such power for the adorning and protection of man, that
   nothing greater or better can be given by God. Finally, since man is
   possessed of a body which is not great, and of slight strength, and of
   infirm health, nevertheless, since he has received that which is of
   greater value, he is better equipped than the other animals, and more
   adorned. For though he is born frail and feeble, yet he is safe from
   all the dumb animals, and all those which are born with greater
   strength, though they are able to bear patiently the inclemency of the
   sky, yet are unable to be safe from man. Thus it comes to pass that
   reason bestows more on man than nature does on the dumb animals; since,
   in their case, neither greatness of strength nor firmness of body can
   prevent them from being oppressed by us, or from being made subject to
   our power.

   Can any one, then, when he sees that even elephants, [1824] with their
   vast bodies and strength, are subservient to man, complain respecting
   God, the Maker of all things, because he has received moderate
   strength, and a small body; and not estimate according to their deserts
   the divine benefits towards himself, which is the part of an ungrateful
   man, or (to speak more truly) of a madman? Plato, I believe, that he
   might refute these ungrateful men, gave thanks to nature that he was
   born a man. [1825] How much better and more soundly did he act, who
   perceived that the condition of man was better, than they did who would
   have preferred that they had been born beasts! For if God should happen
   to change them into those animals whose condition they prefer to their
   own, they would now immediately desire to return to their previous
   state, and would with great outcries eagerly demand their former
   condition, because strength and firmness of body are not of such
   consequence that you should be without the office of the tongue; or the
   free course of birds through the air, that you should be without the
   hands. For the hands are of greater service than the lightness and use
   of the wings; the tongue is of greater service than the strength of the
   whole body. What madness is it, therefore, to prefer those things
   which, if they were given, you would refuse to receive!

    Chap. IV.--Of the Weakness of Man.

   They also complain that man is liable to diseases, and to untimely
   death. They are indignant, it appears, that they are not born gods. By
   no means, they say; but we show from this, that man was made with no
   foresight, which ought to have been otherwise. What if I shall show,
   that this very thing was foreseen with great reason, that he might be
   able to be harassed by diseases, and that his life might often be cut
   short in the midst of its course? For, since God had known that the
   animal which He had made, of its own accord passed to death, that it
   might be capable of receiving death itself, which is the dissolution of
   nature, He gave to it frailty, which might find an approach for death
   in order to the dissolution of the animal. For if it had been of such
   strength that disease and sickness could not approach it, not even
   could death, since death is the consequence of diseases. But how could
   a premature death be absent from him, for whom a mature death had been
   appointed? Assuredly they wish that no man should die, unless when he
   has completed his hundredth year. How can they maintain their
   consistency in so great an opposition of circumstances? For, in order
   that no one may be capable of dying before a hundred years, something
   of the strength which is immortal must be given to him; and when this
   is granted, the condition of death must necessarily be excluded. But of
   what kind can that be, which can render a man firm and impregnable
   against diseases and attacks from without? For, inasmuch as he is
   composed of bones, and nerves, and flesh, and blood, which of these can
   be so firm as to repel frailty and death? That man, therefore, may not
   be liable to dissolution before that time which they think ought to
   have been appointed for him, of what material will they assign to him a
   body? All things which can be seen and touched are frail. It remains
   that they seek something from heaven, since there is nothing on earth
   which is not weak.

   Since, therefore, man had to be so formed by God, that he should at
   some time be mortal, the matter itself required that he should be made
   with a frail and earthly body. It is necessary, therefore, that he
   should at some time receive death, since he is possessed of a body; for
   everybody is liable to dissolution and to death. Therefore they are
   most foolish who complain of premature death, since the condition of
   nature makes a place for it. Thus it will follow that he is subject
   also to diseases; for nature does not admit that infirmity can be
   absent from that body which is at some time to undergo dissolution. But
   let us suppose it to be possible, as they wish, that man is not born
   under those conditions by which he is subject to disease or death,
   unless, having completed the course of his life, he shall have arrived
   at the extremity of old age. They do not, therefore, see what would be
   the consequence if it were so arranged, that it would be plainly
   impossible to die at another time; but if any one can be deprived of
   nourishment by another, it will be possible for him to die. Therefore
   the case requires that man, who cannot die before an appointed day,
   should have no need of the nourishment of food, because it may be taken
   from him; but if he shall have no need of food, he will now not be a
   man, but will become a god. Therefore, as I have already said, they who
   complain of the frailty of man, make this complaint especially, that
   they were not born immortal and everlasting. No one ought to die unless
   he is old. On this account, in truth, he ought to die, because he is
   not God. But mortality cannot be united with immortality: for if a man
   is mortal in old age, he cannot be immortal in youth; neither is the
   condition of death foreign to him who is at some time about to die; nor
   is there any immortality to which a limit is appointed. Thus it comes
   to pass, that the exclusion of immortality for ever, and the reception
   of mortality for a time, place man in such a condition that he is at
   some time mortal.

   Therefore the necessity is in all points suitable, [1826] that he ought
   not to have been otherwise than he is, and that it was impossible. But
   they do not see the order of consequences, because they have once
   committed an error in the main point itself. For the divine providence
   having been excluded from the affairs of men, it necessarily followed
   that all things were produced of their own accord. Hence they invented
   the notion of those blows and fortuitous meetings together of minute
   seeds, because they did not see the origin of things. And when they had
   thrown themselves into this difficulty, necessity now compelled them to
   think that souls were born together with bodies, and in like manner
   were extinguished together with bodies; for they had made the
   assumption, that nothing was made by the divine mind. And they were
   unable to prove this in any other way, than by showing that there were
   some things in which the system of providence appeared to be at fault.
   [1827] Therefore they blamed those things in which providence
   wonderfully expressed its divinity, as those things which I have
   related concerning diseases and premature death; whereas they ought to
   have considered, these things being assumed, what would be the
   necessary consequences (but those things which I have spoken are the
   consequences) if he were not liable to diseases, and did not require a
   dwelling, nor clothing. For why should he fear the winds, or rains, or
   colds, the power of which consists in this, that they bring diseases?
   For on this account he has received wisdom, that he may guard his
   frailty against things that would injure him. The necessary consequence
   is, that since he is liable to diseases for the sake of retaining his
   wisdom, he must also be liable to death; because he to whom death does
   not come, must of necessity be firm. But infirmity has in itself the
   condition of death; but where there shall be firmness, neither can old
   age have any place, nor death, which follows old age.

   Moreover, if death were appointed for a fixed age, man would become
   most arrogant, and would be destitute of all humanity. For almost all
   the rights of humanity, by which we are united with one another, arise
   from fear and the consciousness of frailty. In short, all the more
   feeble and timid animals herd together, that, since they are unable to
   protect themselves by strength, they may protect themselves by their
   multitude; but the stronger animals seek solitudes, since they trust in
   their force and strength. [1828] If man also, in the same manner, had
   sufficient strength for the repelling of dangers, and did not stand in
   need of the assistance of any other, what society would there be? Or
   what system? What humanity? Or what would be more harsh than man? What
   more brutal? What more savage? But since he is feeble, and not able to
   live by himself apart from man, he desires society, that his life,
   passed in intercourse with others, may become both more adorned and
   more safe. You see, therefore, that the whole reason of man centres
   most of all in this, that he is born naked and fragile, that he is
   attacked by diseases, that he is punished by premature death. And if
   these things should be taken away from man, reason also, and wisdom,
   must necessarily be taken away. But I am discussing too long respecting
   things which are manifest, since it is clear that nothing ever was
   made, or could have been made, without providence. And if I should now
   wish to discuss respecting all its works in order, the subject would be
   infinite. But I have purposed to speak so much concerning the body of
   man only, that I may show in it the power of divine providence, how
   great it has been in those things only which are easy of comprehension
   and open; for those things which relate to the soul can neither be
   subjected to the eyes, nor comprehended. Now we speak concerning the
   vessel itself of man, which we see.

    Chap. V.--Of the Figures and Limbs of Animals.

   In the beginning, when God was forming the animals, He did not wish to
   conglobate [1829] and collect them into a round shape, that they might
   be able easily to put themselves in motion for walking, and to turn
   themselves in any direction; but from the highest part of the body He
   lengthened out the head. He also carried out to a greater length some
   of the limbs, which are called feet, that, being fixed on the ground
   with alternate motions, they might lead forward the animal wherever his
   inclination had borne him, or the necessity of seeking food had called
   him. Moreover, He made four limbs standing out from the very vessel of
   the body: two behind, which are in all animals--the feet; also two
   close to the head and neck, which supply various uses to animals. For
   in cattle and wild beasts they are feet like the hinder ones; but in
   man they are hands, which are produced not for walking, but for acting
   and controlling. [1830] There is also a third class, in which those
   former limbs are neither feet nor hands; but wings, which, having
   feathers arranged in order, supply the use of flying. [1831] Thus one
   formation has different forms and uses; and that He might firmly hold
   together the density itself of the body, by binding together greater
   and small bones, He compacted a kind of keel, which we call the spine;
   and He did not think fit to form it of one continued bone, lest the
   animal should not have the power of walking and bending itself. From
   its middle part, as it were, He has extended in a different direction
   transverse and flat bones, by which, being slightly curved, and almost
   drawn together to themselves as into a circle, the inward organs [1832]
   may be covered, that those parts which needed to be soft and less
   strong might be protected by the encircling of a solid framework.
   [1833] But at the end of that joining together which we have said to
   resemble the keel of a ship, He placed the head, in which might be the
   government of the whole living creature; and this name was given to it,
   as indeed Varro writes to Cicero, because from this the senses and the
   nerves take their beginning.

   But those parts, which we have said to be lengthened out from the body,
   either for the sake of walking, or of acting, or of flying, He would
   have to consist of bones, neither too long, for the sake of rapidity of
   motion, nor too short, for the sake of firmness, but of a few, and
   those large. For either they are two as in man, or four as in a
   quadruped. And these He did not make solid, lest in walking
   sluggishness and weight should retard; but He made them hollow, and
   full of marrow within, to preserve the vigour of the body. And again,
   He did not make them equally extended to the end; but He conglobated
   their extremities with coarse knots, that they might be able more
   easily to be bound with sinews, and to be turned more easily, from
   which they are called joints. [1834] These knots He made firmly solid,
   and covered with a soft kind of covering, which is called cartilage;
   for this purpose, that they might be bent without galling or any sense
   of pain. He did not, however, form these after one fashion. For He made
   some simple and round into an orb, in those joints at least in which it
   was befitting that the limbs should move in all directions, as in the
   shoulders, since it is necessary that the hands should move and be
   twisted about in any direction; but others He made broad, and equal,
   and round towards one part, and that plainly in those places where only
   it was necessary for the limbs to be bent, as in the knees, and in the
   elbows, and in the hands themselves. For as it was at the same time
   pleasant to the sight, and useful, that the hands should move in every
   direction from that position from which they spring; so assuredly, if
   this same thing should happen to the elbows, a motion of that kind
   would be at once superfluous and unbecoming. For then the hand, having
   lost the dignity which it now has, through its excessive flexibility,
   [1835] would appear like the trunk of an elephant; and man would be
   altogether snake-handed, [1836] --an instance of which has been
   wonderfully effected in that monstrous beast. For God, who wished to
   display His providence and power by a wonderful variety of many things,
   inasmuch as He had not extended the head of that animal to such a
   length that he might be able to touch the earth with his mouth, which
   would have been horrible and hideous, and because He had so armed the
   mouth itself with extended tusks, that even if he touched the earth the
   tusks would still deprive him of the power of feeding, He lengthened
   out between these from the top of the forehead a soft and flexible
   limb, by which he might be able to grasp and lay hold of anything, lest
   the prominent magnitude of the tusks, or the shortness of the neck,
   should interfere with the arrangement for taking food.

    Chap. VI.--Of the Error of Epicurus, and of the Limbs and Their Use.

   I cannot here be prevented from again showing the folly of Epicurus.
   For all the ravings of Lucretius [1837] belong to him, who, in order
   that he might show that animals are not produced by any contrivance of
   the divine mind, but, as he is wont to say, by chance, said that in the
   beginning of the world innumerable other animals of wonderful form and
   magnitude were produced; but that they were unable to be permanent,
   because either the power of taking food, or the method of uniting and
   generating, had failed them. It is evident that, in order to make a
   place for his atoms flying about through the boundless and empty space,
   he wished to exclude the divine providence. But when he saw that a
   wonderful system of providence is contained in all things which
   breathe, what vanity was it (O mischievous one!) to say that there had
   been animals of immense size, in which the system of production ceased!

   Since, therefore, all things which we see are produced with reference
   to a plan--for nothing but a plan [1838] can effect this very condition
   of being born--it is manifest that nothing could have been born without
   a plan. For it was previously foreseen in the formation of everything,
   how it should use the service of the limbs for the necessaries of life;
   and how the offspring, being produced from the union of bodies, might
   preserve all living creatures by their several species. For if a
   skilful architect, when he designs to construct some great building,
   first of all considers what will be the effect [1839] of the complete
   building, and previously ascertains by measurement what situation is
   suitable for a light weight, in what place a massive part of the
   structure will stand, what will be the intervals between the columns,
   what or where will be the descents and outlets of the falling waters
   and the reservoirs,--he first, I say, foresees these things, that he
   may begin together with the very foundations whatever things are
   necessary for the work when now completed,--why should any one suppose
   that, in the contrivance of animals, God did not foresee what things
   were necessary for living, before giving life itself? For it is
   manifest that life could not exist, unless those things by which it
   exists were previously arranged. [1840]

   Therefore Epicurus saw in the bodies of animals the skill of a divine
   plan; but that he might carry into effect that which he had before
   imprudently assumed, he added another absurdity agreeing with the
   former. For he said that the eyes were not produced for seeing, nor the
   ears for hearing, nor the feet for walking, since these members were
   produced before there was the exercise of seeing, hearing, and walking;
   but that all the offices of these members arose from them after their
   production. [1841] I fear lest the refutation of such extravagant and
   ridiculous stories should appear to be no less foolish; but it pleases
   me to be foolish, since we are dealing with a foolish man, lest he
   should think himself too clever. [1842] What do you say, Epicurus? Were
   not the eyes produced for seeing? Why, then, do they see? Their use, he
   says, afterwards showed itself. Therefore they were produced for the
   sake of seeing, since they can do nothing else but see. Likewise, in
   the case of the other limbs, use itself shows for what purpose they
   were produced. For it is plain that this use could have no existence,
   unless all the limbs had been made with such arrangement and foresight,
   that they might be able to have their use.

   For what if you should say, that birds were not made to fly, nor wild
   beasts to rage, nor fishes to swim, nor men to be wise, when it is
   evident that living creatures are subject to that natural disposition
   and office to which each was created? But it is evident that he who has
   lost the main point itself of the truth must always be in error. For if
   all things are produced not by providence, but by a fortuitous meeting
   together of atoms, why does it never happen by chance, that those first
   principles meet together in such a way as to make an animal of such a
   kind, that it might rather hear with its nostrils, smell with its eyes,
   and see [1843] with its ears? For if the first principles leave no kind
   of position untried, monstrous productions of this kind ought daily to
   have been brought forth, in which the arrangement of the limbs might be
   distorted, [1844] and the use far different from that which prevails.
   But since all the races of animals, and all the limbs, observe their
   own laws and arrangements, and the uses assigned to them, it is plain
   that nothing is made by chance, since a perpetual arrangement of the
   divine plan is preserved. But we will refute Epicurus at another time.
   Now let us discuss the subject of providence, as we have begun.

    Chap. VII.--Of All the Parts of the Body.

   God therefore connected and bound together the parts which strengthen
   [1845] the body, which we call bones, being knotted and joined to one
   another by sinews, which the mind might make use of, as bands, [1846]
   if it should wish to hasten forward or to lag behind; and, indeed,
   without any labour or effort, but with a very slight inclination, it
   might moderate and guide the mass of the whole body. But He covered
   these with the inward organs, [1847] as was befitting to each place,
   that the parts which were solid might be enclosed and concealed. Also
   He mixed with the inward organs, veins as streams divided through the
   whole body, through which the moisture and the blood, running in
   different directions, might bedew all the limbs with the vital juices;
   and He fashioned these inward organs after that manner which was
   befitting to each kind and situation, and covered them with skin drawn
   over them, which He either adorned with beauty only, or covered with
   thick hair, or fenced with scales, or adorned with brilliant feathers.
   But that is a wonderful contrivance of God, that one arrangement and
   one state exhibits innumerable varieties of animals. For in almost all
   things which breathe there is the same connection and arrangement of
   the limbs. For first of all is the head, and annexed to this the neck;
   also the breast adjoined to the neck, and the shoulders projecting from
   it, the belly adhering to the breast; also the organs of generation
   subjoined to the belly; in the last place, the thighs and feet. Nor do
   the limbs only keep their own course and position in all, but also the
   parts of the limbs. For in the head itself alone the ears occupy a
   fixed position, the eyes a fixed position, likewise the nostrils, the
   mouth also, and in the teeth and tongue. And though all these things
   are the same in all animals, yet there is an infinite and manifold
   diversity of the things formed; because those things of which I have
   spoken, being either more drawn out or more contracted, are
   comprehended by lineaments differing in various ways. What! is not that
   divine, that in so great a multitude of living creatures each animal is
   most excellent in its own class and species?--so that if any part
   should be taken from one to another, the necessary result would be,
   that nothing would be more embarrassed for use, nothing more unshapely
   to look upon; as if you should give a prolonged neck to an elephant, or
   a short neck to a camel; or if you should attach feet or hair to
   serpents, in which the length of the body equally stretched out
   required nothing else, except that being marked as to their backs with
   spots, and supporting themselves by their smooth scales, with winding
   courses they should glide into slippery tracts. But in quadrupeds the
   same designer lengthened out the arrangement of the spine, which is
   drawn out from the top of the head to a greater length on the outside
   of the body, and pointed it into a tail, that the parts of the body
   which are offensive might either be covered on account of their
   unsightliness, or be protected on account of their tenderness, so that
   by its motion certain minute and injurious animals might be driven away
   from the body; and if you should take away this member, the animal
   would be imperfect and weak. But where there is reason and the hand,
   that is not so necessary as a covering of hair. To such an extent are
   all things most befittingly arranged, each in its own class, that
   nothing can be conceived more unbecoming than a quadruped which is
   naked, or a man that is covered.

   But, however, though nakedness itself on the part of man tends in a
   wonderful manner to beauty, yet it was not adapted to his head; for
   what great deformity there would be in this, is evident from baldness.
   Therefore He clothed the head with hair; and because it was about to be
   on the top, He added it as an ornament, as it were, to the highest
   summit of the building. And this ornament is not collected into a
   circle, or rounded into the figure of a cap, lest it should be
   unsightly by leaving some parts bare; but it is freely poured forth in
   some places, and withdrawn in others, according to the comeliness of
   each place. Therefore, the forehead entrenched by a circumference, and
   the hair put forth from the temples before the ears, and the uppermost
   parts of these being surrounded after the manner of a crown, and all
   the back part of the head covered, display an appearance of wonderful
   comeliness. Then the nature of the beard contributes in an incredible
   degree to distinguish the maturity of bodies, or to the distinction of
   sex, or to the beauty of manliness and strength; so that it appears
   that the system of the whole work would not have been in agreement, if
   anything had been made otherwise than it is.

    Chap. VIII.--Of the Parts of Man: the Eyes and Ears.

   Now I will show the plan of the whole man, and will explain the uses
   and habits of the several members which are exposed to view in the
   body, or concealed. When, therefore, God had determined of all the
   animals to make man alone heavenly, and all the rest earthly, He raised
   him erect [1848] to the contemplation of the heaven, and made him a
   biped, doubtless that he might look to the same quarter from which he
   derives his origin; but He depressed the others to the earth, that,
   inasmuch as they have no expectation of immortality, being cast down
   with their whole body to the ground, they might be subservient to their
   appetite and food. And thus the right reason and elevated position of
   man alone, and his countenance, shared with and closely resembling God
   his Father, bespeak his origin and Maker. [1849] His mind, nearly
   divine, because it has obtained the rule not only over the animals
   which are on the earth, but even over his own body, being situated in
   the highest part, the head, as in a lofty citadel, looks out upon and
   observes all things. He formed this its palace, not drawn out and
   extended, as in the case of the dumb animals, but like an orb and a
   globe, because all [1850] roundness belongs to a perfect plan and
   figure. Therefore the mind and that divine fire is covered with it,
   [1851] as with a vault; [1852] and when He had covered its highest top
   with a natural garment, He alike furnished and adorned the front part
   which is called the face, with the necessary services of the members.

   And first, He closed the orbs of the eyes with concave apertures, from
   which boring [1853] Varro thought that the forehead [1854] derived its
   name; and He would have these to be neither less nor more than two,
   because no number is more perfect as to appearance than that of two: as
   also He made the ears two, the doubleness [1855] of which bears with it
   an incredible degree of beauty, both because each part is adorned with
   a resemblance, and that voices coming from both sides [1856] may more
   easily be collected. For the form itself is fashioned after a wonderful
   manner: because He would not have their apertures to be naked and
   uncovered, which would have been less becoming and less useful; since
   the voice might fly beyond the narrow space of simple caverns, and be
   scattered, did not the apertures themselves confine it, received
   through hollow windings and kept back from reverberation, like those
   small vessels, by the application of which narrow-mouthed vessels are
   accustomed to be filled.

   These ears, then, which have their name from the drinking [1857] in of
   voices, from which Virgil says, [1858]


   "And with these ears I drank in his voice;"

   or because the Greeks call the voice itself aude'n, from hearing,--the
   ears (aures) were named as though audes by the change of a letter,--God
   would not form of soft skins, which, hanging down and flaccid, might
   take away beauty; nor of hard and solid bones, lest, being stiff and
   immoveable, they should be inconvenient for use. But He designed that
   which might be between these, that a softer cartilage might bind them,
   and that they might have at once a befitting and flexible firmness. In
   these the office of bearing only is placed, as that of seeing is in the
   eyes, the acuteness of which is especially inexplicable and wonderful;
   for He covered their orbs, presenting the similitude of gems in that
   part with which they had to see, with transparent membranes, that the
   images of objects placed opposite them, being refracted [1859] as in a
   mirror, might penetrate to the innermost perception. Through these
   membranes, therefore, that faculty which is called the mind sees those
   things which are without; lest you should happen to think that we see
   either by the striking [1860] of the images, as the philosophers
   discuss, since the office of seeing ought to be in that which sees, not
   in that which is seen; or in the tension of the air together with the
   eyesight; or in the outpouring of the rays: since, if it were so, we
   should see the ray towards which we turn with our eyes, until the air,
   being extended together with the eyesight, or the rays being poured
   out, should arrive at the object which was to be seen.

   But since we see at the same moment of time, and for the most part,
   while engaged on other business, we nevertheless behold all things
   which are placed opposite to us, it is more true and evident that it is
   the mind which, through the eyes, sees those things which are placed
   opposite to it, as though through windows covered with pellucid crystal
   or transparent stone; [1861] and therefore the mind and inclination are
   often known from the eyes. For the refutation of which Lucretius [1862]
   employed a very senseless argument. For if the mind, he says, sees
   through the eye, it would see better if the eyes were torn out and dug
   up, inasmuch as doors being torn up together with the door-posts let in
   more light than if they were covered. Truly his eyes, or rather those
   of Epicurus who taught him, ought to have been dug out, that they might
   not see, that the torn-out orbs, and the burst fibres of the eyes, and
   the blood flowing through the veins, and the flesh increasing from
   wounds, and the scars drawn over at last can admit no light; unless by
   chance he would have it that eyes are produced resembling ears, so that
   we should see not so much with eyes as with apertures, than which there
   can be nothing more unsightly or more useless. For how little should we
   be able to see, if from the innermost recesses of the head the mind
   should pay attention through slight fissures of caverns; as, if any one
   should wish to look through a stalk of hemlock, he would see no more
   than the capability of the stalk itself admitted! For sight, therefore,
   it was rather needful that the members should be collected together
   into an orb, that the sight might be spread in breadth and the parts
   which adjoined them in the front of the face, that they might freely
   behold all things. Therefore the unspeakable power of the divine
   providence made two orbs most resembling each other, and so bound them
   together that they might be able not only to be altogether turned, but
   to be moved and directed with moderation. [1863] And He willed that the
   orbs themselves should be full of a pure and clear moisture, in the
   middle part of which sparks of lights might be kept shut up, which we
   call the pupils, in which, being pure and delicate, are contained the
   faculty and method of seeing. The mind therefore directs itself through
   these orbs that it may see, and the sight of both the eyes is mingled
   and joined together in a wonderful manner.

    Chap. IX.--Of the Senses and Their Power.

   It pleases me in this place to censure the folly of those who, while
   they wish to show that the senses are false, collect many instances in
   which the eyes are deceived; and among them this also, that all things
   appear double to the mad and intoxicated, as though the cause of that
   error were obscure. For it happens on this account, because there are
   two eyes. But hear how it happens. The sight of the eyes consists in
   the exertion of the soul. Therefore, since the mind, as has been above
   said, uses the eyes as windows, this happens not only to those who are
   intoxicated or mad, but even to those who are of sound mind, and sober.
   For if you place any object too near, it will appear double, for there
   is a certain interval and space in which the sight of the eyes meets
   together. Likewise, if you call the soul back as if to reflection, and
   relax the exertion of the mind, then the sight of each eye is drawn
   asunder, and they each begin to see separately.

   If you, again, exert the mind and direct the eyesight, whatever
   appeared double unites into one. What wonder, therefore, if the mind,
   impaired by poison and the powerful influence of wine, cannot direct
   itself to seeing, as the feet cannot to walking when they are weak
   through the numbness of the sinews, or if the force of madness raging
   against the brain disunites the agreement of the eyes? Which is so
   true, that in the case of one-eyed [1864] men, if they become either
   mad or intoxicated, it can by no means happen that they see any object
   double. Wherefore, if the reason is evident why the eyes are deceived,
   it is clear that the senses are not false: for they either are not
   deceived if they are pure and sound; or if they are deceived, yet the
   mind is not deceived which recognises their error.

    Chap. X.--Of the Outer Limbs of Man, and Their Use.

   But let us return to the works of God. That the eyes, therefore, might
   be better protected from injury, He concealed them with the coverings
   of the eyelashes, [1865] from which Varro thinks that the eyes [1866]
   derived their name. For even the eyelids themselves, in which there is
   the power of rapid motion, and to which throbbing [1867] gives their
   name, being protected by hairs standing in order, afford a most
   becoming fence to the eyes; the continual motion of which, meeting with
   incomprehensible rapidity, does not impede the course of the sight, and
   relieves the eyes. [1868] For the pupil--that is, the transparent
   membrane--which ought not to be drained and to become dry, unless it is
   cleansed by continual moisture so that it shines clearly, loses its
   power. [1869] Why should I speak of the summits of the eyebrows
   themselves, furnished with short hair? Do they not, as it were by
   mounds, both afford protection to the eyes, so that nothing may fall
   into them from above, [1870] and at the same time ornament? And the
   nose, arising from the confines of these, and stretched out, as it
   were, with an equal ridge, at once serves to separate and to protect
   the two eyes. Below also, a not unbecoming swelling of the cheeks,
   gently rising after the similitude of hills, makes the eyes safer on
   every side; and it has been provided by the great Artificer, that if
   there shall happen to be a more violent blow, it may be repelled by the
   projecting parts. But the upper part of the nose as far as the middle
   has been made solid; but the lower part has been made with a softened
   cartilage annexed to it, that it may be pliant [1871] to the use of the
   fingers. Moreover, in this, though a single member, three offices are
   placed: one, that of drawing the breath; the second, that of smelling;
   the third, that the secretions of the brain may escape through its
   caverns. And in how wonderful, how divine a manner did God contrive
   these also, so that the very cavity of the nose should not deform the
   beauty of the face: which would certainly have been the case if one
   single aperture only were open. But He enclosed and divided that, as
   though by a wall drawn through the middle, and made it most beautiful
   by the very circumstance of its being double. [1872] From which we
   understand of how much weight the twofold number, made firm by one
   simple connection, is to the perfection of things.

   For though the body is one, yet the whole could not be made up of
   single members, unless it were that there should be parts on the right
   hand or on the left. Therefore, as the two feet and also hands not only
   avail to some utility and practice either of walking or of doing
   something, but also bestow an admirable character and comeliness; so in
   the head, which is, as it were, the crown of the divine work, the
   hearing has been divided by the great Artificer into two ears, and the
   sight into two eyes, and the smelling into two nostrils, because the
   brain, in which is contained the system of the sensation, although it
   is one, yet is divided into two parts by the intervening membrane. But
   the heart also, which appears to be the abode of wisdom, although it is
   one, yet has two recesses within, in which are contained the living
   fountains of blood, divided by an intervening barrier: that as in the
   world itself the chief control, being twofold from simple matter, or
   simple from a twofold matter, governs and keeps together the whole; so
   in the body, all the parts, being constructed of two, might present an
   inseparable unity. Also how useful and how becoming is the appearance
   and the opening of the mouth transversely cannot be expressed; the use
   of which consists in two offices, that of taking food and speaking.

   The tongue enclosed within, which by its motions divides the voice into
   words, and is the interpreter of the mind, cannot, however, by itself
   alone fulfil the office of speaking, unless it strikes its edge against
   the palate, unless aided by striking against the teeth or by the
   compression of the lips. The teeth, however, contribute more to
   speaking: for infants do not begin to speak before they have teeth; and
   old men, when they have lost their teeth, so lisp that they appear to
   have returned afresh to infancy. But these things relate to man alone,
   or to birds, in which the tongue, being pointed and vibrating with
   fixed motions, expresses innumerable inflexions of songs and various
   kinds of sounds. It has, moreover, another office also, which it
   exercises in all, and this alone in the dumb animals, that it collects
   the food when bruised and ground by the teeth, and by its force presses
   it down when collected into balls, and transmits it to the belly.
   Accordingly, Varro thinks that the name of tongue was given to it from
   binding [1873] the food. It also assists the beasts in drinking: for
   with the tongue stretched out and hollowed they draw water; and when
   they have taken it in the hollow [1874] of the tongue, lest by slowness
   and delay it should flow away, they dash [1875] it against the palate
   with swift rapidity. This, therefore, is covered by the concave part of
   the palate as by a shell, [1876] and God has surrounded it with the
   enclosure of the teeth as with a wall.

   But He has adorned the teeth themselves, which are arranged in order in
   a wonderful manner, lest, being bare and exposed, [1877] they should be
   a terror rather than an ornament, with soft gums, which are so named
   from producing teeth, and then with the coverings of the lips; and the
   hardness of the teeth, as in a millstone, is greater and rougher than
   in the other bones, that they might be sufficient for bruising the food
   and pasture. But how befittingly has He divided [1878] the lips
   themselves, which as it were before were united! the upper of which,
   under the very middle of the nostrils, He has marked with a kind of
   slight cavity, as with a valley: He has gracefully spread out [1879]
   the lower for the sake of beauty. For, as far as relates to the
   receiving of flavour, he is deceived, whoever he is, who thinks that
   this sense resides in the palate; for it is the tongue by which
   flavours are perceived, and not the whole of it: for the parts of it
   which are more tender on either side, draw in the flavour with the most
   delicate perceptions. And though nothing is diminished from that which
   is eaten or drunk, yet the flavour in an indescribable manner
   penetrates to the sense, in the same way in which the taking of the
   smell detracts nothing from any material.

   And how beautiful the other parts are can scarcely be expressed. The
   chin, gently drawn down from the cheeks, and the lower part of it so
   closed that the lightly imprinted division appears to mark its extreme
   point: the neck stiff and well rounded: the shoulders let down as
   though by gentle ridges from the neck: the fore-arms [1880] powerful,
   and braced [1881] by sinews for firmness: the great strength of the
   upper-arms [1882] standing out with remarkable muscles: the useful and
   becoming bending of the elbows. What shall I say of the hands, the
   ministers of reason and wisdom? Which the most skilful Creator made
   with a flat and moderately concave bend, that if anything was to be
   held, it might conveniently rest upon them, and terminated them in the
   fingers; in which it is difficult to explain whether the appearance or
   the usefulness is greater. For the perfection and completeness of their
   number, and the comeliness of their order and gradation, and the
   flexible bending of the equal joints, and the round form of the nails,
   comprising and strengthening the tips of the fingers with concave
   coverings, lest the softness of the flesh should yield in holding any
   object, afford great adornment. But this is convenient for use, in
   wonderful ways, that one separated from the rest rises together with
   the hand itself, and is enlarged [1883] in a different direction,
   which, offering itself as though to meet the others, possesses all the
   power of holding and doing either alone, or in a special manner, as the
   guide and director of them all; from which also it received the name of
   thumb, [1884] because it prevails among the others by force and power.
   It has two joints standing out, not as the others, three; but one is
   annexed by flesh to the hand for the sake of beauty: for if it had been
   with three joints, and itself separate, the foul and unbecoming
   appearance would have deprived the hand of all grace.

   Again, the breadth of the breast, being elevated, and exposed to the
   eyes, displays a wonderful dignity of its condition; of which this is
   the cause, that God appears to have made man only, as it were,
   reclining with his face upward: for scarcely any other animal is able
   to lie upon its back. But He appears to have formed the dumb animals as
   though lying on one side, and to have pressed them to the earth. For
   this reason He gave them a narrow breast, and removed from sight, and
   prostrate [1885] towards the earth. But He made that of man open and
   erect, because, being full of reason given from heaven, it was not
   befitting that it should be humble or unbecoming. The nipples also
   gently rising, and crowned with darker and small orbs, add something of
   beauty; being given to females for the nourishment of their young, to
   males for grace only, that the breast might not appear misshapen, and,
   as it were, mutilated. Below this is placed the fiat surface of the
   belly, about the middle of which the navel distinguishes by a not
   unbecoming mark, being made for this purpose, that through it the
   young, while it is in the womb, may be nourished.

    Chap. XI.--Of the Intestines in Man, and Their Use.

   It necessarily follows that I should begin to speak of the inward parts
   also, to which has been assigned not beauty, because they are concealed
   from view, but incredible utility, since it was necessary that this
   earthly body should be nourished with some moisture from food and
   drink, as the earth itself is by showers and frosts. The most provident
   Artificer placed in the middle of it a receptacle for articles of food,
   by means of which, when digested and liquefied, it might distribute the
   vital juices to all the members. But since man is composed of body and
   soul, that receptacle of which I have spoken above affords nourishment
   only to the body; to the soul, in truth, He has given another abode.
   For He has made a kind of intestines soft and thin, [1886] which we
   call the lungs, into which the breath might pass by an alternate
   interchange; [1887] and He did not form this after the fashion of the
   uterus, lest the breath should all at once be poured forth, or at once
   inflate it. And on this account He did not make it a full intestine,
   [1888] but capable of being inflated, and admitting the air, so that it
   might gradually receive the breath; while the vital air is spread
   through that thinness, and might again gradually give it back, while it
   spreads itself forth from it: for the very alternation of blowing and
   breathing, [1889] and the process of respiration, support life in the
   body.

   Since, therefore, there are in man two receptacles,--one of the air
   which nourishes the soul, [1890] the other of the food which nourishes
   the body,--there must be two tubes [1891] through the neck for food,
   and for breath, the upper of which leads from the mouth to the belly,
   the lower from the nostrils to the lungs. And the plan and nature of
   these are different: for the passage which is from the mouth has been
   made soft, and which when closed always adheres [1892] to itself, as
   the month itself; since drink and food, being corporeal, make for
   themselves a space for passage, by moving aside and opening the gullet.
   The breath, on the other hand, which is incorporeal and thin, because
   it was unable to make for itself a space, has received an open way,
   which is called the windpipe. This is composed of flexible and soft
   bones, as though of rings fitted together after the manner of a hemlock
   stalk, [1893] and adhering together; and this passage is always open.
   For the breath can have no cessation in passing; because it, which is
   always passing to and fro, is checked as by a kind of obstacle through
   means of a portion of a member usefully sent down from the brain, and
   which is called the uvula, lest, drawn by pestilential air, it should
   come with impetuosity and spoil the slightness [1894] of its abode, or
   bring the whole violence of the injury upon the inner receptacles. And
   on this account also the nostrils are slightly open, which are
   therefore so named, because either smell or breath does not cease to
   flow [1895] through these, which are, as it were, the doors of this
   tube. Yet this breathing-tube lies open [1896] not only to the
   nostrils, but also to the mouth in the extreme regions of the palate,
   where the risings of [1897] the jaws, looking towards the uvula, begin
   to raise themselves into a swelling. And the reason of this arrangement
   is not obscure: for we should not have the power of speaking if the
   windpipe were open to the nostrils only, as the path of the gullet is
   to the mouth only; nor could the breath proceeding from it cause the
   voice, without the service of the tongue.

   Therefore the divine skill opened a way for the voice from that
   breathing-tube, so that the tongue might be able to discharge its
   office, and by its strokes divide into words the even [1898] course of
   the voice itself. And this passage, if by any means it is intercepted,
   must necessarily cause dumbness. For he is assuredly mistaken, whoever
   thinks that there is any other cause why men are dumb. For they are not
   tongue-tied, as is commonly believed; but they pour forth that vocal
   breath through the nostrils, as though bellowing, [1899] because there
   is either no passage at all for the voice to the mouth, or it is not so
   open as to be able to send forth the full voice. And this generally
   comes to pass by nature; sometimes also it happens by accident that
   this entrance is blocked up and does not transmit the voice to the
   tongue, and thus makes those who can speak dumb. And when this happens,
   the hearing also must necessarily be blocked up; so that because it
   cannot emit the voice, it is also incapable of admitting it. Therefore
   this passage has been opened for the purpose of speaking. It also
   affords this advantage, that in frequenting the bath, [1900] because
   the nostrils are not able to endure the heat, the hot air is taken in
   by the mouth; also, if phlegm contracted by cold shall have happened to
   stop up the breathing pores of the nostrils, we may be able to draw the
   air through the mouth, lest, if the passage [1901] should be
   obstructed, the breath should be stifled. But the food being received
   into the stomach, and mixed with the moisture of the drink, when it has
   now been digested by the heat, its juice, being in an indescribable
   manner diffused through the limbs, bedews and invigorates the whole
   body.

   The manifold coils also of the intestines, and their length rolled
   together on themselves, and yet fastened with one band, are a wonderful
   work of God. For when the stomach has sent forth from itself the food
   softened, it is gradually thrust forth through those windings of the
   intestines, so that whatever of the moisture by which the body is
   nourished is in them, is divided to all the members. And yet, lest in
   any place it should happen to adhere and remain fixed, which might have
   taken place on account of the turnings of the coils, [1902] which often
   turn back to themselves, and which could not have happened without
   injury, He has spread over [1903] these from within a thicker juice,
   that the secretions of the belly might more easily work their way
   through the slippery substance to their outlets. It is also a most
   skilful arrangement, that the bladder, which birds do not use, though
   it is separated from the intestines, and has no tube by which it may
   draw the urine from them, is nevertheless filled and distended with
   moisture. And it is not difficult to see how this comes to pass. For
   the parts of the intestines which receive the food and drink from the
   belly are more open than the other coils, and much more delicate. These
   entwine themselves around and encompass the bladder; and when the meat
   and the drink have arrived at these parts in a mixed state, the
   excrement becomes more solid, and passes through, but all the moisture
   is strained through those tender parts, [1904] and the bladder, the
   membrane of which is equally fine and delicate, absorbs and collects
   it, so as to send it forth where nature has opened an outlet.

    Chap. XII.--De Utero, Et Conceptione Atque Sexibus. [1905]

   De utero quoque et conceptione, quoniam de internis loquimur, dici
   necesse est, ne quid præ terisse videamur; quæ quamquam in operto
   latent, sensum tamen atque intelligentiam latere non possunt. Vena in
   maribus, quæ seminium continet, duplex est, paulo interior, quam illud
   humoris obscoeni receptaculum. Sicut enim renes duo sunt, itemque
   testes, ita et venæ seminales duæ, in una tamen compage cohæ rentes;
   quod videmus in corporibus animalium, cum interfecta [1906] patefiunt.
   Sed illa dexterior masculinum continet semen, sinisterior foemininum;
   et omnino in toto corpore pars dextra masculina est, sinistra veto
   foeminina. Ipsum semen quidam putant ex medullis tantum, quidam ex omni
   corpore ad venam genitalem confluere, ibique concrescere. Sed hoc,
   humana mens, quomodo fiat, non potest comprehendere. Item in foeminis
   uterus in duas se dividit partes, quæ in diversum diffussæ ac reflexæ,
   circumplicantur, sicut arietis cornua. Quæ pars in dextram retorquetur,
   masculina est; quæ in sinistram, foeminina.

   Conceptum igitur Varro et Aristoteles sic fieri arbitrantur. Aiunt non
   tantum maribus inesse semen, verum etiam foeminis, et inde plerumque
   matribus similes procreari; sed earum semensanguinem esse purgatum,
   quod si recte cum virili mixture sit, utraque concreta et simul
   co-agulata informari: et primum quidem cor hominis effingi, quod in eo
   sit et vita omnis et sapientia; denique totum opus quadragesimo die
   consummari. Ex abortionibus hæ c fortasse collecta sunt. In avium tamen
   foetibus primurn oculos fingi dubium non est, quod in ovis sæ pe
   deprehendimus. Unde fieri non posse arbitror quin fictio a capite sumat
   exordium.

   Similitudines autem in corporibus filiorum sic fieri putant. Cum semina
   inter se permixta coalescunt, si virile superaverit, patri similem
   provenire, seu marem, seu foeminam; si muliebre præ valuerit, progeniem
   cujusque sexus ad imaginem respondere maternam. Id autem præ valet e
   duobus, quod fuerit uberius; alterum enim quodammodo amplectitur et
   includit: hinc plerumque fled, ut unius tantum lineamenta præ tendat.
   Si vero æqua fuerit ex pari semente permixtio, figuras quoque misceri,
   ut soboles illa communis aut neutrum referre videatur, quia totum ex
   altero non habet; aut utrumque, quia partem de singulis mutuata est.
   Nam in cor-poribus animalium videmus aut confundi parentum colores, ac
   fieri tertium neutri generantium simile; aut utriusque sic exprimi, ut
   discoloribus membris per omne corpus concors mixtura varietur. Dispares
   quoque naturæ hoc modo fieri putantur. Cum forte in læ vam uteri partem
   masculinæ stirpis semen inciderit, marem quidem gigni opinatio est; sed
   quia sit in foeminina parte conceptus, aliquid in se habere foemineum,
   supra quam decus virile patiatur; vel formam insignem, vel nimium
   candorem, vel corporis levitatem, vel artus delicatos, vel staturam
   brevem, vel vocem gracilem, vel animum imbecillum, vel ex his plura.
   Item, si partem in dextram semen foeminini sexus influxerit, foeminam
   quidem procreari; sed quoniam in masculina parte concepta sit, habere
   in se aliquid virilita-tis, ultra quam sexus; ratio permittat; aut
   valida membra, aut immoderatam Iongitudinem, aut fuscum colorem, aut
   hispidam faciem, aut vulture indecorum, aut vocem robustam, aut animum
   audacem, aut ex his plura.

   Si vero masculinum in dexteram, foemininum in sinistram pervenerit,
   utrosque foetus recte provenire; ut et foeminis per omnia naturæ suæ
   decus constet, et maribus tam mente, quam corpore robur virile
   servetur. Istud vero ipsum quam mirabile institutum Dei, quod ad
   conservationem generum singulorum, duos sexus maris ac foeminæ
   machinatus est; quibus inter se per voluptatis illecebras copulatis,
   successiva soboles pareretur, ne omne genus viventium conditio
   mortalitatis extingueret. Sed plus roboris maribus attributum est, quo
   facilius ad patientiam jugi maritalis foeminæ cogerentur. Vir itaque
   nominatus est, quod major in eo vis est, quire in foemina; et hinc
   virtus nomen accepit. Item mulier (ut Varro interpretatur) a mollitie,
   immutata et detracta littera, velut mollier; cui suscepto foetu, cum
   partus appropinquare jam coepit, turgescentes mammæ dulcibus succis
   distenduntur, et ad nutrimenta nascentis fontibus lacteis foecundum
   pectus exuberat. Nec enim decebat aliud quam ut sapiens animal a corde
   alimoniam duceret. Idque ipsum solertissime comparatum est, ut candens
   ac pinguis humor teneritudinem novi corporis irrigaret, donec ad
   capiendos fortiores cibos, et dentibus instruatur, et viribus
   roboretur. Sed redeamus ad propositum, ut cæ tera, quæ supersunt,
   breviter explicemus.

    Chap. XIII.--Of the Lower Members.

   Poteram nunc ego ipsorum quoque genitalium membrorum mirificam rationem
   tibi exponere, nisi me pudor ab hujusmodi sermone revocaret: itaque a
   nobis indumento verecundiæ, quæ sunt pudenda velentur. Quod ad hanc rem
   attinet, queri satis est, homines impios ac profanos summum nefas
   admittere, qui divinum et admirabile Dei opus, ad propagandam
   successionem inexcogitabili ratione provisum et effectum, vel ad
   turpissimos quæ stus, vel ad obscoenæ libidinis pudenda opera
   convertunt, ut jam nihil aliud ex re sanctissima petant, quam inanem et
   sterilem voluptatem.

   How is it with respect to the other parts of the body? Are they without
   order and beauty? The flesh rounded off into the nates, how adapted to
   the office of sitting! and this also more firm than in the other limbs,
   lest by the pressure of the bulk of the body it should give way to the
   bones. Also the length of the thighs drawn out, and strengthened by
   broader muscles, in order that it might more easily sustain the weight
   of the body; and as this is gradually contracted, it is bounded [1907]
   by the knees, the comely joints [1908] of which supply a bend which is
   most adapted for walking and sitting. Also the legs not drawn out in an
   equal manner, lest an unbecoming figure should deform the feet; but
   they are at once strengthened and adorned by well-turned [1909] calves
   gently standing out and gradually diminishing.

   But in the soles of the feet there is the same plan as in the hands,
   but yet very different: for since these are, as it were, the
   foundations of the whole body, [1910] the admirable Artificer has not
   made them of a round appearance, lest man should be unable to stand, or
   should need other feet for standing, as is the case with quadrupeds;
   but He has formed them of a longer and more extended shape, that they
   might make the body firm by their flatness, [1911] from which
   circumstance their name was given to them. The toes are of the same
   number with the fingers, for the sake of appearance rather than
   utility; and on this account they are both joined together, and short,
   and put together by gradations; and that which is the greatest of
   these, since it was not befitting that it should be separated from the
   others, as in the hand, has been so arranged in order, that it appears
   to differ from the others in magnitude and the small space which
   intervenes. This beautiful union [1912] of them strengthens the
   pressure of the feet with no slight aid; for we cannot be excited to
   running, unless, our toes being pressed against the ground, and resting
   upon the soil, we take an impetus and a spring. I appear to have
   explained all things of which the plan is capable of being understood.
   I now come to those things which are either doubtful or obscure.

    Chap. XIV.--Of the Unknown Purpose of Some of the Intestines.

   It is evident that there are many things in the body, the force and
   purpose of which no one can perceive but He who made them. Can any one
   suppose that he is able to relate what is the advantage, and what the
   effect, of that slight transparent membrane by which the stomach is
   netted over and covered? What the twofold resemblance of the kidneys?
   which Varro says are so named because streams of foul moisture arise
   from these; which is far from being the case, because, rising on either
   side of the spine, they are united, and are separated from the
   intestines. What is the use of the spleen? What of the liver? Organs
   which appear as it were to be made up [1913] of disordered blood. What
   of the very bitter moisture of the gall? What of the heart? unless we
   shall happen to think that they ought to be believed, who think that
   the affection of anger is placed in the gall, that of fear in the
   heart, of joy in the spleen. But they will have it that the office of
   the liver is, by its embrace and heat, to digest the food in the
   stomach; some think that the desires of the amorous passions are
   contained in the liver.

   First of all, the acuteness of the human sense is unable to perceive
   these things, because their offices lie concealed; nor, when laid open,
   do they show their uses. For, if it were so, perhaps the more gentle
   animals would either have no gall at all, or less than the wild beasts;
   the more timid ones would have more heart, the more lustful would have
   more liver, the more playful more spleen. As, therefore, we perceive
   that we hear with our ears, that we see with our eyes, that we smell
   with our nostrils; so assuredly we should perceive that we are angry
   with the gall, that we desire with the liver, that we rejoice with the
   spleen. Since, therefore, we do not at all perceive from what part
   those affections come, it is possible that they may come from another
   source, and that those organs may have a different effect to that which
   we suppose. We cannot prove, however, that they who discuss these
   things speak falsely. But I think that all things which relate to the
   motions of the mind and soul, are of so obscure and profound a nature,
   that it is beyond the power of man to see through them clearly. This,
   however, ought to be sure and undoubted, that so many objects and so
   many organs have one and the same office--to retain the soul in the
   body. But what office is particularly assigned to each, who can know,
   except the Designer, to whom alone His own work is known?

    Chap. XV.--Of the Voice.

   But what account can we give of the voice? Grammarians, indeed, and
   philosophers, define the voice to be air struck by the breath; from
   which words [1914] derive their name: which is plainly false. For the
   voice is not produced outside of the mouth, but within, and therefore
   that opinion is more probable, that the breath, being compressed, when
   it has struck against the obstacle presented by the throat, forces out
   the sound of the voice: as when we send down the breath into an open
   hemlock stalk, having applied it to the lips, and the breath,
   reverberating from the hollow of the stalk, and rolled back from the
   bottom, while it returns [1915] to that descending through meeting with
   itself, striving for an outlet, produces a sound; and the wind,
   rebounding by itself, is animated into vocal breath. Now, whether this
   is true, God, who is the designer, may see. For the voice appears to
   arise not from the mouth, but from the innermost breast. In fine, even
   when the mouth is closed, a sound such as is possible is emitted from
   the nostrils. Moreover, also, the voice is not affected by that
   greatest breath with which we gasp, but with a light and not compressed
   breath, as often as we wish. It has not therefore been comprehended in
   what manner it takes place, or what it is altogether. And do not
   imagine that I am now falling into the opinion of the Academy, for all
   things are not incomprehensible. For as it must be confessed that many
   things are unknown, since God has willed that they should exceed the
   understanding of man; so, however, it must be acknowledged that there
   are many which may both be perceived by the senses and comprehended by
   the reason. But we shall devote an entire treatise to the refutation of
   the philosophers. Let us therefore finish the course over which we are
   now running.

    Chap. XVI.--Of the Mind and Its Seat.

   That the nature of the mind is also incomprehensible, who can be
   ignorant, but he who is altogether destitute of mind, since it is not
   known in what place the mind is situated, or of what nature it is?
   Therefore various things have been discussed by philosophers concerning
   its nature and place. But I will not conceal what my own sentiments
   are: not that I should affirm that it is so--for in a doubtful matter
   it is the part of a foolish person to do this; but that when I have set
   forth the difficulty of the matter, you may understand how great is the
   magnitude off the divine works. Some would have it, that the seat of
   the mind is in the breast. But if this is so, how wonderful is it, that
   a faculty which is situated in an obscure and dark habitation should be
   employed in so great a light of reason and intelligence; then that the
   senses from every part of the body come together to it, so that it
   appears to be present in any quarter of the limbs! Others have said
   that its seat is in the brain and, indeed, they have used probable
   arguments, saying that it was doubtless befitting that that which had
   the government of the whole body should especially have its abode in
   the highest place, as though in the citadel of the body; and that
   nothing should be in a more elevated position than that which governs
   the whole by reason, just as the Lord Himself, and Ruler of the
   universe, is in the highest place. Then they say, that the organs which
   are the ministers of each sense, that is, of hearing, and seeing, and
   smelling, are situated in the head, and that the channels of all these
   lead not to the breast, but to the brain: otherwise we must be more
   slow in the exercise of our senses, until the power of sensation by a
   long course should descend through the neck even to the breast. These,
   in truth, do not greatly err, or perchance not at all. For the mind,
   which exercises control over the body, appears to be placed in the
   highest part, the head, as God is in heaven; but when it is engaged in
   any reflection, it appears to pass to the breast, and, as it were, to
   withdraw to some secret recess, that it may elicit and draw forth
   counsel, as it were, from a hidden treasury. And therefore, when we are
   intent upon reflection, and when the mind, being occupied, has
   withdrawn itself to the inner depth, [1916] we are accustomed neither
   to hear the things which sound about us, nor to see the things which
   stand in our way. But whether this is the case, it is assuredly a
   matter of admiration how this takes place, since there is no passage
   from the brain to the breast. But if it is not so, nevertheless it is
   no less a matter of admiration that, by some divine plan or other, it
   is caused that it appears to be so. Can any fail to admire that that
   living and heavenly faculty which is called the mind or the soul, is of
   such volubility [1917] that it does not rest even then when it is
   asleep; of such rapidity, that it surveys the whole heaven at one
   moment of time; and, if it wills, flies over seas, traverses lands and
   cities,--in short, places in its own sight all things which it pleases,
   however far and widely they are removed?

   And does any one wonder if the divine mind of God, being extended
   [1918] through all parts of the universe, runs to and fro, and rules
   all things, governs all things, being everywhere present, everywhere
   diffused; when the strength and power of the human mind, though
   enclosed within a mortal body, is so great, that it can in no way be
   restrained even by the barriers of this heavy and slothful body, to
   which it is bound, from bestowing upon itself, in its impatience of
   rest, the power of wandering without restraint? Whether, therefore, the
   mind has its dwelling in the head or in the breast, can any one
   comprehend what power of reason effects, that that incomprehensible
   faculty either remains fixed in the marrow of the brain, or in that
   blood divided into two parts [1919] which is enclosed in the heart; and
   not infer from this very circumstance how great is the power of God,
   because the soul does not see itself, or of what nature or where it is;
   and if it did see, yet it would not be able to perceive in what manner
   an incorporeal substance is united with one which is corporeal? Or if
   the mind has no fixed locality, but runs here and there scattered
   through the whole body,--which is possible, and was asserted by
   Xenocrates, the disciple of Plato,--then, inasmuch as intelligence is
   present in every part of the body, it cannot be understood what that
   mind is, or what its qualities are, since its nature is so subtle and
   refined, that, though infused into solid organs by a living and, as it
   were, ardent perception, it is mingled with all the members.

   But take care that you never think it probable, as Aristoxenus said,
   that the mind has no existence, but that the power of perception exists
   from the constitution of the body and the construction of the organs,
   as harmony does in the case of the lyre. For musicians call the
   stretching and sounding of the strings to entire strains, without any
   striking of notes in agreement with them, harmony. They will have it,
   therefore, that the soul in man exists in a manner like that by which
   harmonious modulation exists on the lyre; namely, that the firm uniting
   of the separate parts of the body and the vigour of all the limbs
   agreeing together, makes that perceptible motion, and adjusts [1920]
   the mind, as well-stretched things produce harmonious sound. And as, in
   the lyre, when anything has been interrupted or relaxed, the whole
   method of the strain is disturbed and destroyed; so in the body, when
   any part of the limbs receives an injury, the whole are weakened, and
   all being corrupted and thrown into confusion, the power of perception
   is destroyed: and this is called death. But he, if he had possessed any
   mind, would never have transferred harmony from the lyre to man. For
   the lyre cannot of its own accord send forth a sound, so that there can
   be in this any comparison and resemblance to a living person; but the
   soul both reflects and is moved of its own accord. But if there were in
   us anything resembling harmony, it would be moved by a blow from
   without, as the strings of the lyre are by the hands; whereas without
   the handling of the artificer, and the stroke of the fingers, they lie
   mute and motionless. But doubtless he [1921] ought to have beaten by
   the hand, that he might at length observe; for his mind, badly
   compacted from his members, was in a state of torpor.

    Chap. XVII.--Of the Soul, and the Opinion of Philosophers Concerning It.

   It remains to speak of the soul, although its system and nature cannot
   be perceived. Nor, therefore, do we fail to understand that the soul is
   immortal, since whatever is vigorous and is in motion by itself at all
   times, and cannot be seen or touched, must he eternal. But what the
   soul is, is not yet agreed upon by philosophers, and perhaps will never
   be agreed upon. For some have said that it is blood, others that it is
   fire, others wind, from which it has received its name of anima, or
   animus, because in Greek the wind is called anemos [1922] and yet none
   of these appears to have spoken anything. For if the soul appears to be
   extinguished when the blood is poured forth through a wound, or is
   exhausted by the heat of fevers, it does not therefore follow that the
   system of the soul is to be placed in the material of the blood; as
   though a question should arise as to the nature of the light which we
   make use of, and the answer should be given that it is oil, for when
   that is consumed the light is extinguished: since they are plainly
   different, but the one is the nourishment of the other. Therefore the
   soul appears to be like light, since it is not itself blood, but is
   nourished by the moisture of the blood, as light is by oil.

   But they who have supposed it to be fire made use of this argument,
   that when the soul is present the body is warm, but on its departure
   the body grows cold. But fire is both without perception and is seen,
   and burns when touched. But the soul is both endowed with perception
   and cannot be seen, and does not burn. From which it is evident that
   the soul is something like God. But they who suppose that it is wind
   are deceived by this, because we appear to live by drawing breath from
   the air. Varro gives this definition: "The soul is air conceived in the
   mouth, warmed in the lungs, heated in the heart, diffused into the
   body." These things are most plainly false. For I say that the nature
   of things of this kind is not so obscure, that we do not even
   understand what cannot be true. If any one should say to me that the
   heaven is of brass, or crystal, or, as Empedocles says, that it is
   frozen air, must I at once assent because I do not know of what
   material the heaven is? For as I know not this, I know that. Therefore
   the soul is not air conceived in the mouth, because the soul is
   produced much before air can be conceived in the mouth. For it is not
   introduced into the body after birth, as it appears to some
   philosophers, but immediately after conception, when the divine
   necessity has formed the offspring in the womb; for it so lives within
   the bowels of its mother, that it is increased in growth, and delights
   to bound with repeated beatings. In short, there must be a miscarriage
   if the living young within shall die. The other parts of the definition
   have reference to this, that during those nine months in which we were
   in the womb we appear to have been dead. None, therefore, of these
   three opinions is true. We cannot, however, say that they who held
   these sentiments were false to such an extent that they said nothing at
   all; for we live at once by the blood, and heat, and breath. But since
   the soul exists in the body by the union of all these, they did not
   express what it was in its own proper sense; [1923] for as it cannot be
   seen, so it cannot be expressed.

    Chap. XVIII.--Of the Soul and the Mind, and Their Affections.

   There follows another, and in itself an inexplicable inquiry: Whether
   the soul and the mind are the same, or there be one faculty by which we
   live, and another by which we perceive and have discernment. [1924]
   There are not wanting arguments on either side. For they who say that
   they are one faculty make use of this argument, that we cannot live
   without perception, nor perceive without life, and therefore that that
   which is incapable of separation cannot be different; but that whatever
   it is, it has the office of living and the method of perception. On
   which account two [1925] Epicurean poets speak of the mind and the soul
   indifferently. But they who say that they are different argue in this
   way: That the mind is one thing, and the soul another, may be
   understood from this, that the mind may be extinguished while the soul
   is uninjured, which is accustomed to happen in the case of the insane;
   also, that the soul is put to rest [1926] by death, the mind by sleep,
   and indeed in such a manner that it is not only ignorant of what is
   taking place, [1927] or where it is, but it is even deceived by the
   contemplation of false objects. And how this takes place cannot
   accurately be perceived; why it takes place can be perceived. For we
   can by no means rest unless the mind is kept occupied by the
   similitudes [1928] of visions. But the mind lies hid, oppressed with
   sleep, as fire buried [1929] by ashes drawn over it; but if you stir it
   a little it again blazes, and, as it were, wakes up. [1930] Therefore
   it is called away by images, [1931] until the limbs, bedewed with
   sleep, are invigorated; for the body while the perception is awake,
   although it lies motionless, yet is not at rest, because the perception
   burns in it, and vibrates as a flame, and keeps all the limbs bound to
   itself.

   But when the mind is transferred from its application to the
   contemplation of images, then at length the whole body is resolved into
   rest. But the mind is transferred from dark thought, when, under the
   influence of darkness, it has begun to be alone with itself. While it
   is intent upon those things concerning which it is reflecting, sleep
   suddenly creeps on, and the thought itself imperceptibly turns aside to
   the nearest appearances: [1932] thus it begins also to see those things
   which it had placed before its eyes. Then it proceeds further, and
   finds diversions [1933] for itself, that it may not interrupt the most
   healthy repose of the body. For as the mind is diverted in the day by
   true sights, so that it does not sleep; so is it diverted in the night
   by false sights, so that it is not aroused. For if it perceives no
   images, it will follow of necessity either that it is awake, or that it
   is asleep in perpetual death. Therefore the system of dreaming has been
   given by God for the sake of sleeping; and, indeed, it has been given
   to all animals in common; but this especially to man, that when God
   gave this system on account of rest, He left to Himself the power of
   teaching man future events by means of the dream. [1934] For narratives
   often testify that there have been dreams which have had an immediate
   and a remarkable accomplishment, [1935] and the answers of our prophets
   have been after the character of a dream. [1936] On which account they
   are not always true, nor always false, as Virgil testified, [1937] who
   supposed that there were two gates for the passage of dreams. But those
   which are false are seen for the sake of sleeping; those which are true
   are sent by God, that by this revelation we may learn impending goods
   or evils.

    Chap. XIX.--Of the Soul, and It Given by God.

   A question also may arise respecting this, whether the soul is produced
   from the father, or rather from the mother, or indeed from both. But I
   think that this judgment is to be formed as though in a doubtful
   matter. [1938] For nothing is true of these three opinions, because
   souls are produced neither from both nor from either. For a body may be
   produced from a body, since something is contributed from both; but a
   soul cannot be produced from souls, because nothing can depart from a
   slight and incomprehensible subject. Therefore the manner of the
   production of souls belongs entirely to God alone.


   "In fine, we are all sprung from a heavenly seed, all have that same
   Father."

   as Lucretius [1939] says. For nothing but what is mortal can be
   generated from mortals. Nor ought he to be deemed a father who in no
   way perceives that he has transmitted or breathed a soul from his own;
   nor, if he perceives it, comprehends in his mind when or in what manner
   that effect is produced.

   From this it is evident that souls are not given by parents, but by one
   and the same God and Father of all, who alone has the law and method of
   their birth, since He alone produces them. For the part of the earthly
   parent is nothing more than with a sense of pleasure to emit the
   moisture of the body, in which is the material of birth, or to receive
   it; and to this work man's power is limited, [1940] nor has he any
   further power. Therefore men wish for the birth of sons, because they
   do not themselves bring it about. Everything beyond this is the work of
   God,--namely, the conception itself, and the moulding of the body, and
   the breathing in of life, and the bringing forth in safety, and
   whatever afterwards contributes to the preservation of man: it is His
   gift that we breathe, that we live, and are vigorous. For, besides that
   we owe it to His bounty that we are safe in body, and that He supplies
   us with nourishment from various sources, He also gives to man wisdom,
   which no earthly father can by any means give; and therefore it often
   happens that foolish sons are born from wise parents, and wise sons
   from foolish parents, which some persons attribute to fate and the
   stars. But this is not now the time to discuss the subject of fate. It
   is sufficient to say this, that even if the stars hold together the
   efficacy of all things, it is nevertheless certain that all things are
   done by God, who both made and set in order the stars themselves. They
   are therefore senseless who detract this power from God, and assign it
   to His work.

   He would have it, therefore, to be in our own power, whether we use or
   do not use this divine and excellent gift of God. For, having granted
   this, He bound man himself by the mystery [1941] of virtue, by which he
   might be able to gain life. For great is the power, great the reason,
   great the mysterious purpose of man; and if any one shall not abandon
   this, nor betray his fidelity and devotedness, he must be happy: he, in
   short, to sum up the matter in few words, must of necessity resemble
   God. For he is in error whosoever judges of [1942] man by his flesh.
   For this worthless body [1943] with which we are clothed is the
   receptacle of man. [1944] For man himself, can neither be touched, nor
   looked upon, nor grasped, because he lies hidden within this body,
   which is seen. And if he shall be more luxurious and delicate in this
   life than its nature demands, if he shall despise virtue, and give
   himself to the pursuit of fleshly lusts, he will fall and be pressed
   down to the earth; but if (as his duty is) he shall readily and
   constantly maintain his position, which is right for him, and he has
   rightly obtained, [1945] --if he shall not be enslaved to the earth,
   which he ought to trample upon and overcome, he will gain eternal life.

    Chap. XX.--Of Himself and the Truth.

   These things I have written to you, Demetrianus, for the present in few
   words, and perhaps with more obscurity than was befitting, in
   accordance with the necessity of circumstances and the time, with which
   you ought to be content, since you are about to receive more and better
   things if God shall favour us. Then, accordingly, I will exhort you
   with greater clearness and truth to the learning of true philosophy.
   For I have determined to commit to writing as many things as I shall be
   able, which have reference to the condition of a happy life; and that
   indeed against the philosophers, since they are pernicious and weighty
   for the disturbing of the truth. For the force of their eloquence is
   incredible, and their subtlety in argument and disputation may easily
   deceive any one; and these we will refute partly by our own weapons,
   but partly by weapons borrowed from their mutual wrangling, so that it
   may be evident that they rather introduced error than removed it.

   Perhaps you may wonder that I venture to undertake so great a deed.
   Shall we then suffer the truth to be extinguished or crushed? I, in
   truth, would more willingly fail even under this burthen. For if Marcus
   Tullius, the unparalleled example of eloquence itself, was often
   vanquished by men void of learning and eloquence,--who, however, were
   striving for that which was true,--why should we despair that the truth
   itself will by its own peculiar force and clearness avail against
   deceitful and captious eloquence? They indeed are wont to profess
   themselves advocates of the truth; but who can defend that which he has
   not learned, or make clear to others that which he himself does not
   know? I seem to promise a great thing; but there is need of the favour
   of Heaven, that ability and time may be given us for following our
   purpose. But if life is to be wished for by a wise man, assuredly I
   should wish to live for no other reason than that I may effect
   something which may be worthy of life, and which may be useful to my
   readers, if not for eloquence, because there is in me but a slight
   stream of eloquence, at any rate for living, which is especially
   needful. And when I have accomplished this, I shall think that I have
   lived enough, and that I have discharged the duty of a man, if my
   labour shall have freed some men from errors, and have directed them to
   the path which leads to heaven.

    General Note by the American Editor.

   Just here I economize a little spare room to note the cynical Gibbon's
   ideas about Lactantius and his works. He quotes him freely, and
   recognises his Ciceronian Latinity, and even the elegance of his
   rhetoric, and the spirit and eloquence with which he can garnish the
   "dismal tale" of coming judgments, based on the Apocalypse. But then,
   again [1946] he speaks of him as an "obscure rhetorician," and affects
   a doubt as to his sources of information, notably in doubting the
   conversation between Galerius and Diocletian which forced the latter to
   abdicate. This is before he decides to attribute the work on the Deaths
   of Persecutors to somebody else, or, rather, to quote its author
   ambiguously as Cæcilius. And here we may insert what he says on this
   subject, as follows:--

   "It is certain that this...was composed and published while Licinius,
   sovereign of the East, still preserved the friendship of Constantine
   and of the Christians. Every reader of taste must perceive that the
   style is of a very different and inferior character to that of
   Lactantius; and such, indeed, is the judgment of Le Clerc [1947] and
   Lardner. [1948] Three arguments (from the title of the book and from
   the names of Donatus and Cæcilius) are produced by the advocates of
   Lactantius. [1949] Each of these proofs is, singly, weak and defective;
   but their concurrence has great weight. I have often fluctuated, and
   shall tamely [1950] follow the Colbert ms. in calling the author,
   whoever he was, Cæcilius."

   After this the critic adheres to this ambiguity. I have no wish to
   argue otherwise. Quite as important are his notes on the Institutes. He
   states the probable conjecture of two original editions,--the one under
   Diocletian, and the other under Licinius. Then he says: [1951] --

   "I am almost convinced that Lactantius dedicated his Institutions to
   the sovereign of Gaul at a time when Galerius, Maximin, and even
   Licinius, persecuted the Christians; that is, between the years a.d.
   306 and a.d. 311."

   On the dubious passages [1952] he remarks: [1953] --

   "The first and most important of these is, indeed, wanting in
   twenty-eight mss., but is found in nineteen. If we weigh the
   comparative value of those mss., one, ... in the King of France's
   library, [1954] may be alleged in its favour. But the passage is
   omitted in the correct ms. of Bologna, which the Père de Montfaucon
   [1955] ascribes to the sixth or seventh century. The taste of most of
   the editors [1956] has felt the genuine style of Lactantius."

   Do not many indications point to the natural suggestion of a third
   original edition, issued after the conversion of Constantine? Or the
   questionable passages may be the interpolations of Lactantius himself.

  Of the Manner in Which the Persecutors Died. [1957] [1958]

      Addressed to Donatus.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. I.

   The Lord has heard those supplications which you, my best beloved
   Donatus, [1959] pour forth in His presence all the day long, and the
   supplications of the rest of our brethren, who by a glorious confession
   have obtained an everlasting crown, the reward of their faith. Behold,
   all the adversaries are destroyed, and tranquillity having been
   re-established throughout the Roman empire, the late oppressed Church
   arises again, and the temple of God, overthrown by the hands of the
   wicked, is built with more glory than before. For God has raised up
   princes to rescind the impious and sanguinary edicts of the tyrants and
   provide for the welfare of mankind; so that now the cloud of past times
   is dispelled, and peace and serenity gladden all hearts. And after the
   furious whirlwind and black tempest, the heavens are now become calm,
   and the wished-for light has shone forth; and now God, the hearer of
   prayer, by His divine aid has lifted His prostrate and afflicted
   servants from the ground, has brought to an end the united devices of
   the wicked, and wiped off the tears from the faces of those who
   mourned. They who insulted over the Divinity, lie low; they who cast
   down the holy temple, are fallen with more tremendous ruin; and the
   tormentors of just men have poured out their guilty souls amidst
   plagues inflicted by Heaven, and amidst deserved tortures. For God
   delayed to punish them, that, by great and marvellous examples, He
   might teach posterity that He alone is God, and that with fit vengeance
   He executes judgment on the proud, the impious, and the persecutors.
   [1960]

   Of the end of those men I have thought good to publish a narrative,
   that all who are afar off, and all who shall arise hereafter, may learn
   how the Almighty manifested His power and sovereign greatness in
   rooting out and utterly destroying the enemies of His name. And this
   will become evident, when I relate who were the persecutors of the
   Church from the time of its first constitution, and what were the
   punishments by which the divine Judge, in His severity, took vengeance
   on them.

    Chap. II.

   In the latter days of the Emperor Tiberius, in the consulship of
   Ruberius Geminus and Fufius Geminus, and on the tenth of the kalends of
   April, [1961] as I find it written, Jesus Christ was crucified by the
   Jews. [1962] After He had risen again on the third day, He gathered
   together His apostles, whom fear, at the time of His being laid hold
   on, had put to flight; and while He sojourned with them forty days, He
   opened their hearts, interpreted to them the Scripture, which hitherto
   had been wrapped up in obscurity, ordained and fitted them for the
   preaching of His word and doctrine, and regulated all things concerning
   the institutions of the New Testament; and this having been
   accomplished, a cloud and whirlwind enveloped Him, and caught Him up
   from the sight of men unto heaven.

   His apostles were at that time eleven in number, to whom were added
   Matthias, in the room of the traitor Judas, and afterwards Paul. Then
   were they dispersed throughout all the earth to preach the Gospel, as
   the Lord their Master had commanded them; and during twenty-five years,
   and until the beginning of the reign of the Emperor Nero, they occupied
   themselves in laying the foundations of the Church in every province
   and city. And while Nero reigned, the Apostle Peter came to Rome, and,
   through the power of God committed unto him, wrought certain miracles,
   and, by turning many to the true religion, built up a faithful and
   stedfast temple unto the Lord. When Nero heard of those things, and
   observed that not only in Rome, but in every other place, a great
   multitude revolted daily from the worship of idols, and, condemning
   their old ways, went over to the new religion, he, an execrable and
   pernicious tyrant, sprung forward to raze the heavenly temple and
   destroy the true faith. He it was who first persecuted the servants of
   God; he crucified Peter, and slew Paul: [1963] nor did he escape with
   impunity; for God looked on the affliction of His people; and therefore
   the tyrant, bereaved of authority, and precipitated from the height of
   empire, suddenly disappeared, and even the burial-place of that noxious
   wild beast was nowhere to be seen. This has led some persons of
   extravagant imagination to suppose that, having been conveyed to a
   distant region, he is still reserved alive; and to him they apply the
   Sibylline verses concerning


   "The fugitive, who slew his own mother, being to come from the
   uttermost boundaries of the earth;"

   as if he who was the first should also be the last persecutor, and thus
   prove the forerunner of Antichrist! But we ought not to believe those
   who, affirming that the two prophets Enoch and Elias have been
   translated into some remote place that they might attend our Lord when
   He shall come to judgment, [1964] also fancy that Nero is to appear
   hereafter as the forerunner of the devil, when he shall come to lay
   waste the earth and overthrow mankind.

    Chap. III.

   After an interval of some years from the death of Nero, there arose
   another tyrant no less wicked (Domitian), who, although his government
   was exceedingly odious, for a very long time oppressed his subjects,
   and reigned in security, until at length he stretched forth his impious
   hands against the Lord. Having been instigated by evil demons to
   persecute the righteous people, he was then delivered into the power of
   his enemies, and suffered due punishment. To be murdered in his own
   palace was not vengeance ample enough: the very memory of his name was
   erased. For although he had erected many admirable edifices, and
   rebuilt the Capitol, and left other distinguished marks of his
   magnificence, yet the senate did so persecute his name, as to leave no
   remains of his statues, or traces of the inscriptions put up in honour
   of him; and by most solemn and severe decrees it branded him, even
   after death, with perpetual infamy. Thus, the commands of the tyrant
   having been rescinded, the Church was not only restored to her former
   state, but she shone forth with additional splendour, and became more
   and more flourishing. And in the times that followed, while many
   well-deserving princes guided the helm of the Roman empire, the Church
   suffered no violent assaults from her enemies, and she extended her
   hands unto the east and unto the west, insomuch that now there was not
   any the most remote corner of the earth to which the divine religion
   had not penetrated, or any nation of manners so barbarous that did not,
   by being converted to the worship of God, become mild and gentle.

   This long peace, [1966] however, was afterwards interrupted. Decius
   appeared in the world, an accursed wild beast, to afflict the
   Church,--and who but a bad man would persecute religion? It seems as if
   he had been raised to sovereign eminence, at once to rage against God,
   and at once to fall; for, having undertaken an expedition against the
   Carpi, who had then possessed themselves of Dacia and Moefia, he was
   suddenly surrounded by the barbarians, and slain, together with great
   part of his army; nor could he be honoured with the rites of sepulture,
   but, stripped and naked, he lay to be devoured by wild beasts and
   birds, [1967] --a fit end for the enemy of God.

    Chap. V.

   And presently Valerian also, in a mood alike frantic, lifted up his
   impious hands to assault God, and, although his time was short, shed
   much righteous blood. But God punished him in a new and extraordinary
   manner, that it might be a lesson to future ages that the adversaries
   of Heaven always receive the just recompense of their iniquities. He,
   having been made prisoner by the Persians, lost not only that power
   which he had exercised without moderation, but also the liberty of
   which be had deprived others; and he wasted the remainder of his days
   in the vilest condition of slavery: for Sapores, the king of the
   Persians, who had made him prisoner, whenever he chose to get into his
   carriage or to mount on horseback, commanded the Roman to stoop and
   present his back; then, setting his foot on the shoulders of Valerian,
   he said, with a smile of reproach, "This is true, and not what the
   Romans delineate on board or plaster." Valerian lived for a
   considerable time under the well-merited insults of his conqueror; so
   that the Roman name remained long the scoff and derision of the
   barbarians: and this also was added to the severity of his punishment,
   that although he had an emperor for his son, he found no one to revenge
   his captivity and most abject and servile state; neither indeed was he
   ever demanded back. Afterward, when he had finished this shameful life
   under so great dishonour, he was flayed, and his skin, stripped from
   the flesh, was dyed with vermilion, and placed in the temple of the
   gods of the barbarians, that the remembrance of a triumph so signal
   might be perpetuated, and that this spectacle might always be exhibited
   to our ambassadors, as an admonition to the Romans, that, beholding the
   spoils of their captived emperor in a Persian temple, they should not
   place too great confidence in their own strength.

   Now since God so punished the sacrilegious, is it not strange that any
   one should afterward have dared to do, or even to devise, aught against
   the majesty of the one God, who governs and supports all things?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. VI.

   Aurelian might have recollected the fate of the captived emperor, yet,
   being of a nature outrageous and headstrong, he forgot both his sin and
   its punishment, and by deeds of cruelty irritated the divine wrath. He
   was not, however, permitted to accomplish what he had devised; for just
   as he began to give a loose to his rage, he was slain. His bloody
   edicts had not yet reached the more distant provinces, when he himself
   lay all bloody on the earth at Cænophrurium in Thrace, assassinated by
   his familiar friends, who had taken up groundless suspicions against
   him.

   Examples of such a nature, and so numerous, ought to have deterred
   succeeding tyrants; nevertheless they were not only not dismayed, but,
   in their misdeeds against God, became more bold and presumptuous.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. VII.

   While Diocletian, that author of ill, and deviser of misery, was
   ruining all things, he could not withhold his insults, not even against
   God. This man, by avarice partly, and partly by timid counsels,
   overturned the Roman empire. For he made choice of three persons to
   share the government with him; and thus, the empire having been
   quartered, armies were multiplied, and each of the four princes strove
   to maintain a much more considerable military force than any sole
   emperor had done in times past. [1968] There began to be fewer men who
   paid taxes than there were who received wages; so that the means of the
   husbandmen being exhausted by enormous impositions, the farms were
   abandoned, cultivated grounds became woodland, and universal dismay
   prevailed. Besides, the provinces were divided into minute portions,
   and many presidents and a multitude of inferior officers lay heavy on
   each territory, and almost on each city. There were also many stewards
   of different degrees, and deputies of presidents. Very few civil causes
   came before them: but there were condemnations daily, and forfeitures
   frequently inflicted; taxes on numberless commodities, and those not
   only often repeated, but perpetual, and, in exacting them, intolerable
   wrongs.

   Whatever was laid on for the maintenance of the soldiery might have
   been endured; but Diocletian, through his insatiable avarice, would
   never allow the sums of money in his treasury to be diminished: he was
   constantly heaping together extraordinary aids and free gifts, that his
   original hoards might remain untouched and inviolable. He also, when by
   various extortions he had made all things exceedingly dear, attempted
   by an ordinance to limit their prices. Then much blood was shed for the
   veriest trifles; men were afraid to expose aught to sale, and the
   scarcity became more excessive and grievous than ever, until, in the
   end, the ordinance, after having proved destructive to multitudes, was
   from mere necessity abrogated. To this there were added a certain
   endless passion for building, and on that account, endless exactions
   from the provinces for furnishing wages to labourers and artificers,
   and supplying carriages and whatever else was requisite to the works
   which he projected. Here public halls, there a circus, here a mint, and
   there a workhouse for making implements of war; in one place a
   habitation for his empress, and in another for his daughter. Presently
   great part of the city was quitted, and all men removed with their
   wives and children, as from a town taken by enemies; and when those
   buildings were completed, to the destruction of whole provinces, he
   said, "They are not right, let them be done on another plan." Then they
   were to be pulled down, or altered, to undergo perhaps a future
   demolition. By such folly was he continually endeavouring to equal
   Nicomedia with the city Rome in magnificence.

   I omit mentioning how many perished on account of their possessions or
   wealth; for such evils were exceedingly frequent, and through their
   frequency appeared almost lawful. But this was peculiar to him, that
   whenever he saw a field remarkably well cultivated, or a house of
   uncommon elegance, a false accusation and a capital punishment were
   straightway prepared against the proprietor; so that it seemed as if
   Diocletian could not be guilty of rapine without also shedding blood.

    Chap. VIII.

   What was the character of his brother in empire, Maximian, called
   Herculius? Not unlike to that of Diocletian; and, indeed, to render
   their friendship so close and faithful as it was, there must have been
   in them a sameness of inclinations and purposes, a corresponding will
   and unanimity in judgment. Herein alone they were different, that
   Diocletian was more avaricious and less resolute, and that Maximian,
   with less avarice, had a bolder spirit, prone not to good, but to evil.
   For while he possessed Italy, itself the chief seat of empire, and
   while other very opulent provinces, such as Africa and Spain, were near
   at hand, he took little care to preserve those treasures which he had
   such fair opportunities of amassing. Whenever he stood in need of more,
   the richest senators were presently charged, by suborned evidences, as
   guilty of aspiring to the empire; so that the chief luminaries of the
   senate were daily extinguished. And thus the treasury, delighting in
   blood, overflowed with ill-gotten wealth.

   Add to all this the incontinency of that pestilent wretch, not only in
   debauching males, which is hateful and abominable, but also in the
   violation of the daughters of the principal men of the state; for
   wherever he journeyed, virgins were suddenly torn from the presence of
   their parents. In such enormities he placed his supreme delight, and to
   indulge to the utmost his lust and flagitious desires was in his
   judgment the felicity of his reign.

   I pass over Constantius, a prince unlike the others, and worthy to have
   had the sole government of the empire.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. IX.

   But the other Maximian (Galerius), chosen by Diocletian for his
   son-in-law, was worse, not only than those two princes whom our own
   times have experienced, but worse than all the bad princes of former
   days. In this wild beast there dwelt a native barbarity and a
   savageness foreign to Roman blood; and no wonder, for his mother was
   born beyond the Danube, and it was an inroad of the Carpi that obliged
   her to cross over and take refuge in New Dacia. The form of Galerius
   corresponded with his manners. Of stature tall, full of flesh, and
   swollen to a horrible bulk of corpulency; by his speech, gestures, and
   looks, he made himself a terror to all that came near him. His
   father-in-law, too, dreaded him excessively. The cause was this.
   Narseus, king of the Persians, emulating the example set him by his
   grandfather Sapores, assembled a great army, and aimed at becoming
   master of the eastern provinces of the Roman empire. Diocletian, apt to
   be low-spirited and timorous in every commotion, and fearing a fate
   like that of Valerian, would not in person encounter Narseus; but he
   sent Galerius by the way of Armenia, while he himself halted in the
   eastern provinces, and anxiously watched the event. It is a custom
   amongst the barbarians to take everything that belongs to them into the
   field. Galerius laid an ambush for them, and easily overthrew men
   embarrassed with the multitude of their followers and with their
   baggage. Having put Narseus to flight, and returned with much spoil,
   his own pride and Diocletian's fears were greatly increased. For after
   this victory he rose to such a pitch of haughtiness as to reject the
   appellation of Cæsar; [1969] and when he heard that appellation in
   letters addressed to him, he cried out, with a stern look and terrible
   voice, "How long am I to be Cæsar? "Then he began to act extravagantly,
   insomuch that, as if he had been a second Romulus, he wished to pass
   for and to be called the offspring of Mars; and that he might appear
   the issue of a divinity, he was willing that his mother Romula should
   be dishonoured with the name of adulteress. But, not to confound the
   chronological order of events, I delay the recital of his actions; for
   indeed afterwards, when Galerius got the title of emperor, his
   father-in-law having been divested of the imperial purple, he became
   altogether outrageous, and of unbounded arrogance.

   While by such a conduct, and with such associates, Diocles--for that
   was the name of Diocletian before he attained sovereignty--occupied
   himself in subverting the commonweal, there was no evil which his
   crimes did not deserve: nevertheless he reigned most prosperously, as
   long as he forbore to defile his hands with the blood of the just; and
   what cause he had for persecuting them, I come now to explain.

    Chap. X.

   Diocletian, as being of a timorous disposition, was a searcher into
   futurity, and during his abode in the East he began to slay victims,
   that from their livers he might obtain a prognostic of events; and
   while he sacrificed, some attendants of his, who were Christians, stood
   by, and they put the immortal sign on their foreheads. At this the
   demons were chased away, and the holy rites interrupted. The
   soothsayers trembled, unable to investigate the wonted marks on the
   entrails of the victims. They frequently repeated the sacrifices, as if
   the former had been unpropitious; but the victims, slain from time to
   time, afforded no tokens for divination. At length Tages, the chief of
   the soothsayers, [1970] either from guess or from his own observation,
   said, "There are profane persons here, who obstruct the rites." Then
   Diocletian, in furious passion, ordered not only all who were assisting
   at the holy ceremonies, but also all who resided within the palace, to
   sacrifice, and, in case of their refusal, to be scourged. And further,
   by letters to the commanding officers, he enjoined that all soldiers
   should be forced to the like impiety, under pain of being dismissed the
   service. Thus far his rage proceeded; but at that season he did nothing
   more against the law and religion of God. After an interval of some
   time he went to winter in Bithynia; and presently Galerius Cæsar came
   thither, inflamed with furious resentment, and purposing to excite the
   inconsiderate old man to carry on that persecution which he had begun
   against the Christians. I have learned that the cause of his fury was
   as follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1970] [Nothing easier than for these to pretend such a difficulty, in
   order to incite the emperor to severities. They may have found it
   convenient to represent the sign of the cross as the source of their
   inability to give oracles.]
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XI.

   The mother of Galerius, a woman exceedingly superstitious, was a votary
   of the gods of the mountains. Being of such a character, she made
   sacrifices almost every day, and she feasted her servants on the meat
   offered to idols: but the Christians of her family would not partake of
   those entertainments; and while she feasted with the Gentiles, they
   continued in fasting and prayer. On this account she conceived ill-will
   against the Christians, and by woman-like complaints instigated her
   son, no less superstitious than herself, to destroy them. So, during
   the whole winter, Diocletian and Galerius held councils together, at
   which no one else assisted; and it was the universal opinion that their
   conferences respected the most momentous affairs of the empire. The old
   man long opposed the fury of Galerius, and showed how pernicious it
   would be to raise disturbances throughout the world and to shed so much
   blood; that the Christians were wont with eagerness to meet death; and
   that it would be enough for him to exclude persons of that religion
   from the court [1971] and the army. Yet he could not restrain the
   madness of that obstinate man. He resolved, therefore, to take the
   opinion of his friends. Now this was a circumstance in the bad
   disposition of Diocletian, that whenever he determined to do good, he
   did it without advice, that the praise might be all his own; but
   whenever he determined to do ill, which he was sensible would be
   blamed, he called in many advisers, that his own fault might be imputed
   to other men: and therefore a few civil magistrates, and a few military
   commanders, were admitted to give their counsel; and the question was
   put to them according to priority of rank. Some, through personal
   ill-will towards the Christians, were of opinion that they ought to be
   cut off, as enemies of the gods and adversaries of the established
   religious ceremonies. Others thought differently, but, having
   understood the will of Galerius, they, either from dread of displeasing
   or from a desire of gratifying him, concurred in the opinion given
   against the Christians. Yet not even then could the emperor be
   prevailed upon to yield his assent. He determined above all to consult
   his gods; and to that end he despatched a soothsayer to inquire of
   Apollo at Miletus, whose answer was such as might be expected from an
   enemy of the divine religion. So Diocletian was drawn over from his
   purpose. But although he could struggle no longer against his friends,
   and against Cæsar and Apollo, yet still he attempted to observe such
   moderation as to command the business to be carried through without
   bloodshed; whereas Galerius would have had all persons burnt alive who
   refused to sacrifice.

    Chap. XII.

   A fit and auspicious day was sought out for the accomplishment of this
   undertaking; and the festival of the god Terminus, celebrated on the
   sevens of the kalends of March, [1972] was chosen, in preference to all
   others, to terminate, as it were, the Christian religion.


   "That day, the harbinger of death, arose,

   First cause of ill, and long enduring woes;"

   of woes which befell not only the Christians, but the whole earth. When
   that day dawned, in the eighth consulship of Diocletian and seventh of
   Maximian, suddenly, while it was yet hardly light, the prefect,
   together with chief commanders, tribunes, and officers of the treasury,
   came to the church in Nicomedia, and the gates having been forced open,
   they searched everywhere for an image of the Divinity. The books of the
   Holy Scriptures were found, and they were committed to the flames; the
   utensils and furniture of the church were abandoned to pillage: all was
   rapine, confusion, tumult. That church, situated on rising ground, was
   within view of the palace; and Diocletian and Galerius stood, as if on
   a watch-tower, disputing long whether it ought to be set on fire. The
   sentiment of Diocletian prevailed, who dreaded lest, so great a fire
   being once kindled, some part of the city might he burnt; for there
   were many and large buildings that surrounded the church. Then the
   Pretorian Guards came in battle array, with axes and other iron
   instruments, and having been let loose everywhere, they in a few hours
   levelled that very lofty edifice with the ground. [1973]

    Chap. XIII.

   Next day an edict was published, depriving the Christians of all
   honours and dignities; ordaining also that, without any distinction of
   rank or degree, they should be subjected to tortures, and that every
   suit at law should be received against them; while, on the other hand,
   they were debarred from being plaintiffs in questions of wrong,
   adultery, or theft; and, finally, that they should neither be capable
   of freedom, nor have right of suffrage. A certain person tore down this
   edict, and cut it in pieces, improperly indeed, but with high spirit,
   saying in scorn, "These are the triumphs of Goths and Sarmatians."
   Having been instantly seized and brought to judgment, he was not only
   tortured, but burnt alive, in the forms of law; and having displayed
   admirable patience under sufferings, he was consumed to ashes.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XIV.

   But Galerius, not satisfied with the tenor of the edict, sought in
   another way to gain on the emperor. That he might urge him to excess of
   cruelty in persecution, he employed private emissaries to set the
   palace on fire; and some part of it having been burnt, the blame was
   laid on the Christians as public enemies; and the very appellation of
   Christian grew odious [1974] on account of that fire. It was said that
   the Christians, in concert with the eunuchs, had plotted to destroy the
   princes; and that both of the princes had well-nigh been burnt alive in
   their own palace. Diocletian, shrewd and intelligent as he always chose
   to appear, suspected nothing of the contrivance, but, inflamed with
   anger, immediately commanded that all his own domestics should be
   tortured to force a confession of the plot. He sat on his tribunal, and
   saw innocent men tormented by fire to make discovery. All magistrates,
   and all who had superintendency in the imperial palace, obtained
   special commissions to administer the torture; and they strove with
   each other who should be first in bringing to light the conspiracy. No
   circumstances, however, of the fact were detected anywhere; for no one
   applied the torture to any domestics of Galerius. He himself was ever
   with Diocletian, constantly urging him, and never allowing the passions
   of the inconsiderate old man to cool. Then, after an interval of
   fifteen days, he attempted a second fire; but that was perceived
   quickly, and extinguished. Still, however, its author remained unknown.
   On that very day, Galerius, who in the middle of winter had prepared
   for his departure, suddenly hurried out of the city, protesting that he
   fled to escape being burnt alive.

    Chap. XV.

   And now Diocletian raged, not only against his own domestics, but
   indiscriminately against all; and he began by forcing his daughter
   Valeria and his wife Prisca to be polluted by sacrificing. Eunuchs,
   once the most powerful, and who had chief authority at court and with
   the emperor, were slain. Presbyters and other officers of the Church
   were seized, without evidence by witnesses or confession, condemned,
   and together with their families led to execution. In burning alive, no
   distinction of sex or age was regarded; and because of their great
   multitude, they were not burnt one after another, but a herd of them
   were encircled with the same fire; and servants, having millstones tied
   about their necks, were cast into the sea. Nor was the persecution less
   grievous on the rest of the people of God; for the judges, dispersed
   through all the temples, sought to compel every one to sacrifice. The
   prisons were crowded; tortures, hitherto unheard of, were invented; and
   lest justice should be inadvertently administered to a Christian,
   altars were placed in the courts of justice, hard by the tribunal, that
   every litigant might offer incense before his cause could be heard.
   Thus judges were no otherwise approached than divinities. Mandates also
   had gone to Maximian Herculius and Constantius, requiring their
   concurrence in the execution of the edicts; for in matters even of such
   mighty importance their opinion was never once asked. Herculius, a
   person of no merciful temper, yielded ready obedience, and enforced the
   edicts throughout his dominions of Italy. Constantius, on the other
   hand, lest he should have seemed to dissent from the injunctions of his
   superiors, permitted the demolition of churches,--mere walls, and
   capable of being built up again,--but he preserved entire that true
   temple of God, which is the human body. [1975]

    Chap. XVI.

   Thus was all the earth afflicted; and from east to west, except in the
   territories of Gaul, three ravenous wild beasts continued to rage.


   "Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,

   A voice of brass, and adamantine lungs,

   Not half the dreadful scene could I disclose,"

   or recount the punishments inflicted by the rulers in every province on
   religious and innocent men.

   But what need of a particular recital of those things, especially to
   you, my best beloved Donatus, [1976] who above all others was exposed
   to the storm of that violent persecution? For when you had fallen into
   the hands of the prefect Flaccinian, no puny murderer, and afterwards
   of Hierocles, who from a deputy became president of Bithynia, the
   author and adviser of the persecution, and last of all into the hands
   of his successor Priscillian, you displayed to mankind a pattern of
   invincible magnanimity. Having been nine times exposed to racks and
   diversified torments, nine times by a glorious profession of your faith
   you foiled the adversary; in nine combats you subdued the devil and his
   chosen soldiers; and by nine victories you triumphed over this world
   and its terrors. How pleasing the spectacle to God, when He beheld you
   a conqueror, yoking in your chariot not white horses, nor enormous
   elephants, but those very men who had led captive the nations! After
   this sort to lord it over the lords of the earth is triumph indeed!
   Now, by your valour were they conquered, when you set at defiance their
   flagitious edicts, and, through stedfast faith and the fortitude of
   your soul, you routed all the vain terrors of tyrannical authority.
   Against you neither scourges, nor iron claws, nor fire, nor sword, nor
   various kinds of torture, availed aught; and no violence could bereave
   you of your fidelity and persevering resolution. This it is to be a
   disciple of God, and this it is to be a soldier of Christ; a soldier
   whom no enemy can dislodge, or wolf snatch, from the heavenly camp; no
   artifice ensnare, or pain of body subdue, or torments overthrow. At
   length, after those nine glorious combats, in which the devil was
   vanquished by you, he dared not to enter the lists again with one whom,
   by repeated trials, he had found unconquerable; and he abstained from
   challenging you any more, lest you should have laid hold on the garland
   of victory already stretched out to you; an unfading garland, which,
   although you have not at present received it, is laid up in the kingdom
   of the Lord for your virtue and deserts. But let us now return to the
   course of our narrative.

    Chap. XVII.

   The wicked plan having been carried into execution, Diocletian, whom
   prosperity had now abandoned, set out instantly for Rome, there to
   celebrate the commencement of the twentieth year of his reign. That
   solemnity was performed on the twelfth of the kalends of December;
   [1977] and suddenly the emperor, unable to bear the Roman freedom of
   speech, peevishly and impatiently burst away from the city. The kalends
   of January [1978] approached, at which day the consulship, for the
   ninth time, was to be offered to him; yet, rather than continue
   thirteen days longer in Rome, he chose that his first appearance as
   consul should be at Ravenna. Having, however, begun his journey in
   winter, amidst intense cold and incessant rains, he contracted a slight
   but lingering disease: it harassed him without intermission, so that he
   was obliged for the most part to be carried in a litter. Then, at the
   close of summer, he made a circuit along the banks of the Danube, and
   so came to Nicomedia. His disease had now become more grievous and
   oppressing; yet he caused himself to be brought out, in order to
   dedicate that circus which, at the conclusion of the twentieth year of
   his reign, he had erected. Immediately he grew so languid and feeble,
   that prayers for his life were put up to all the gods. Then suddenly,
   on the ides of December, [1979] there was heard in the palace sorrow,
   and weeping, and lamentation, and the courtiers ran to and fro; there
   was silence throughout the city, and a report went of the death, and
   even of the burial, of Diocletian: but early on the morrow it was
   suddenly rumoured that he still lived. At this the countenance of his
   domestics and courtiers changed from melancholy to gay. Nevertheless
   there were who suspected his death to be kept secret until the arrival
   of Galerius Cæsar, lest in the meanwhile the soldiery should attempt
   some change in the government; and this suspicion grew so universal,
   that no one would believe the emperor alive, until, on the kalends of
   March, [1980] he appeared in public, but so wan, his illness having
   lasted almost a year, as hardly to be known again. The fit of stupor,
   resembling death, happened on the ides of December; and although he in
   some measure recovered, yet he never attained to perfect health again,
   for he became disordered in his judgment, being at certain times insane
   and at others of sound mind.

    Chap. XVIII.

   Within a few days Galerius Cæsar arrived, not to congratulate his
   father-in-law on the re-establishment of his health, but to force him
   to resign the empire. Already he had urged Maximian Herculius to the
   like purpose, and by the alarm of civil wars terrified the old man into
   compliance; and he now assailed Diocletian. At first, in gentle and
   friendly terms, he said that age and growing infirmities disabled
   Diocletian for the charge of the commonweal, and that he had need to
   give himself some repose after his labours. Galerius, in confirmation
   of his argument, produced the example of Nerva, who laid the weight of
   empire on Trajan.

   But Diocletian made answer, that it was unfit for one who had held a
   rank, eminent above all others and conspicuous, to sink into the
   obscurity of a low station; neither indeed was it safe, because in the
   course of so long a reign he must unavoidably have made many enemies.
   That the case of Nerva was very different: he, after having reigned a
   single year, felt himself, either from age or from inexperience in
   business, unequal to affairs so momentous, and therefore threw aside
   the helm of government, and returned to that private life in which he
   had already grown old. But Diocletian added, that if Galerius wished
   for the title of emperor, there was nothing to hinder its being
   conferred on him and Constantius, as well as on Maximian Herculius.

   Galerius, whose imagination already grasped at the whole empire, saw
   that little but an unsubstantial name would accrue to him from this
   proposal, and therefore replied that the settlement made by Diocletian
   himself ought to be inviolable; a settlement which provided that there
   should be two of higher rank vested with supreme power, and two others
   of inferior, to assist them. Easily might concord be preserved between
   two equals, never amongst four; [1981] that he, if Diocletian would not
   resign, must consult his own interests, so as to remain no longer in an
   inferior rank, and the last of that rank; that for fifteen years past
   he had been confined, as an exile, to Illyricum and the banks of the
   Danube, perpetually struggling against barbarous nations, while others,
   at their ease, governed dominions more extensive than his, and better
   civilized.

   Diocletian already knew, by letters from Maximian Herculius, all that
   Galerius had spoken at their conference, and also that he was
   augmenting his army; and now, on hearing his discourse, the spiritless
   old man burst into tears, and said, "Be it as you will."

   It remained to choose Cæsars by common consent. "But," said Galerius,
   "why ask the advice of Maximian and Constantius, since they must needs
   acquiesce in whatever we do?"--"Certainly they will," replied
   Diocletian, "for we must elect their sons."

   Now Maximian Herculius had a son, Maxentius, married to the daughter of
   Galerius, a man of bad and mischievous dispositions, and so proud and
   stubborn withal, that he would never pay the wonted obeisance either to
   his father or father-in-law, and on that account he was hated by them
   both. Constantius also had a son, Constantine, a young man of very
   great worth, and well meriting the high station of Cæsar. The
   distinguished comeliness of his figure, his strict attention to all
   military duties, his virtuous demeanour and singular affability, had
   endeared him to the troops, and made him the choice of every
   individual. He was then at court, having long before been created by
   Diocletian a tribune of the first order.

   "What is to be done?" said Galerius, "for that Maxentius deserves not
   the office. He who, while yet a private man, has treated me with
   contumely, how will he act when once he obtains power?"--"But
   Constantine is amiable, and will so rule as hereafter, in the opinion
   of mankind, to surpass the mild virtues of his father."--"Be it so, if
   my inclinations and judgment are to be disregarded. Men ought to be
   appointed who are at my disposal, who will dread me, and never do
   anything unless by my orders."--"Whom then shall we
   appoint?"--"Severus."--"How! that dancer, that habitual drunkard, who
   turns night into day, and day into night?"--"He deserves the office,
   for he has approved himself a faithful paymaster and purveyor of the
   army; and, indeed, I have already despatched him to receive the purple
   from the hands of Maximian."--"Well, I consent; but whom else do you
   suggest?"--"Him," said Galerius, pointing out Daia, a young man,
   half-barbarian. Now Galerius had lately bestowed part of his own name
   on that youth, and called him Maximin, in like manner as Diocletian
   formerly bestowed on Galerius the name of Maximian, for the omen's
   sake, because Maximian Herculius had served him with unshaken
   fidelity.--"Who is that you present?"--"A kinsman of mine."--"Alas!"
   said Diocletian, heaving a deep sigh, "you do not propose men fit for
   the charge of public affairs!"--"I have tried them."--"Then do you look
   to it, who are about to assume the administration of the empire: as for
   me, while I continued emperor, long and diligent have been my labours
   in providing for the security of the commonweal; and now, should
   anything disastrous ensue, the blame will not be mine."

    Chap. XIX.

   Matters having been thus concerted, Diocletian and Galerius went in
   procession to publish the nomination of Cæsars. Every one looked at
   Constantine; for there was no doubt that the choice would fall on him.
   The troops present, as well as the chief soldiers of the other legions,
   who had been summoned to the solemnity, fixed their eyes on
   Constantine, exulted in the hope of his approaching election, and
   occupied themselves in prayers for his prosperity. Near three miles
   from Nicomedia there is an eminence, on the summit of which Galerius
   formerly received the purple; and there a pillar, with the statue of
   Jupiter, was placed. Thither the procession went. An assembly of the
   soldiers was called. Diocletian, with tears, harangued them, and said
   that he was become infirm, that he needed repose after his fatigues,
   and that he would resign the empire into hands more vigorous and able,
   and at the same time appoint new Cæsars. The spectators, with the
   utmost earnestness, waited for the nomination. Suddenly he declared
   that the Cæsars were Severus and Maximin. The amazement was universal.
   Constantine stood near in public view, and men began to question
   amongst themselves whether his name too had not been changed into
   Maximin; when, in the sight of all, Galerius, stretching back his hand,
   put Constantine aside, and drew Daia forward, and, having divested him
   of the garb of a private person, set him in the most conspicuous place.
   All men wondered who he could be, and from whence he came; but none
   ventured to interpose or move objections, so confounded were their
   minds at the strange and unlooked-for event. Diocletian took off his
   purple robe, put it on Daia, and resumed his own original name of
   Diocles. He descended from the tribunal, and passed through Nicomedia
   in a chariot; and then this old emperor, like a veteran soldier freed
   from military service, was dismissed into his own country; while Daia,
   lately taken from the tending of cattle in forests to serve as a common
   soldier, immediately made one of the life-guard, presently a tribune,
   and next day Cæsar, obtained authority to trample under foot and
   oppress the empire of the East; a person ignorant alike of war and of
   civil affairs, and from a herdsman become a leader of armies.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XX.

   Galerius having effected the expulsion of the two old men, began to
   consider himself alone as the sovereign of the Roman empire. Necessity
   had required the appointment of Constantius to the first rank; but
   Galerius made small account of one who was of an easy temper, and of
   health declining and precarious. He looked for the speedy death of
   Constantius. And although that prince should recover, it seemed not
   difficult to force him to put off the imperial purple; for what else
   could he do, if pressed by his three colleagues to abdicate? Galerius
   had Licinius ever about his person, his old and intimate acquaintance,
   and his earliest companion in arms, whose counsels he used in the
   management of all affairs; yet he would not nominate Licinius to the
   dignity of Cæsar, with the title of son, for he purposed to nominate
   him, in the room of Constantius, to the dignity of emperor, with the
   title of brother, while he himself might hold sovereign authority, and
   rule over the whole globe with unbounded licence. After that, he meant
   to have solemnized the vicennial festival; to have conferred on his son
   Candidianus, then a boy of nine years of age, the office of Cæsar; and,
   in conclusion, to have resigned, as Diocletian had done. And thus,
   Licinius and Severus being emperors, and Maximin and Candidianus in the
   next station of Cæsars, he fancied that, environed as it were by an
   impregnable wall, he should lead an old age of security and peace. Such
   were his projects; but God, whom he had made his adversary, frustrated
   all those imaginations.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXI.

   Having thus attained to the highest power, he bent his mind to afflict
   that empire into which he had opened his way. It is the manner and
   practice of the Persians for the people to yield themselves slaves to
   their kings, and for the kings to treat their people as slaves. This
   flagitious man, from the time of his victories over the Persians, was
   not ashamed incessantly to extol such an institution, and he resolved
   to establish it in the Roman dominions; and because he could not do
   this by an express law, he so acted, in imitation of the Persian kings,
   as to bereave men of their liberties. He first of all degraded those
   whom he meant to punish; and then not only were inferior magistrates
   put to the torture by him, but also the chief men in cities, and
   persons of the most eminent rank, and this too in matters of little
   moment, and in civil questions. Crucifixion was the punishment ready
   prepared in capital cases; and for lesser crimes, fetters. Matrons of
   honourable station were dragged into workhouses; and when any man was
   to be scourged, there were four posts fixed in the ground, and to them
   he was tied, after a manner unknown in the chastisement of slaves. What
   shall I say of his apartment for sport, and of his favourite
   diversions? He kept bears, most resembling himself in fierceness and
   bulk, whom he had collected together during the course of his reign. As
   often as he chose to indulge his humour, he ordered some particular
   bear to be brought in, and men were thrown to that savage animal,
   rather to be swallowed up than devoured; and when their limbs were torn
   asunder, he laughed with excessive complacency: nor did he ever sup
   without being spectator of the effusion of human blood. Men of private
   station were condemned to be burnt alive; and he began this mode of
   execution by edicts against the Christians, commanding that, after
   torture and condemnation, they should be burnt at a slow fire. They
   were fixed to a stake, and first a moderate flame was applied to the
   soles of their feet, until the muscles, contracted by burning, were
   torn from the bones; then torches, lighted and put out again, were
   directed to all the members of their bodies, so that no part had any
   exemption. Meanwhile cold water was continually poured on their faces,
   and their mouths moistened, lest, by reason of their jaws being
   parched, they should expire. At length they did expire, when, after
   many hours, the violent heat had consumed their skin and penetrated
   into their intestines. The dead carcases were laid on a funeral pile,
   and wholly burnt; their bones were gathered, ground to powder, and
   thrown into the river, or into the sea.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXII.

   And now that cruelty, which he had learned in torturing the Christians,
   became habitual, and he exercised it against all men indiscriminately.
   [1982] He was not wont to inflict the slighter sorts of punishment, as
   to banish, to imprison, or to send criminals to work in the mines; but
   to burn, to crucify, to expose to wild beasts, were things done daily,
   and without hesitation. For smaller offences, those of his own
   household and his stewards were chastised with lances, instead of rods;
   and, in great offences, to be beheaded was an indulgence shown to very
   few; and it seemed as a favour, on account of old services, when one
   was permitted to die in the easiest manner. But these were slight evils
   in the government of Galerius, when compared with what follows. For
   eloquence was extinguished, pleaders cut off, and the learned in the
   laws either exiled or slain. Useful letters came to be viewed in the
   same light as magical and forbidden arts; and all who possessed them
   were trampled upon and execrated, as if they had been hostile to
   government, and public enemies. Law was dissolved, and unbounded
   licence permitted to judges,--to judges chosen from amongst the
   soldiery, rude and illiterate men, and let loose upon the provinces,
   without assessors to guide or control them.

    Chap. XXIII.

   But that which gave rise to public and universal calamity, was the tax
   imposed at once on each province and city. Surveyors having been spread
   abroad, and occupied in a general and severe scrutiny, horrible scenes
   were exhibited, like the outrages of victorious enemies, and the
   wretched state of captives. Each spot of ground was measured, vines and
   fruit-trees numbered, lists taken of animals of every kind, and a
   capitation-roll made up. In cities, the common people, whether residing
   within or without the walls, were assembled, the market-places filled
   with crowds of families, all attended with their children and slaves,
   the noise of torture and scourges resounded, sons were hung on the rack
   to force discovery of the effects of their fathers, the most trusty
   slaves compelled by pain to bear witness against their masters, and
   wives to bear witness against their husbands, In default of all other
   evidence, men were tortured to speak against themselves; and no sooner
   did agony oblige them to acknowledge what they had not, but those
   imaginary effects were noted down in the lists. Neither youth, nor old
   age, nor sickness, afforded any exemption. The diseased and the infirm
   were carried in; the age of each was estimated; and, that the
   capitation-tax might be enlarged, years were added to the young and
   struck off from the old. General lamentation and sorrow prevailed.
   Whatever, by the laws of war, conquerors had done to the conquered, the
   like did this man presume to perpetrate against Romans and the subjects
   of Rome, because his forefathers had been made liable to a like tax
   imposed by the victorious Trajan, as a penalty on the Dacians for their
   frequent rebellions. After this, money was levied for each head, as if
   a price had been paid for liberty to exist; yet full trust was not
   reposed on the same set of surveyors, but others and others still were
   sent round to make further discoveries; and thus the tributes were
   redoubled, not because the new surveyors made any fresh discoveries,
   but because they added at pleasure to the former rates, lest they
   should seem to have been employed to no purpose. Meanwhile the number
   of animals decreased, and men died; nevertheless taxes were paid even
   for the dead, so that no one could either live or cease to live without
   being subject to impositions. There remained mendicants alone, from
   whom nothing could be exacted, and whom their misery and wretchedness
   secured from ill-treatment. But this pious man had compassion on them,
   and determining that they should remain no longer in indigence, he
   caused them all to be assembled, put on board vessels, and sunk in the
   sea. So merciful was he in making provision that under his
   administration no man should want! And thus, while he took effectual
   measures that none, under the reigned pretext of poverty, should elude
   the tax, he put to death a multitude of real wretches, in violation of
   every law of humanity.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXIV.

   Already the judgment of God approached him, and that season ensued in
   which his fortunes began to droop and to waste away. While occupied in
   the manner that I have described above, he did not set himself to
   subvert or expel Constantius, but waited for his death, not imagining,
   however, that it was so nigh. Constantius, having become exceedingly
   ill, wrote to Galerius, and requested that his son Constantine might be
   sent to see him. He had made a like request long before, but in vain;
   for Galerius meant nothing less than to grant it. On the contrary, he
   laid repeated snares for the life of that young man, because he durst
   not use open violence, lest he should stir up civil wars against
   himself, and incur that which he most dreaded, the hate and resentment
   of the army. Under pretence of manly exercise and recreation, he made
   him combat with wild beasts: but this device was frustrated; for the
   power of God protected Constantine, and in the very moment of jeopardy
   rescued him from the hands of Galerius. At length, Galerius, when he
   could no longer avoid complying with the request of Constantius, one
   evening gave Constantine a warrant to depart, and commanded him to set
   out next morning with the imperial despatches. Galerius meant either to
   find some pretext for detaining Constantine, or to forward orders to
   Severus for arresting him on the road. Constantine discerned his
   purpose; and therefore, after supper, when the emperor was gone to
   rest, he hasted away, carried off from the principal stages all the
   horses maintained at the public expense, and escaped. Next day the
   emperor, having purposely remained in his bed-chamber until noon,
   ordered Constantine to be called into his presence; but he learnt that
   Constantine had set out immediately after supper. Outrageous with
   passion, he ordered horses to be made ready, that Constantine might be
   pursued and dragged back; and hearing that all the horses had been
   carried off from the great road, he could hardly refrain from tears.
   Meanwhile Constantine, journeying with incredible rapidity, reached his
   father, who was already about to expire. Constantius recommended his
   son to the soldiers, delivered the sovereign authority into his hands,
   and then died, as his wish had long been, in peace and quiet.

   Constantine Augustus, having assumed the government, made it his first
   care to restore the Christians to the exercise of their worship and to
   their God; and so began his administration by reinstating [1983] the
   holy religion.

    Chap. XXV.

   Some few days after, the portrait of Constantine, adorned with laurels,
   was brought to the pernicious wild beast, that, by receiving that
   symbol, he might acknowledge Constantine in the quality of emperor. He
   hesitated long whether to receive it or not, and he was about to commit
   both the portrait and its bearer to the flames, but his confidants
   dissuaded him from a resolution so frantic. They admonished him of the
   danger, and they represented that, if Constantine came with an armed
   force, all the soldiers, against whose inclination obscure or unknown
   Cæsars had been created, would acknowledge him, and crowd eagerly to
   his standard. So Galerius, although with the utmost unwillingness,
   accepted the portrait, and sent the imperial purple to Constantine,
   that he might seem of his own accord to have received that prince into
   partnership of power with him. And now his plans were deranged, and he
   could not, as he intended formerly, admit Licinius, without exceeding
   the limited number of emperors. But this he devised, that Severus, who
   was more advanced in life, should be named emperor, and that
   Constantine, instead of the title of emperor, to which he had been
   named, should receive that of Cæsar in common with Maximin Daia, and so
   be degraded from the second place to the fourth.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXVI.

   Things seemed to be arranged in some measure to the satisfaction of
   Galerius, when another alarm was brought, that his son-in-law Maxentius
   had been declared emperor at Rome. The cause was this: Galerius having
   resolved by permanent taxes to devour the empire, soared to such
   extravagance in folly, as not to allow an exemption from that thraldom
   even to the Roman people. Tax-gatherers therefore were appointed to go
   to Rome, and make out lists of the citizens. Much about the same time
   Galerius had reduced the Pretorian Guards. There remained at Rome a few
   soldiers of that body, who, profiting of the opportunity, put some
   magistrates to death, and, with the acquiescence of the tumultuary
   populace, clothed Maxentius in the imperial purple. Galerius, on
   receiving this news, was disturbed at the strangeness of the event, but
   not much dismayed. He hated Maxentius, and he could not bestow on him
   the dignity of Cæsar already enjoyed by two (Daia and Constantine);
   besides, he thought it enough for him to have once bestowed that
   dignity against his inclination. So he sent for Severus, exhorted him
   to regain his dominion and sovereignty, and he put under his command
   that army which Maximian Herculius had formerly commanded, that he
   might attack Maxentius at Rome. There the soldiers of Maximian had been
   oftentimes received with every sort of luxurious accommodation, so that
   they were not only interested to preserve the city, but they also
   longed to fix their residence in it.

   Maxentius well knew the enormity of his own offences; and although he
   had as it were an hereditary claim to the services of his father's
   army, and might have hoped to draw it over to himself, yet he reflected
   that this consideration might occur to Galerius also, and induce him to
   leave Severus in Illyricum, and march in person with his own army
   against Rome. Under such apprehensions, Maxentius sought to protect
   himself from the danger that hung over him. To his father, who since
   his abdication resided in Campania, he sent the purple, and saluted him
   again Augustus. Maximian, given to change, eagerly resumed that purple
   of which he had unwillingly divested himself. Meanwhile Severus marched
   on, and with his troops approached the walls of the city. Presently the
   soldiers raised up their ensigns, abandoned Severus, and yielded
   themselves to Maxentius, against whom they had come. What remained but
   flight for Severus, thus deserted? He was encountered by Maximian, who
   had resumed the imperial dignity. On this he took refuge in Ravenna,
   and shut himself up there with a few soldiers. But perceiving that he
   was about to be delivered up, he voluntarily surrendered himself, and
   restored the purple to him from whom he had received it; and after this
   he obtained no other grace but that of an easy death, for he was
   compelled to open his veins, and in that gentle manner expired.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXVII.

   But Maximian, who knew the outrageous temper of Galerius, began to
   consider that, fired with rage on hearing of the death of Severus, he
   would march into Italy, and that possibly he might be joined by Daia,
   and so bring into the field forces too powerful to be resisted. Having
   therefore fortified Rome, and made diligent provision for a defensive
   war, Maximian went into Gaul, that he might give his younger daughter
   Fausta in marriage to Constantine, and thus win over that prince to his
   interest. Meantime Galerius assembled his troops, invaded Italy, and
   advanced towards Rome, resolving to extinguish the senate and put the
   whole people to the sword. But he found everything shut and fortified
   against him. There was no hope of carrying the place by storm, and to
   besiege it was an arduous undertaking; for Galerius had not brought
   with him an army sufficient to invest the walls. Probably, having never
   seen Rome, he imagined it to be little superior in size to those cities
   with which be was acquainted. But some of his legions, detesting the
   wicked enterprise of a father against his son-in-law, and of Romans
   against Rome, renounced his authority, and carried over their ensigns
   to the enemy. Already had his remaining soldiers begun to waver, when
   Galerius, dreading a fate like that of Severus, and having his haughty
   spirit broken and humiliated, threw himself at the feet of his
   soldiers, and continued to beseech them that he might not be delivered
   to the foe, until, by the promise of mighty largesses, he prevailed on
   them. Then he retreated from Rome, and fled in great disorder. Easily
   might he have been cut off in his flight, had any one pursued him even
   with a small body of troops. He was aware of his danger, and allowed
   his soldiers to disperse themselves, and to plunder and destroy far and
   wide, that, if there were any pursuers, they might be deprived of all
   means of subsistence in a ruined country. So the parts of Italy through
   which that pestilent band took its course were wasted, all things
   pillaged, matrons forced, virgins violated, parents and husbands
   compelled by torture to disclose where they had concealed their goods,
   and their wives and daughters; flocks and herds of cattle were driven
   off like spoils taken from barbarians. And thus did he, once a Roman
   emperor, but now the ravager of Italy, retire into his own territories,
   after having afflicted all men indiscriminately with the calamities of
   war. Long ago, indeed, and at the very time of his obtaining sovereign
   power, he had avowed himself the enemy of the Roman name; and he
   proposed that the empire should be called, not the Roman, but the
   Dacian empire.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXVIII.

   After the flight of Galerius, Maximian, having returned from Gaul, held
   authority in common with his son; but more obedience was yielded to the
   young man than to the old: for Maxentius had most power, and had been
   longest in possession of it; and it was to him that Maximian owed on
   this occasion the imperial dignity. The old man was impatient at being
   denied the exercise of uncontrolled sovereignty, and envied his son
   with a childish spirit of rivalry; and therefore he began to consider
   how he might expel Maxentius and resume his ancient dominion. This
   appeared easy, because the soldiers who deserted Severus had originally
   served in his own army. He called an assembly of the people of Rome,
   and of the soldiers, as if he had been to make an harangue on the
   calamitous situation of public affairs. After having spoken much on
   that subject, he stretched his hands towards his son, charged him as
   author of all ills and prime cause of the calamities of the state, and
   then tore the purple from his shoulders. Maxentius, thus stripped,
   leaped headlong from the tribunal, and was received into the arms of
   the soldiers. Their rage and clamour confounded the unnatural old man,
   and, like another Tarquin the Proud, he was driven from Rome.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXIX.

   Then Maximian returned into Gaul; and after having made some stay in
   those quarters, he went to Galerius, the enemy of his son, that they
   might confer together, as he pretended, about the settlement of the
   commonweal; but his true purpose was, under colour of reconciliation,
   to find an opportunity of murdering Galerius, and of seizing his share
   of the empire, instead of his own, from which he had been everywhere
   excluded.

   Diocles was at the court of Galerius when Maximian arrived; for
   Galerius, meaning now to invest Licinius with the ensigns of supreme
   power in the room of Severus, had lately sent for Diocles to be present
   at the solemnity. So it was performed in presence both of him and of
   Maximian; and thus there were six who ruled the empire at one and the
   same time. [1984]

   Now the designs of Maximian having been frustrated, he took flight, as
   he had done twice before, and returned into Gaul, with a heart full of
   wickedness, and intending by treacherous devices to overreach
   Constantine, who was not only his own son-in-law, but also the child of
   his son-in-law; and that he might the more successfully deceive, he
   laid aside the imperial purple. The Franks had taken up arms. Maximian
   advised the unsuspecting Constantine not to lead all his troops against
   them, and he said that a few soldiers would suffice to subdue those
   barbarians. He gave this advice that an army might be left for him to
   win over to himself, and that Constantine, by reason of his scanty
   forces, might be overpowered. The young prince believed the advice to
   be judicious, because given by an aged and experienced commander; and
   he followed it, because given by a father-in-law. He marched, leaving
   the most considerable part of his forces behind. Maximian waited a few
   days; and as soon as, by his calculation, Constantine had entered the
   territory of the barbarians, he suddenly resumed the imperial purple,
   seized the public treasures, after his wont made ample donatives to the
   soldiery, and feigned that such disasters had befallen Constantine as
   soon after befell himself. Constantine was presently informed of those
   events, and, by marches astonishingly rapid, he flew back with his
   army. Maximian, not yet prepared to oppose him, was overpowered at
   unawares, and the soldiers returned to their duty. Maximian had
   possessed himself of Marseilles (he fled thither), and shut the gates.
   Constantine drew nigh, and seeing Maximian on the walls, addressed him
   in no harsh or hostile language, and demanded what he meant, and what
   it was that he wanted, and why he had acted in a way so peculiarly
   unbecoming him. But Maximian from the walls incessantly uttered abuse
   and curses against Constantine. Then, of a sudden, the gates on the
   opposite side having been unbarred, the besiegers were admitted into
   the city. The rebel emperor, and unnatural parent and a perfidious
   father-in-law, was dragged into the presence of Constantine, heard a
   recital made of his crimes, was divested of his imperial robe, and,
   after this reprimand, obtained his life.

    Chap. XXX.

   Maximian, having thus forfeited the respect due to an emperor and a
   father-in-law, grew impatient at his abased condition, and, emboldened
   by impunity, formed new plots against Constantine. He addressed himself
   to his daughter Fausta, and, as well by entreaties as by the soothing
   of flattery, solicited her to betray her husband. He promised to obtain
   for her a more honourable alliance than that with Constantine; and he
   requested her to allow the bed-chamber of the emperor to be left open,
   and to be slightly guarded. Fausta undertook to do whatever he asked,
   and instantly revealed the whole to her husband. A plan was laid for
   detecting Maximian in the very execution of his crime. They placed a
   base eunuch to be murdered instead of the emperor. At the dead of night
   Maximian arose, and perceived all things to be favourable for his
   insidious purpose. There were few soldiers on guard, and these too at
   some distance from the bed-chamber. However, to prevent suspicion, he
   accosted them, and said that he had had a dream which he wished to
   communicate to his son-in-law. He went in armed, slew the eunuch,
   sprung forth exultingly, and avowed the murder. At that moment
   Constantine showed himself on the opposite side with a band of
   soldiers; the dead body was brought out of the bed-chamber; the
   murderer, taken in the fact, all aghast,


   "Stood like a stone, silent and motionless;"

   while Constantine upbraided him for his impiety and enormous guilt. At
   last Maximian obtained leave that the manner of his death should be at
   his own choice, and he strangled himself.

   Thus that mightiest sovereign of Rome--who ruled so long with exceeding
   glory, and who celebrated his twentieth anniversary--thus that most
   haughty man had his neck broken, and ended his detestable life by a
   death base and ignominious.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXXI.

   From Maximian, God, the avenger of religion and of His people, turned
   his eyes to Galerius, the author of the accursed persecution, that in
   his punishment also He might manifest the power of His majesty.
   Galerius, too, was purposing to celebrate his twentieth anniversary;
   and as, under that pretext, he had, by new taxes payable in gold and
   silver, oppressed the provinces, so now, that he might recompense them
   by celebrating the promised festival, he used the like pretext for
   repeating his oppressions. Who can relate in fit terms the methods used
   to harass mankind in levying the tax, and especially with regard to
   corn and the other fruits of the earth? The officers, or rather the
   executioners, of all the different magistrates, seized on each
   individual, and would never let go their hold. No man knew to whom he
   ought to make payment first. There was no dispensation given to those
   who had nothing; and they were required, under pain of being variously
   tortured, instantly to pay, notwithstanding their inability. Many
   guards were set round, no breathing time was granted, or, at any season
   of the year, the least respite from exactions. Different magistrates,
   or the officers of different magistrates, frequently contended for the
   right of levying the tax from the same persons. No threshing-floor
   without a tax-gatherer, no vintage without a watch, and nought left for
   the sustenance of the husbandman! That food should be snatched from the
   mouths of those who had earned it by toil, was grievous: the hope,
   however, of being afterwards relieved, might have made that grievance
   supportable; but it was necessary for every one who appeared at the
   anniversary festival to provide robes of various kinds, and gold and
   silver besides. And one might have said, "How shall I furnish myself
   with those things, O tyrant void of understanding, if you carry off the
   whole fruits of my ground, and violently seize its expected produce?"
   Thus, throughout the dominions of Galerius, men were spoiled of their
   goods, and all was raked together into the imperial treasury, that the
   emperor might be enabled to perform his vow of celebrating a festival
   which he was doomed never to celebrate.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXXII.

   Maximin Daia was incensed at the nomination of Licinius to the dignity
   of emperor, and he would no longer be called Cæsar, or allow himself to
   be ranked as third in authority. Galerius, by repeated messages,
   besought Daia to yield, and to acquiesce in his arrangement, to give
   place to age, and to reverence the grey hairs of Licinius. But Daia
   became more and more insolent. He urged that, as it was he who first
   assumed the purple, so, by possession, he had right to priority in
   rank; and he set at nought the entreaties and the injunctions of
   Galerius. That brute animal was stung to the quick, and bellowed when
   the mean creature whom he had made Cæsar, in expectation of his
   thorough obsequiousness, forgot the great favour conferred on him, and
   impiously withstood the requests and will of his benefactor. Galerius
   at length, overcome by the obstinacy of Daia, abolished the subordinate
   title of Cæsar, gave to himself and Licinius that of the Augusti, and
   to Daia and Constantine that of sons of the Augusti. Daia, some time
   after, in a letter to Galerius, took occasion to observe, that at the
   last general muster he had been saluted by his army under the title of
   Augustus. Galerius, vexed and grieved at this, commanded that all the
   four should have the appellation of emperor. [1985]

    Chap. XXXIII.

   And now, when Galerius was in the eighteenth year of his reign, God
   struck him with an incurable plague. A malignant ulcer formed itself
   low down in his secret parts, and spread by degrees. The physicians
   attempted to eradicate it, and healed up the place affected. But the
   sore, after having been skinned over, broke out again; a vein burst,
   and the blood flowed in such quantity as to endanger his life. The
   blood, however, was stopped, although with difficulty. The physicians
   had to undertake their operations anew, and at length they cicatrized
   the wound. In consequence of some slight motion of his body, Galerius
   received a hurt, and the blood streamed more abundantly than before. He
   grew emaciated, pallid, and feeble, and the bleeding then stanched. The
   ulcer began to be insensible to the remedies applied, and a gangrene
   seized all the neighbouring parts. It diffused itself the wider the
   more the corrupted flesh was cut away, and everything employed as the
   means of cure served but to aggravate the disease.


   "The masters of the healing art withdrew."

   Then famous physicians were brought in from all quarters; but no human
   means had any success. Apollo and Æsculapius were besought
   importunately for remedies: Apollo did prescribe, and the distemper
   augmented. Already approaching to its deadly crisis, it had occupied
   the lower regions of his body: his bowels came out, and his whole seat
   putrefied. The luckless physicians, although without hope of overcoming
   the malady, ceased not to apply fomentations and administer medicines.
   The humours having been repelled, the distemper attacked his
   intestines, and worms were generated in his body. The stench was so
   foul as to pervade not only the palace, but even the whole city; and no
   wonder, for by that time the passages from his bladder and bowels,
   having been devoured by the worms, became indiscriminate, and his body,
   with intolerable anguish, was dissolved into one mass of corruption.
   [1986]


   "Stung to the soul, he bellowed with the pain,

   So roars the wounded bull."--Pitt

   They applied warm flesh of animals to the chief seat of the disease,
   that the warmth might draw out those minute worms; and accordingly,
   when the dressings were removed, there issued forth an innumerable
   swarm: nevertheless the prolific disease had hatched swarms much more
   abundant to prey upon and consume his intestines. Already, through a
   complication of distempers, the different parts of his body had lost
   their natural form: the superior part was dry, meagre, and haggard, and
   his ghastly-looking skin had settled itself deep amongst his bones
   while the inferior, distended like bladders, retained no appearance of
   joints. These things happened in the course of a complete year; and at
   length, overcome by calamities, he was obliged to acknowledge God, and
   he cried aloud, in the intervals of raging pain, that he would re-edify
   the Church which he had demolished, and make atonement for his
   misdeeds; and when he was near his end, he published an edict of the
   tenor following:--
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1986] [Acts xii. 23.]
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXXIV.

   "Amongst our other regulations for the permanent advantage of the
   commonweal, we have hitherto studied to reduce all things to a
   conformity with the ancient laws and public discipline of the Romans.

   "It has been our aim in an especial manner, that the Christians also,
   who had abandoned the religion of their forefathers, should return to
   right opinions. For such wilfulness and folly had, we know not how,
   taken possession of them, that instead of observing those ancient
   institutions, which possibly their own forefathers had established,
   they, through caprice, made laws to themselves, and drew together into
   different societies many men of widely different persuasions.

   "After the publication of our edict, ordaining the Christians to betake
   themselves to the observance of the ancient institutions, many of them
   were subdued through the fear of danger, and moreover many of them were
   exposed to jeopardy; nevertheless, because great numbers still persist
   in their opinions, and because we have perceived that at present they
   neither pay reverence and due adoration to the gods, nor yet worship
   their own God, therefore we, from our wonted clemency in bestowing
   pardon on all, have judged it fit to extend our indulgence to those
   men, and to permit them again to be Christians, and to establish the
   places of their religious assemblies; yet so as that they offend not
   against good order.

   "By another mandate we purpose to signify unto magistrates how they
   ought herein to demean themselves.

   "Wherefore it will be the duty of the Christians, in consequence of
   this our toleration, to pray to their God for our welfare, and for that
   of the public, and for their own; that the commonweal may continue safe
   in every quarter, and that they themselves may live securely in their
   habitations."

    Chap. XXXV.

   This edict was promulgated at Nicomedia on the day preceding the
   kalends of May, [1987] in the eighth consulship of Galerius, and the
   second of Maximin Daia. Then the prison-gates having been thrown open,
   you, my best beloved Donatus, [1988] together with the other confessors
   for the faith, were set at liberty from a jail, which had been your
   residence for six years. Galerius, however, did not, by publication of
   this edict, obtain the divine forgiveness. In a few days after he was
   consumed by the horrible disease that had brought on an universal
   putrefaction. Dying, he recommended his wife and son to Licinius, and
   delivered them over into his hands. This event was known at Nicomedia
   before the end of the month. [1989] His vicennial anniversary was to
   have been celebrated on the ensuing kalends of March. [1990]

    Chap. XXXVI.

   Daia, on receiving this news, hasted with relays of horses from the
   East, to seize the dominions of Galerius, and, while Licinius lingered
   in Europe, to arrogate to himself all the country as far as the narrow
   seas of Chalcedon. On his entry into Bithynia, he, with the view of
   acquiring immediate popularity, abolished Galerius' tax, to the great
   joy of all. Dissension arose between the two emperors, and almost an
   open war. They stood on the opposite shores with their armies. Peace,
   however, and amity were established under certain conditions. Licinius
   and Daia met on the narrow sees, concluded a treaty, and in token of
   friendship joined hands. Then Daia, believing all things to be in
   security, returned (to Nicomedia), and was in his new dominions what he
   had been in Syria and Egypt. First of all, he took away the toleration
   and general protection granted by Galerius to the Christians, and, for
   this end, he secretly procured addresses from different cities,
   requesting that no Christian church might be built within their walls;
   and thus he meant to make that which was his own choice appear as if
   extorted from him by importunity. In compliance with those addresses,
   he introduced a new mode of government in things respecting religion,
   and for each city he created a high priest, chosen from among the
   persons of most distinction. The office of those men was to make daily
   sacrifices to all their gods, and, with the aid of the former priests,
   to prevent the Christians from erecting churches, or from worshipping
   God either publicly or in private; and he authorized them to compel the
   Christians to sacrifice to idols, and, on their refusal, to bring them
   before the civil magistrate; and, as if this had not been enough, in
   every province he established a superintendent priest, one of chief
   eminence in the state; and he commanded that all those priests newly
   instituted should appear in white habits, that being the most
   honourable distinction of dress. [1991] And as to the Christians, he
   purposed to follow the course that he had followed in the East, and,
   affecting the show of clemency, he forbade the slaying of God's
   servants, but he gave command that they should be mutilated. So the
   confessors for the faith had their ears and nostrils slit, their hands
   and feet lopped off, and their eyes dug out of the sockets.

    Chap. XXXVII.

   While occupied in this plan, he received letters from Constantine which
   deterred him from proceeding in its execution, so for a time he
   dissembled his purpose; nevertheless any Christian that fell within his
   power was privily thrown into the sea. Neither did he cease from his
   custom of sacrificing every day in the palace. It was also an invention
   of his to cause all animals used for food to be slaughtered, not by
   cooks, but by priests at the altars; so that nothing was ever served
   up, unless foretasted, consecrated, and sprinkled with wine, according
   to the rites of paganism; and whoever was invited to an entertainment
   must needs have returned from it impure and defiled. In all things else
   he resembled his preceptor Galerius. For if aught chanced to have been
   left untouched by Diocles and Maximian, that did Daia greedily and
   shamelessly carry off. And now the granaries of each individual were
   shut, and all warehouses sealed up, and taxes, not yet due, were levied
   by anticipation. Hence famine, from neglect of cultivation, and the
   prices of all things enhanced beyond measure. Herds and flocks were
   driven from their pasture for the daily sacrifice. By gorging his
   soldiers with the flesh of sacrifices, he so corrupted them, that they
   disdained their wonted pittance in corn, and wantonly threw it away.
   Meanwhile Daia recompensed his bodyguards, who were very numerous, with
   costly raiment and gold medals, made donatives in silver to the common
   soldiers and recruits, and bestowed every sort of largess on the
   barbarians who served in his army. As to grants of the property of
   living persons, which he made to his favourites whenever they chose to
   ask what belonged to another, I know not whether the same thanks might
   not be due to him that are given to merciful robbers, who spoil without
   murdering.

    Chap. XXXVIII.

   But that which distinguished his character, and in which he transcended
   all former emperors, was his desire of debauching women. What else can
   I call it but a blind and headstrong passion? Yet such epithets feebly
   express my indignation in reciting his enormities. The magnitude of the
   guilt overpowers my tongue, and makes it unequal to its office. Eunuchs
   and panders made search everywhere, and no sooner was any comely face
   discovered, than husbands and parents were obliged to withdraw. Matrons
   of quality and virgins were stripped of their robes, and all their
   limbs were inspected, lest any part should be unworthy of the bed of
   the emperor. Whenever a woman resisted, death by drowning was inflicted
   on her; as if, under the reign of this adulterer, chastity had been
   treason. Some men there were, who, beholding the violation of wives
   whom for virtue and fidelity they affectionately loved, could not
   endure their anguish of mind, and so killed themselves. While this
   monster ruled, it was singular deformity alone which could shield the
   honour of any female from his savage desires. At length he introduced a
   custom prohibiting marriage unless with the imperial permission; and he
   made this an instrument to serve the purposes of his lewdness. After
   having debauched freeborn maidens, he gave them for wives to his
   slaves. His conflicts also imitated the example of the emperor, and
   violated with impunity the beds of their dependants. For who was there
   to punish such offences? As for the daughters of men of middle rank,
   any who were inclined took them by force. Ladies of quality, who could
   not be taken by force, were petitioned for, and obtained from the
   emperor by way of free gift. Nor could a father oppose this; for the
   imperial warrant having been once signed, he had no alternative but to
   die, or to receive some barbarian as his son-in-law. For hardly was
   there any person in the lifeguard except of those people, who, having
   been driven from their habitations by the Goths in the twentieth year
   of Diocletian, yielded themselves to Galerius and entered into his
   service. It was ill for humankind, that men who had fled from the
   bondage of barbarians should thus come to lord it over the Romans.
   Environed by such guards, Daia oppressed and insulted the Eastern
   empire.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XXXIX.

   Now Daia, in gratifying his libidinous desires, made his own will the
   standard of right; and therefore he would not refrain from soliciting
   the widow of Galerius, the Empress Valeria, to whom he had lately given
   the appellation of mother. After the death of her husband, she had
   repaired to Daia, because she imagined that she might live with more
   security in his dominions than elsewhere, especially as he was a
   married man; but the flagitious creature became instantly inflamed with
   a passion for her. Valeria was still in weeds, the time of her mourning
   not being yet expired. He sent a message to her proposing marriage, and
   offering, on her compliance, to put away his wife. She frankly returned
   an answer such as she alone could dare to do: first, that she would not
   treat of marriage while she was in weeds, and while the ashes of
   Galerius, her husband, and, by adoption, the father of Daia, were yet
   warm; next, that he acted impiously, in proposing to divorce a faithful
   wife to make room for another, whom in her turn he would also cast off;
   and, lastly, that it was indecent, unexampled, and unlawful for a woman
   of her title and dignity to engage a second time in wedlock. [1992]
   This bold answer having been reported to Daia, presently his desires
   changed into rage and furious resentment. He pronounced sentence of
   forfeiture against the princess, seized her goods, removed her
   attendants, tortured her eunuchs to death, and banished her and her
   mother Prisca: but he appointed no particular place for her residence
   while in banishment; and hence he insultingly expelled her from every
   abode that she took in the course of her wanderings; and, to complete
   all, he condemned the ladies who enjoyed most of her friendship and
   confidence to die on a false accusation of adultery.

    Chap. XL.

   There was a certain matron of high rank who already had grandchildren
   by more than one son. Her Valeria loved like a second mother, and Daia
   suspected that her advice had produced that refusal which Valeria gave
   to his matrimonial offers; and therefore he charged the president
   Eratineus to have her put to death in a way that might injure her fame.
   To her two others, equally noble, were added. One of them, who had a
   daughter a Vestal virgin at Rome, maintained an intercourse by stealth
   with the banished Valeria. The other, married to a senator, was
   intimately connected with the empress. Excellent beauty and virtue
   proved the cause of their death. They were dragged to the tribunal, not
   of an upright judge, but of a robber. Neither indeed was there any
   accuser, until a certain Jew, one charged with other offences, was
   induced, through hope of pardon, to give false evidence against the
   innocent. The equitable and vigilant magistrate conducted him out of
   the city under a guard, lest the populace should have stoned him. This
   tragedy was acted at Nicæa. The Jew was ordered to the torture till he
   should speak as he had been instructed, while the torturers by blows
   prevented the women from speaking in their own defence. The innocent
   were condemned to die. Then there arose wailing and lamentation, not
   only of the senator, who attended on his well-deserving consort, but
   amongst the spectators also, whom this proceeding, scandalous and
   unheard of, had brought together; and, to prevent the multitude from
   violently rescuing the condemned persons out of the hands of the
   executioners, military commanders followed with light infantry and
   archers. And thus, under a guard of armed soldiers, they were led to
   punishment. Their domestics having been forced to flee, they would have
   remained without burial, had not the compassion of friends interred
   them by stealth. Nor was the promise of pardon made good to the feigned
   adulterer, for he was fixed to a gibbet, and then he disclosed the
   whole secret contrivance; and with his last breath he protested to all
   the beholders that the women died innocent.

    Chap. XLI.

   But the empress, an exile in some desert region of Syria, secretly
   informed her father Diocletian of the calamity that had befallen her.
   He despatched messengers to Daia, requesting that his daughter might be
   sent to him. He could not prevail. Again and again he entreated; yet
   she was not sent. At length he employed a relation of his, a military
   man high in power and authority, to implore Daia by the remembrance of
   past favours. This messenger, equally unsuccessful in his negotiation
   as the others, reported to Diocletian that his prayers were vain.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XLII.

   At this time, by command of Constantine, the statues of Maximian
   Herculius were thrown down, and his portraits removed; and, as the two
   old emperors were generally delineated in one piece, the portraits of
   both were removed at the same time. Thus Diocletian lived to see a
   disgrace which no former emperor had ever seen, and, under the double
   load of vexation of spirit and bodily maladies, he resolved to die.
   Tossing to and fro, with his soul agitated by grief, he could neither
   eat nor take rest. He sighed, groaned, and wept often, and incessantly
   threw himself into various postures, now on his couch, and now on the
   ground. So he, who for twenty years was the most prosperous of
   emperors, having been cast down into the obscurity of a private
   station, treated in the most contumelious manner, and compelled to
   abhor life, became incapable of receiving nourishment, and, worn out
   with anguish of mind, expired.

     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XLIII.

   Of the adversaries of God there still remained one, whose overthrow and
   end I am now to relate.

   Daia had entertained jealousy and ill-will against Licinius from the
   time that the preference was given to him by Galerius; and those
   sentiments still subsisted, notwithstanding the treaty of peace lately
   concluded between them. When Daia heard that the sister of Constantine
   was betrothed to Licinius, he apprehended that the two emperors, by
   contracting this affinity, meant to league against him; so he privily
   sent ambassadors to Rome, desiring a friendly alliance with Maxentius:
   he also wrote to him in terms of cordiality. The ambassadors were
   received courteously, friendship established, and in token of it the
   effigies of Maxentius and Daia were placed together in public view.
   Maxentius willingly embraced this, as if it had been an aid from
   heaven; for he had already declared war against Constantine, as if to
   revenge the death of his father Maximian. From this appearance of
   filial piety a suspicion arose, that the detestable old man had but
   feigned a quarrel with his son that he might have an opportunity to
   destroy his rivals in power, and so make way for himself and his son to
   possess the whole empire. This conjecture, however, had no foundation;
   for his true purpose was to have destroyed his son and the others, and
   then to have reinstated himself and Diocletian in sovereign authority.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XLIV.

   And now a civil war broke out between Constantine and Maxentius.
   Although Maxentius kept himself within Rome, because the soothsayers
   had foretold that if he went out of it he should perish, yet he
   conducted the military operations by able generals. In forces he
   exceeded his adversary; for he had not only his father's army, which
   deserted from Severus, but also his own, which he had lately drawn
   together out of Mauritania and Italy. They fought, and the troops of
   Maxentius prevailed. At length Constantine, with steady courage and a
   mind prepared for every event, led his whole forces to the
   neighbourhood of Rome, and encamped them opposite to the Milvian
   bridge. The anniversary of the reign of Maxentius approached, that is,
   the sixth of the kalends of November, [1993] and the fifth year of his
   reign was drawing to an end.

   Constantine was directed in a dream to cause the heavenly sign to be
   delineated on the shields of his soldiers, and so to proceed to battle.
   He did as he had been commanded, and he marked on their shields the
   letter Ch, with a perpendicular line drawn through it and turned round
   thus at the top, being the cipher of Christ. Having this sign (Ch? ),
   his troops stood to arms. The enemies advanced, but without their
   emperor, and they crossed the bridge. The armies met, and fought with
   the utmost exertions of valour, and firmly maintained their ground. In
   the meantime a sedition arose at Rome, and Maxentius was reviled as one
   who had abandoned all concern for the safety of the commonweal; and
   suddenly, while he exhibited the Circensian games on the anniversary of
   his reign, the people cried with one voice, "Constantine cannot be
   overcome!" Dismayed at this, Maxentius burst from the assembly, and
   having called some senators together, ordered the Sibylline books to be
   searched. In them it was found that:--


   "On the same day the enemy of the Romans should perish."

   Led by this response to the hopes of victory, he went to the field. The
   bridge in his rear was broken down. At sight of that the battle grew
   hotter. The hand of the Lord prevailed, and the forces of Maxentius
   were routed. He fled towards the broken bridge; but the multitude
   pressing on him, he was driven headlong into the Tiber.

   This destructive war being ended, Constantine was acknowledged as
   emperor, with great rejoicings, by the senate and people of Rome. And
   now he came to know the perfidy of Daia; for he found the letters
   written to Maxentius, and saw the statues and portraits of the two
   associates which had been set up together. The senate, in reward of the
   valour of Constantine, decreed to him the title of Maximus (the
   Greatest), a title which Daia had always arrogated to himself. Daia,
   when he heard that Constantine was victorious and Rome freed, expressed
   as much sorrow as if he himself had been vanquished; but afterwards,
   when he heard of the decree of the senate, he grew outrageous, avowed
   enmity towards Constantine, and made his title of the Greatest a theme
   of abuse and raillery.

    Chap. XLV.

   Constantine having settled all things at Rome, went to Milan about the
   beginning of winter. Thither also Licinius came to receive his wife
   Constantia. When Daia understood that they were busied in solemnizing
   the nuptials, he moved out of Syria in the depth of a severe winter,
   and by forced marches he came into Bithynia with an army much impaired;
   for he lost all his beasts of burden, of whatever kind, in consequence
   of excessive rains and snow, miry ways, cold and fatigue. Their
   carcases, scattered about the roads, seemed an emblem of the calamities
   of the impending war, and the presage of a like destruction that
   awaited the soldiers. Daia did not halt in his own territories; but
   immediately crossed the Thracian Bosphorus, and in a hostile manner
   approached the gates of Byzantium. There was a garrison in the city,
   established by Licinius to check any invasion that Daia might make. At
   first Daia attempted to entice the soldiers by the promise of
   donatives, and then to intimidate them by assault and storm. Yet
   neither promises nor force availed aught. After eleven days had
   elapsed, within which time Licinius might have learned the state of the
   garrison, the soldiers surrendered, not through treachery, but because
   they were too weak to make a longer resistance. Then Daia moved on to
   Heraclea (otherwise called Perinthus), and by delays of the like nature
   before that place lost some days. And now Licinius by expeditious
   marches had reached Adrianople, but with forces not numerous. Then
   Daia, having taken Perinthus by capitulation, and remained there for a
   short space, moved forwards eighteen miles to the first station. Here
   his progress was stopped; for Licinius had already occupied the second
   station, at the distance also of eighteen miles. Licinius, having
   assembled what forces he could from the neighbouring quarters, advanced
   towards Daia rather indeed to retard his operations than with any
   purpose of fighting, or hope of victory: for Daia had an army of
   seventy thousand men, while he himself had scarce thirty thousand; for
   his soldiers being dispersed in various regions, there was not time, on
   that sudden emergency, to collect all of them together.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XLVI.

   The armies thus approaching each other, seemed on the eve of a battle.
   Then Daia made this vow to Jupiter, that if he obtained victory he
   would extinguish and utterly efface the name of the Christians. And on
   the following night an angel of the Lord seemed to stand before
   Licinius while he was asleep, admonishing him to arise immediately, and
   with his whole army to put up a prayer to the Supreme God, and assuring
   him that by so doing he should obtain victory. Licinius fancied that,
   hearing this, he arose, and that his monitor, who was nigh him,
   directed how be should pray, and in what words. Awaking from sleep, he
   sent for one of his secretaries, and dictated these words exactly as he
   had heard them:--

   "Supreme God, we beseech Thee; Holy God, we beseech Thee; unto Thee we
   commend all right; unto Thee we commend our safety; unto Thee we
   commend our empire. By Thee we live, by Thee we are victorious and
   happy. Supreme Holy God, hear our prayers; to Thee we stretch forth our
   arms. Hear, Holy Supreme God."

   Many copies were made of these words, and distributed amongst the
   principal commanders, who were to teach them to the soldiers under
   their charge. At this all men took fresh courage, in the confidence
   that victory bad been announced to them from heaven. Licinius resolved
   to give battle on the kalends of May; [1994] for precisely eight years
   before Daia had received the dignity of Cæsar, and Licinius chose that
   day in hopes that Daia might be vanquished on the anniversary of his
   reign, as Maxentius had been on his. Daia, however, purposed to give
   battle earlier, to fight on the day before those kalends, [1995] and to
   triumph on the anniversary of his reign. Accounts came that Daia was in
   motion; the soldiers of Licinius armed themselves; and advanced. A
   barren and open plain, called Campus Serenus, lay between the two
   armies. They were now in sight of one another. The soldiers of Licinius
   placed their shields on the ground, took off their helmets, and,
   following the example of their leaders, stretched forth their hands
   towards heaven. Then the emperor uttered the prayer, and they all
   repeated it after him. The host, doomed to speedy destruction, heard
   the murmur of the prayers of their adversaries. And now, the ceremony
   having been thrice performed, the soldiers of Licinius became full of
   courage, buckled on their helmets again, and resumed their shields. The
   two emperors advanced to a conference: but Daia could not be brought to
   peace; for he held Licinius in contempt, and imagined that the soldiers
   would presently abandon an emperor parsimonious in his donatives, and
   enter into the service of one liberal even to profusion. And indeed it
   was on this notion that he began the war. He looked for the voluntary
   surrender of the armies of Licinius; and, thus reinforced, he meant
   forthwith to have attacked Constantine.

    Chap. XLVII.

   So the two armies drew nigh; the trumpets gave the signal; the military
   ensigns advanced; the troops of Licinius charged. But the enemies,
   panic-struck, could neither draw their swords nor yet throw their
   javelins. Daia went about, and, alternately by entreaties and promises,
   attempted to seduce the soldiers of Licinius. But he was not hearkened
   to in any quarter, and they drove him back. Then were the troops of
   Daia slaughtered, none making resistance; and such numerous legions,
   and forces so mighty, were mowed down by an inferior enemy. No one
   called to mind his reputation, or former valour, or the honourable
   rewards which had been conferred on him. The Supreme God did so place
   their necks under the sword of their foes, that they seemed to have
   entered the field, not as combatants, but as men devoted to death.
   After great numbers had fallen, Daia perceived that everything went
   contrary to his hopes; and therefore he threw aside the purple, and
   having put on the habit of a slave, hasted across the Thracian
   Bosphorus. One half of his army perished in battle, and the rest either
   surrendered to the victor or fled; for now that the emperor himself had
   deserted, there seemed to be no shame in desertion. Before the
   expiration of the kalends of May, Daia arrived at Nicomedia, although
   distant one hundred and sixty miles from the field of battle. So in the
   space of one day and two nights he performed that journey. Having
   hurried away with his children and wife, and a few officers of his
   court, he went towards Syria; but having been joined by some troops
   from those quarters, and having collected together a part of his
   fugitive forces, he halted in Cappadocia, and then he resumed the
   imperial garb.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. XLVIII.

   Not many days after the victory, Licinius, having received part of the
   soldiers of Daia into his service, and properly distributed them,
   transported his army into Bithynia, and having made his entry into
   Nicomedia, he returned thanks to God, through whose aid he had
   overcome; and on the ides of June, [1996] while he and Constantine were
   consuls for the third time, he commanded the following edict for the
   restoration of the Church, directed to the president of the province,
   to be promulgated:--

   "When we, Constantine and Licinius, emperors, had an interview at
   Milan, and conferred together with respect to the good and security of
   the commonweal, it seemed to us that, amongst those things that are
   profitable to mankind in general, the reverence paid to the Divinity
   merited our first and chief attention, and that it was proper that the
   Christians and all others should have liberty to follow that mode of
   religion which to each of them appeared best; so that that God, who is
   seated in heaven, might be benign and propitious to us, and to every
   one under our government. And therefore we judged it a salutary
   measure, and one highly consonant to right reason, that no man should
   be denied leave of attaching himself to the rites of the Christians, or
   to whatever other religion his mind directed him, that thus the supreme
   Divinity, to whose worship we freely devote ourselves, might continue
   to vouchsafe His favour and beneficence to us. And accordingly we give
   you to know that, without regard to any provisos in our former orders
   to you concerning the Christians, all who choose that religion are to
   be permitted, freely and absolutely, to remain in it, and not to be
   disturbed any ways, or molested. And we thought fit to be thus special
   in the things committed to your charge, that you might understand that
   the indulgence which we have granted in matters of religion to the
   Christians is ample and unconditional; and perceive at the same time
   that the open and free exercise of their respective religions is
   granted to all others, as well as to the Christians. For it befits the
   well-ordered state and the tranquillity of our times that each
   individual be allowed, according to his own choice, to worship the
   Divinity; and we mean not to derogate aught from the honour due to any
   religion or its votaries. Moreover, with respect to the Christians, we
   formerly gave certain orders concerning the places appropriated for
   their religious assemblies; but now we will that all persons who have
   purchased such places, either from our exchequer or from any one else,
   do restore them to the Christians, without money demanded or price
   claimed, and that this be performed peremptorily and unambiguously; and
   we will also, that they who have obtained any right to such places by
   form of gift do forthwith restore them to the Christians: reserving
   always to such persons, who have either purchased for a price, or
   gratuitously acquired them, to make application to the judge of the
   district, if they look on themselves as entitled to any equivalent from
   our beneficence.

   "All those places are, by your intervention, to be immediately restored
   to the Christians. And because it appears that, besides the places
   appropriated to religious worship, the Christians did possess other
   places, which belonged not to individuals, but to their society in
   general, that is, to their churches, we comprehend all such within the
   regulation aforesaid, and we will that you cause them all to be
   restored to the society or churches, and that without hesitation or
   controversy: Provided always, that the persons making restitution
   without a price paid shall be at liberty to seek indemnification from
   our bounty. In furthering all which things for the behoof of the
   Christians, you are to use your utmost diligence, to the end that our
   orders be speedily obeyed, and our gracious purpose in securing the
   public tranquillity promoted. So shall that divine favour which, in
   affairs of the mightiest importance, we have already experienced,
   continue to give success to us, and in our successes make the
   commonweal happy. And that the tenor of this our gracious ordinance may
   be made known unto all, we will that you cause it by your authority to
   be published everywhere."

   Licinius having issued this ordinance, made an harangue, in which he
   exhorted the Christians to rebuild their religious edifices.

   And thus, from the overthrow of the Church until its restoration, there
   was a space of ten years and about four months.

    Chap. XLIX.

   While Licinius pursued with his army, the fugitive tyrant retreated,
   and again occupied the passes of mount Taurus; and there, by erecting
   parapets and towers, attempted to stop the march of Licinius. But the
   victorious troops, by an attack made on the right, broke through all
   obstacles, and Daia at length fled to Tarsus. There, being hard pressed
   both by sea and land, he despaired of finding any place for refuge; and
   in the anguish and dismay of his mind, he sought death as the only
   remedy of those calamities that God had heaped on him. But first he
   gorged himself with food, and large draughts of wine, as those are wont
   who believe that they eat and drink for the last time; and so he
   swallowed poison. However, the force of the poison, repelled by his
   full stomach, could not immediately operate, but it produced a grievous
   disease, resembling the pestilence; and his life was prolonged only
   that his sufferings might be more severe. And now the poison began to
   rage, and to burn up everything within him, so that he was driven to
   distraction with the intolerable pain; and during a fit of frenzy,
   which lasted four days, he gathered handfuls of earth, and greedily
   devoured it. Having undergone various and excruciating torments, he
   dashed his forehead against the wall, and his eyes started out of their
   sockets. And now, become blind, he imagined that he saw God, with His
   servants arrayed in white robes, sitting in judgment on him. He roared
   out as men on the rack are wont, and exclaimed that not he, but others,
   were guilty. In the end, as if he had been racked into confession, he
   acknowledged his own guilt, and lamentably implored Christ to have
   mercy upon him. Then, amidst groans, like those of one burnt alive, did
   he breathe out his guilty soul in the most horrible kind of death.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chap. L.

   Thus did God subdue all those who persecuted His name, so that neither
   root nor branch of them remained; for Licinius, as soon as he was
   established in sovereign authority, commanded that Valeria should be
   put to death. Daia, although exasperated against her, never ventured to
   do this, not even after his discomfiture and flight, and when he knew
   that his end approached. Licinius commanded that Candidianus also
   should be put to death. He was the son of Galerius by a concubine, and
   Valeria, having no children, had adopted him. On the news of the death
   of Daia, she came in disguise to the court of Licinius, anxious to
   observe what might befall Candidianus. The youth, presenting himself at
   Nicomedia, had an outward show of honour paid to him, and, while he
   suspected no harm, was killed. Hearing of this catastrophe, Valeria
   immediately fled. The Emperor Severus left a son, Severianus, arrived
   at man's estate, who accompanied Daia in his flight from the field of
   battle. Licinius caused him to be condemned and executed, under the
   pretence that, on the death of Daia, he had intentions of assuming the
   imperial purple. Long before this time, Candidianus and Severianus,
   apprehending evil from Licinius, had chosen to remain with Daia; while
   Valeria favoured Licinius, and was willing to bestow on him that which
   she had denied to Daia, all rights accruing to her as the widow of
   Galerius. Licinius also put to death Maximus, the son of Daia, a boy
   eight years old, and a daughter of Daia, who was seven years old, and
   had been betrothed to Candidianus. But before their death, their mother
   had been thrown into the Orontes, in which river she herself had
   frequently commanded chaste women to be drowned. So, by the unerring
   and just judgment of God, all the impious received according to the
   deeds that they had done.

    Chap. LI.

   Valeria, too, who for fifteen months had wandered under a mean garb
   from province to province, was at length discovered in Thessalonica,
   was apprehended, together with her mother Prisca, and suffered capital
   punishment. Both the ladies were conducted to execution; a fall from
   grandeur which moved the pity of the multitude of beholders that the
   strange sight had gathered together. They were beheaded, and their
   bodies cast into the sea. Thus the chaste demeanour of Valeria, and the
   high rank of her and her mother, proved fatal to both of them. [1997]

   I relate all those things on the authority of well-informed persons;
   and I thought it proper to commit them to writing exactly as they
   happened, lest the memory of events so important should perish, and
   lest any future historian of the persecutors should corrupt the truth,
   either by suppressing their offences against God, or the judgment of
   God against them. To His everlasting mercy ought we to render thanks,
   that, having at length looked on the earth, He deigned to collect again
   and to restore His flock, partly laid waste by ravenous wolves, and
   partly scattered abroad, and to extirpate those noxious wild beasts who
   had trod down its pastures, and destroyed its resting-places. [1998]
   Where now are the surnames of the Jovii and the Herculii, once so
   glorious and renowned amongst the nations; surnames insolently assumed
   at first by Diocles and Maximian, and afterwards transferred to their
   successors? The Lord has blotted them out and erased them from the
   earth. Let us therefore with exultation celebrate the triumphs of God,
   and oftentimes with praises make mention of His victory; let us in our
   prayers, by night and by day, beseech Him to confirm for ever that
   peace which, after a warfare of ten years, He has bestowed on His own:
   and do you, above all others, my best beloved Donatus, who so well
   deserve to be heard, implore the Lord that it would please Him
   propitiously and mercifully to continue His pity towards His servants,
   to protect His people from the machinations and assaults of the devil,
   and to guard the now flourishing churches in perpetual felicity.

  Elucidation

   (On the tenth of the kalends of April, p. 301.)

   Serious difficulties are encountered by the learned in reconciling
   Lactantius with himself, if, indeed, the fault be not one of his
   copyists rather than his own. In the fourth book of the Institutes
   [1999] his language is thus given by Baluzius: [2000] --

   "Extremis temporibus Tiberii Cæsaris, ut scriptum legimus, Dominus
   noster Jesus Christus, a Judæis cruciatus est post diem decimum
   kalendarum Aprilis, duobus Geminis consulibus."

   Lactantius was writing in Nicomedia, and may have quoted from memory
   what he had read, perhaps in the report of Pilate himself. The
   expression post diem decimum kalendarum Aprilis is ambiguous: and
   Jarvis says, "My impression is, that it means after the tenth day
   before the kalends of April;' that is, after the 23d of March." [2001]

   But here our author says, according to the accurate edition of Walchius
   [2002] (a.d. 1715),--

   "Exinde tetrarchas habuerunt usque ad Herodem, qui fuit sub imperio
   Tiberii Cæsaris: cujus anno quinto decimo, id est duobus Geminis
   consulibus, ante diem septimam Calendarum Aprilium, Judæi Christum
   cruci affixerunt."

   But here, on the authority of forty manuscripts, Du Fresnoy reads,
   "ante diem decimam," which he labours to reconcile with "post diem
   decimum," as above. Jarvis adheres to the reading septimam, supported
   by more than fifty manuscripts, and decides for the 23d of March.

   He cites Augustine to the same effect in the noted passage: [2003] --

   "Ille autem mense conceptum et passum esse Christum, et Paschæ
   observatio et dies ecclesiis notissimus Nativitatis ejus ostendit. Qui
   enim mense nono natus est octavo kalendas Janvarias profecto mense
   primo conceptus est circa octavum kalendas Aprilis, quod tempus
   passionis ejus fuit."

   This, Augustine considers to be "seething a kid in mother's milk,"
   after a mystical sense; cruelly making the cross to coincide with the
   maternity of the Virgin, who beheld her Son an innocent victim on the
   anniversary of her salutation by the angel.

  Fragments of Lactantius

   I. Fear, love, joy, sadness, lust, eager desire, anger, pity,
   emulation, admiration,--these motions or affections of the mind exist
   from the beginning of man's creation by the Lord; and they were
   usefully and advantageously introduced into human nature, that by
   governing himself by these with method, and in accordance with reason,
   man may be able, by acting manfully, to exercise those good qualities,
   by means of which he would justly have deserved to receive from the
   Lord eternal life. For these affections of the mind being restrained
   within their proper limits, that is, being rightly employed, produce at
   present good qualities, and in the future eternal rewards. But when
   they advance [2004] beyond their boundaries, that is, when they turn
   aside to an evil course, then vices and iniquities come forth, and
   produce everlasting punishments. [2005]

   II. Within our memory, also, Lactantius speaks of metres,--the
   pentameter (he says) and the tetrameter. [2006]

   III. Firmianus, writing to Probus on the metres of comedies, thus
   speaks: "For as to the question which you proposed concerning the
   metres of comedies, I also know that many are of opinion that the plays
   of Terence in particular have not the metre of Greek comedy,--that is,
   of Menander, Philemon, and Diphilus, which consist of trimeter verses;
   for our ancient writers of comedies, in the modulation of their plays,
   preferred to follow Eupolis, Cratinus, and Aristophanes, as has been
   before said." That there is a measure--that is, metre [2007] --in the
   plays of Terence and Plautus, and of the other comic and tragic
   writers, let these declare: Cicero, Scaurus, and Firmianus. [2008]

   IV. We will bring forward the sentiments of our Lactantius, which he
   expressed in words in his third volume to Probus on this subject. The
   Gauls, he says, were from ancient times called Galatians, from the
   whiteness of their body; and thus the Sibyl terms them. And this is
   what the poet intended to signify when he said,--


   "Gold collars deck their milk-white necks," [2009]

   when he might have used the word white. It is plain that from this the
   province was called Galatia, in which, on their arrival in it, the
   Gauls united themselves with Greeks, from which circumstance that
   region was called Gallogræcia, and afterwards Galatia. And it is no
   wonder if he said this concerning the Galatians, and related that a
   people of the West, having passed over so great a distance in the
   middle of the earth, settled in a region of the East. [2010]

  The Phoenix

      By an Uncertain Author. Attributed to Lactantius [2011]

   There is a happy spot, retired [2012] in the first East, where the
   great gate of the eternal pole lies open. It is not, however, situated
   near to his rising in summer or in winter, but where the sun pours the
   day from his vernal chariot. There a plain spreads its open tracts; nor
   does any mound rise, nor hollow valley open [2013] itself. But through
   twice six ells that place rises above the mountains, whose tops are
   thought to be lofty among us. Here is the grove of the sun; a wood
   stands planted with many a tree, blooming with the honour of perpetual
   foliage. When the pole had blazed with the fires of Phaethon, that
   place was uninjured by the flames; and when the deluge had immersed the
   world in waves, it rose above the waters of Deucalion. No enfeebling
   diseases, no sickly old age, nor cruel death, nor harsh fear,
   approaches hither, nor dreadful crime, nor mad desire of riches, nor
   Mars, nor fury, burning with the love of slaughter. [2014] Bitter grief
   is absent, and want clothed in rags, and sleepless cares, and violent
   hunger. No tempest rages there, nor dreadful violence of the wind; nor
   does the hoar-frost cover the earth with cold dew. No cloud extends its
   fleecy [2015] covering above the plains, nor does the turbid moisture
   of water fall from on high; but there is a fountain in the middle,
   which they call by the name of "living;" [2016] it is clear, gentle,
   and abounding with sweet waters, which, bursting forth once during the
   space of each [2017] month, twelve times irrigates all the grove with
   waters. Here a species of tree, rising with lofty stem, bears mellow
   fruits not about to fall on the ground. This grove, these woods, a
   single [2018] bird, the phoenix, inhabits,--single, but it lives
   reproduced by its own death. It obeys and submits [2019] to Phoebus, a
   remarkable attendant. Its parent nature has given it to possess this
   office. When at its first rising the saffron morn grows red, when it
   puts to flight the stars with its rosy light, thrice and four times she
   plunges her body into the sacred waves, thrice and four times she sips
   water from the living stream. [2020] She is raised aloft, and takes her
   seat on the highest top of the lofty tree, which alone looks down upon
   the whole grove; and turning herself to the fresh risings of the
   nascent Phoebus, she awaits his rays and rising beam. And when the sun
   has thrown back the threshold of the shining gate, and the light gleam
   [2021] of the first light has shone forth, she begins to pour strains
   of sacred song, and to hail [2022] the new light with wondrous voice,
   which neither the notes of the nightingale [2023] nor the flute of the
   Muses can equal with Cyrrhæan [2024] strains. But neither is it thought
   that the dying swan can imitate it, nor the tuneful strings of the lyre
   of Mercury. After that Phoebus has brought back his horses to the open
   heaven, [2025] and continually advancing, has displayed [2026] his
   whole orb; she applauds with thrice-repeated flapping of her wings, and
   having thrice adored the fire-bearing head, is silent. And she also
   distinguishes the swift hours by sounds not liable to error by day and
   night: an overseer [2027] of the groves, a venerable priestess of the
   wood, and alone admitted to thy secrets, O Phoebus. And when she has
   now accomplished the thousand years of her life, and length of days has
   rendered her burdensome, [2028] in order that she may renew the age
   which has glided by, the fates pressing [2029] her, she flees from the
   beloved couch of the accustomed grove. And when she has left the sacred
   places, through a desire of being born [2030] again, then she seeks
   this world, where death reigns. Full of years, she directs her swift
   flight into Syria, to which Venus herself has given the name of
   Phoenice; [2031] and through trackless deserts she seeks the retired
   groves in the place, where a remote wood lies concealed through the
   glens. Then she chooses a lofty palm, with top reaching to the heavens,
   which has the pleasing [2032] name of phoenix from the bird, and where
   [2033] no hurtful living creature can break through, or slimy serpent,
   or any bird of prey. Then Æolas shuts in the winds in hanging caverns,
   lest they should injure the bright [2034] air with their blasts, or
   lest a cloud collected by the south wind through the empty sky should
   remove the rays of the sun, and be a hindrance [2035] to the bird.
   Afterwards she builds for herself either a nest or a tomb, for she
   perishes that she may live; yet she produces herself. Hence she
   collects juices and odours, which the Assyrian gathers from the rich
   wood, which the wealthy Arabian gathers; which either the Pygmæan
   [2036] nations, or India crops, or the Sabæan land produces from its
   soft bosom. Hence she heaps together cinnamon and the odour of the
   far-scented amomum, and balsams with mixed leaves. Neither the twig of
   the mild cassia nor of the fragrant acanthus is absent, nor the tears
   and rich drop of frankincense. To these she adds tender ears [2037] of
   flourishing spikenard, and joins the too pleasing pastures [2038] of
   myrrh. Immediately she places her body about to be changed on the
   strewed nest, and her quiet limbs on such [2039] a couch. Then with her
   mouth she scatters juices around and upon her limbs, about to die with
   her own funeral rites. Then amidst various odours she yields up [2040]
   her life, nor fears the faith of so great a deposit. In the meantime
   her body, destroyed by death, which proves the source of life, [2041]
   is hot, and the heat itself produces a flame; and it conceives fire
   afar off from the light of heaven: it blazes, and is dissolved into
   burnt ashes. And these ashes collected in death it fuses, [2042] as it
   were, into a mass, and has an effect [2043] resembling seed. From this
   an animal is said to arise without limbs, but the worm is said to be of
   a milky colour. And it suddenly increases vastly with an imperfectly
   formed [2044] body, and collects itself into the appearance of a
   well-rounded egg. After this it is formed again, such as its figure was
   before, and the phoenix, having burst her shell, [2045] shoots forth,
   even as caterpillars [2046] in the fields, when they are fastened by a
   thread to a stone, are wont to be changed into a butterfly. No food is
   appointed for her in our world, nor does any one make it his business
   to feed her while unfledged. She sips the delicate [2047] ambrosial
   dews of heavenly nectar which have fallen from the star-bearing pole.
   She gathers these; with these the bird is nourished in the midst of
   odours, until she bears a natural form. But when she begins to flourish
   with early youth, she flies forth now about to return to her native
   abode. Previously, however, she encloses in an ointment of balsam, and
   in myrrh and dissolved [2048] frankincense, all the remains of her own
   body, and the bones or ashes, and relics [2049] of herself, and with
   pious mouth brings it into a round form, [2050] and carrying this with
   her feet, she goes to the rising of the sun, and tarrying at the altar,
   she draws it forth in the sacred temple. She shows and presents herself
   an object of admiration to the beholder; such great beauty is there,
   such great honour abounds. In the first place, her colour is like the
   brilliancy [2051] of that which the seeds of the pomegranate when ripe
   take under the smooth rind; [2052] such colour as is contained in the
   leaves which the poppy produces in the fields, when Flora spreads her
   garments beneath the blushing sky. Her shoulders and beautiful breasts
   shine with this covering; with this her head, with this her neck, and
   the upper parts of her back shine. And her tail is extended, varied
   with yellow metal, in the spots of which mingled purple blushes.
   Between her wings there is a bright [2053] mark above, as [2054] Tris
   on high is wont to paint a cloud from above. She gleams resplendent
   with a mingling of the green emerald, and a shining beak [2055] of pure
   horn opens itself. Her eyes are large; [2056] you might believe that
   they were two jacinths; [2057] from the middle of which a bright flame
   shines. An irradiated crown is fitted [2058] to the whole of her head,
   resembling on high the glory of the head of Phoebus. [2059] Scales
   cover her thighs spangled with yellow metal, but a rosy [2060] colour
   paints her claws with honour. Her form is seen to blend the figure of
   the peacock with that of the painted bird of Phasis. [2061] The winged
   creature which is produced in the lands of the Arabians, whether it be
   beast or bird, can scarcely equal her magnitude. [2062] She is not,
   however, slow, as birds which through the greatness of their body have
   sluggish motions, and a very heavy [2063] weight. But she is light and
   swift, full of royal beauty. Such she always shows herself [2064] in
   the sight of men. Egypt comes hither to such a wondrous [2065] sight,
   and the exulting crowd salutes the rare bird. Immediately they carve
   her image on the consecrated marble, and mark both the occurrence and
   the day with a new title. Birds of every kind assemble together; none
   is mindful of prey, none of fear. Attended by a chorus of birds, she
   flies through the heaven, and a crowd accompanies her, exulting in the
   pious duty. But when she has arrived at the regions of pure ether, she
   presently returns; [2066] afterwards she is concealed in her own
   regions. But oh, bird of happy lot and fate, [2067] to whom the god
   himself granted to be born from herself! Whether it be female, or male,
   or neither, or both, happy she, who enters into [2068] no compacts of
   Venus. Death is Venus to her; her only pleasure is in death: that she
   may be born, she desires previously to die. She is an offspring to
   herself, her own father and heir, her own nurse, and always a
   foster-child to herself. She is herself indeed, but not the same, since
   she is herself, and not herself, having gained eternal life by the
   blessing of death.

  A Poem on the Passion of the Lord

      Formerly Ascribed to Lactantius

   Whoever you are who approach, and are entering the precincts [2069] of
   the middle of the temple, stop a little and look upon me, who, though
   innocent, suffered for your crime; lay me up in your mind, keep me in
   your breast. I am He who, pitying the bitter misfortunes of men, came
   hither as a messenger [2070] of offered peace, and as a full atonement
   [2071] for the fault of men. [2072] Here the brightest light from above
   is restored to the earth; here is the merciful image of safety; here I
   am a rest to you, the right way, the true redemption, the banner [2073]
   of God, and a memorable sign of fate. It was on account of you and your
   life that I entered the Virgin's womb, was made man, and suffered a
   dreadful death; nor did I find rest anywhere in the regions of the
   earth, but everywhere threats, everywhere labours. First of all a
   wretched dwelling [2074] in the land of Judæa was a shelter for me at
   my birth, and for my mother with me: here first, amidst the
   outstretched sluggish cattle, dry grass gave me a bed in a narrow
   stall. I passed my earliest years in the Pharian [2075] regions, being
   an exile in the reign of Herod; and after my return to Judæa I spent
   the rest of my years, always engaged [2076] in fastings, and the
   extremity of poverty itself, and the lowest circumstances; always by
   healthful admonitions applying the minds of men to the pursuit of
   genial uprightness, uniting with wholesome teaching many evident
   miracles: on which account impious Jerusalem, harassed by the raging
   cares of envy and cruel hatred, and blinded by madness, dared to seek
   for me, though innocent, by deadly punishment, a cruel death on the
   dreadful cross. And if you yourself wish to discriminate these things
   more fully, [2077] and if it delights you to go through all my groans,
   and to experience griefs with me, put together [2078] the designs and
   plots, and the impious price of my innocent blood, and the pretended
   kisses of a disciple, [2079] and the insults and strivings of the cruel
   multitude; and, moreover, the blows, and tongues prepared [2080] for
   accusations. Picture to your mind both the witnesses, and the accursed
   [2081] judgment of the blinded Pilate, and the immense cross pressing
   my shoulders and wearied back, and my painful steps to a dreadful
   death. Now survey me from head to foot, deserted as I am, and lifted up
   afar from my beloved mother. Behold and see my locks clotted with
   blood, and my blood-stained neck under my very hair, and my head
   drained [2082] with cruel thorns, and pouring down like rain [2083]
   from all sides a stream [2084] of blood over my divine face. Survey my
   compressed and sightless eyes, and my afflicted cheeks; see my parched
   tongue poisoned with gall, and my countenance pale with death. Behold
   my hands pierced with nails, and my arms drawn out, and the great wound
   in my side; see the blood streaming from it, and my perforated [2085]
   feet, and blood-stained limbs. Bend your knee, and with lamentation
   adore the venerable wood of the cross, and with lowly countenance
   stooping [2086] to the earth, which is wet with innocent blood,
   sprinkle it with rising tears, and at times [2087] bear me and my
   admonitions in your devoted heart. Follow the footsteps of my life, and
   while you look upon my torments and cruel death, remembering my
   innumerable pangs of body and soul, learn to endure hardships, [2088]
   and to watch over your own safety. These memorials, [2089] if at any
   time you find pleasure in thinking over them, if in your mind there is
   any confidence to bear anything like my sufferings), [2090] if the
   piety due, and gratitude worthy of my labours shall arise, will be
   incitements [2091] to true virtue, and they will be shields against the
   snares of an enemy, aroused [2092] by which you will be safe, and as a
   conqueror bear off the palm in every contest. If these memorials shall
   turn away your senses, which are devoted to a perishable [2093] world,
   from the fleeting shadow of earthly beauty, the result will be, that
   you will not venture, [2094] enticed by empty hope, to trust the frail
   [2095] enjoyments of fickle fortune, and to place your hope in the
   fleeting years of life. But, truly, if you thus regard this perishable
   world, [2096] and through your love of a better country deprive
   yourself [2097] of earthly riches and the enjoyment of present things,
   [2098] the prayers of the pious will bring you up [2099] in sacred
   habits, and in the hope of a happy life, amidst severe punishments,
   will cherish you with heavenly dew, and feed you with the sweetness of
   the promised good. Until the great favour of God shall recall your
   happy [2100] soul to the heavenly regions, [2101] your body being left
   after the fates of death. Then freed from all labour, then joyfully
   beholding the angelic choirs, and the blessed companies of saints in
   perpetual bliss, it shall reign with me in the happy abode of perpetual
   peace.

    General Note.

   There is no ms authority for ascribing the above to Lactantius. "It
   does not, in the least, come up to the purity and eloquence of his
   style," says Dupin; and the same candid author notes the "adoration of
   the cross" as fatal to any such claim. [2102]

   Of the following poem, on Easter, Dupin says: "It is attributed to
   Venantius upon the testimony of some mss. in the Vatican Library." This
   writer became known to Gregory of Tours, who died about a.d. 595, and
   seems to have succeeded him as bishop, dying soon after. Bede quotes
   his verse on St. Alban, [2103] --


   "Albanum egregium fecunda Britannia profert,"

   but styles him "presbyter Fortunatus." He was the author of a poem on
   St. Martin, and another, In Laude Virginum. His works were edited by
   Brouverius, a Jesuit.

  On Easter

  Poem of Venantius Honorius [2104] Clementianus Fortunatus, On Easter.

   The seasons blush varied with the flowery, fair weather [2105] , and
   the gate of the pole lies open with greater light. His path in the
   heaven raises the fire-breathing [2106] sun higher, who goes forth on
   his course, [2107] and enters the waters of the ocean. Armed with rays
   traversing the liquid elements, in this [2108] brief night he stretches
   out the day in a circle. The brilliant firmament [2109] puts forth its
   clear countenance, and the bright stars show their joy. The fruitful
   earth pours forth its gifts with varied increase, [2110] when the year
   has well returned its vernal riches. [2111] Soft beds of violets paint
   the purple plain; the meadows are green with plants, [2112] and the
   plant shines with its leaves. By degrees gleaming brightness of the
   flowers [2113] comes forth; all the herbs smile with their blossoms.
   [2114] The seed being deposited, the corn springs up far and wide
   [2115] in the fields, promising to be able to overcome the hunger of
   the husbandman. Having deserted its stem, the vine-shoot bewails its
   joys; the vine gives water only from the source from which it is wont
   to give wine. The swelling bud, rising with tender down from the back
   of its mother, prepares its bosom for bringing forth. Its foliage
   [2116] having been torn off in the wintry season, the verdant grove now
   renews its leafy shelter. Mingled together, the willow, the fir, the
   hazel, the osier, [2117] the elm, the maple, the walnut, each tree
   applauds, delightful with its leaves. Hence the bee, about to construct
   its comb, leaving the hive, humming over the flowers, carries off honey
   with its leg. The bird which, having closed its song, was dumb,
   sluggish with the wintry cold, returns to its strains. Hence Philomela
   attunes her notes with her own instruments, [2118] and the air becomes
   sweeter with the re-echoed melody. Behold, the favour of the reviving
   world bears witness that all gifts have returned together with its
   Lord. For in honour of Christ rising triumphant after His descent to
   the gloomy Tartarus, the grove on every side with its leaves expresses
   approval, the plants with their flowers express approval. [2119] The
   light, the heaven, the fields, and the sea duly praise the God
   ascending above the stars, having crushed the laws of hell. Behold, He
   who was crucified reigns as God over all things, and all created
   objects offer prayer to their Creator. Hail, festive day, to be
   reverenced throughout the world, [2120] on which God has conquered
   hell, and gains the stars! The changes of the year and of the months,
   the bounteous light of the days, the splendour of the hours, all things
   with voice applaud. [2121] Hence, in honour of you, the wood with its
   foliage applauds; hence the vine, with its silent shoot, gives thanks.
   Hence the thickets now resound with the whisper of birds; amidst these
   the sparrow sings with exuberant [2122] love. O Christ, Thou Saviour of
   the world, merciful Creator and Redeemer, the only offspring from the
   Godhead of the Father, flowing in an indescribable [2123] manner from
   the heart of Thy Parent, Thou self-existing Word, and powerful from the
   mouth of Thy Father, equal to Him, of one mind with Him, His fellow,
   coeval with the Father, from whom at first [2124] the world derived its
   origin! Thou dost suspend the firmament, [2125] Thou heapest together
   the soil, Thou dost pour forth the seas, by whose [2126] government all
   things which are fixed in their places flourish. Who seeing that the
   human race was plunged in the depth [2127] of misery, that Thou
   mightest rescue man, didst Thyself also become man: nor wert Thou
   willing only to be born with a body, [2128] but Thou becamest flesh,
   which endured to be born and to die. Thou dost undergo [2129] funeral
   obsequies, Thyself the author of life and framer of the world, Thou
   dost enter [2130] the path of death, in giving the aid of salvation.
   The gloomy chains of the infernal law yielded, and chaos feared to be
   pressed by the presence [2131] of the light. Darkness perishes, put to
   flight by the brightness of Christ; the thick pall of eternal [2132]
   night falls. But restore the promised [2133] pledge, I pray Thee, O
   power benign! The third day has returned; arise, my buried One; it is
   not becoming that Thy limbs should lie in the lowly sepulchre, nor that
   worthless stones should press that which is the ransom [2134] of the
   world. It is unworthy that a stone should shut in with a confining
   [2135] rock, and cover Him in whose fist [2136] all things are
   enclosed. Take away the linen clothes, I pray; leave the napkins in the
   tomb: Thou art sufficient for us, and without Thee there is nothing.
   Release the chained shades of the infernal prison, and recall to the
   upper regions [2137] whatever sinks to the lowest depths. Give back Thy
   face, that the world may see the light; give back the day which flees
   from us at Thy death. But returning, O holy conqueror! Thou didst
   altogether fill the heaven! [2138] Tartarus lies depressed, nor retains
   its rights. The ruler of the lower regions, insatiably opening his
   hollow jaws, who has always been a spoiler, becomes [2139] a prey to
   Thee. Thou rescuest an innumerable people from the prison of death, and
   they follow in freedom to the place whither their leader [2140]
   approaches. The fierce monster in alarm vomits forth the multitude whom
   he had swallowed up, and the Lamb [2141] withdraws the sheep from the
   jaw of the wolf. Hence re-seeking the tomb from the lower regions,
   [2142] having resumed Thy flesh, as a warrior Thou carriest back ample
   trophies to the heavens. Those whom chaos held in punishment [2143] he
   [2144] has now restored; and those whom death might seek, a new life
   holds. Oh, sacred King, behold a great part of Thy triumph shines
   forth, when the sacred laver blesses pure souls! A host, clad in white,
   [2145] come forth from the bright waves, and cleanse their old [2146]
   fault in a new stream. The white garment also designates bright souls,
   and the shepherd has enjoyments from the snow-white flock. The priest
   Felix is added sharing [2147] in this reward, who wishes to give double
   talents to his Lord. Drawing those who wander in Gentile error to
   better things, that a beast of prey may not carry them away, He guards
   the fold of God. Those whom guilty Eve had before infected, He now
   restores, fed [2148] with abundant milk at the bosom of the Church. By
   cultivating rustic hearts with mild conversations, a crop is produced
   from a briar by the bounty of Felix. The Saxon, a fierce nation, living
   as it were after the manner of wild beasts, when you, O sacred One!
   apply a remedy, the beast of prey resembles [2149] the sheep. About to
   remain with you through an age with the return [2150] of a
   hundred-fold, you fill the barns with the produce of an abundant
   harvest. May this people, free from stain, be strengthened [2151] in
   your arms, and may you bear to the stars a pure pledge to God. May one
   crown be bestowed on you from on high gained from yourself [2152] , may
   another flourish gained from your people.

      General Note.

   A fine passage illustrating the gush of early Christian devotion at
   Easter, "breaking into all the heavenly joy of the new creation," will
   be found in Professor Milligan's remarkable work on The Resurrection of
   our Lord (London, Macmillan, 1884). The author is "professor of
   divinity and biblical criticism in the University of Aberdeen."

    Introductory Notice

   [Circa a.d. 232] Finding these fragments relegated, by the Edinburgh
   editors, to a place (unaccountably chosen) among the spurious Decretals
   [2153] and dismissed as of dubious character, it looked as if modern
   light had been shed upon this author, and as if he had better, perhaps,
   be classed with the apocryphal works of our concluding volume. But,
   after considerable inquiry, I see no reason to dismiss Asterius from
   the respectable position assigned him by Lardner; [2154] and I now wish
   I had appended these fragments to those of the Roman presbyter Caius,
   to which the reader is referred. [2155] It is true, Lardner is quite
   undecided as to this author, though he accepts Tillemont's conjecture
   as probable; viz., that the Asterius Urbanus mentioned by Eusebius is
   the author of the fragments, and that his work against the Montanists
   was written in the eleventh year of the Emperor Alexander, circa 232.
   It is doubtful whether the author was a presbyter or a bishop. On some
   occasions he seems to have been at Ancyra in Galatia, where he
   reluctantly consented to write is treatise at the solicitation of the
   presbytery there, and particularly of Abercius [2156] Marcellus, to
   whom it is inscribed.

   The translator is not named, but here follows the very unsatisfactory
   preface of the Edinburgh edition:--


   Nothing is known of Asterius Urbanus. The name occurs in Fragment IV.;
   [2157] and from the allusion made to him there, some have inferred that
   he was the author of the work against Montanists, from which Eusebius
   has made these extracts. The inference is unfounded. There is no clue
   to the authorship. It has been attributed by different critics to
   Apollinaris, Apollonius, and Rhodon.

  The Extant Writings of Asterius Urbanus [2158]

    i. the exordium.

   Having now for a very long and surely a very sufficient period had the
   charge pressed upon me by thee, my dear Avircius [2159] Marcellus, to
   write some sort of treatise against the heresy that bears the name of
   Miltiades, [2160] I have somehow been very doubtfully disposed toward
   the task up till now; not that I felt any difficulty in refuting the
   falsehood, and in bearing my testimony to the truth, but that I was
   apprehensive and fearful lest I should appear to any to be adding some
   new word or precept [2161] to the doctrine of the Gospel of the New
   Testament, with respect to which indeed it is not possible for one who
   has chosen to have his manner of life in accordance with the Gospel
   itself, either to add anything to it or to take away anything from it.
   Being recently, however, at Ancyra, a town of Galatia, and finding the
   church in Pontus [2162] greatly agitated [2163] by this new prophecy,
   as they call it, but which should rather be called this false prophecy,
   as shall be shown presently, I discoursed to the best of my ability,
   with the help of God, for many days in the church, both on these
   subjects and on various others [2164] which were brought under my
   notice by them. And this I did in such manner that the church rejoiced
   and was strengthened in the truth, while the adversaries [2165] were
   forthwith routed, and the opponents put to grief. And the presbyters of
   the place accordingly requested us to leave behind us some memorandum
   of the things which we alleged in opposition to the adversaries of the
   truth, there being present also our fellow-presbyter Zoticus Otrenus.
   [2166] This, however, we did not; but we promised, if the Lord gave us
   opportunity, to write down the matters here, and send them to them with
   all speed.

      ii. from book i.

   Now the attitude of opposition [2167] which they have assumed, and this
   new heresy of theirs which puts them in a position of separation from
   the Church, had their origin in the following manner. There is said to
   be a certain village called Ardaba [2168] in the Mysia, which touches
   Phrygia. [2169] There, they say, one of those who had been but recently
   converted to the faith, a person of the name of Montanus, when Gratus
   was proconsul of Asia, gave the adversary entrance against himself by
   the excessive lust of his soul after taking the lead. And this person
   was carried away in spirit; [2170] and suddenly being seized with a
   kind of frenzy and ecstasy, he raved, and began to speak and to utter
   strange things, and to prophesy in a manner contrary to the custom of
   the Church, as handed down from early times and preserved thenceforward
   in a continuous succession. And among those who were present on that
   occasion, and heard those spurious utterances, there were some who were
   indignant, and rebuked him as one frenzied, and under the power of
   demons, and possessed by the spirit of delusion, and agitating the
   multitude, and debarred him from speaking any more; for they were
   mindful of the Lord's distinction [2171] and threatening, whereby He
   warned them to be on their guard vigilantly against the coming of the
   false prophets. But there were others too, who, as if elated by the
   Holy Spirit and the prophetic gift, and not a little puffed up, and
   forgetting entirely the Lord's distinction, challenged the maddening
   and insidious and seductive spirit, being themselves cajoled and misled
   by him, so that there was no longer any checking him to silence. [2172]
   And thus by a kind of artifice, or rather by such a process of craft,
   the devil having devised destruction against those who were disobedient
   to the Lord's warning, and being unworthily honoured by them, secretly
   excited and inflamed their minds that had already left the faith which
   is according to truth, in order to play the harlot with error. [2173]
   For he stirred up two others also, women, and filled them with the
   spurious spirit, so that they too spoke in a frenzy and unseasonably,
   and in a strange manner, like the person already mentioned, while the
   spirit called them happy as they rejoiced and exulted proudly at his
   working, and puffed them up by the magnitude of his promises; while, on
   the other hand, at times also he condemned them skilfully and
   plausibly, in order that he might seem to them also to have the power
   of reproof. [2174] And those few who were thus deluded were Phrygians.
   But the same arrogant spirit taught them to revile the Church universal
   under heaven, because that false spirit of prophecy found neither
   honour from it nor entrance into it. For when the faithful throughout
   Asia met together often and in many places of Asia for deliberation on
   this subject, and subjected those novel doctrines to examination, and
   declared them to be spurious, and rejected them as heretical, they were
   in consequence of that expelled from the Church and debarred from
   communion. [2175]

      iii. from book ii.

   Wherefore, since they stigmatized us as slayers of the prophets [2176]
   because we did not receive their loquacious [2177] prophets,--for they
   say that these are they whom the Lord promised to send to the
   people,--let them answer us in the name of God, and tell us, O friends,
   whether there is any one among those who began to speak from Montanus
   and the women onward that was persecuted by the Jews or put to death by
   the wicked? There is not one. Not even one of them is there who was
   seized and crucified for the name [2178] of Christ. No; certainly not.
   Neither assuredly was there one of these women who was ever scourged in
   the synagogues of the Jews, or stoned. No; never anywhere. It is indeed
   by another kind of death that Montanus and Maximilla are said to have
   met their end. For the report is, that by the instigation of that
   maddening spirit both of them hung themselves; not together indeed, but
   at the particular time of the death of each [2179] as the common story
   goes. And thus they died, and finished their life like the traitor
   Judas. Thus, also, the general report gives it that Theodotus--that
   astonishing person who was, so to speak, the first procurator [2180] of
   their so-called prophecy, and who, as if he were sometime taken up and
   received into the heavens, fell into spurious ecstasies, [2181] and
   gave himself wholly over to the spirit of delusion--was at last tossed
   by him [2182] into the air, and met his end miserably. People say then
   that this took place in the way we have stated. But as we did not see
   [2183] them ourselves, we do not presume to think that we know any of
   these things with certainty. And it may therefore have been in this way
   perhaps, and perhaps in some other way, that Montanus and Theodotus and
   the woman mentioned above perished.

      iv.

   And let not the spirit of Maximilla say (as it is found in the same
   book of Asterius Urbanus [2184] ), "I am chased like a wolf from the
   sheep; I am no wolf. I am word, and spirit, and power." But let him
   clearly exhibit and prove the power in the spirit. And by the spirit
   let him constrain to a confession those who were present at that time
   for the very purpose of trying and holding converse with the talkative
   spirit--those men so highly reputed as men and bishops--namely, Zoticus
   of the village of Comana [2185] , and Julian of Apamea, whose mouths
   Themison [2186] and his followers bridled, and prevented the false and
   seductive spirit from being confuted by them.

      v.

   And has not the falsity of this also been made manifest already? For it
   is now upwards of thirteen years since the woman died, and there has
   arisen neither a partial nor a universal war in the world. Nay, rather
   there has been steady and continued peace to the Christians by the
   mercy of God.

      vi. from book iii.

   But as they have been refuted in all their allegations, and are thus at
   a loss what to say, they try to take refuge in their martyrs. For they
   say that they have many martyrs, and that this is a sure proof of the
   power of their so-called prophetic spirit. But this allegation, as it
   seems, carries not a whit more truth with it than the others. For
   indeed some of the other heresies have also a great multitude of
   martyrs; but yet certainly we shall not on that account agree with
   them, neither shall we acknowledge that they have truth in them. And
   those first heretics, who from the heresy of Marcion are called
   Marcionites, allege that they have a great multitude of martyrs for
   Christ. But yet they do not confess Christ Himself according to truth.

      vii.

   Hence, also, whenever those who have been called to martyrdom for the
   true faith by the Church happen to fall in with any of those so-called
   martyrs of the Phrygian heresy, they always separate from them, and die
   without having fellowship with them, because they do not choose to give
   their assent to the spirit of Montanus and the women. And that this is
   truly the case, and that it has actually taken place in our own times
   at Apamea, a town on the Mæander, in the case of those who suffered
   martyrdom with Caius [2187] and Alexander, natives of Eumenia, is clear
   to all.

      viii.

   As I found these things in a certain writing of theirs directed against
   the writing of our brother Alcibiades, [2188] in which he proves the
   impropriety of a prophet's speaking in ecstasy, I made an abridgment of
   that work.

      ix.

   But the false prophet falls into a spurious ecstasy, which is
   accompanied by a want of all shame and fear. For beginning with a
   voluntary (designed) rudeness, he ends with an involuntary madness of
   soul, as has been already stated. But they will never be able to show
   that any one of the Old Testament prophets, or any one of the New, was
   carried away in spirit after this fashion. Nor will they be able to
   boast that Agabus, or Judas, or Silas, or the daughters of Philip, or
   the woman Ammia in Philadelphia, or Quadratus, or indeed any of the
   others who do not in any respect belong to them, were moved in this
   way.

      x.

   For if, after Quadratus and the woman Ammia in Philadelphia, as they
   say, the women who attached themselves to Montanus succeeded to the
   gift of prophecy, let them show us which of them thus succeeded
   Montanus and his women. For the apostle deems that the gift of prophecy
   should abide in all the Church up to the time of the final advent. But
   they will not be able to show the gift to be in their possession even
   at the present time, which is the fourteenth year only from the death
   of Maximilla. [2189]

      general note.

   The reader will do well to turn back to my Introductory Notice to the
   Epistle of Hermas, [2190] and also to the elucidations [2191] which are
   appended to that Epistle. If any value attaches to this fragment, it
   must be found in its illustrations of Hermas and Tertullian. These, in
   turn, shed light on it.

    Elucidation.

   (Aviricius Marcellus, [202]p. 335, supra)

   Like his great predecessor in Patristic research (Bishop Pearson), the
   learned and indefatigable Bishop Lightfoot will leave us gold-dust in
   the mere sweepings of his literary work. His recent voluminous edition
   of the Apostolic Fathers [2192] is encyclopedic in its treatment of the
   subject; and I had hardly corrected the last proofs of the fragments
   ascribed to Asterius Urbanus when I discovered, in one of his notes on
   Polycarp, a most brilliant elucidation of a matter which I had supposed
   involved in twofold obscurity. Asterius is a mere name embedded in
   Eusebius, and in his fragments there preserved is embedded the yet
   obscurer name of Aviricius Marcellus, which the reader will find, with
   its various spellings, in one of the translator's notes. [2193] Who
   could have supposed that even the learning and ingenuity of Lightfoot
   could fish out of very dark waters such shining booty as fills the
   network about "Abercius of Hierapolis?" While he does not even name
   Asterius, the mere nominis umbra of Aviricius Marcellus is material for
   a truly remarkable dissertation covering nine pages of fine print, and
   enabling us to conclude that this Aviricius is none other than the same
   "bishop of Hierapolis" about whom there is such a long story in the
   Bollandist Acta Sanctorum [2194] The story is a silly legend, but
   Lightfoot understands the art ex fumo dare lucem; and any one who
   enjoys following up such elaborations will find most curious and
   delightful reading in the pages to which I have referred. Our
   Aviricius, then, was bishop of "Hierapolis of Lesser Phrygia," not of
   Hierapolis on the Mæander, and flourished about a.d.163, during the
   reign of M. Aurelius. This date, therefore, must correct the conjecture
   of Tillemont and the date which I had accepted from him on the
   authority of Dr. Lardner. [2195]

   [2159] The manuscripts write the name Aoui'rkios, Avircius: but
   Nicephorus (book iv.) gives it as Abe'rkios, Abercius.

   [2160] Nicephorus adds ison d' eipein Montano'n , which seems, however,
   to be but a scholium. It may appear difficult to account for the fact
   that the name of Miltiades rather than that of Montanus is associated
   with the heresy of the Cataphrygians, and some consequently have
   conjectured that we should read here Alcibiades, as that is a name
   mentioned in concert with Montanus and Theodotus in Euseb. v. 3. In the
   Muratorian fragment, however, as given above among the writings of
   Caius, we find again a Miltiades named among the heretics. [Vol. v.

   token that our author was a bishop.]

   hence this false spirit, with the view of confirming his hearers in the
   belief that he was the true Spirit of God, sometimes rebuked and
   condemned them. See a passage in Ambrose's Epistle to the Thessal., ch.

   that he established exactors of money, and provided salaries for those
   who preached his doctrine.

   [2183] The text is, alla` me`n aneu. But in various codices we have the
   more correct reading, alla` me` aneu.

   [2184] These words are apparently a scholium, which Eusebius himself or
   some old commentator had written on the margin of his copy. We gather
   also from them that Asterius Urbanus was credited with the authorship
   of these three books, and not Apollinaris, as some have supposed.

   [2185] Comana seems to have been a town of Pamphylia. At least a bishop
   of Comana is mentioned in the epistle of the bishops of Pamphylia to
   Leo Augustus, cited in the third part of the Council of Chalcedon,
   [209]p. 391. [See p. 335, note 9, supra.]

   [2186] Themison was a person of note among the Montanists, who boasted
   of himself as a confessor and martyr, and had the audacity to write a
   catholic epistle to the churches like an apostle, with the view of
   commending the new prophecy to them. See Euseb., v. 18.

   [2187] en tois peri` Ga'ion ... marture'sasi. It may be intended for,
   "In the case of the martyrs Caius and Alexander."

   [2188] Migne is of opinion that there has been an interchange of names
   between this passage and the Exordium, and that we should read
   Miltiades here, and Alcibiades there. But see Exordium, note 3, p. 335.
   [And compare Eusebius, book v. cap. 3, where two of this name are
   mentioned; also Ibid., cap. 17.]

   [2189] This seems to be the sense of the text, which appears to be
   imperfect here: a`ll' ouk an echoien seixai tessareskaide'katon ede pou

VICTORINUS

        [translated by the rev. robert ernest wallis, ph.d.]

     __________________________________________________________________


  ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD [2196]

   To me, as I meditate and consider in my mind concerning the creation of
   this world in which we are kept enclosed, even such is the rapidity of
   that creation; as is contained in the book of Moses, which he wrote
   about its creation, and which is called Genesis. God produced that
   entire mass for the adornment of His majesty in six days; on the
   seventh to which He consecrated it . . . with a blessing. For this
   reason, therefore, because in the septenary number of days both
   heavenly and earthly things are ordered, in place of the beginning I
   will consider of this seventh day after the principle of all matters
   pertaining to the number of seven; and as far as I shall be able, I
   will endeavour to portray the day of the divine power to that
   consummation.

   In the beginning God made the light, and divided it in the exact
   measure of twelve hours by day and by night, for this reason,
   doubtless, that day might bring over the night as an occasion of rest
   for men's labours; that, again, day might overcome, and thus that
   labour might be refreshed with this alternate change of rest, and that
   repose again might be tempered by the exercise of day. "On the fourth
   day He made two lights in the heaven, the greater and the lesser, that
   the one might rule over the day, the other over the night," [2197]
   --the lights of the sun and moon and He placed the rest of the stars in
   heaven, that they might shine upon the earth, and by their positions
   distinguish the seasons, and years, and months, and days, and hours.

   Now is manifested the reason of the truth why the fourth day is called
   the Tetras, why we fast even to the ninth hour, or even to the evening,
   or why there should be a passing over even to the next day. Therefore
   this world of ours is composed of four elements--fire, water, heaven,
   earth. These four elements, therefore, form the quaternion of times or
   seasons. The sun, also, and the moon constitute throughout the space of
   the year four seasons--of spring, summer, autumn, winter; and these
   seasons make a quaternion. And to proceed further still from that
   principle, lo, there are four living creatures before God's throne,
   [2198] four Gospels, four rivers flowing in paradise; [2199] four
   generations of people from Adam to Noah, from Noah to Abraham, from
   Abraham to Moses, from Moses to Christ the Lord, the Son of God; and
   four living creatures, viz., a man, a calf, a lion, an eagle; and four
   rivers, the Pison, the Gihon, the Tigris, and the Euphrates. The man
   Christ Jesus, the originator of these things whereof we have above
   spoken, was taken prisoner by wicked hands, by a quaternion of
   soldiers. Therefore on account of His captivity by a quaternion, on
   account of the majesty of His works,--that the seasons also, wholesome
   to humanity, joyful for the harvests, tranquil for the tempests, may
   roll on,--therefore we make the fourth day a station or a supernumerary
   fast.

   On the fifth day the land and water brought forth their progenies. On
   the sixth day the things that were wanting were created; and thus God
   raised up man from the soil, as lord of all the things which He created
   upon the earth and the water. Yet He created angels and archangels
   before He created man, placing spiritual beings before earthly ones.
   For light was made before sky and the earth. This sixth day is called
   parasceve, [2200] that is to say, the preparation of the kingdom. For
   He perfected Adam, whom He made after His image and likeness. But for
   this reason He completed His works before He created angels and
   fashioned man, lest perchance they should falsely assert that they had
   been His helpers. On this day also, on account of the passion of the
   Lord Jesus Christ, we make either a station to God, or a fast. On the
   seventh day He rested from all His works, and blessed it, and
   sanctified it. On the former day we are accustomed to fast rigorously,
   that on the Lord's day we may go forth to our bread with giving of
   thanks. And let the parasceve become a rigorous fast, lest we should
   appear to observe any Sabbath with the Jews, which Christ Himself, the
   Lord of the Sabbath, says by His prophets that "His soul hateth;"
   [2201] which Sabbath He in His body abolished, although, nevertheless,
   He had formerly Himself commanded Moses that circumcision should not
   pass over the eighth day, which day very frequently happens on the
   Sabbath, as we read written in the Gospel. [2202] Moses, foreseeing the
   hardness of that people, on the Sabbath raised up his hands, therefore,
   and thus figuratively fastened himself to a cross. [2203] And in the
   battle they were sought for by the foreigners on the Sabbath-day, that
   they might be taken captive, and, as if by the very strictness of the
   law, might be fashioned to the avoidance of its teaching. [2204]

   And thus in the sixth Psalm for the eighth day, [2205] David asks the
   Lord that He would not rebuke him in His anger, nor judge him in His
   fury; for this is indeed the eighth day of that future judgment, which
   will pass beyond the order of the sevenfold arrangement. Jesus also,
   the son of Nave, the successor of Moses, himself broke the Sabbath-day;
   for on the Sabbath-day he commanded the children of Israel [2206] to go
   round the walls of the city of Jericho with trumpets, and declare war
   against the aliens. Matthias [2207] also, prince of Judah, broke the
   Sabbath; for he slew the prefect of Antiochus the king of Syria on the
   Sabbath, and subdued the foreigners by pursuing them. And in Matthew we
   read, that it is written Isaiah also and the rest of his colleagues
   broke the Sabbath [2208] --that that true and just Sabbath should be
   observed in the seventh millenary of years. Wherefore to those seven
   days the Lord attributed to each a thousand years; for thus went the
   warning: "In Thine eyes, O Lord, a thousand years are as one day."
   [2209] Therefore in the eyes of the Lord each thousand of years is
   ordained, for I find that the Lord's eyes are seven. [2210] Wherefore,
   as I have narrated, that true Sabbath will be in the seventh millenary
   of years, when Christ with His elect shall reign. Moreover, the seven
   heavens agree with those days; for thus we are warned: "By the word of
   the Lord were the heavens made, and all the powers of them by the
   spirit of His mouth." [2211] There are seven spirits. Their names are
   the spirits which abode on the Christ of God, as was intimated in
   Isaiah the prophet: "And there rests upon Him the spirit of wisdom and
   of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of wisdom
   [2212] and of piety, and the spirit of God's fear hath filled Him."
   [2213] Therefore the highest heaven is the heaven of wisdom; the
   second, of understanding; the third, of counsel; the fourth, of might;
   the fifth, of knowledge; the sixth, of piety; the seventh, of God's
   fear. From this, therefore, the thunders bellow, the lightnings are
   kindled, [2214] the fires are heaped together; fiery darts [2215]
   appear, stars gleam, the anxiety caused by the dreadful comet is
   aroused. [2216] Sometimes it happens that the sun and moon approach one
   another, and cause those more than frightful appearances, radiating
   with light in the field of their aspect. But the author of the whole
   creation is Jesus. His name is the Word; for thus His Father says: "My
   heart hath emitted a good word." [2217] John the evangelist thus says:
   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
   was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made
   by Him, and without Him was nothing made that was made." [2218]
   Therefore, first, was made the creation; secondly, man, the lord of the
   human race, as says the apostle. [2219] Therefore this Word, when it
   made light, is called Wisdom; when it made the sky, Understanding; when
   it made land and sea, Counsel; when it made sun and moon and other
   bright things, Power; when it calls forth land and sea, Knowledge; when
   it formed man, Piety; when it blesses and sanctifies man, it has the
   name of God's fear.

   Behold the seven horns of the Lamb, [2220] the seven eyes of God [2221]
   --the seven eyes are the seven spirits of the Lamb; [2222] seven
   torches burning before the throne of God [2223] seven golden
   candlesticks, [2224] seven young sheep, [2225] the seven women in
   Isaiah, [2226] the seven churches in Paul, [2227] seven deacons, [2228]
   seven angels, [2229] seven trumpets, [2230] seven seals to the book,
   seven periods of seven days with which Pentecost is completed, the
   seven weeks in Daniel, [2231] also the forty-three weeks in Daniel;
   [2232] with Noah, seven of all clean things in the ark; [2233] seven
   revenges of Cain, [2234] seven years for a debt to be acquitted, [2235]
   the lamp with seven orifices, [2236] seven pillars of wisdom in the
   house of Solomon. [2237]

   Now, therefore, you may see that it is being told you of the unerring
   glory of God in providence; yet, as far as my small capacity shall be
   able, I will endeavour to set it forth. That He might re-create that
   Adam by means of the week, and bring aid to His entire creation, was
   accomplished by the nativity of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Who,
   then, that is taught in the law of God, who that is filled with the
   Holy Spirit, does not see in his heart, that on the same day on which
   the dragon seduced Eve, the angel Gabriel brought the glad tidings to
   the Virgin Mary; that on the same day the Holy Spirit overflowed the
   Virgin Mary, on which He made light; that on that day He was incarnate
   in flesh, in which He made the land and water; that on the same day He
   was put to the breast, on which He made the stars; that on the same day
   He was circumcised, [2238] on which the land and water brought forth
   their offspring; that on the same day He was incarnated, on which He
   formed man out of the ground; that on the same day Christ was born, on
   which He formed man; that on that day He suffered, on which Adam fell;
   that on the same day He rose again from the dead, on which He created
   light? He, moreover, consummates His humanity in the number seven: of
   His nativity, His infancy, His boyhood, His youth, His young-manhood,
   His mature age, His death. I have also set forth His humanity to the
   Jews in these manners: since He is hungry, is thirsty; since He gave
   food and drink; since He walks, and retired; since He slept upon a
   pillow; [2239] since, moreover, He walks upon the stormy seas with His
   feet, He commands the winds, He cures the sick and restores the lame,
   He raises the blind by His speech, [2240] --see ye that He declares
   Himself to them to be the Lord.

   The day, as I have above related, is divided into two parts by the
   number twelve--by the twelve hours of day and night; and by these hours
   too, months, and years, and seasons, and ages are computed. Therefore,
   doubtless, there are appointed also twelve angels of the day and twelve
   angels of the night, in accordance, to wit, with the number of hours.
   For these are the twenty-four witnesses of the days and nights [2241]
   which sit before the throne of God, having golden crowns on their
   heads, whom the Apocalypse of John the apostle and evangelist calls
   elders, for the reason that they are older both than the other angels
   and than men.

  COMMENTARY ON THE APOCALYPSE OF THE BLESSED JOHN
     __________________________________________________________________

    from the first chapter.

   1. "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to Him, and showed
   unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass, and signified
   it. Blessed are they who read and hear the words of this prophecy, and
   keep the things which are written."] The beginning of the book promises
   blessing to him that reads and hears and keeps, that he who takes pains
   about the reading may thence learn to do works, and may keep the
   precepts.

   4. "Grace unto you, and peace, from Him which is, and which was, and
   which is to come."] He is, because He endures continually; He was,
   because with the Father He made all things, and has at this time taken
   a beginning from the Virgin; He is to come, because assuredly He will
   come to judgment.

   "And from the seven spirits which are before His throne."] We read of a
   sevenfold spirit in Isaiah, [2242] --namely, the spirit of wisdom and
   of understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, of knowledge and of
   piety, and the spirit of the fear of the Lord.

   5. "And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the
   first-begotten of the dead."] In taking upon Him manhood, He gave a
   testimony in the world, wherein also having suffered, He freed us by
   His blood from sin; and having vanquished hell, He was the first who
   rose from the dead, and "death shall have no more dominion over Him,"
   [2243] but by His own reign the kingdom of the world is destroyed.

   6. "And He made us a kingdom and priests unto God and His Father."]
   That is to say, a Church of all believers; as also the Apostle Peter
   says: "A holy nation, a royal priesthood." [2244]

   7. "Behold, He shall come with clouds, and every eye shall see Him."]
   For He who at first came hidden in the manhood that He had undertaken,
   shall after a little while come to judgment manifest in majesty and
   glory. And what saith He?

   12. "And I turned, and saw seven golden candlesticks; and in the midst
   of the seven golden candlesticks one like unto the Son of man."] He
   says that He was like Him after His victory over death, when He had
   ascended into the heavens, after the union in His body of the power
   which He received from the Father with the spirit of His glory.

   13. "As it were the Son of man walking in the midst of the golden
   candlesticks."] He says, in the midst of the churches, as it is said in
   Solomon, "I will walk in the midst of the paths of the just," [2245]
   whose antiquity is immortality, and the fountain of majesty.

   "Clothed with a garment down to the ankles."] In the long, that is, the
   priestly garment, these words very plainly deliver the flesh which was
   not corrupted in death, and has the priesthood through suffering.

   "And He was girt about the paps with a golden girdle."] His paps are
   the two testaments, and the golden girdle is the choir of saints, as
   gold tried in the fire. Otherwise the golden girdle bound around His
   breast indicates the enlightened conscience, and the pure and spiritual
   apprehension that is given to the churches.

   14. "And His head and His hairs were white as it were white wool, and
   as it were snow."] On the head the whiteness is shown; "but the head of
   Christ is God." [2246] In the white hairs is the multitude of abbots
   [2247] like to wool, in respect of simple sheep; to snow, in respect of
   the innumerable crowd of candidates taught from heaven.

   "His eyes were as a flame of fire."] God's precepts are those which
   minister light to believers, but to unbelievers burning.

   16. "And in His face was brightness as the sun."] That which He called
   brightness was the appearance of that in which He spoke to men face to
   face. But the glory of the sun is less than the glory of the Lord.
   Doubtless on account of its rising and setting, and rising again, that
   He was born and suffered and rose again, therefore the Scripture gave
   this similitude, likening His face to the glory of the sun.

   15. "His feet were like unto yellow brass, as if burned in a furnace."]
   He calls the apostles His feet, who, being wrought by suffering,
   preached His word in the whole world; for He rightly named those by
   whose means the preaching went forth, feet. Whence also the prophet
   anticipated this, and said: "We will worship in the place where His
   feet have stood." [2248] Because where they first of all stood and
   confirmed the Church, that is, in Judea, all the saints shall assemble
   together, and will worship their Lord.

   16. "And out of His mouth was issuing a sharp two-edged sword."] By the
   twice-sharpened sword going forth out of His mouth is shown, that it is
   He Himself who has both now declared the word of the Gospel, and
   previously by Moses declared the knowledge of the law to the whole
   world. But because from the same word, as well of the New as of the Old
   Testament, He will assert Himself upon the whole human race, therefore
   He is spoken of as two-edged. For the sword arms the soldier, the sword
   slays the enemy, the sword punishes the deserter. And that He might
   show to the apostles that He was announcing judgment, He says: "I came
   not to send peace, but a sword." [2249] And after He had completed His
   parables, He says to them: "Have ye understood all these things? And
   they said, We have. And He added, Therefore is every scribe instructed
   in the kingdom of God like unto a man that is a father of a family,
   bringing forth from his treasure things new and old," [2250] --the new,
   the evangelical words of the apostles; the old, the precepts of the law
   and the prophets: and He testified that these proceeded out of His
   mouth. Moreover, He also says to Peter: "Go thou to the sea, and cast a
   hook, and take up the fish that shall first come up; and having opened
   its mouth, thou shalt find a stater (that is, two denarii), and thou
   shalt give it for me and for thee." [2251] And similarly David says by
   the Spirit: "God spake once, twice I have heard the same." [2252]
   Because God once decreed from the beginning what shall be even to the
   end. Finally, as He Himself is the Judge appointed by the Father, on
   account of His assumption of humanity, wishing to show that men shall
   be judged by the word that He had declared, He says: "Think ye that I
   will judge you at the last day? Nay, but the word," says He, "which I
   have spoken unto you, that shall judge you in the last day." [2253] And
   Paul, speaking of Antichrist to the Thessalonians, says: "Whom the Lord
   Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth." [2254] And Isaiah says:
   "By the breath of His lips He shall slay the wicked." [2255] This,
   therefore, is the two-edged sword issuing out of His mouth.

   15. "And His voice as it were the voice of many waters."] The many
   waters are understood to be many peoples, or the gift of baptism that
   He sent forth by the apostles, saying: "Go ye, teach all nations,
   baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
   Holy Ghost." [2256]

   16. "And He had in His right hand seven stars."] He said that in His
   right hand He had seven stars, because the Holy Spirit of sevenfold
   agency was given into His power by the Father. As Peter exclaimed to
   the Jews: "Being at the right hand of God exalted, He hath shed forth
   this Spirit received from the Father, which ye both see and hear."
   [2257] Moreover, John the Baptist had also anticipated this, by saying
   to his disciples: "For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him.
   The Father," says he, "loveth the Son, and hath given all things into
   His hands." [2258] Those seven stars are the seven churches, which he
   names in his addresses by name, and calls them to whom he wrote
   epistles. Not that they are themselves the only, or even the principal
   churches; but what he says to one, he says to all. For they are in no
   respect different, that on that ground any one should prefer them to
   the larger number of similar small ones. In the whole world Paul taught
   that all the churches are arranged by sevens, that they are called
   seven, and that the Catholic Church is one. And first of all, indeed,
   that he himself also might maintain the type of seven churches, he did
   not exceed that number. But he wrote to the Romans, to the Corinthians,
   to the Galatians, to the Ephesians, to the Thessalonians, to the
   Philippians, to the Colossians; afterwards he wrote to individual
   persons, so as not to exceed the number of seven churches. And
   abridging in a short space his announcement, he thus says to Timothy:
   "That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the
   Church of the living God." [2259] We read also that this typical number
   is announced by the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Isaiah: "Of seven women
   which took hold of one man." [2260] The one man is Christ, not born of
   seed; but the seven women are seven churches, receiving His bread, and
   clothed with his apparel, who ask that their reproach should be taken
   away, only that His name should be called upon them. The bread is the
   Holy Spirit, which nourishes to eternal life, promised to them, that
   is, by faith. And His garments wherewith they desire to be clothed are
   the glory of immortality, of which Paul the apostle says: "For this
   corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on
   immortality." [2261] Moreover, they ask that their reproach may be
   taken away--that is, that they may be cleansed from their sins: for the
   reproach is the original sin which is taken away in baptism, and they
   begin to be called Christian men, which is, "Let thy name be called
   upon us." Therefore in these seven churches, of one Catholic Church are
   believers, because it is one in seven by the quality of faith and
   election. Whether writing to them who labour in the world, and live
   [2262] of the frugality of their labours, and are patient, and when
   they see certain men in the Church wasters, and pernicious, they hear
   them, lest there should become dissension, he yet admonishes them by
   love, that in what respects their faith is deficient they should
   repent; or to those who dwell in cruel places among persecutors, that
   they should continue faithful; or to those who, under the pretext of
   mercy, do unlawful sins in the Church, and make them manifest to be
   done by others; or to those that are at ease in the Church; or to those
   who are negligent, and Christians only in name; or to those who are
   meekly instructed, that they may bravely persevere in faith; or to
   those who study the Scriptures, and labour to know the mysteries of
   their announcement, and are unwilling to do God's work that is mercy
   and love: to all he urges penitence, to all he declares judgment.

    from the second chapter.

   2. "I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience."] In the first
   epistle He speaks thus: I know that thou sufferest and workest, I see
   that thou art patient; think not that I am staying long from thee.

   "And that thou canst not bear them that are evil, and who say that they
   are Jews and are not, and thou has found them liars, and thou hast
   patience for My name's sake."] All these things tend to praise, and
   that no small praise; and it behoves such men, and such a class, and
   such elected persons, by all means to be admonished, that they may not
   be defrauded of such privileges granted to them of God. These few
   things He said that He had against them.

   4, 5. "And thou hast left thy first love: remember whence thou hast
   fallen."] He who falls, falls from a height: therefore He said whence:
   because, even to the very last, works of love must be practised; and
   this is the principal commandment. Finally, unless this is done, He
   threatened to remove their candlestick out of its place, that is, to
   disperse the congregation.

   6. "This thou hast also, that thou hatest the deeds of the
   Nicolaitanes."] But because thou thyself hatest those who hold the
   doctrines of the Nicolaitanes, thou expectest praise. Moreover, to hate
   the works of the Nicolaitanes, which He Himself also hated, this tends
   to praise. But the works of the Nicolaitanes were in that time false
   and troublesome men, who, as ministers under the name of Nicolaus, had
   made for themselves a heresy, to the effect that what had been offered
   to idols might be exorcised and eaten, and that whoever should have
   committed fornication might receive peace on the eighth day. Therefore
   He extols those to whom He is writing; and to these men, being such and
   so great, He promised the tree of life, which is in the paradise of His
   God.

   The following epistle unfolds the mode of life and habit of another
   order which follows. He proceeds to say:--

   9. "I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art rich."] For He
   knows that with such men there are riches hidden with Him, and that
   they deny the blasphemy of the Jews, who say that they are Jews and are
   not; but they are the synagogue of Satan, since they are gathered
   together by Antichrist; and to them He says:--

   10. "Be thou faithful unto death."] That they should continue to be
   faithful even unto death.

   11. "He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death."]
   That is, he shall not be chastised in hell.

   The third order of the saints shows that they are men who are strong in
   faith, and who are not afraid of persecution; but because even among
   them there are some who are inclined to unlawful associations, He
   says:--

   14-16. "Thou hast there some who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who
   taught in the case of Balak that he should put a stumbling-block before
   the children of Israel, to eat and to commit fornication. So also hast
   thou them who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes; but I will fight
   with them with the sword of my mouth."] That is, I will say what I
   shall command, and I will tell you what you shall do. For Balaam,
   [2263] with his doctrine, taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before
   the eyes of the children of Israel, to eat what was sacrificed to
   idols, and to commit fornication,--a thing which is known to have
   happened of old. For he gave this advice to the king of the Moabites,
   and they caused stumbling to the people. Thus, says He, ye have among
   you those who hold such doctrine; and under the pretext of mercy, you
   would corrupt others.

   17. "To him that overcometh I will give the hidden manna, and I will
   give him a white stone."] The hidden manna is immortality; the white
   gem is adoption to be the son of God; the new name written on the stone
   is "Christian."

   The fourth class intimates the nobility of the faithful, who labour
   daily, and do greater works. But even among them also He shows that
   there are men of an easy disposition to grant unlawful peace, and to
   listen to new forms of prophesying; and He reproves and warns the
   others to whom this is not pleasing, who know the wickedness opposed to
   them: for which evils He purposes to bring upon the head of the
   faithful both sorrows and dangers; and therefore He says:--

   24. "I will not put upon you any other burden."] That is, I have not
   given you laws, observances, and duties, which is another burden.

   25, 26. "But that which ye have, hold fast until I come; and he that
   overcometh, to him will I give power over all peoples."] That is, him I
   will appoint as judge among the rest of the saints.

   28. "And I will give him the morning star."] To wit, the first
   resurrection. He promised the morning star, which drives away the
   night, and announces the light, that is, the beginning of day.

    from the third chapter.

   The fifth class, company, or association of saints, sets forth men who
   are careless, and who are carrying on in the world other transactions
   than those which they ought--Christians only in name. And therefore He
   exhorts them that by any means they should be turned away from
   negligence, and be saved; and to this effect He says:--

   2. "Be watchful, and strengthen the other things which were ready to
   die; for I have not found thy works perfect before God."] For it is not
   enough for a tree to live and to have no fruit, even as it is not
   enough to be called a Christian and to confess Christ, but not to have
   Himself in our work, that is, not to do His precepts.

   The sixth class is the mode of life of the best election. The habit of
   saints is set forth; of those, to wit, who are lowly in the world, and
   unskilled in the Scriptures, and who hold the faith immoveably, and are
   not at all broken down by any chance, or withdrawn from the faith by
   any fear. Therefore He says to them:--

   8. "I have set before thee an open door, because thou hast kept the
   word of my patience."] In such little strength.

   10. "And I will keep thee from the hour of temptation."] That they may
   know His glory to be of this kind, that they are not indeed permitted
   to be given over to temptation.

   12. "He that overcometh shall be made a pillar in the temple of God."]
   For even as a pillar is an ornament of the building, so he who
   perseveres shall obtain a nobility in the Church.

   Moreover, the seventh association of the Church declares that they are
   rich men placed in positions of dignity, but believing that they are
   rich, among whom indeed the Scriptures are discussed in their
   bedchamber, while the faithful are outside; and they are understood by
   none, although they boast themselves, and say that they know all
   things,--endowed with the confidence of learning, but ceasing from its
   labour. And thus He says:--

   15. "That they are neither cold nor hot."] That is, neither unbelieving
   nor believing, for they are all things to all men. And because he who
   is neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm, gives nausea, He says:--

   16. "I will vomit thee out of My mouth."] Although nausea is hateful,
   still it hurts no one; so also is it with men of this kind when they
   have been cast forth. But because there is time of repentance, He
   says:--

   18. "I persuade thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire."] That is,
   that in whatever manner you can, you should suffer for the Lord's name
   tribulations and passions.

   "And anoint thine eyes with eye-salve."] That what you gladly know by
   the Scripture, you should strive also to do the work of the same. And
   because, if in these ways men return out of great destruction to great
   repentance, they are not only useful to themselves, but they are able
   also to be of advantage to many, He promised them no small reward,--to
   sit, namely, on the throne of judgment.
     __________________________________________________________________

    from the fourth chapter.

   1. "After this, I beheld, and, lo, a door was opened in heaven."] The
   new testament is announced as an open door in heaven.

   "And the first voice which I heard was, as it were, of a trumpet
   talking with me, saying, Come up hither."] Since the door is shown to
   be opened, it is manifest that previously it had been closed to men.
   And it was sufficiently and fully laid open when Christ ascended with
   His body to the Father into heaven. Moreover, the first voice which he
   had heard when he says that it spoke with him, without contradiction
   condemns those who say that one spoke in the prophets, another in the
   Gospel; since it is rather He Himself who comes, that is the same who
   spoke in the prophets. For John was of the circumcision, and all that
   people which had heard the announcement of the Old Testament was
   edified with his word.

   "That very same voice," said he, "that I had heard, that said unto me,
   Come up hither."] That is the Spirit, whom a little before he confesses
   that he had seen walking as the Son of man in the midst of the golden
   candlesticks. And he now gathers from Him what had been foretold in
   similitudes by the law, and associates with this scripture all the
   former prophets, and opens up the Scriptures. And because our Lord
   invited in His own name all believers into heaven, He forthwith poured
   out the Holy Spirit, who should bring them to heaven. He says:--

   2. "Immediately I was in the Spirit."] And since the mind of the
   faithful is opened by the Holy Spirit, and that is manifested to them
   which was also foretold to the fathers, he distinctly says:--

   "And, behold, a throne was set in heaven."] The throne set: what is it
   but the throne of judgment and of the King?

   3. "And He that sat upon the throne was, to look upon, like a jasper
   and a sardine stone."] Upon the throne he says that he saw the likeness
   of a jasper and a sardine stone. The jasper is of the colour of water,
   the sardine of fire. These two are thence manifested to be placed as
   judgments upon God's tribunal until the consummation of the world, of
   which judgments one is already completed in the deluge of water, and
   the other shall be completed by fire.

   "And there was a rainbow about the throne."] Moreover, the rainbow
   round about the throne has the same colours. The rainbow is called a
   bow from what the Lord spake to Noah and to his sons, [2264] that they
   should not fear any further deluge in the generation of God, but fire.
   For thus He says: I will place my bow in the clouds, that ye may now no
   longer fear water, but fire.

   6. "And before the throne there was, as it were, a sea of glass like to
   crystal."] That is the gift of baptism which He sheds forth through His
   Son in time of repentance, before He executes judgment. It is therefore
   before the throne, that is, the judgment. And when he says a sea of
   glass like to crystal, he shows that it is pure water, smooth, not
   agitated by the wind, not flowing down as on a slope, but given to be
   immoveable as the house of God.

   "And round about the throne were four living creatures."] The four
   living creatures are the four Gospels.

   7-10. "The first living creature was like to a lion, and the second was
   like to a calf, and the third had a face like to a man, and the fourth
   was like to a flying eagle; and they had six wings, and round about and
   within they were full of eyes; and they had no rest, saying, Holy,
   holy, holy, Lord Omnipotent. And the four and twenty elders, falling
   down before the throne, adored God."] The four and twenty elders are
   the twenty-four books of the prophets and of the law, which give
   testimonies of the judgment. Moreover, also, they are the twenty-four
   fathers--twelve apostles and twelve patriarchs. And in that the living
   creatures are different in appearance, this is the reason: the living
   creature like to a lion designates Mark, in whom is heard the voice of
   the lion roaring in the desert. And in the figure of a man, Matthew
   strives to declare to us the genealogy of Mary, from whom Christ took
   flesh. Therefore, in enumerating from Abraham to David, and thence to
   Joseph, he spoke of Him as if of a man: therefore his announcement sets
   forth the image of a man. Luke, in narrating the priesthood of
   Zacharias as he offers a sacrifice for the people, and the angel that
   appears to him with respect of the priesthood, and the victim in the
   same description bore the likeness of a calf. John the evangelist, like
   to an eagle hastening on uplifted wings to greater heights, argues
   about the Word of God. Mark, therefore, as an evangelist thus
   beginning, "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it is
   written in Isaiah the prophet;" [2265] The voice of one crying in the
   wilderness," [2266] --has the effigy of a lion. And Matthew, "The book
   of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of
   Abraham:" [2267] this is the form of a man. But Luke said, "There was a
   priest, by name Zachariah, of the course of Abia, and his wife was of
   the daughters of Aaron:" [2268] this is the likeness of a calf. But
   John, when he begins, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
   with God, and the Word was God," [2269] sets forth the likeness of a
   flying eagle. Moreover, not only do the evangelists express their four
   similitudes in their respective openings of the Gospels, but also the
   Word itself of God the Father Omnipotent, which is His Son our Lord
   Jesus Christ, bears the same likeness in the time of His advent. When
   He preaches to us, He is, as it were, a lion and a lion's whelp. And
   when for man's salvation He was made man to overcome death, and to set
   all men free, and that He offered Himself a victim to the Father on our
   behalf, He was called a calf. And that He overcame death and ascended
   into the heavens, extending His wings and protecting His people, He was
   named a flying eagle. Therefore these announcements, although they are
   four, yet are one, because it proceeded from one mouth. Even as the
   river in paradise, although it is one, was divided into four heads.
   Moreover, that for the announcement of the New Testament those living
   creatures had eyes within and without, shows the spiritual providence
   which both looks into the secrets of the heart, and beholds the things
   which are coming after that are within and without.

   8. "Six wings."] These are the testimonies of the books of the Old
   Testament. Thus, twenty and four make as many as there are elders
   sitting upon the thrones. But as an animal cannot fly unless it have
   wings, so, too, the announcement of the New Testament gains no faith
   unless it have the fore-announced testimonies of the Old Testament, by
   which it is lifted from the earth, and flies. For in every case, what
   has been told before, and is afterwards found to have happened, that
   begets an undoubting faith. Again, also, if wings be not attached to
   the living creatures, they have nothing whence they may draw their
   life. For unless what the prophets foretold had been consummated in
   Christ, their preaching was vain. For the Catholic Church holds those
   things which were both before predicted and afterwards accomplished.
   And it flies, because the living animal is reasonably lifted up from
   the earth. But to heretics who do not avail themselves of the prophetic
   testimony, to them also there are present living creatures; but they do
   not fly, because they are of the earth. And to the Jews who do not
   receive the announcement of the New Testament there are present wings;
   but they do not fly, that is, they bring a vain prophesying to men, not
   adjusting facts to their words. And the books of the Old Testament that
   are received are twenty-four, which you will find in the epitomes of
   Theodore. But, moreover (as we have said), four and twenty elders,
   patriarchs and apostles, are to judge His people. For to the apostles,
   when they asked, saying, "We have forsaken all that we had, and
   followed Thee: what shall we have?" our Lord replied, "When the Son of
   man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon
   twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." [2270] But of the
   fathers also who should judge, says the patriarch Jacob, "Dan also
   himself shall judge his people among his brethren, even as one of the
   tribes in Israel." [2271]

   5. "And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and thunders,
   and seven torches of fire burning."] And the lightnings, and voices,
   and thunders proceeding from the throne of God, and the seven torches
   of fire burning, signify announcements, and promises of adoption, and
   threatenings. For lightnings signify the Lord's advent, and the voices
   the announcements of the New Testament, and the thunders, that the
   words are from heaven. The burning torches of fire signify the gift of
   the Holy Spirit, that it is given by the wood of the passion. And when
   these things were doing, he says that all the elders fell down and
   adored the Lord; while the living creatures--that is, of course, the
   actions recorded in the Gospels and the teaching of the Lord--gave Him
   glory and honour. [2272] In that they had fulfilled the word that had
   been previously foretold by them, they worthily and with reason exult,
   feeling that they have ministered the mysteries and the word of the
   Lord. Finally, also, because He had come who should remove death, and
   who alone was worthy to take the crown of immortality, all for the
   glory of His most excellent doing had crowns.

   10. "And they cast their crowns under His feet."] That is, on account
   of the eminent glory of Christ's victory, they cast all their victories
   under His feet. This is what in the Gospel the Holy Spirit consummated
   by showing, For when about finally to suffer, our Lord had come to
   Jerusalem, and the people had gone forth to meet Him, some strewed the
   road with palm branches cut down, others threw down their garments,
   doubtless these were setting forth two peoples--the one of the
   patriarchs, the other of the prophets; that is to say, of the great men
   who had any kind of palms of their victories against sin, and cast them
   under the feet of Christ, the victor of all. And the palm and the crown
   signify the same things, and these are not given save to the victor.

    from the fifth chapter.

   1. "And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne, a book
   written within and without, sealed with seven seals."] This book
   signifies the Old Testament, which has been given into the hands of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, who received from the Father judgment.

   2, 3. "And I saw an angel full of strength proclaiming with a loud
   voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
   And no one was found worthy, neither in the earth nor under the earth,
   to open the book."] Now to open the book is to overcome death for man.

   4. "There was none found worthy to do this."] Neither among the angels
   of heaven, nor among men in earth, nor among the souls of the saints in
   rest, save Christ the Son of God alone, whom he says that he saw as a
   Lamb standing as it were slain, having seven horns. What had not been
   then announced, and what the law had contemplated for Him by its
   various oblations and sacrifices, it behoved Himself to fulfil. And
   because He Himself was the testator, who had overcome death, it was
   just that Himself should be appointed the Lord's heir, that He should
   possess the substance of the dying man, that is, the human members.

   5. "Lo, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath
   prevailed."] We read in Genesis that this lion of the tribe of Judah
   hath conquered, when the patriarch Jacob says, "Judah, thy brethren
   shall praise thee; thou hast lain down and slept, and hast risen up
   again as a lion, and as a lion's whelp." [2273] For He is called a lion
   for the overcoming of death; but for the suffering for men He was led
   as a lamb to the slaughter. But because He overcame death, and
   anticipated the duty of the executioner, He was called as it were
   slain. He therefore opens and seals again the testament, which He
   Himself had sealed. The legislator Moses intimating this, that it
   behoved Him to be sealed and concealed, even to the advent of His
   passion, veiled his face, and so spoke to the people; showing that the
   words of his announcement were veiled even to the advent of His time.
   For he himself, when he had read to the people, having taken the wool
   purpled with the blood of the calf, with water sprinkled the whole
   people, saying, "This is the blood of His testament who hath purified
   you." [2274] It should therefore be observed that the Man is accurately
   announced, and that all things combine into one. For it is not
   sufficient that that law is spoken of, but it is named as a testament.
   For no law is called a testament, nor is any thing else called a
   testament, save what persons make who are about to die. And whatever is
   within the testament is sealed, even to the day of the testator's
   death. Therefore it is with reason that it is only sealed by the Lamb
   slain, who, as it were a lion, has broken death in pieces, and has
   fulfilled what had been foretold; and has delivered man, that is, the
   flesh, from death, and has received as a possession the substance of
   the dying person, that is, of the human members; that as by one body
   all men had fallen under the obligation of its death, also by one body
   all believers should be born again unto life, and rise again.
   Reasonably, therefore, His face is opened and unveiled to Moses; and
   therefore He is called Apocalypse, Revelation. For now His book is
   unsealed--now the offered victims are perceived--now the fabrication of
   the priestly chrism; moreover the testimonies are openly understood.

   8, 9. "Twenty-four elders and four living creatures, having harps and
   phials, and singing a new song."] The proclamation of the Old Testament
   associated with the New, points out the Christian people singing a new
   song, that is, bearing their confession publicly. It is a new thing
   that the Son of God should become man. It is a new thing to ascend into
   the heavens with a body. It is a new thing to give remission of sins to
   men. It is a new thing for men to be sealed with the Holy Spirit. It is
   a new thing to receive the priesthood of sacred observance, and to look
   for a kingdom of unbounded promise. The harp, and the chord stretched
   on its wooden frame, signifies the flesh of Christ linked with the wood
   of the passion. The phial signifies the Confession, [2275] and the race
   of the new Priesthood. But it is the praise of many angels, yea, of
   all, the salvation of all, and the testimony of the universal creation,
   bringing to our Lord thanksgiving for the deliverance of men from the
   destruction of death. The unsealing of the seals, as we have said, is
   the opening of the Old Testament, and the foretelling of the preachers
   of things to come in the last times, which, although the prophetic
   Scripture speaks by single seals, yet by all the seals opened at once,
   prophecy takes its rank.

    from the sixth chapter.

   1, 2. "And when the Lamb had opened one of the seven seals, I saw, and
   heard one of the four living creatures saying, Come and see. And, lo, a
   white horse, and He who sat upon him had a bow." ] The first seal being
   opened, he says that he saw a white horse, and a crowned horseman
   having a bow. For this was at first done by Himself. For after the Lord
   ascended into heaven and opened all things, He sent the Holy Spirit,
   whose words the preachers sent forth as arrows reaching to the human
   heart, that they might overcome unbelief. And the crown on the head is
   promised to the preachers by the Holy Spirit. The other three horses
   very plainly signify the wars, famines, and pestilences announced by
   our Lord in the Gospel. And thus he says that one of the four living
   creatures said (because all four are one), "Come and see." "Come" is
   said to him that is invited to faith; "see" is said to him who saw not.
   Therefore the white horse is the word of preaching with the Holy Spirit
   sent into the world. For the Lord says, "This Gospel shall be preached
   throughout the whole world for a testimony to all nations, and then
   shall come the end." [2276]

   3, 4. "And when He had opened the second seal, I heard the second
   living creature saying, Come and see. And there went out another horse
   that was red, and to him that sat upon him was given a great sword."]
   The red horse, and he that sat upon him, having a sword, signify the
   coming wars, as we read in the Gospel: "For nation shall rise against
   nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be great
   earthquakes in divers places." [2277] This is the ruddy horse.

   5. "And when He had opened the third seal, I heard the third living
   creature saying, Come and see. And, lo, a black horse; and he who sat
   upon it had a balance in his hand."] The black horse signifies famine,
   for the Lord says, "There shall be famines in divers places;" but the
   word is specially extended to the times of Antichrist, when there shall
   be a great famine, and when all shall be injured. Moreover, the balance
   in the hand is the examining scales, wherein He might show forth the
   merits of every individual. He then says:--

   6. "Hurt not the wine and the oil."] That is, strike not the spiritual
   man with thy inflictions. This is the black horse.

   7, 8. "And when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth
   living creature saying, Come and see. And, lo, a pale horse; and he who
   sat upon him was named Death."] For the pale horse and he who sat upon
   him bore the name of Death. These same things also the Lord had
   promised among the rest of the coming destructions--great pestilences
   and deaths; since, moreover, he says:--

   "And hell followed him."] That is, it was waiting for the devouring of
   many unrighteous souls. This is the pale horse.

   9. "And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
   souls of them that were slain."] He relates that he saw under the altar
   of God, that is, under the earth, the souls of them that were slain.
   For both heaven and earth are called God's altar, as saith the law,
   commanding in the symbolical form of the truth two altars to be
   made,--a golden one within, and a brazen one without. But we perceive
   that the golden altar is thus called heaven, by the testimony that our
   Lord bears to it; for He says, "When thou bringest thy gift to the
   altar" (assuredly our gifts are the prayers which we offer), "and there
   rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy
   gift before the altar." [2278] Assuredly prayers ascend to heaven.
   Therefore heaven is understood to be the golden altar which was within;
   for the priests also were accustomed to enter once in the year--as they
   who had the anointing--to the golden altar, the Holy Spirit signifying
   that Christ should do this once for all. As the golden altar is
   acknowledged to be heaven, so also by the brazen altar is understood
   the earth, under which is the Hades,--a region withdrawn from
   punishments and fires, and a place of repose for the saints, wherein
   indeed the righteous are seen and heard by the wicked, but they cannot
   be carried across to them. He who sees all things would have us to know
   that these saints, therefore--that is, the souls of the slain--are
   asking for vengeance for their blood, that is, of their body, from
   those that dwell upon the earth; but because in the last time,
   moreover, the reward of the saints will be perpetual, and the
   condemnation of the wicked shall come, it was told them to wait. And
   for a solace to their body, there were given unto each of them white
   robes. They received, says he, white robes, that is, the gift of the
   Holy Spirit.

   12. "And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal, there was a great
   earthquake."] In the sixth seal, then, was a great earthquake: this is
   that very last persecution.

   "And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair."] The sun becomes as
   sackcloth; that is, the brightness of doctrine will be obscured by
   unbelievers.

   "And the entire moon became as blood."] By the moon of blood is set
   forth the Church of the saints as pouring out her blood for Christ.

   13. "And the stars fell to the earth."] The falling of the stars are
   the faithful who are troubled for Christ's sake.

   "Even as a fig-tree casteth her untimely figs."] The fig-tree, when
   shaken, loses its untimely figs--when men are separated from the Church
   by persecution.

   14. "And the heaven withdrew as a scroll that is rolled up."] For the
   heaven to be rolled away, that is, that the Church shall be taken away.

   "And every mountain and the islands were moved from their places."]
   Mountains and islands removed from their places intimate that in the
   last persecution all men departed from their places; that is, that the
   good will be removed, seeking to avoid the persecution.

    from the seventh chapter.

   2. "And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of
   the living God."] He speaks of Elias the prophet, who is the precursor
   of the times of Antichrist, for the restoration and establishment of
   the churches from the great and intolerable persecution. We read that
   these things are predicted in the opening of the Old and New Testament;
   for He says by Malachi: "Lo, I will send to you Elias the Tishbite, to
   turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, according to the time
   of calling, to recall the Jews to the faith of the people that succeed
   them." [2279] And to that end He shows, as we have said, that the
   number of those that shall believe, of the Jews and of the nations, is
   a great multitude which no man was able to number. Moreover, we read in
   the Gospel that the prayers of the Church are sent from heaven by an
   angel, and that they are received against wrath, and that the kingdom
   of Antichrist is cast out and extinguished by holy angels; for He says:
   "Pray that ye enter not into temptation: for there shall be a great
   affliction, such as has not been from the beginning of the world; and
   except the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved."
   [2280] Therefore He shall send these seven great archangels to smite
   the kingdom of Antichrist; for He Himself also thus said: "Then the Son
   of man shall send His messengers; and they shall gather together His
   elect from the four corners of the wind, from the one end of heaven
   even to the other end thereof." [2281] For, moreover, He previously
   says by the prophet: "Then shall there be peace for our land, when
   there shall arise in it seven shepherds and eight attacks of men; and
   they shall encircle Assur," that is, Antichrist, "in the trench of
   Nimrod," [2282] that is, in the nation of the devil, by the spirit of
   the Church. Similarly when the keepers of the house shall be moved.
   Moreover, the Lord Himself, in the parable to the apostles, when the
   labourers had come to Him and said, "Lord, did not we sow good seed in
   Thy field? whence, then, hath it tares? answered them, An enemy hath
   done this. And they said to Him, Lord, wilt Thou, then, that we go and
   root them up? And He said, Nay, but let both grow together until the
   harvest; and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, that
   they gather the tares and make bundles of them, and burn them with fire
   everlasting, but that they gather the wheat into my barns." [2283] The
   Apocalypse here shows, therefore, that these reapers, and shepherds,
   and labourers, are the angels. And the trumpet is the word of power.
   And although the same thing recurs in the phials, still it is not said
   as if it occurred twice, but because what is decreed by the Lord to
   happen shall be once for all; for this cause it is said twice. What,
   therefore, He said too little in the trumpets, is here found in the
   phials. We must not regard the order of what is said, because
   frequently the Holy Spirit, when He has traversed even to the end of
   the last times, returns again to the same times, and fills up what He
   had before failed to say. [2284] Nor must we look for order in the
   Apocalypse; but we must follow the meaning of those things which are
   prophesied. Therefore in the trumpets and phials is signified either
   the desolation of the plagues that are sent upon the earth, or the
   madness of Antichrist himself, or the cutting off of the peoples, or
   the diversity of the plagues, or the hope in the kingdom of the saints,
   or the ruin of states, or the great overthrow of Babylon, that is, the
   Roman state.

   9. "After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man was
   able to number, of every nation, tribe, and people, and tongue, clothed
   with white robes."] What the great multitude out of every tribe
   implies, is to show the number of the elect out of all believers, who,
   being cleansed by baptism in the blood of the Lamb, have made their
   robes white, keeping the grace which they have received.

   1. "And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
   heaven for about half an hour."] Whereby is signified the beginning of
   everlasting rest; but it is described as partial, because the silence
   being interrupted, he repeats it in order. For if the silence had
   continued, here would be an end of his narrative.

   13. "And I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven."] By the
   angel flying through the midst of heaven is signified the Holy Spirit
   bearing witness in two of the prophets that a great wrath of plagues
   was imminent. If by any means, even in the last times, any one should
   be willing to be converted, any one might even still be saved.

   13, 14. "And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar
   which is in the presence of God, saying to the sixth angel which had
   the trumpet, Loose the four angels."] That is, the four corners of the
   earth which hold the four winds.

   "Which are bound in the great river Euphrates."] By the corners of the
   earth, or the four winds across the river Euphrates, are meant four
   nations, because to every nation is sent an angel; as said the law, "He
   determined them by the number of the angels of God," [2285] until the
   number of the saints should be filled up. They do not overpass their
   bounds, because at the last they shall come with Antichrist.

    from the tenth chapter.

   1, 2. "I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, clothed with
   a cloud; and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were
   the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: and he had in his hand an
   open book: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot
   upon the earth."] He signifies that that mighty angel who, he says,
   descended from heaven, clothed with a cloud, is our Lord, as we have
   above narrated.

   "His face was as it were the sun."] That is, with respect to the
   resurrection.

   "Upon his head was a rainbow."] He points to the judgment which is
   executed by Him, or shall be.

   "An open book."] A revelation of works in the future judgment, or the
   Apocalypse which John received.

   "His feet,"] as we have said above, are the apostles. For that both
   things in sea and land are trodden under foot by Him, signifies that
   all things are placed under His feet. Moreover, he calls Him an angel,
   that is, a messenger, to wit, of the Father; for He is called the
   Messenger of great counsel. He says also that He cried with a loud
   voice. The great voice is to tell the words of the Omnipotent God of
   heaven to men, and to bear witness that after penitence is closed there
   will be no hope subsequently.

   3. "Seven thunders uttered their voices."] The seven thunders uttering
   their voices signify the Holy Spirit of sevenfold power, who through
   the prophets announced all things to come, and by His voice John gave
   his testimony in the world; but because he says that he was about to
   write the things which the thunders had uttered, that is, whatever
   things had been obscure in the announcements of the Old Testament; he
   is forbidden to write them, but he was charged to leave them sealed,
   because he is an apostle, nor was it fitting that the grace of the
   subsequent stage should be given in the first. "The time," says he, "is
   at hand." [2286] For the apostles, by powers, by signs, by portents,
   and by mighty works, have overcome unbelief. After them there is now
   given to the same completed Churches the comfort of having the
   prophetic Scriptures subsequently interpreted, for I said that after
   the apostles there would be interpreting prophets.

   For the apostle says: "And he placed in the Church indeed, first,
   apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers," [2287] and the rest.
   And in another place he says: "Let the prophets speak two or three, and
   let the others judge." [2288] And he says: "Every woman that prayeth or
   prophesieth with her head uncovered, dishonoureth her head." [2289] And
   when he says, "Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others
   judge," he is not speaking in respect of the Catholic prophecy of
   things unheard and unknown, but of things both announced and known. But
   let them judge whether or not the interpretation is consistent with the
   testimonies of the prophetic utterance. [2290] It is plain, therefore,
   that to John, armed as he was with superior virtue, this was not
   necessary, although the body of Christ, which is the Church, adorned
   with His members, ought to respond to its position.

   10. "I took the book from the hand of the angel, and ate it up."] To
   take the book and eat it up, is, when exhibition of a thing is made to
   one, to commit it to memory.

   "And it was in my mouth as sweet as honey."] To be sweet in the mouth
   is the reward of the preaching of the speaker, and is most pleasant to
   the hearers; but it is most bitter both to those that announce it, and
   to those that persevere in its commandments through suffering.

   11. "And He says unto me, Thou must again prophesy to the peoples, and
   to the tongues, and to the nations, and to many kings."] He says this,
   because when John said these things he was in the island of Patmos,
   condemned to the labour of the mines by Cæsar Domitian. There,
   therefore, he saw the Apocalypse; and when grown old, he thought that
   he should at length receive his quittance by suffering, Domitian being
   killed, all his judgments were discharged. And John being dismissed
   from the mines, thus subsequently delivered the same Apocalypse which
   he had received from God. This, therefore, is what He says: Thou must
   again prophesy to all nations, because thou seest the crowds of
   Antichrist rise up; and against them other crowds shall stand, and they
   shall fall by the sword on the one side and on the other.

    from the eleventh chapter.

   1. "And there was shown unto me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
   stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and
   them that worship therein."] A reed was shown like to a rod. This
   itself is the Apocalypse which he subsequently exhibited to the
   churches; for the Gospel of the complete faith he subsequently wrote
   for the sake of our salvation. For when Valentinus, and Cerinthus, and
   Ebion, and others of the school of Satan, were scattered abroad
   throughout the world, there assembled together to him from the
   neighbouring provinces all the bishops, and compelled him himself also
   to draw up his testimony. Moreover, we say that the measure of God's
   temple is the command of God to confess the Father Almighty, and that
   His Son Christ was begotten by the Father before the beginning of the
   world, and was made man in very soul and flesh, both of them having
   overcome misery and death; and that, when received with His body into
   heaven by the Father, He shed forth the Holy Spirit, the gift and
   pledge of immortality, that He was announced by the prophets, He was
   described by the law, He was God's hand, and the Word of the Father
   from God, Lord over all, and founder of the world: this is the reed and
   the measure of faith; and no one worships the holy altar save he who
   confesses this faith.

   2. "The court which is within the temple leave out."] The space which
   is called the court is the empty altar within the walls: these being
   such as were not necessary, he commanded to be ejected from the Church.

   "It is given to be trodden down by the Gentiles."] That is, to the men
   of this world, that it may be trodden under foot by the nations, or
   with the nations. Then he repeats about the destruction and slaughter
   of the last time, and says:--

   3. "They shall tread the holy city down for forty and two months; and I
   will give to my two witnesses, and they shall predict a thousand two
   hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth."] That is, three
   years and six months: these make forty-two months. Therefore their
   preaching is three years and six months, and the kingdom of Antichrist
   as much again.

   5. "If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and
   devoureth their enemies."] That fire proceedeth out of the mouth of
   those prophets against the adversaries, bespeaks the power of the
   world. For all afflictions, however many there are, shall be sent by
   their messengers in their word. Many think that there is Elisha, or
   Moses, with Elijah; but both of these died; while the death of Elijah
   is not heard of, with whom all our ancients have believed that it was
   Jeremiah. For even the very word spoken to him testifies to him,
   saying, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
   camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a
   prophet unto the nations." [2291] But he was not a prophet unto the
   nations; and thus the truthful word of God makes it necessary, which it
   has promised to set forth, that he should be a prophet to the nations.

   4. "These are the two candlesticks standing before the Lord of the
   earth."] These two candlesticks and two olive trees He has to this end
   spoken of, and admonished you that if, when you have read of them
   elsewhere, you have not understood, you may understand here. For in
   Zechariah, one of the twelve prophets, it is thus written: "These are
   the two olive trees and two candlesticks which stand in the presence of
   the Lord of the earth;" [2292] that is, they are in paradise. Also, in
   another sense, standing in the presence of the lord of the earth, that
   is, in the presence of Antichrist. Therefore they must be slain by
   Antichrist.

   7. "And the beast which ascendeth from the abyss."] After many plagues
   completed in the world, in the end he says that a beast ascended from
   the abyss. But that he shall ascend from the abyss is proved by many
   testimonies; for he says in the thirty-first chapter of Ezekiel:
   "Behold, Assur was a cypress in Mount Lebanon." Assur, deeply rooted,
   was a lofty and branching cypress--that is, a numerous people--in Mount
   Lebanon, in the kingdom of kingdoms, that is, of the Romans. Moreover,
   that he says he was beautiful in offshoots, he says he was strong in
   armies. The water, he says, shall nourish him, that is, the many
   thousands of men which were subjected to him; and the abyss increased
   him, that is, belched him forth. For even Isaiah speaks almost in the
   same words; moreover, that he was in the kingdom of the Romans, and
   that he was among the Cæsars. The Apostle Paul also bears witness, for
   he says to the Thessalonians: "Let him who now restraineth restrain,
   until he be taken out of the way; and then shall appear that Wicked
   One, even he whose coming is after the working of Satan, with signs and
   lying wonders." [2293] And that they might know that he should come who
   then was the prince, he added: "He already endeavours after the secret
   of mischief" [2294] --that is, the mischief which he is about to do he
   strives to do secretly; but he is not raised up by his own power, nor
   by that of his father, but by command of God, of which thing Paul says
   in the same passage: "For this cause, because they have not received
   the love of God, He will send upon them a spirit of error, that they
   all may be persuaded of a lie, who have not been persuaded of the
   truth." [2295] And Isaiah saith: "While they waited for the light,
   darkness arose upon them." [2296] Therefore the Apocalypse sets forth
   that these prophets are killed by the same, and on the fourth day rise
   again, that none might be found equal to God.

   8. "And their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city,
   which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt."] But He calls Jerusalem
   Sodom and Egypt, since it had become the heaping up of the persecuting
   people. Therefore it behooves us diligently, and with the utmost care,
   to follow the prophetic announcement, and to understand what the Spirit
   from the Father both announces and anticipates, and how, when He has
   gone forward to the last times, He again repeats the former ones. And
   now, what He will do once for all, He sometimes sets forth as if it
   were done; and unless you understand this, as sometimes done, and
   sometimes as about to be done, you will fall into a great confusion.
   Therefore the interpretation of the following sayings has shown
   therein, that not the order of the reading, but the order of the
   discourse, must be understood.

   19. "And the temple of God was opened which is in heaven."] The temple
   opened is a manifestation of our Lord. For the temple of God is the
   Son, as He Himself says: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will
   raise it up." And when the Jews said, "Forty and six years was this
   temple in building," the evangelist says, "He spake of the temple of
   His body." [2297]

   "And there was seen in His temple the ark of the Lord's testament."]
   The preaching of the Gospel and the forgiveness of sins, and all the
   gifts whatever that came with Him, he says, appeared therein.

    from the twelfth chapter.

   1. "And there was seen a great sign in heaven. A woman clothed with the
   sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve
   stars. And being with child, she cried out travailing, and bearing
   torments that she might bring forth."] The woman clothed with the sun,
   and having the moon under her feet, and wearing a crown of twelve stars
   upon her head, and travailing in her pains, is the ancient Church of
   fathers, and prophets, and saints, and apostles, [2298] which had the
   groans and torments of its longing until it saw that Christ, the fruit
   of its people according to the flesh long promised to it, had taken
   flesh out of the selfsame people. Moreover, being clothed with the sun
   intimates the hope of resurrection and the glory of the promise. And
   the moon intimates the fall of the bodies of the saints under the
   obligation of death, which never can fail. For even as life is
   diminished, so also it is increased. Nor is the hope of those that
   sleep extinguished absolutely, as some think, but they have in their
   darkness a light such as the moon. And the crown of twelve stars
   signifies the choir of fathers, according to the fleshly birth, of whom
   Christ was to take flesh.

   3. "And there appeared another sign in heaven; and behold a red dragon,
   having seven heads."] Now, that he says that this dragon was of a red
   colour--that is, of a purple colour--the result of his work gave him
   such a colour. For from the beginning (as the Lord says) he was a
   murderer; and he has oppressed the whole of the human race, not so much
   by the obligation of death, as, moreover, by the various forms of
   destruction and fatal mischiefs. His seven heads were the seven kings
   of the Romans, of whom also is Antichrist, as we have said above.

   "And ten horns."] He says that the ten kings in the latest times are
   the same as these, as we shall more fully set forth there.

   4. "And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast
   them upon the earth."] Now, that he says that the dragon's tail drew
   the third part of the stars of heaven, this may be taken in two ways.
   For many think that he may be able to seduce the third part of the men
   who believe. [2299] But it should more truly be understood, that of the
   angels that were subject to him, since he was still a prince when he
   descended from his estate, he seduced the third part; therefore what we
   said above, the Apocalypse says.

   "And the dragon stood before the woman who was beginning to bring
   forth, that, when she had brought forth, he might devour her child."]
   The red dragon standing and desiring to devour her child when she had
   brought him forth, is the devil,--to wit, the traitor angel, who
   thought that the perishing of all men would be alike by death; but He,
   who was not born of seed, owed nothing to death: wherefore he could not
   devour Him--that is, detain Him in death--for on the third day He rose
   again. Finally, also, and before He suffered, he approached to tempt
   Him as man; but when he found that He was not what he thought Him to
   be, he departed from Him, even till the time. Whence it is here said:--

   5. "And she brought forth a son, who begins to rule all nations with a
   rod of iron."] The rod of iron is the sword of persecution.

   "I saw that all men withdrew from his abodes."] That is, the good will
   be removed, flying from persecution. [2300]

   "And her son was caught up to God, and to His throne."] We read also in
   the Acts of the Apostles that He was caught up to God's throne, just as
   speaking with the disciples He was caught up to heaven.

   6. "But the woman fled into the wilderness, and there were given to her
   two great eagle's wings."] The aid of the great eagle's wings--to wit,
   the gift of prophets--was given to that Catholic Church, whence in the
   last times a hundred and forty-four thousands of men should believe on
   the preaching of Elias; but, moreover, he here says that the rest of
   the people should be found alive on the coming of the Lord. And the
   Lord says in the Gospel: "Then let them which are in Judea flee to the
   mountains;" [2301] that is, as many as should be gathered together in
   Judea, let them go to that place which they have ready, and let them be
   supported there for three years and six months from the presence of the
   devil.

   14. "Two great wings"] are the two prophets--Elias, and the prophet who
   shall be with him.

   15. "And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman water as a
   flood, that he might carry her away with the flood."] He signifies by
   the water which the serpent cast out of his mouth, the people who at
   his command would persecute her.

   16. "And the earth helped the woman, and opened her mouth, and
   swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth."] That
   the earth opened her month and swallowed up the waters, sets forth the
   vengeance for the present troubles. Although, therefore, it may signify
   this woman bringing forth, it shows her afterwards flying when her
   offspring is brought forth, because both things did not happen at one
   time; for we know that Christ was born, but that the time should arrive
   that she should flee from the face of the serpent: (we do not know)
   that this has happened as yet. Then he says:--

   7-9. "There was a battle in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with
   the dragon; and the dragon warred, and his angels, and they prevailed
   not; nor was their place found any more in heaven. And that great
   dragon was cast forth, that old serpent: he was cast forth into the
   earth."] This is the beginning of Antichrist; yet previously Elias must
   prophesy, and there must be times of peace. And afterwards, when the
   three years and six months are completed in the preaching of Elias, he
   also must be cast down from heaven, where up till that time he had had
   the power of ascending; and all the apostate angels, as well as
   Antichrist, must be roused up from hell. Paul the apostle says: "Except
   there come a falling away first, and the man of sin shall appear, the
   son of perdition; and the adversary who exalted himself above all which
   is called God, or which is worshipped." [2302]

    from the thirteenth chapter. [2303]

   1. "And I saw a beast rising up from the sea, like unto a leopard."]
   This signifies the kingdom of that time of Antichrist, and the people
   mingled with the variety of nations.

   2. "His feet were as the feet of a bear."] A strong and most unclean
   beast, the feet are to be understood as his leaders.

   "And his mouth as the mouth of a lion."] That is, his mouth armed for
   blood is his bidding, and a tongue which will proceed to nothing else
   than to the shedding of blood.

   * * * * * * * *

   18. "His number is the name of a man, and his number is Six hundred
   threescore and six."] As they have it reckoned from the Greek
   characters, they thus find it among many to be teitan, for teitan has
   this number, which the Gentiles call Sol and Phoebus; and it is
   reckoned in Greek thus: t three hundred, e five, i ten, t three
   hundred, a one, n fifty,--which taken together become six hundred and
   sixty-six. For as far as belongs to the Greek letters, they fill up
   this number and name; which name if you wish to turn into Latin, it is
   understood by the antiphrase DICLUX, which letters are reckoned in this
   manner: since D figures five hundred, I one, C a hundred, L fifty, V
   five, X ten,--which by the reckoning up of the letters makes similarly
   six hundred and sixty-six, that is, what in Greek gives teitan, to wit,
   what in Latin is called DICLUX; by which name, expressed by
   antiphrases, we understand Antichrist, who, although he be cut off from
   the supernal light, and deprived thereof, yet transforms himself into
   an angel of light, daring to call himself light. [2304] Moreover, we
   find in a certain Greek codex antemos, which letters being reckoned up,
   you will find to give the number as above: a one, n fifty, t three
   hundred, e five, m forty, o seventy, s two hundred,--which together
   makes six hundred and sixty-six, according to the Greeks. Moreover,
   there is another name in Gothic of him, which will be evident of
   itself, that is, genserikos, which in the same way you will reckon in
   Greek letters: g three, e five, n fifty, s two hundred, e eight, r a
   hundred, i ten, k twenty, o seventy, s also two hundred, which, as has
   been said above, make six hundred and sixty-six.

   11. "And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth."] He is
   speaking of the great and false prophet who is to do signs, and
   portents, and falsehoods before him in the presence of men.

   "And he had two horns like a lamb--that is, the appearance within of a
   man--and he spoke like a dragon."] But the devil speaks full of malice;
   for he shall do these things in the presence of men, so that even the
   dead appear to rise again.

   13. "And he shall make fire come down from heaven in the sight of
   men."] Yes (as I also have said), in the sight of men. Magicians do
   these things, by the aid of the apostate angels, even to this day. He
   shall cause also that a golden image of Antichrist shall be placed in
   the temple at Jerusalem, and that the apostate angel should enter, and
   thence utter voices and oracles. Moreover, he himself shall contrive
   that his servants and children should receive as a mark on their
   foreheads, or on their right hands, the number of his name, lest any
   one should buy or sell them. Daniel had previously predicted his
   contempt and provocation of God. "And he shall place," says he, "his
   temple within Samaria, upon the illustrious and holy mountain that is
   at Jerusalem, an image such as Nebuchadnezzar had made." [2305] Thence
   here he places, and by and by here he renews, that of which the Lord,
   admonishing His churches concerning the last times and their dangers,
   says: "But when ye shall see the contempt which is spoken of by Daniel
   the prophet standing in the holy place, let him who readeth
   understand." [2306] It is called a contempt when God is provoked,
   because idols are worshipped instead of God, or when the dogma of
   heretics is introduced in the churches. But it is a turning away
   because stedfast men, seduced by false signs and portents, are turned
   away from their salvation.

    from the fourteenth chapter.

   6. "And I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven."] The angel
   flying through the midst of heaven, whom he says that he saw, we have
   already treated of above, as being the same Elias who anticipates the
   kingdom of Antichrist in his prophecy.

   8. "And another angel following him."] The other angel following, he
   speaks of as the same prophet who is the associate of his prophesying.
   But that he says,--

   15. "Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather in the grapes of the
   vine,"] he signifies it of the nations that should perish on the advent
   of the Lord. And indeed in many forms he shows this same thing, as if
   to the dry harvest, and the seed for the coming of the Lord, and the
   consummation of the world, and the kingdom of Christ, and the future
   appearance of the kingdom of the blessed.

   19, 20. "And the angel thrust in the sickle, and reaped the vine of the
   earth, and cast it into the wine-press of the wrath of God. And the
   wine-press of His fury was trodden down without the city."] In that he
   says that it was cast into the wine-press of the wrath of God, and
   trodden down without the city, the treading of the wine-press is the
   retribution on the sinner.

   "And blood went out from the wine-press, even unto the horse-bridles."]
   The vengeance of shed blood as was before predicted, "In blood thou
   hast sinned, and blood shall follow thee." [2307]

   "For a thousand and six hundred furlongs."] That is, through all the
   four parts of the world: for there is a quadrate put together by fours,
   as in four faces and four appearances, and wheels by fours; for forty
   times four is one thousand six hundred. Repeating the same persecution,
   the Apocalypse says:--

    from the fifteenth chapter.

   1. "And I saw another great and wonderful sign, seven angels having the
   seven last plagues; for in them is completed the indignation of God."]
   For the wrath of God always strikes the obstinate people with seven
   plagues, that is, perfectly, as it is said in Leviticus; and these
   shall be in the last time, when the Church shall have gone out of the
   midst.

   2. "Standing upon the sea of glass, having harps."] That is, that they
   stood stedfastly in the faith upon their baptism, and having their
   confession in their mouth, that they shall exult in the kingdom before
   God. But let us return to what is set before us.
     __________________________________________________________________

    from the seventeenth chapter.

   1-6. "There came one of the seven angels, which have the seven bowls,
   and spake with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of that
   great whore who sitteth upon many waters. And I saw the woman drunk
   with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs."] The
   decrees of that senate are always accomplished against all, contrary to
   the preaching of the true faith; and now already mercy being cast
   aside, itself here gave the decree among all nations.

   3. "And I saw the woman herself sitting upon the scarlet-coloured
   beast, full of names of blasphemy."] But to sit upon the scarlet beast,
   the author of murders, is the image of the devil. Where also is treated
   of his captivity, concerning which we have fully considered. I
   remember, indeed, that this is called Babylon also in the Apocalypse,
   on account of confusion; and in Isaiah also; and Ezekiel called it
   Sodom. In fine, if you compare what is said against Sodom, and what
   Isaiah says against Babylon, and what the Apocalypse says, you will
   find that they are all one. [2308]

   9. "The seven heads are the seven hills, on which the woman sitteth."]
   That is, the city of Rome.

   10. "And there are seven kings: five have fallen, and one is, and the
   other is not yet come; and when he is come, he will be for a short
   time."] The time must be understood in which the written Apocalypse was
   published, since then reigned Cæsar Domitian; but before him had been
   Titus his brother, and Vespasian, Otho, Vitellius, and Galba. These are
   the five who have fallen. One remains, under whom the Apocalypse was
   written--Domitian, to wit. "The other has not yet come," speaks of
   Nerva; "and when he is come, he will be for a short time," for he did
   not complete the period of two years.

   11. "And the beast which thou sawest is of the seven."] Since before
   those kings Nero reigned.

   "And he is the eighth."] He says only when this beast shall come,
   reckon it the eighth place, since in that is the completion. He
   added:--

   "And shall go into perdition."] For that ten kings received royal power
   when he shall move from the east, he says. He shall be sent from the
   city of Rome with his armies. And Daniel sets forth the ten horns and
   the ten diadems. And that these are eradicated from the former
   ones,--that is, that three of the principal leaders are killed by
   Antichrist: that the other seven give him honour and wisdom and power,
   of whom he says:--

   16. "These shall hate the whore, to wit, the city, and shall burn her
   flesh with fire."] Now that one of the heads was, as it were, slain to
   death, and that the stroke of his death was directed, he speaks of
   Nero. For it is plain that when the cavalry sent by the senate was
   pursuing him, he himself cut his throat. Him therefore, when raised up,
   God will send as a worthy king, but worthy in such a way as the Jews
   merited. And since he is to have another name, He shall also appoint
   another name, that so the Jews may receive him as if he were the
   Christ. Says Daniel: "He shall not know the lust of women, although
   before he was most impure, and he shall know no God of his fathers: for
   he will not be able to seduce the people of the circumcision, unless he
   is a judge of the law." [2309] Finally, also, he will recall the
   saints, not to the worship of idols, but to undertake circumcision,
   and, if he is able, to seduce any; for he shall so conduct himself as
   to be called Christ by them. But that he rises again from hell, we have
   said above in the word of Isaiah: "Water shall nourish him, and hell
   hath increased him;" who, however, must come with name unchanged, and
   doings unchanged, as says the Spirit.

   upon him, sets forth our Lord coming to His kingdom with the heavenly
   army. Because from the sea of the north, which is the Arabian Sea, even
   to the sea of Phoenice, and even to the ends of the earth, they will
   command these greater parts in the coming of the Lord Jesus, and all
   the souls of the nations will be assembled to judgment.
     __________________________________________________________________

    from the twentieth chapter.

   1-3. "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the
   abyss, and a chain in his hand. And he held the dragon, that old
   serpent, which is called the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a
   thousand years, and cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and set a
   seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the
   thousand years should be finished: after this he must be loosed a
   little season."] Those years wherein Satan is bound are in the first
   advent of Christ, even to the end of the age; and they are called a
   thousand, according to that mode of speaking, wherein a part is
   signified by the whole, just as is that passage, "the word which He
   commanded for a thousand generations," [2310] although they are not a
   thousand. Moreover that he says, "and he cast him into the abyss," he
   says this, because the devil, excluded from the hearts of believers,
   began to take possession of the wicked, in whose hearts, blinded day by
   day, he is shut up as if in a profound abyss. And he shut him up, says
   he, and put a seal upon him, that he should not deceive the nations
   until the thousand years should be finished. "He shut the door upon
   him," it is said, that is, he forbade and restrained his seducing those
   who belong to Christ. Moreover, he put a seal upon him, because it is
   hidden who belong to the side of the devil, and who to that of Christ.
   For we know not of those who seem to stand whether they shall not fall,
   and of those who are down it is uncertain whether they may rise.
   Moreover, that he says that he is bound and shut up, that he may not
   seduce the nations, the nations signify the Church, seeing that of them
   it itself is formed, and which being seduced, he previously held until,
   he says, the thousand years should be completed, that is, what is left
   of the sixth day, to wit, of the sixth age, which subsists for a
   thousand years; after this he must be loosed for a little season. The
   little season signifies three years and six months, in which with all
   his power the devil will avenge himself under Antichrist against the
   Church. Finally, he says, after that the devil shall be loosed, and
   will seduce the nations in the whole world, and will entice war against
   the Church, the number of whose foes shall be as the sand of the sea.
   [2311]

   4, 5. "And I saw thrones, and them that sat upon them, and judgment was
   given unto them; and I saw the souls of them that were slain on account
   of the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not
   worshipped the beast nor his image, nor have received his writing on
   their forehead or in their hand; and they reigned with Christ for a
   thousand years: the rest of them lived not again until the thousand
   years were finished. This is the first resurrection."] There are two
   resurrections. But the first resurrection is now of the souls that are
   by the faith, which does not permit men to pass over to the second
   death. Of this resurrection the apostle says: "If ye have risen with
   Christ, seek those things which are above." [2312]

   6. "Blessed and holy is he who has part in this resurrection: on them
   the second death shall have no power, but they shall be priests of God
   and Christ, and they shall reign with Him a thousand years."] I do not
   think the reign of a thousand years is eternal; or if it is thus to be
   thought of, they cease to reign when the thousand years are finished.
   But I will put forward what my capacity enables me to judge. The
   tenfold number signifies the decalogue, and the hundredfold sets forth
   the crown of virginity: for he who shall have kept the undertaking of
   virginity completely, and shall have faithfully fulfilled the precepts
   of the decalogue, and shall have destroyed the untrained nature or
   impure thoughts within the retirement of the heart, that they may not
   rule over him, this is the true priest of Christ, and accomplishing the
   millenary number thoroughly, is thought to reign with Christ; and truly
   in his case the devil is bound. But he who is entangled in the vices
   and the dogmas of heretics, in his case the devil is loosed. But that
   it says that when the thousand years are finished he is loosed, so the
   number of the perfect saints being completed, in whom there is the
   glory of virginity in body and mind, by the approaching advent of the
   kingdom of the hateful one, many, seduced by that love of earthly
   things, shall be overthrown, and together with him shall enter the lake
   of fire.

   8-10. "And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and compassed
   the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city; and fire came down
   from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil who seduced
   them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where both the beast
   and the false prophet shall be tormented day and night for ever and
   ever."] This belongs to the last judgment. And after a little time the
   earth was made holy, as being at least that wherein lately had reposed
   the bodies of the virgins, when they shall enter upon an eternal
   kingdom with an immortal King, as they who are not only virgins in
   body, but, moreover, with equal inviolability have protected
   themselves, both in tongue and thought, from wickedness; and these, it
   shows, shall dwell in rejoicing for ever with the Lamb.

    from the twenty-first and twenty-second chapters.

   16. "And the city is placed in a square."] The city which he says is
   squared, he says also is resplendent with gold and precious stones, and
   has a sacred street, and a river through the midst of it, and the tree
   of life on either side, bearing twelve manner of fruits throughout the
   twelve months; and that the light of the sun is not there, because the
   Lamb is the light of it; and that its gates were of single pearls; and
   that there were three gates on each of the four sides, and that they
   could not be shut. I say, in respect of the square city, he shows forth
   the united multitude of the saints, in whom the faith could by no means
   waver. As Noah is commanded to make the ark of squared beams, [2313]
   that it might resist the force of the deluge, by the precious stones he
   sets forth the holy men who cannot waver in persecution, who could not
   be moved either by the tempest of persecutors, or be dissolved from the
   true faith by the force of the rain, because they are associated of
   pure gold, of whom the city of the great King is adorned. Moreover, the
   streets set forth their hearts purified from all uncleanness,
   transparent with glowing light, that the Lord may justly walk up and
   down in them. The river of life sets forth that the grace of spiritual
   doctrine flowed through the minds of the faithful, and that manifold
   flourishing forms of odours germinated therein. The tree of life on
   either bank sets forth the Advent of Christ, according to the flesh,
   who satisfied the peoples wasted with famine, that received life from
   One by the wood of the Cross, with the announcement of God's word. And
   in that he says that the sun is not necessary in the city, he shows,
   evidently, that the Creator as the immaculate light shines in the midst
   of it, whose brightness no mind has been able to conceive, nor tongue
   to tell.

   In that he says there are three gates placed on each of the four sides,
   of single pearls, I think that these are the four virtues, [2314] to
   wit, prudence, fortitude, justice, temperance, which are associated
   with one another. And, being involved together, they make the number
   twelve. But the twelve gates we believe to be the number of the
   apostles, who, shining in the four virtues as precious stones,
   manifesting the light of their doctrine among the saints, cause it to
   enter the celestial city, that by intercourse with them the choir of
   angels may be gladdened. And that the gates cannot be shut, it is
   evidently shown that the doctrine of the apostles can be separated from
   rectitude by no tempest of contradiction. Even though the floods of the
   nations and the vain superstitions of heretics should revolt against
   their true faith, they are overcome, and shall be dissolved as the
   foam, because Christ is the Rock [2315] by which, and on which, the
   Church is founded. [2316] And thus it is overcome by no traces of
   maddened men. Therefore they are not to be heard who assure themselves
   that there is to be an earthly reign of a thousand years; who think,
   that is to say, with the heretic Cerinthus. [2317] For the kingdom of
   Christ is now eternal in the saints, although the glory of the saints
   shall be manifested after the resurrection.

    GENERAL NOTES BY THE AMERICAN EDITOR

   1. The whole subject of the Apocalypse is so treated, [2318] in the
   Speaker's Commentary, as to elucidate many questions suggested by the
   primitive commentators of this series, and to furnish the latest
   judgments of critics on the subject. It is so immense a matter,
   however, as to render annotations on patristic specialties impossible
   in a work like this. Every reader must feel how apposite is the
   sententious saying of Augustine: "Apocalypsis Joannis tot sacramenta
   quot verba."

   2. The seven spirits, [230]p. 344, ver. 4. That is, the one Spirit in
   His seven-fold gifts. He now fulfills the promise of Christ, "He shall
   show you things to come." Without this complement the Church would lack
   assurance that her great Head upon the throne has ordered and limited
   the whole course of this world for her conflicts and her final triumph
   by the Spirit's power. St. John's rapture was the Spirit's work: "I was
   in the Spirit on the Lord's day." [2319] The whole Apocalypse is an
   Easter sermon (on the text, i. 18) and an Easter song (vers. 9-14, and
   passim). It supplements the appearances of the risen Redeemer for
   identification, by a manifestation, which is the Church's assurance of
   His glorification, and of His perpetual work in her and for her, as
   well as of His presence with her, by the Spirit.

   3. Seven golden candlesticks, [231]p. 344, ver. 12. The symbol of the
   seven-fold Spirit in the Church. On the Arch of Titus this symbol had
   just been set up as proof of its removal from the Mosaic Church. It is
   now found to be transferred to the "seven churches," a symbol of the
   Catholic Church [2320] or the "communion of saints." The threatening of
   removal from particular churches derives force from the (then) recent
   removal out of Jerusalem.

   4. All the Saints shall assemble, [232]p. 345, ver. 15. Our author
   clings to the purer Chiliasm of Commodian, to which Augustine had now
   given the death-blow by his famous retraction. [2321]

   5. New forms of prophesying, [233]p. 347, ver.17. A retrospective
   glance at Montanism, and a caveat against the mistakes of Tertullian.

   6. I will vomit thee, [234]p. 347, ver. 17. Bishop Wordsworth suggests,
   that, if the canon of Scripture compiled by the church of Laodicea
   lacks the Apocalypse, its terrible reproof of that church may have
   influenced its unwillingness to accept it. Accordingly she was vomited,
   and perished in the Saracen invasion.

   7. That is the Spirit, [235]p. 348, ver. 1. Christ's divine nature as
   distinguished from his flesh. [2322] "In a word," says Professor
   Milligan, [2323] "pneuma is a short expression for our Lord's
   resurrection state." A truth, but based on the distinction between the
   flesh of Christ and His spiritual nature as the Word. See Tertullian,
   [2324] vol. iii. p. 609, [236]note 5, and p. 610, [237]note 5: also 2
   Cor. iii. 17-18.

   8. The genealogy of Mary, [238]p. 348, vers. 7-10. It is remarkable
   that St. Matthew should be credited with this, and not St. Luke, who in
   the sixteenth century [2325] began to be regarded as giving the
   ancestry of Mary. See Africanus [2326] on the subject, and my
   elucidation, [2327] in which I followed Wordsworth. Though I had
   already prepared the pages of Victorinus for the press, I failed to
   note at that time this modification of the general truth, that
   antiquity regards both genealogies as those of Joseph.

   9. Dan himself, [239]p. 349, ver. 8. Here is a touch of Chiliasm again,
   i.e., of the better sort. Even Dan is promised a restoration: and the
   use of Gen. xlix. 16 for that intent is noteworthy, as compared with
   Rev. vii. 5-8, where Dan is omitted. But Hippolytus takes a very
   different view of the same text. [2328]

   10. Hades, [240]p. 351. "A region withdrawn from punishment and fires,"
   says our author. He identifies it with paradise, and shows that in his
   day the Latin churches knew of no purgatorial fires. He knows of
   nothing but a place for those "who die in the Lord," and a place for
   the wicked. It is perpetually overlooked, that, in the fiction of
   "purgatory," it is only the righteous who are entitled to it: none but
   those dying in full communion with the Church having any portion in it,
   or any title to Masses for their repose. Of all this our author had no
   conception. [2329]

   11. To take the book and eat it up, [241]p. 353, ver. 10. We must not
   fail to note with this the passage Jer. xv. 16, where the Revised
   Version pedantically sacrifices the Septuagint reading, ho logos sou,
   (which is followed by the Vulgate), distinguishing "sermones tui" from
   "Verbum tuum." The Seventy have testified to this distinction in their
   day, and their copies of the Hebrew must have supported it. So
   understood, what riches in the text of Jeremiah!

   12. Thessalonians, [242]p. 354, ver. 7. On which much that is
   suggestive is said by St. Augustine, though he confesses, concerning
   what St. Paul had said to the Thessalonians, "Ego prorsus quid dixerit
   me fateor ignorare." See De Civ. Dei, lib. xx. cap. 19, p. 685, ed.
   Migne.

   13. The woman, [243]p. 355, ver. 1. Compare vol. vi. p. 337, [244]note
   4, and Elucidation II. [245]p. 355. It is quite important to observe
   the voice of antiquity on a matter which, in our own times, has been
   made a stumbling-block to souls by a wanton, personal act of the Bishop
   of Rome and his dogma of the "Immaculate Conception."

   14. The hope of those that sleep, [246]p. 355, ver. 1. To make our
   author consistent with himself (see note 10, supra), we should read
   thus: "But they have in their darkness a light (some think) such as the
   moon." Here, however, it seems to me, he is giving his mind to "the
   Church of Fathers and Prophets" exclusively, in which its "saints and
   apostles" were for a time waiting and looking for the Man-child. Even
   that Church of the Hebrews had, in Hades, light "like that of the
   moon," where they reposed in Abraham's bosom; but Christ removed them
   into a fairer region, i.e., Paradise, when He illuminated Hades, and
   then became "the first-fruits of them that slept." Such seems to be the
   sense.

   15. In a certain Greek codex, [247]p. 357, ver. 18. Can antemos here be
   a reference to Anthemius, of the kindred of Julian (d. a.d. 472)? His
   history, mixed up with that of Ricimer, connects with Genseric, who
   died a.d. 477.

   16. Sea of the north, [248]p. 358, ver. 11. The Mediterranean, near
   Mount Carmel, is "the sea of Phoenice," I suppose: but how the Arabian
   Gulf can be called the sea of the north, I do not comprehend. As Routh
   says, the manuscripts must have been much corrupted.

   17. Two resurrections, [249]p. 359, ver. 5. Here our author, who is
   supposed to be the contemporary of St. Augustine, accepts his final
   judgment. [2330] But Victorinus was a Chiliast of the better sort,
   according to St. Jerome. This confirms the corruption of the mss.
   Indeed, if the Victorinus mentioned by Jerome be the same as our
   author, the mention of Genseric proves the subsequent interpolation of
   his works.

   18. It is evident that the fragment which is here preserved, if,
   indeed, it be the work of Caius Marius Victorinus, surnamed Afer, is
   full of the corrections of some pious disciple of St. Augustine who
   lived much later. The reader must consult Lardner, [2331] and compare
   Routh, whose notes on this treatise are indeed few. He does not think
   the reference to abbots [2332] of any consequence in determining its
   age, because he finds albatorum elsewhere sustained as the true
   reading, i.e., those "made white in the blood of the Lamb." But the
   great probability that there were two authors of the name living in
   different ages seems more than suspected by the learned. Dupin, who
   calls him Marius without the Caius (changed to Fabius by the English
   translator), leaves one yet more in a mist as to the identity of our
   author with the one he writes about.

                                   Dionysius.

     __________________________________________________________________


  INTRODUCTORY NOTICE

        TO

DIONYSIUS, BISHOP OF ROME.

   [a.d. 259-269.] Dionysius is no exception to the rule that Latin
   Christianity had no place in Rome till after the Nicene Council. He was
   a Greek by birth, and reflects the spirit and orthodoxy of the Greek
   Fathers; and what we have from him is written in the Greek language. We
   find it in Athanasius, where, remarks Waterland, [2333] its genuineness
   cannot be suspected, because "Athanasius did not entirely approve of
   it, and would certainly never have forged an interpretation different
   from his own." He concurred with the Easterns in the discipline of Paul
   of Samosata. Waterland says of the following fragment: "It is of
   admirable use for showing the doctrine of the Trinity as professed by
   the Church of Christ at that time."

   The purely receptive character of the Roman See during the Ante-Nicene
   period must be sufficiently apparent to the possessors of the volumes
   of this series. Until after the Council of Nice, as a Roman pontiff has
   testified, she was unfelt in the churches as a teaching church. [2334]
   Irenæus has justly stated her case: as the focus of the empire, she was
   the natural center of exchange and social commerce among all nations.
   Thither all Christians converged, and there at all times might be found
   representatives of all the churches,--those of Gaul and Britain; those
   of Asia Minor and Syria; those of Alexandria and Egypt; those of North
   Africa, where Latin Christianity had begun to exist, and where it had
   reached a vigorous maturity at the Nicene period. Hence, from all these
   churches came into Rome a Catholic testimony, which was thus preserved
   at the metropolis by the pressure from without.

   This is the fact which gives importance to the earliest dogmatic
   testimony proceeding from the See of Rome. [2335] Dionysius has the
   great distinction of sustaining the orthodoxy which Hippolytus and
   other comprovincial bishops had established against the heresy of two
   of his predecessors; and this little essay, embedded in the works of
   Athanasius, comes forth as a genuine "bee" out of his precious amber,
   sweet with the honey of truth, and pungent with the sting of an acute
   and piercing testimony against error.

   For the necessary preface to this essay or synodical letter, the reader
   must turn to the history of Dionysius of Alexandria, surnamed the
   Great, and to the letters he wrote to his namesake of Rome. [2336] For
   a complete view of the whole matter, and for the originals of both
   these great prelates, the student will not fail to consult Routh.
   [2337] Athanasius, the touchstone of orthodoxy, does not altogether
   commend the idioms of either; but he sustains the essential orthodoxy
   of both with that vast sweep of genius which could insist upon Nicene
   idioms after the council, but sustain those who, in defective language,
   fought previously for essential truth.

   For a just view of Novatian and of the orthodoxy of Rome in the times
   of Dionysius, as that unhappy but competent witness sets it forth, the
   reader would do well to consult Dr. Waterland. [2338] For a vindication
   of the Alexandrian Dionysius, to whom his contemporaries gave the
   surname Magnus, see the same lucid expounder of antiquity. [2339] For a
   sententious statement of the subordination of the Son, on which so much
   hinges in these inquiries, consult the same theologian. [2340]

   I might have suffixed this essay to the works of the great Dionysius
   but for several important considerations: (1) I was glad to give due
   prominence to this exceptional voice from old Rome, and to place
   Dionysius with due dignity before the reader; (2) as the Bishop of Rome
   was without a hearing at Nicæa, I was anxious to show what good
   Sylvester would have said had he been able to attend the council; (3) I
   was not willing, therefore, to hide this writer's light under the
   bushel of the pages devoted to the Alexandrian school; (4) I was
   anxious to close this important volume by a just exhibition of the
   Ante-Nicene doctrine, previous to the compilation of the Great Symbol;
   (5) I considered it judicious to elucidate Dionysius by the doctrines
   of Athanasius, to whom we owe the preservation of the fragment itself;
   and (6) I felt that here was the place to record the "Athanasian
   Confession" (so called), which, apocryphal though it be, as a "creed"
   under his name is allowed to embody the principles for which the whole
   life of Athanasius was a contest unparalleled in the history of
   Christianity.

  Against the Sabellians. [2341]

   1 Now truly it would be just to dispute against those who, by dividing
   and rending the monarchy, which is the most august announcement of the
   Church of God, into, as it were, three powers, and distinct substances
   (hypostases), and three deities, destroy it. [2342] For I have heard
   that some who preach and teach the word of God among you are teachers
   of this opinion, who indeed diametrically, so to speak, are opposed to
   the opinion of Sabellius. For he blasphemes in saying that the Son
   Himself is the Father, and vice versa; but these in a certain manner
   announce three gods, in that they divide the holy unity into three
   different substances, absolutely separated from one another. For it is
   essential that the Divine Word should be united to the God of all, and
   that the Holy Spirit should abide and dwell in God; and thus that the
   Divine Trinity should be reduced and gathered into one, as if into a
   certain head--that is, into the omnipotent God of all. For the doctrine
   of the foolish Marcion, which cuts and divides the monarchy into three
   elements, is assuredly of the devil, and is not of Christ's true
   disciples, or of those to whom the Saviour's teaching is agreeable. For
   these indeed rightly know that the Trinity is declared in the divine
   Scripture, but that the doctrine that there are three gods is neither
   taught in the Old nor in the New Testament.

   2 But neither are they less to be blamed who think that the Son was a
   creation, and decided that the Lord was made just as one of those
   things which really were made; whereas the divine declarations testify
   that He was begotten, as is fitting and proper, but not that He was
   created or made. It is therefore not a trifling, but a very great
   impiety, to say that the Lord was in any wise made with hands. For if
   the Son was made, there was a time when He was not; but He always was,
   if, as He Himself declares, [2343] He is undoubtedly in the Father. And
   if Christ is the Word, the Wisdom, and the Power,--for the divine
   writings tell us that Christ is these, as ye yourselves
   know,--assuredly these are powers of God. Wherefore, if the Son was
   made, there was a time when these were not in existence; [2344] and
   thus there was a time when God was without these things, which is
   utterly absurd. But why should I discourse at greater length to you
   about these matters, since ye are men filled with the Spirit, and
   especially understanding what absurd results follow from the opinion
   which asserts that the Son was made? The leaders of this view seem to
   me to have given very little heed to these things, and for that reason
   to have strayed absolutely, by explaining the passage otherwise than as
   the divine and prophetic Scripture demands. "The Lord created me the
   beginning of His ways." [2345] For, as ye know, there is more than one
   signification of the word "created;" and in this place "created" is the
   same as "set over" the works made by Himself--made, I say, by the Son
   Himself. But this "created" is not to be understood in the same manner
   as "made." For to make and to create are different from one another.
   "Is not He Himself thy Father, that hath possessed thee and created
   thee?" [2346] says Moses in the great song of Deuteronomy. And thus
   might any one reasonably convict these men. Oh reckless and rash men!
   was then "the first-born of every creature" [2347] something made?--"He
   who was begotten from the womb before the morning star?" [2348] --He
   who in the person of Wisdom says, "Before all the hills He begot me?"
   [2349] Finally, any one may read in many parts of the divine utterances
   that the Son is said to have been begotten, but never that He was made.
   From which considerations, they who dare to say that His divine and
   inexplicable generation was a creation, are openly convicted of
   thinking that which is false concerning the generation of the Lord.

   3 That admirable and divine unity, therefore, must neither be separated
   into three divinities, nor must the dignity and eminent greatness of
   the Lord be diminished by having applied to it the name of creation,
   but we must believe on God the Father Omnipotent, and on Christ Jesus
   His Son, and on the Holy Spirit. Moreover, that the Word is united to
   the God of all, because He says, "I and the Father are one;" [2350]
   and, "I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me." [2351] Thus
   doubtless will be maintained in its integrity the doctrine of the
   divine Trinity, and the sacred announcement of the monarchy.
     __________________________________________________________________

    elucidations.

    I.

   The Confession, improperly called the "Creed of Athanasius," is
   acknowledged to embody the (Athanasian) doctrine of the Nicene Council;
   and I append it here as an index to the state of theology at the period
   which is the limit of our series. Nothing is properly a "creed" which
   has never been accepted as such by the whole Church, and the Greeks
   knew no other creed than that called Nicene. The Anglo-American Church
   has ceased to recite this Confession in public worship, but does not
   depart from it as doctrine. The "Reformed" communion in America [2352]
   retains it among her liturgical forms, and I suppose the same is true
   of the Lutherans. It is a Western Confession, and, like the Te Deum, is
   a hymn rather than a symbol, though breathing the spirit of the Creed.

   Usher adopts a.d. 447 as its date, and Beveridge assigns it to the
   fourth century. Dupin gives it a later origin than Usher, and a
   considerable number of eminent authorities agree with him in the date
   a.d. 484.

   What are called the anathemas are the enacting clauses (so to speak),
   and, like the same in the Nicene Creed, may be regarded as no part of
   the Confession itself. If they have disappeared from the Great Symbol
   itself, as unsuitable to liturgical recitation, why not apply the same
   rule here?

    confession of our christian faith, commonly called the creed of st.
    athanasius.

   Quicunque vult.

   ¶ Whosoever will be saved: before all things it is necessary that he
   hold the Catholick Faith. Which Faith except everyone do keep whole and
   undefiled: without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.

    i.

   And the Catholick Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity,
   and Trinity in Unity;

   Neither confounding the Persons: nor dividing the Substance.

   For there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son: and another
   of the Holy Ghost.

   But the God-head of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is
   all one: the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.

   Such as the Father is, such is the Son: and such is the Holy Ghost.

   The Father un-create, the Son un-create: and the Holy Ghost un-create.

   The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible: and the Holy
   Ghost incomprehensible.

   The Father eternal, the Son eternal: and the Holy Ghost eternal.

   And yet they are not three eternals: but one eternal.

   As also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three un-created:
   but one un-created, and one incomprehensible.

   So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty: and the Holy
   Ghost Almighty.

   And yet they are not three Almighties: but one Almighty.

   So the Father is God, the Son is God: and the Holy Ghost is God.

   And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.

   So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord: and the Holy Ghost is
   Lord.

   And yet not three Lords: but one Lord.

   For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity: to acknowledge
   every Person by Himself to be God and Lord;

   So we are forbidden by the Catholick Religion: to say, there be three
   Gods, or three Lords.

   The Father is made of none: neither created, nor begotten.

   The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but begotten.

   The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son: [2353] neither made,
   nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.

   So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons: one
   Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.

   And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other: none is greater, or
   less than another;

   But the whole three Persons are co-eternal together: and co-equal.

   So that in all things, as is aforesaid: the Unity in Trinity, and the
   Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped.

   ¶ He therefore that will be saved: must thus think of the Trinity.

    ii.

   Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation: that he also
   believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;

   God, of the Substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds: and
   Man, of the Substance of His Mother, born in the world;

   Perfect God, and perfect Man: of a reasonable soul and human flesh
   subsisting;

   Equal to the Father, as touching His God-head: and inferior to the
   Father, as touching His Manhood.

   Who although He be God and Man: yet He is not two, but one Christ;

   One; not by conversion of the God-head into flesh: but by taking of the
   Manhood into God;

   One altogether; not by confusion of Substance: but by unity of Person.

   For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man: so God and Man is one
   Christ;

   Who suffered for our Salvation: descended into hell, rose again the
   third day from the dead.

   He ascended into heaven, He sitteth on the right hand of the Father,
   God Almighty: from whence He shall come to judge the quick and the
   dead.

   At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies: and shall
   give account for their own works.

   And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and they
   that have done evil into everlasting fire.

    ¶ This is the Catholick Faith: which except a man believe faithfully,
   he cannot be saved.

    ii.

   It is with regret that I am forced to take exception to the most useful
   Ecclesiastical History of the learned Professor Schaff, in this
   connection. I quote from that work [2354] as follows:--

   "He, Dionysius, maintained distinctly, in (a) controversy with
   Dionysius of Alexandria, at once the unity of essence and the real
   personal distinction, etc., . . . and avoided tritheism, Sabellianism,
   and (b) subordination, with the instinct of orthodoxy, and also with
   the art of anathematizing, (c) already familiar to (d) the popes."

   Such a paragraph must convey to the youthful student a great confusion
   of ideas; all the greater, because the same valuable work elsewhere
   invites him to conclusions quite the reverse. Thus, (a) there was no
   controversy whatever between the two Dionysii; with a holy jealousy
   they entered into fraternal explanations of the same truth, held by
   each, but by neither very technically elucidated. The mere reader would
   probably infer that the greater of the two was guilty of tritheism or
   Sabellianism, although that is not the meaning of these unguarded
   expressions. But (b) the "subordinationism" which he repudiated was the
   doctrine of the subjection of the Son, not of the subordination, which
   orthodoxy has always maintained. Again, (c) I see no such
   "anathematizing" in the letter of Dionysius as is here charged; indeed,
   it contains no anathema [2355] whatever, much less the artificial
   cursing of the Papacy which is thus assumed. And last, (d) what can be
   meant by the expression, "already familiar to the popes?" The learned
   pages of the same author sufficiently prove that there were no such
   things [2356] as "popes" till a much later period of history; and, as
   to the "art of anathematizing," if it existed at all in those days, we
   find it much more freely exemplified by the Greek Fathers than by
   bishops of Rome. I say, if it existed at all, because the primitive
   anathema was a purely scriptural enforcement of St. Paul's great canon
   (Gal. i. 8, 9); while the "art of anathematizing," so justly credited
   to "the popes," was a vindictive and monstrous assertion, at a later
   date, of prerogatives which they impiously arrogated to themselves,
   against other churches.

  THE TEACHING OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES.

  Introductory Notice

        To

The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.

   ____________________

   The interest so generally excited in the learned world by the
   ("Bryennios") discovery of a very primitive document, rendered it
   indispensable that this republication should be enriched by it, in
   connection with the Apostolic Constitutions (so called), which had been
   reserved for the concluding volume of the series. The critics were
   greatly divided as to the genuineness of the Bryennios ms ; and, in
   order to gain time, I had relegated the Constitutions, with this
   document as its sequel or its preface, to a place with the Apocrypha
   Dissatisfied with my own impressions and conjectures, I soon decided
   that the task of editing the Teaching, as the Bryennios document is
   entitled, must be entrusted to an "expert," and that, if possible, it
   should be taken in hand with the Constitutions In order to give
   sufficient time, I entrusted the task, a year ago, to the
   well-qualified head and hands of Professor Riddle of Hartford, who most
   kindly accepted my proposals, and who now enables me to present his
   completed work to the public with the volume to which it properly
   belongs. It will be hailed by literary men generally as a timely
   reviewal of the whole subject, nor should I be surprised to find Dr.
   Riddle's estimate of the Teaching accepted as the most important
   contribution yet made to the literature of inquiry touching its worth
   and character. Appearing, as it does in this place, in close relations
   with the Constitutions, and with the editorial comparisons so
   felicitously introduced by the learned annotator, the student will find
   himself in a position to weigh and to decide for himself all the
   questions that have been raised in previous examinations of the case.
   Without risking any judgment of my own upon the decisions which have
   been reached by Dr. Riddle in the exercise of his great critical skill,
   I cannot withhold an expression of gratitude for the impartiality and
   scientific conscientiousness with which he has handled the matter.
   Uninfluenced by prepossessions, he presents the case with judicial
   calmness and with due consideration of what others have suggested. I am
   gratified to find that impressions of my own are strengthened by his
   conclusions. In an early notice of the Bryennios discovery, contributed
   to a leading publication, I stated my surmise that the Teaching, and
   its parallels in the Constitutions and other primitive writings, would
   prove to be based upon some original document, common to all. Even
   Lactantius, in his Institutes, shapes his instructions to Constantine
   by the Duoe Vioe, which seem to have been formulated in the earliest
   ages for the training of catechumens. The elementary nature and the
   "childishness" of the work are thus accounted for, and I am sure that
   the "mystagogic" teaching of Cyril receives light from this view of the
   matter. This work was "food for lambs:" it was not meant to meet the
   wants of those "of full age." It may prove, as Dr. Riddle hints, that
   the Teaching as we have it, in the Bryennios document, is tainted by
   the views of some nascent sect or heresy, or by the incompetency of
   some obscure local church as yet unvisited by learned teachers and
   evangelists. It seems to me not improbably influenced by views of the
   charismata, which ripened into Montanism, and which are illustrated by
   the warnings and admonitions of Hermas. [2357]

   Notes," are bracketed when they illustrate any other text except that

   Professor Riddle's work, as well as to that of the Edinburgh
   translator's.

    section 1.--the discovery of the codex, and its contents.

   In 1873 Philotheos Bryennios, then Head Master of the higher Greek
   school at Constantinople, but now Metropolitan of Nicomedia, discovered
   a remarkable collection of manuscripts in the library of the Jerusalem
   Monastery of the Most Holy Sepulchre at Constantinople. This collection
   is bound in one volume, and written by the same hand. It is signed
   "Leon, notary and sinner," and bears the Greek date of 6564 = a.d.
   1056. There is no reason to doubt the age of the manuscripts. The
   documents have been examined by Professor Albert L. Long of Robert
   College, Constantinople; [2358] and some of the pages, reproduced by
   photography, were published by the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
   April, 1885. The jealousy of its guardians does not imply any lack of
   confidence in the age and value of the Codex. The contents of the 120
   folios (240 pp.) are as follows:--

   I.

       Synopsis of the Old and New Testaments, by St. Chrysostom (fol. 1-32).

   II.

       The Epistle of Barnabas (fol. 33-51b).

   III.

       The two Epistles of Clement to the Corinthians (fol. 51b-76a).

   IV.

       The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (fol. 76a-80).

   V.

       The Epistle of Mary of Cassoboli to Ignatius (fol. 81-82a).

   VI.

       Twelve Epistles of Ignatius (fol. 82a-120a).

   The last part of fol. 120a contains the signature and date; then
   follows an account of the genealogy of Joseph, continued on the other
   page of the leaf.

   Schaff (p. 6) gives a facsimile of fol. 120a.

   Of these, I. supplies some unpublished portions, and furnishes matter
   for textual criticism. II. gives the second Greek copy of Barnabas,
   also furnishing new readings. III. is very valuable; the text of both
   Epistles is now complete. Two-fifths of that of the second was
   previously unknown. [2359] The value for purposes of textual criticism
   is also great. IV. is the Teaching, the value of which is discussed
   below. V. and VI. both belong to the Ignatian literature, and furnish
   new readings, which have already appeared in the editions of Funk
   (Opera Patr. Apost., ii., Tübingen, 1881) and Lightfoot (Epistles of
   St. Ignatius, London and Cambridge, 1885).

    section 2.--publication of the discovered works: the effect.

   In 1875 Bryennios, who had been chosen Metropolitan of Serræ during his
   absence at the Old Catholic conference in Bonn, published at
   Constantinople the two Epistles of Clement, with prolegomena and notes;
   giving the text found in the Jerusalem Codex, as he termed it. All
   patristic scholars welcomed his work, which bore every mark of care and
   learning; showing the results of his contact, as a student, with German
   methods. Bishop Lightfoot and many others at once made use of this new
   material. The remaining contents of the Codex were named in the volume
   of Bryennios, and some interest awakened by the mention of the
   Teaching. The learned Metropolitan furnished new readings from other
   parts of the Codex to German scholars. At the close of 1883 he
   published in Constantinople the text of the Teaching, with prolegomena
   and notes. A copy of the volume was received in Germany in January,
   1884; was translated into German, and published Feb. 3, 1884;
   translated from German into English, and published in America, Feb. 28,
   1884; Archdeacon Farrar published (Contemporary Review) a version from
   the Greek in May, 1884. Before the close of the year the literature on
   the subject, exclusive of newspaper articles, covered fifty titles
   (given by Schaff) in Western Europe and America. [2360]

     __________________________________________________________________

    section 3.--contents of teaching, and relation to other works.

   In the Babel of conflicting opinions, it is best to notice first the
   obvious internal phenomena. The first part of the Teaching (now
   distinguished as chaps. i.-vi.) sets forth the duty of the Christian;
   in chaps. vii.-x., xiv., we find a directory for worship; chaps.
   xi.-xiii., xv., give advice respecting church officers, extraordinary
   and local, and the reception of Christians; the closing chapter (xvi.)
   enjoins watchfulness in view of the coming of Christ, which is then
   described.

   The amount of matter is not so great as that of the Sermon on the
   Mount.

   The peculiarities of language are marked, but can only be indicated
   here in footnotes. They point to a period of transition from
   New-Testament usage to that of ecclesiastical Greek. The citations from
   the Scriptures resemble those of the Apostolic Fathers. The Gospel of
   Matthew is most frequently used, especially chaps. v.-vii. and xxiv.;
   but some of the passages fairly imply a knowledge of the Gospel of
   Luke. There are some remarkable correspondences with expressions and
   thoughts found in the Gospel of John, while there is good reason for
   inferring the writer's acquaintance with all the groups of Pauline
   Epistles. His allusions to the other New-Testament books are less
   marked. There is nothing to prove that he did not know all of our
   canonical books. If an early date is accepted, the tone of the whole
   opposes the tendency-theory of the Tübingen school.

   The most striking internal phenomena are, however, the correspondences
   of this document with early Christian writings, from a.d. 125 to the
   fourth century. With the so-called Epistle to Barnabas, chaps.
   xviii.-xx., the resemblances are so marked as to demand a critical
   theory which can account for them. A few passages in the Shepherd of
   Hermas show some resemblance; but only two sentences, in Commandment
   Second, are verbally the same. There is a still greater agreement with
   the so-called Apostolical Church Order, of Egyptian origin, probably as
   old as the third century. It is now known in the Coptic (Memphitic),
   and also in Arabic and Greek. [2361] The first thirteen canons
   correspond quite closely, both in order and words, with chaps. i.-iv.
   of the Teaching

   Most noteworthy, however, is the parallel with the Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 1-32, which contain more than half the Teaching, in
   precisely the same order, with very close verbal resemblances. The
   parts omitted are in most cases such as had lost their pertinence in
   the fourth century, while they seem appropriate to a much earlier
   period. The details will be found in the footnotes to the Teaching in
   this volume. These phenomena have called forth voluminous discussions,
   and are the most important facts in determining the authenticity and
   age of the Teaching
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2361] The Church Order is to be distinguished from the Ethiopic
   collection of Apostolic canons; see Introductory Notice to Apostolic
   Constitutions.
     __________________________________________________________________

    section 4.--authenticity.

   By this is meant, in this case, the substantial identity of the
   recently discovered document with the work known and referred to by
   early Christian writers under the same (or a similar) title. Of
   apostolic origin no one should presume to speak, since the text of the
   document makes no such claim, and internal evidence is obviously
   against such a suggestion. On the other hand, there is no reason for
   doubting the age of the Codex, or the accuracy of the edition published
   by Bryennios.

   Eusebius (d. 340) of Cæsarea, in the famous passage of his history
   (iii. 25) which treats of the canonical books of the New Testament,
   names among the "spurious" works (nothoi) "the so-called Teachings of
   the Apostles" (ton aposto'lon hai lego'menai didachai'). The plural
   form does not forbid a reference to the work under discussion, since
   Athanasius (d. 373) has a notice clearly pointing to the same writing,
   in which he uses the singular (Festal Epistle, 39). Rufinus (d. 410)
   speaks of a brief work called The Two Ways, or The Judgment of Peter;
   and this fact, in view of the contents of the Teaching, furnishes one
   of the most important data for the critical discussion. The last notice
   of the Teaching was made by Nicephorus (d. 828) more than two hundred
   years before Leon made this copy. Clement of Alexandria (d. circa 216)
   and Irenæus (mart. 202) use expressions that may indicate an
   acquaintance with this writing. The more extended correspondences with
   Barnabas and later disciplinary works are noticed above (sec. 3). The
   existence of an old Latin translation of the Teaching, of the tenth
   century, a fragment of which has been preserved, furnishes general
   evidence to the authenticity of the Greek copy, but by its variations
   suggests the presence of many textual corruptions. Its closer
   correspondence with Barnabas has led to the theory that the translator
   used both documents. Others suppose that its form points to a document
   which was the common source of the Greek form of the Teaching and of
   Barnabas.

   The various theories based on the above facts cannot even be stated.
   The following positions seem, on the whole, most tenable:--

   1. The Greek Codex presents substantially the writing referred to by
   Eusebius and Athanasius.

   2. Owing to an absence of other copies, we cannot determine the purity
   of the text; but there is every probability of many minor corruptions.

   3. This probability calls for care that we do not infer too much from
   verbal resemblances.

   4. The resemblances to book vii., Apostolic Constitutions, are,
   however, of such a character as establish, not only a literary
   connection between the two works, but also the priority of the Teaching

   5. In the case of Barnabas, the resemblances can be accounted for (a)
   by accepting the priority of the Teaching, or (b) by assuming a common
   (earlier and unknown) source, or (c) by accepting the priority of
   Barnabas, and assuming such corruptions in the Greek copy of the
   Teaching as will account for the supposed marks of its priority.
   Despite the general adoption of (a), there remains a strong probability
   that (b) is the correct solution of the problem.

   6. The Duæ Viæ, spoken of by Rufinus, may be the common source. We have
   no positive evidence, but the "two ways" form so prominent a topic in
   most of these documents which indicate literary relationship, as to
   encourage this theory. If there was a common source, it probably
   contained only matter similar to chaps. i.-v., which was variously used
   by the subsequent compilers. Here a number of theories have been
   suggested. [2362] None of them, however, necessarily call for a very
   late date of the Teaching, or compel us to deny that Eusebius and
   Athanasius referred to substantially the same work as that now existing
   in the Codex at Constantinople. Many resemblances have been noticed in
   other works. Probably in the course of a few years all the data will
   have been collected, and a well-defined result based upon them. But,
   even in this period of discussion, there is remarkable agreement among
   critics in regard to the main question of authenticity.

     __________________________________________________________________

    section 5.--time and place of composition.

   Granting the general authenticity of the Greek work, the time of
   composition must be at least as early as the first half of the second
   century. If the Teaching is older than Barnabas, then it cannot be
   later than a.d. 120. If both are from a common source, the interval of
   time was probably not very great. [2363] The document itself bears many
   marks of an early date:--

   (1) Its simplicity, almost amounting to childishness, not only
   discountenances all idea of forgery, but points to the sub-apostolic
   age, during which Christianity manifested this characteristic. The fact
   is an important one in the discussion of the canon of the New
   Testament.

   (2) The undeveloped Christian thought, as well as the indications of
   undeveloped heresy, [2364] confirms this position. Christianity was at
   first a life, for which the Apostles furnished a basis of revealed
   thought. But the Christians of the sub-apostolic age had not
   consciously assimilated the thought to any large extent, while their
   ethical striving was stimulated by the gross sins surrounding them.
   [2365]

   (3) The Church polity indicated in the Teaching is less developed than
   that of the genuine Ignatian Epistles, and shows the existence of
   extraordinary travelling teachers ("Apostles" and "Prophets," chap.
   xi.). This points to a date not later than the first half of the second
   century, probably as early as the first quarter. [2366]

   Most of these phenomena would, however, consist with a date as late as
   that of the Ignatian Epistles on the theory that the Teaching was
   written for a community of Christians in some obscure locality. But
   this theory must admit that there existed for a long time great variety
   of Church polity and worship. [2367] Of this there is, indeed,
   considerable evidence. The undeveloped form of the doctrinal elements
   of the work constitutes the most serious objection to the theory of a
   late origin. On the other hand, it seems on many accounts improbable
   that the work, in its present form, was written earlier than the
   beginning of the second century: (1) Such a document would not be
   penned during the lifetime of any of the Apostles. (2) There is no
   allusion in chap. xvi. to the destruction of Jerusalem. If the author
   was a Jewish Christian, as seems most probable, such silence implies an
   interval of at least one generation. (3) The position of the document
   in the Codex is after the Clementine Epistles, and before the Ignatian.
   This probably marks the chronological position. (4) The extreme
   simplicity scarcely consists with the view that the author was nearly
   contemporary with the Apostles.

   Bryennios and Harnack assign, as the date, between 120 and 160;
   Hilgenfeld, 160 and 190; English and American scholars vary between
   a.d. 80 and 120. Until the priority to Barnabas is more positively
   established, the two may be regarded as of the same age, about 120,
   although a date slightly later is not impossible. All attempts to
   discover the author are, with our present lack of data, necessarily
   futile. Even the region in and for which it was composed cannot be
   determined. Jewish-Christian tendencies are not sufficiently indicated
   to warrant the assumption of a polemical aim. [2368] The document has
   been assigned to Alexandria, to Antioch, to Jerusalem; indeed, many
   other places have been named. In favour of the Syrian origin is the
   literary connection with the Apostolic Constitutions, while the
   correspondences with the Epistle to Barnabas suggest Egypt as the
   locality. If the Teaching and Barnabas have a common basis, e.g., the
   Duæ Viæ, the last may be assigned to Egypt, and the Teaching, in its
   present form, to Syria. The Palestinian origin is urged by those who
   lay stress upon the absence of Pauline doctrine in the Teaching [If
   meant for catechumens only, this fact is sufficiently accounted for.]

   The question is still an open one.

   As regards the doctrine, polity, usages, and ethics expressed and
   implied in the Teaching, the reader can judge for himself. The writer
   is of the opinion that the work represents, on many of these points,
   only a very small fraction of the Christians during the second century,
   and that, while it casts some light upon usages of that period, it
   cannot be regarded as an authoritative witness concerning the universal
   faith and practice of believers at the date usually assigned to it. The
   few notices of it, and its early disappearance, confirm this position.
   The theory of a composite origin also accords with this estimate of the
   document as a whole.

   The version of the Teaching here given is that of Professor Isaac H.
   Hall and Mr. John T. Napier, which first appeared in the Sunday-School
   Times (Philadelphia), April 12, 1884. It is now republished by
   permission of the editor of that periodical and of the joint authors. A
   few slight changes have been made, some of them in accordance with
   suggestions from Professor Hall, others to indicate correspondences
   with book vii. of Apostolic Constitutions.

   The division of verses agrees with that of Harnack as given by Schaff.
   The headings to the chapters have been inserted by the editor. The
   Scripture references have been selected and verified. The notes have
   been kept within narrow limits. They serve to indicate the relation of
   the matter to that in other early writings, mainly the Apostolic
   Constitutions, and to give various readings and renderings.
   Occasionally explanations and comments have been inserted. In dealing
   with this, as with most other books, the best method of study is
   historico-exegetical. To read the book intelligently is better than to
   read about it. The editor has sought to furnish some help in this
   method.

    Chapter I.--The Two Ways; The First Commandment.

   1. There are two ways, [2370] one of life and one of death; [2371] but
   a great difference between the two ways. 2. The way of life, then, is
   this: First, thou shalt love God [2372] who made thee; second, thy
   neighbour as thyself; [2373] and all things whatsoever thou wouldst
   should not occur to thee, thou also to another do not do. [2374] 3. And
   of these sayings [2375] the teaching is this: Bless them that curse
   you, and pray for your enemies, and fast for them that persecute you.
   [2376] For what thank is there, if ye love them that love you? Do not
   also the Gentiles do the same? [2377] But do ye love them that hate
   you; and ye shall not have an enemy. [2378] 4. Abstain thou from
   fleshly and worldly lusts. [2379] If one give thee a blow upon thy
   right cheek, turn to him the other also; [2380] and thou shalt be
   perfect. If one impress thee for one mile, go with him two. [2381] If
   one take away thy cloak, give him also thy coat. [2382] If one take
   from thee thine own, ask it not back, [2383] for indeed thou art not
   able. 5. Give to every one that asketh thee, and ask it not back;
   [2384] for the Father willeth that to all should be given of our own
   blessings (free gifts). [2385] Happy is he that giveth according to the
   commandment; for he is guiltless. Woe to him that receiveth; for if one
   having need receiveth, he is guiltless; but he that receiveth not
   having need, shall pay the penalty, why he received and for what, and,
   coming into straits (confinement), [2386] he shall be examined
   concerning the things which he hath done, and he shall not escape
   thence until he pay back the last farthing. [2387] 6. But also now
   concerning this, it hath been said, Let thine alms sweat [2388] in thy
   hands, until thou know to whom thou shouldst give.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2370] This phrase connects the book with the Duæ Viæ; see Introductory
   Notice. Barnabas has "light" and "darkness" for "life" and "death."

   [2371] Deut. xxx. 15, 19; Jer. xxi. 8; Matt. vii. 13, 14

   [2372] Comp. Deut. vi. 5, which is fully cited in Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 2, though the verb here is more exactly cited from
   LXX.

   [2373] Lev. xix. 18; Matt. xxii. 37, 39. Comp. Mark xii. 30, 31

   [2374] Comp. Tobit iv. 15; and Matt. vii. 12; Luke vi. 31

   [2375] These Old-Testament commands are thus taught by the Lord.

   [2376] Matt. v. 44. But the last clause is added, and is of unknown
   origin; not found in Apostolic Constitutions

   [2377] Matt. v. 46, 47; Luke vi. 32. The two passages are combined.

   [2378] So Apostolic Constitutions. Comp. 1 Pet. iii. 13

   [2379] 1 Pet. ii. 11. The Codex has somatikon, "bodily;" but editors
   correct to kosmikon

   [2380] Matt. v. 39; Luke vi. 29.

   [2381] Matt. v. 41

   [2382] Matt. v. 40; Luke vi. 29

   [2383] Luke vi. 30. The last clause is a peculiar addition: "art not
   able," since thou art a Christian; otherwise it is a commonplace
   observation.

   [2384] Luke vi. 30. The rest of the sentence is explained by the
   parallel passage in Apostolic Constitutions, which cites Matt. v. 45.

   [2385] Bryennios finds a parallel (or citation) in Hermas, Commandment
   Second, [261]p. 20, vol. i. Ante-Nicene Fathers. The remainder of this
   chapter has no parallel in Apostolic Constitutions.

   [2386] Gr. en sunoche. Probably = imprisonment; see next clause.

   [2387] Matt. v. 26.

   [2388] Codex: idrotato, which in this connection is unintelligible.
   Bryennios corrects into idrosato, rendered as above. There are various
   other conjectural emendations. The verse probably forbids
   indiscriminate charity, pointing to an early abuse of Christian
   liberality.

    Chapter II. [2389] --The Second Commandment: Gross Sin Forbidden.

   1. And the second commandment of the Teaching; 2. Thou shalt not commit
   murder, thou shalt not commit adultery, [2390] thou shalt not commit
   pæderasty, [2391] thou shalt not commit fornication, thou shalt not
   steal, [2392] thou shalt not practice magic, thou shalt not practice
   witchcraft, thou shalt not murder a child by abortion nor kill that
   which is begotten. [2393] Thou shalt not covet the things of thy
   neighbour, [2394] 3. thou shalt not forswear thyself, [2395] thou shalt
   not bear false witness, [2396] thou shalt not speak evil, thou shalt
   bear no grudge. [2397] 4. Thou shalt not be double-minded nor
   double-tongued; for to be double-tongued is a snare of death. [2398] 5.
   Thy speech shall not be false, nor empty, but fulfilled by deed. [2399]
   6. Thou shalt not be covetous, nor rapacious, nor a hypocrite, nor evil
   disposed, nor haughty. Thou shalt not take evil counsel against thy
   neighbour. [2400] 7. Thou shalt not hate any man; but some thou shalt
   reprove, [2401] and concerning some thou shalt pray, and some thou
   shalt love more than thy own life. [2402]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2389] The chapter, except this opening sentence and part of verse 7,
   is found in Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 2-5; but the precepts are
   separated and enlarged upon.

   [2390] Ex. xx. 13, 14.

   [2391] Or, "corrupt boys," as in the version of Apostolic
   Constitutions.

   [2392] Ex. xx. 15.

   [2393] Comp. Ex. xxi. 22, 23. The Codex reads gennethenta, which Schaff
   renders "the new-born child." Bryennios substitutes gennethen, which is
   accepted by most editors, and rendered as above.

   [2394] Ex. xx. 17.

   [2395] Matt. v. 34.

   [2396] Ex. xx. 16.

   [2397] Rendered "nor shalt thou be mindful of injuries" in version of
   Apostolic Constitutions.

   [2398] So Barnabas, xix.

   [2399] Verse 5, except the first clause, occurs only here.

   [2400] Latter half of verse 6 in Barnabas, xix.

   [2401] Lev. xix. 17; Apostolic Constitutions.

   [2402] Or, "soul." The last part of the clause is found in Barnabas;
   but "and concerning some...pray, and some" has no parallel. An
   interesting verse in its literary history.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter III. [2403] --Other Sins Forbidden.

   1. My child, [2404] flee from every evil thing, and from every likeness
   of it. 2. Be not prone to anger, for anger leadeth the way to murder;
   neither jealous, nor quarrelsome, nor of hot temper; for out of all
   these murders are engendered. 3. My child, be not a lustful one; for
   lust leadeth the way to fornication; neither a filthy talker, nor of
   lofty eye; for out of all these adulteries are engendered. 4. My child,
   be not an observer of omens, since it leadeth the way to idolatry;
   neither an enchanter, nor an astrologer, nor a purifier, nor be willing
   to took at these things; for out of all these idolatry is engendered.
   5. My child, be not a liar, since a lie leadeth the way to theft;
   neither money-loving, nor vainglorious, for out of all these thefts are
   engendered. 6. My child, be not a murmurer, since it leadeth the way to
   blasphemy; neither self-willed nor evil-minded, for out of all these
   blasphemies are engendered. 7. But be thou meek, since the meek shall
   inherit the earth. [2405] 8. Be long-suffering and pitiful and
   guileless and gentle and good and always trembling at the words which
   thou hast heard. [2406] 9. Thou shalt not exalt thyself, [2407] nor
   give over-confidence to thy soul. Thy soul shall not be joined with
   lofty ones, but with just and lowly ones shall it have its intercourse.
   10. The workings that befall thee receive as good, knowing that apart
   from God nothing cometh to pass. [2408]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2403] About one-half of the matter of this chapter is to be found, in
   well-nigh the same order, scattered through Apostolic Constitutions,
   vii. 6 -8. The precepts are aimed at minor sins, and require no
   particular comment. This chapter has the largest number of Greek words
   not found in the New Testament.

   [2404] The address "my child" does not occur in the parallel passages.

   [2405] Matt. v. 5.

   Constitutions vii. 8.

    Chapter IV. [2409] --Various Precepts.

   1. My child, him that speaketh to thee the word of God remember night
   and day; and thou shalt honour him as the Lord; [2410] for in the place
   whence lordly rule is uttered, [2411] there is the Lord. 2. And thou
   shalt seek out day by day the faces of the saints, in order that thou
   mayest rest upon [2412] their words. 3. Thou shalt not long for [2413]
   division, but shalt bring those who contend to peace. Thou shalt judge
   righteously, thou shalt not respect persons in reproving for
   transgressions. 4. Thou shalt not be undecided whether it shall be or
   no. [2414] 5. Be not a stretcher forth of the hands to receive and a
   drawer of them back to give. [2415] 6. If thou hast aught, through thy
   hands thou shalt give ransom for thy sins. [2416] 7. Thou shalt not
   hesitate to give, nor murmur when thou givest; for thou shalt know who
   is the good repayer of the hire. 8. Thou shalt not turn away from him
   that is in want, but thou shalt share all things with thy brother, and
   shalt not say that they are thine own; for if ye are partakers in that
   which is immortal, how much more in things which are mortal? [2417] 9.
   Thou shalt not remove thy hand from thy son or from thy daughter, but
   from their youth shalt teach them the fear of God. [2418] 10. Thou
   shalt not enjoin aught in thy bitterness upon thy bondman or
   maidservant, who hope in the same God, lest ever they shall fear not
   God who is over both; [2419] for he cometh not to call according to the
   outward appearance, but unto them whom the Spirit hath prepared. 11.
   And ye bondmen shall be subject to your [2420] masters as to a type of
   God, in modesty and fear. [2421] 12. Thou shalt hate all hypocrisy and
   everything which is not pleasing to the Lord. 13. Do thou in no wise
   forsake the commandments of the Lord; but thou shalt keep what thou
   hast received, neither adding thereto nor taking away therefrom. [2422]
   14. In the church [2423] thou shalt acknowledge thy transgressions, and
   thou shalt not come near for thy prayer [2424] with an evil conscience.
   [2425] This is the way of life. [2426]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2409] This chapter, with the exception of a few clauses and words, is
   found in Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 9-17. There are verbal
   variations, but the order is exact. In Barnabas not so much of the
   matter is found. There is, however, even greater verbal agreement in
   many cases, though the order is quite different. Two important clauses
   (verses 8, 14) find an exact parallel only in Barnabas. One phrase is
   peculiar to the Teaching; see ver. 14.

   [2410] Comp. Heb. xiii. 7. In Apostolic Constitutions there is a
   transposition of words.

   [2411] Schaff: "The Lordship is spoken of." Apostolic Constitutions,
   "where the doctrine concerning God is," etc.

   [2412] Or, "acquiesce in" (Apostolic Constitutions).

   [2413] Some read poieseis, "make," as in Apostolic Constitutions and
   Barnabas, instead of potheseis, Codex.

   [2414] Comp. Ecclus. i. 28. The verse occurs in Barnabas; and in
   Apostolic Constitutions "in thy prayer" is inserted, which is probably
   the sense here.

   [2415] Ecclus. iv. 31. The Greek word suspon occurs here and in
   Barnabas, but not in Apostolic Constitutions.

   [2416] Apostolic Constitutions adds, in explanation, Prov. xvi. 6.

   [2417] Comp. Acts iv. 32; Rom. xv. 27. The latter half of the verse is
   in Barnabas (not in Apostolic Constitutions), but with the substitution
   of "incorruptible" and "corruptible."

   [2418] Comp. Eph. vi. 4.

   [2419] Comp. Eph. vi. 9; Col. iv. 1.

   [2420] Codex reads "our;" editors correct to "your. "

   [2421] Comp. Eph. vi. 5; Col. iii. 22.

   [2422] Deut. xii. 32.

   [2423] "In the congregation;" i.e., assembly of believers. This phrase
   is omitted in both Barnabas and Apostolic Constitutions. Comp. Jas. v.
   16.

   [2424] Or, "to thy place of prayer" (Schaff).

   [2425] So Barnabas; but Apostolic Constitutions, "in the day of thy
   bitterness."

   [2426] So Apostolic Constitutions; but Barnabas, "the way of light."
   See note on chap. i. 1.
     __________________________________________________________________


    Chapter V. [2427] --The Way of Death.

   1. And the way of death [2428] is this: First of all it is evil and
   full of curse: [2429] murders, [2430] adulteries, lusts, fornications,
   thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false
   witnessings, hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, haughtiness,
   depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy,
   over-confidence, loftiness, boastfulness; 2. persecutors of the good,
   [2431] hating truth, loving a lie, not knowing a reward for
   righteousness, not cleaving [2432] to good nor to righteous judgment,
   watching not for that which is good, but for that which is evil; from
   whom meekness and endurance are far, loving vanities, pursuing
   requital, not pitying a poor man, not labouring for the afflicted, not
   knowing Him that made them, murderers of children, destroyers of the
   handiwork of God, turning away from him that is in want, afflicting him
   that is distressed, advocates of the rich, lawless judges of the poor,
   utter sinners. [2433] Be delivered, children, from all these. [2434]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2427] This chapter finds nearly exact parallels in Barnabas, xx., and
   Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 18, but with curious variations.

   [2428] Barnabas has "darkness," but afterwards "way of eternal death."

   [2429] Not in Apostolic Constitutions, and no exact parallel in
   Barnabas.

   [2430] Of the twenty-two sins named in this verse, Barnabas gives
   fourteen, in differing order, and in the singular; Apostolic
   Constitutions gives all but one (upsos, "loftiness" "haughtiness"), in
   the same order, and with the same change from plural to singular.

   [2431] This verse appears almost word for word in Barnabas, with two
   additional clauses.

   [2432] The Apostolic Constitutions give a parallel from this point;
   verbally exact from the phrase, "not for that which is good."

   [2433] The word panthamartetoi occurs only here, and in the parallel
   passage in Barnabas (rendered in this edition "who are in every respect
   transgressors," vol. i. [262]p. 149), and in Apostolic Constitutions
   (rendered "full of sin"). A similar term occurs in the recently
   recovered portion of 2 Clement, xviii., where Bishop Lightfoot renders,
   as above, "an utter sinner."

   [2434] Found verbatim in Apostolic Constitutions, not in Barnabas: with
   the latter there is no further parallel, except a few phrases in chap.
   xvi. 2, 3 (which see).
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter VI. [2435] --Against False Teachers, and Food Offered to Idols.

   1. See that no one cause thee to err [2436] from this way of the
   Teaching, since apart from God it teacheth thee. 2. For if thou art
   able to bear all the yoke [2437] of the Lord, thou wilt be perfect; but
   if thou art not able, what thou art able that do. 3. And concerning
   food, [2438] bear what thou art able; but against that which is
   sacrificed to idols [2439] be exceedingly on thy guard; for it is the
   service of dead gods. [2440]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2435] Of this chapter, two phrases and one entire clause are found in
   Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 19-21.

   [2436] Comp. Matt. xxiv . 4 (Greek); Revised Version, "lead you
   astray:" Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 19.

   [2437] Or, "the whole yoke." Those who accept the Jewish-Christian
   authorship refer this to the ceremonial law. It seems quite as likely
   to mean ascetic regulations. Of these there are many traces, even in
   the New-Testament churches.

   [2438] Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 20, begins with a similar phrase,
   but is explicitly against asceticism in this respect. The precepts here
   do not indicate any such spirit as that opposed by Paul.

   [2439] Comp. Acts xv. 20, 29; 1 Cor. viii. 4, etc., x. 18, etc. (Rom.
   xiv. 20 refers to ascetic abstinence.) This prohibition had a necessary
   permanence; comp. Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 21.

   [2440] Comp. the same phrase in 2 Clement, iii. This chapter closes the
   first part of the Teaching, that supposed to be intended for
   catechumens. The absence of doctrinal statement does not necessarily
   prove the existence of a circle of Gentile Christians where the Pauline
   theology was unknown. If such a circle existed, emphasizing the ethical
   side of Christianity to the exclusion of its doctrinal basis, it
   disappeared very soon. From the nature of the case, that kind of
   Christianity is intellectually weak and necessarily short-lived.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter VII.--Concerning Baptism.

   1. And concerning baptism, [2441] thus baptize ye: [2442] Having first
   said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father, and of the
   Son, and of the Holy Spirit, [2443] in living water. [2444] 2. But if
   thou have not living water, baptize into other water; and if thou canst
   not in cold, in warm. 3. But if thou have not either, pour out water
   thrice [2445] upon the head into the name of Father and Son and Holy
   Spirit. 4. But before the baptism let the baptizer fast, and the
   baptized, and whatever others can; but thou shalt order the baptized to
   fast one or two days before. [2446]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2441] Verse 1 is found, well-nigh entire, in Apostolic Constitutions
   vii. 22, but besides this only a few words of verses 2 and 4. The
   chapter has naturally called out much discussion as to the mode of
   baptism.

   [2442] [Elucidation I.]

   [2443] Matt. xxviii. 19.

   [2444] Probably running water.

   [2445] The previous verses point to immersion; this permits pouring in
   certain cases, which indicates that this mode was not unknown. The
   trine application of the water, and its being poured on the head, are
   both significant.

   [2446] The fasting of the baptized is enjoined in Apostolic
   Constitutions, but that of the baptizer (and others) is peculiar to
   this document.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter VIII. [2447] --Concerning Fasting and Prayer (the Lord's Prayer).

   1. But let not your fasts be with the hypocrites; [2448] for they fast
   on the second and fifth day of the week; but do ye fast on the fourth
   day and the Preparation (Friday). [2449] 2. Neither pray as the
   hypocrites; but as the Lord commanded in His Gospel, [2450] thus pray:
   Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come.
   Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth. Give us to-day our daily
   (needful) bread, [2451] and forgive us our debt as we also forgive our
   debtors. And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil
   one (or, evil); for Thine is the power and the glory for ever. [2452]
   3. Thrice in the day thus pray. [2453]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2447] The entire chapter is found almost verbatim in Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 23, 24.

   [2448] Comp. Matt. vi. 16.

   [2449] The reasons for fasting on Wednesday and Friday are given in
   Apostolic Constitutions (the days of betrayal and of burial). Monday
   and Thursday were the Jewish fast-days. The word "Preparation" (day
   before the Jewish sabbath) occurs in Matt. xxvii. 62, etc., and for
   some time retained a place in Christian literature.

   [2450] Matt. vi. 5, 9-13. This form of the Lord's Prayer is evidently
   cited from Matthew, not from Luke. The textual variations are slight.
   The citation is of importance as proving that the writer used this
   Gospel, and that the liturgical use of the Lord's Prayer was common.

   [2451] On this phrase, comp. Revised Version, Matt. vi. 11; Luke xi. 3
   (text, margin, and American appendix).

   [2452] The variation in the form of the doxology confirms the judgment
   of textual criticism, which omits it in Matt. vi. 13. All early
   liturgical literature tends in the same direction; comp. Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 24.

   [2453] This is in accordance with Jewish usage. Dan. vi. 10; Ps. lv.
   17. Comp. Acts iii. 1, x. 9.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter IX. [2454] --The Thanksgiving (Eucharist).

   1. Now concerning the Thanksgiving (Eucharist), thus give thanks. 2.
   First, concerning the cup: [2455] We thank thee, our Father, for the
   holy vine of David Thy servant, [2456] which Thou madest known to us
   through Jesus Thy Servant; to Thee be the glory for ever. 3. And
   concerning the broken bread: [2457] We thank Thee, our Father, for the
   life and knowledge which Thou madest known to us through Jesus Thy
   Servant; to Thee be the glory for ever. 4. Even as this broken bread
   was scattered over the hills, [2458] and was gathered together and
   became one, so let Thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the
   earth into Thy kingdom; [2459] for Thine is the glory and the power
   through Jesus Christ for ever. 5. But let no one eat or drink of your
   Thanksgiving (Eucharist), but they who have been baptized into the name
   of the Lord; for concerning this also the Lord hath said, Give not that
   which is holy to the dogs. [2460]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2454] The eucharistic prayers of this and the following chapter are
   only partially reproduced in Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 25, 26; that
   of verse 2 has no parallel.

   [2455] This is a variation from the order of the New Testament and of
   all liturgies: probably this led to its omission in Apostolic
   Constitutions. The word "for" may be substituted for "concerning" here
   and in verse 3. [Possibly a response for recipients.]

   [2456] Peculiar to this passage, but derived from a common scriptural
   figure and from the paschal formula. Comp. especially John xv. 1; Matt.
   xxvi. 29; Mark xiv. 25.

   [2457] The word kla'sma is found in the accounts of the feeding of the
   multitude (Matt. xiv. 20, xv. 37, and parallels); it was naturally
   applied to the broken bread of the Eucharist.

   [2458] This reference to "hills," or "mountains," is used as an
   argument against the Egyptian origin of the Teaching.

   [2459] This part of the verse is found in Apostolic Constitutions.
   Schaff properly calls attention to the distinction here made between
   "Thy Church" and "Thy kingdom."

   [2460] Matt. vii. 6.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter X. [2461] --Prayer After Communion.

   1. But after ye are filled, [2462] thus give thanks: 2. We thank Thee,
   holy Father, for Thy holy name which Thou didst cause to tabernacle in
   our hearts, and for the knowledge and faith and immortality, which Thou
   madest known to us through Jesus Thy Servant; to Thee be the glory for
   ever. 3. Thou, Master almighty, didst create all things for Thy name's
   sake; Thou gavest food and drink to men for enjoyment, that they might
   give thanks to Thee; but to us Thou didst freely give spiritual food
   and drink and life eternal through Thy Servant. [2463] 4. Before all
   things we thank Thee that Thou art mighty; to Thee be the glory for
   ever. 5. Remember, Lord, Thy Church, to deliver it from all evil and to
   make it perfect in Thy love, and gather it from the four winds,
   sanctified for Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared for it; [2464] for
   Thine is the power and the glory for ever. 6. Let grace come, and let
   this world pass away. [2465] Hosanna to the God (Son) [2466] of David!
   If any one is holy, let him come; if any one is not so, let him repent.
   [2467] Maran atha. [2468] Amen. 7. But permit the prophets to make
   Thanksgiving as much as they desire. [2469]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2461] This post-communion thanksgiving is f ound in Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 26, but with many omissions, alterations, and
   additions. Still, the correspondence in thought and language is very
   remarkable. Schaff cites a similar prayer at the Passover (after the
   Hallel cup).

   [2462] "After the participation" (Apostolic Constitutions) points to a
   distinct Eucharistic service. Here the Lord's Supper is evidently
   connected with the Agape [a noteworthy suggestion]; comp. 1 Cor. xi.
   20-22, 33. This is an evidence of early date; comp. Justin Martyr,
   Apol. i. chaps. 64-66, where the Lord's Supper is shown to be distinct
   (Ante-Nicene Fathers, i. pp. [263]185, 186).

   [2463] This last clause has no parallel in Apostolic Constitutions, and
   points to an earlier and more spiritual conception of the Eucharist.
   Verse 4 also is peculiar to this passage.

   [2464] The above rendering follows Bryennios; that of Harnack (formerly
   accepted by Hall and Napier) is: "Gather it, sanctified, from the four
   winds, into Thy kingdom," etc. The phrase "from the four winds" recalls
   Matt. xxiv. 31.

   [2465] This is peculiar; but comp. 1 Cor. vii. 31 for the last clause.

   [2466] The Codex reads to ueo, which Bryennios alters to to uio. The
   former is the more difficult reading, and is defended by Harnack.

   [2467] This exhortation indicates a mixed assembly; comp. Apostolic
   Constitutions. [If so, it belongs to the Agape.]

   [2468] Cor. xvi. 22, Revised Version, margin: "That is, our Lord
   cometh." Comp. Rev. xxii. 20.

   [2469] A limitation as compared with 1 Cor. Xiv. 29, 31, and yet
   indicating a combination of extemporaneous devotion with the liturgical
   form. The verse prepares the way for the next chapter.

    Chapter XI. [2470] --Concerning Teachers, Apostles, and Prophets.

   1. Whosoever, therefore, cometh and teacheth you all these things that
   have been said before, receive him. [2471] 2. But if the teacher
   himself turn [2472] and teach another doctrine to the destruction of
   this, hear him not; but if he teach so as to increase righteousness and
   the knowledge of the Lord, receive him as the Lord. 3. But concerning
   the apostles and prophets, according to the decree of the Gospel, thus
   do. 4. Let every apostle that cometh to you be received as the Lord.
   [2473] 5. But he shall not remain except one day; but if there be need,
   also the next; but if he remain three days, he is a false prophet. 6.
   And when the apostle goeth away, let him take nothing but bread until
   he lodgeth; [2474] but if he ask money, he is a false prophet. 7. And
   every prophet that speaketh in the Spirit [2475] ye shall neither try
   nor judge; for every sin shall be forgiven, but this sin shall not be
   forgiven. [2476] 8. But not every one that speaketh in the Spirit is a
   prophet; but only if he hold the ways of the Lord. Therefore from their
   ways shall the false prophet and the prophet be known. 9. And every
   prophet who ordereth a meal [2477] in the Spirit eateth not from it,
   except indeed he be a false prophet; 10. and every prophet who teacheth
   the truth, if he do not what he teacheth, is a false prophet. 11. And
   every prophet, proved true, [2478] working unto the mystery of the
   Church in the world, [2479] yet not teaching others to do what he
   himself doeth, shall not be judged among you, for with God he hath his
   judgment; for so did also the ancient prophets. But whoever saith in
   the Spirit, Give me money, or something else, ye shall not listen to
   him; but if he saith to you to give for others' sake who are in need,
   let no one judge him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2470] The Apostolic Constitutions (vii. 27) present scarcely any
   parallel to this chapter, which points to an earlier period, when
   ecclesiastical polity was less developed, and the travelling "Apostles"
   and "Prophets" here spoken of were numerous. [Elucidation II.]

   [2471] This refers to all teachers, more fully described afterwards.

   [2472] Lit. "being turned:" i.e. turned from the truth, perverted.

   [2473] Matt. x. 40. The mention of apostles here has caused much
   discussion, but there are many indications that travelling evangelists
   were thus termed for some time after the apostolic age. Bishop
   Lightfoot has shown, that, even in the New Testament, a looser use of
   the term applied it to others than the Twelve. Comp. Rom. xvi. 7; 1
   Cor. xv. 5, 7 (?); Gal. i. 19; 1 Thess. ii. 6: also, as applied to
   Barnabas, Acts xiv. 4, 14.

   [2474] Reach a place where he can lodge.

   [2475] Under the influence of the charismatic gift spoken of in 1 Cor.
   xii. 3, xiv. 2. Another indication of an early date.

   [2476] Probably a reference to the sin against the Holy Spirit. Matt.
   xii. 31, 32; Mark iii. 29, 30.

   [2477] Probably a love-feast, commanded by the prophet in his peculiar
   utterance.

   [2478] alethinos, "genuine."

   [2479] poion eis musterion kosmikon ekklesias, "working unto a worldly
   mystery of (the) Church," or "making assemblies for a worldly mystery."
   Either rendering is grammatical: neither is very intelligible. The
   paraphrase in the above version presents one leading view of this
   difficult passage: the mystery is the Church, and a worldly one,
   because the Church is in the world. The other leading view joins
   ekklesias (as accusative) with poion, "making assemblies for a worldly
   mystery." So Bryennios, who regards the worldly mystery as a symbolical
   act of the prophet. Others suggest, as the mystery for which the
   assemblies are called, revelation of future events, celibacy, the
   Eucharist, the ceremonial law. It seems, at all events, to point to
   incipient fanaticism on the part of the prophets of those days.
   [Elucidation III.] This was likely to take the form either of
   asceticism or of extravagant predictions and mystical fancies about the
   Church in the world. Did we know the place and the time more
   accurately, we might decide which was meant. This caution was evidently
   needed: Let God judge such extravagances.

    Chapter XII. [2480] --Reception of Christians.

   1. But let every one that cometh in the name of the Lord be received,
   [2481] and afterward ye shall prove and know him; for ye shall have
   understanding right and left. 2. If he who cometh is a wayfarer, assist
   him as far as ye are able; but he shall not remain with you, except for
   two or three days, if need be. 3. But if he willeth to abide with you,
   being an artisan, let him work and eat; [2482] but if he hath no trade,
   4. according to your understanding see to it that, as a Christian,
   [2483] he shall not live with you idle. 5. But if he willeth not to do,
   he is a Christ-monger. [2484] Watch that ye keep aloof from such.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2480] Verse 1 is almost identical with the beginning of Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 28; the remaining verses have no parallel.

   [2481] All professed Christians are meant.

   [2482] Comp. 2 Thess. iii. 10.

   [2483] The term occurs only here in the Teaching.

   [2484] "Christ-trafficker." The abuse of Christian fellowship and
   hospitality naturally followed the remarkable extension of
   Christianity. This expressive term was coined to designate the class of
   idlers who would make gain out of their professed Christianity. It
   occurs in the longer form of the Ignatian Epistles (Trallians, vi.) and
   in literature of the fourth century.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter XIII. [2485] --Support of Prophets.

   1. But every true prophet that willeth to abide among you [2486] is
   worthy of his support. [2487] 2. So also a true teacher is himself
   worthy, as the workman, of his support. [2488] 3. Every first-fruit,
   therefore, of the products of wine-press and threshing-floor, of oxen
   and of sheep, thou shalt take and give to the prophets, for they are
   your high priests. [2489] 4. But if ye have not a prophet, give it to
   the poor. 5. If thou makest a batch of dough, take the first-fruit and
   give according to the commandment. 6. So also when thou openest a jar
   of wine or of oil, take the first-fruit and give it to the prophets; 7.
   and of money (silver) and clothing and every possession, take the
   first-fruit, as it may seem good to thee, and give according to the
   commandment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2485] A large part of this chapter is found in Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 28, 29, but with modifications and additions
   indicating a later date.

   [2486] "Who will settle among you" (Hitchcock and Brown). The itinerant
   prophets might become stationary, we infer. Chaps. xi.-xv. point to a
   movement from an itinerant and extraordinary ministry to a more settled
   one.

   [2487] Lit., "nourishment," "food."

   [2488] Matt. x. 10; comp. Luke x. 7.

   [2489] This phrase, indicating a sacerdotal view of the ministry, seems
   to point to a later date than that claimed for the Teaching. Some
   regard it as an interpolation: others take it in a figurative sense. In
   Apostolic Constitutions the sacerdotal view is more marked. [1 Pet. ii.
   9. If the plebs = "priests," prophets = "high priests."] Here the term
   is restricted to the prophets: compare Schaff in loco.

    Chapter XIV. [2490] --Christian Assembly on the Lord's Day.

   1. But every Lord's day [2491] do ye gather yourselves together, and
   break bread, and give thanksgiving after having confessed your
   transgressions, [2492] that your sacrifice may be pure. [2493] 2. But
   let no one that is at variance [2494] with his fellow come together
   with you, until they be reconciled, that your sacrifice may not be
   profaned. 3. For this is that which was spoken by the Lord: In every
   place and time offer to me a pure sacrifice; [2495] for I am a great
   King, saith the Lord, and my name is wonderful among the nations.
   [2496]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2490] Verses 1 and 3 are given substantially in Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 30. This chapter would seem to belong more properly
   before chap. viii.; but the same order of topics is followed in
   Apostolic Constitutions,--a remarkable proof of literary connection.

   [2491] Comp. Rev. i. 10. Here the full form is kata kuriaken de Kurion.
   If the early date is allowed, this verse confirms the view that from
   the first the Lord's Day was observed, and that, too, by a eucharistic
   celebration.

    Chapter XV. [2497] --Bishops and Deacons; Christian Reproof.

   1. Appoint, therefore, for yourselves, bishops and deacons worthy of
   the Lord, men meek, and not lovers of money, [2498] and truthful and
   proved; for they also render to you the service [2499] of prophets and
   teachers. 2. Despise them not therefore, for they are your honoured
   ones, together with the prophets and teachers. 3. And reprove one
   another, not in anger, but in peace, as ye have it in the Gospel;
   [2500] but to every one that acts amiss [2501] against another, let no
   one speak, nor let him hear aught from you until he repent. 4. But your
   prayers and alms and all your deeds so do, as ye have it in the Gospel
   of our Lord. [2502]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2497] The larger part of verse 1, and a clause from verses 2, 3,
   respectively, are found in Apostolic Constitutions, vii. 31. Verses 1,
   2, both in the use of terms and in the Church polity indicated, point
   to an early date: (1) There are evident marks of a transition from
   extraordinary to ordinary ministers. (2) The distinction between
   bishops and elders does not appear [1 Pet. v. 1. Vol. i. [265]p. 16,
   this series], and yet it is found in Ignatius. (3) The word cheirotoneo
   is here used in the sense of "elect" or "appoint" (by show of hands),
   and not in that of "ordain" (by laying on of hands). The former is the
   New Testament sense (Acts xiv. 23; 2 Cor. viii. 19), also in Ignatius;
   the latter sense is found in Apostolic Canons, i. (4) The choice by the
   people also indicates an early period.

   [2498] Comp. 1 Tim. iii. 4.

   [2499] Or, "ministry." This clause and the following verse indicate
   that the extraordinary ministers were as yet more highly regarded.

   [2500] Comp. Matt. xviii. 15-17.

   [2501] The word astocheo, occurring here, means "to miss the mark;" in
   New Testament, "to err" or, "swerve." See 1 Tim. i. 6, vi. 21; 2 Tim.
   ii. 18.

   [2502] The reference here is probably to the Sermon on the Mount: Matt.
   v.-vii., especially to chap. vi.
     __________________________________________________________________


    Chapter XVI. [2503] --Watchfulness; The Coming of the Lord.

   1. Watch for your life's sake. [2504] Let not your lamps be quenched,
   nor your loins unloosed; [2505] but be ye ready, for ye know not the
   hour in which our Lord cometh. [2506] 2. But often shall ye come
   together, seeking the things which are befitting to your souls: for the
   whole time of your faith will not profit you, [2507] if ye be not made
   perfect in the last time. 3. For in the last days [2508] false prophets
   and corrupters shall be multiplied, and the sheep shall be turned into
   wolves, and love shall be turned into hate; [2509] 4. for when
   lawlessness increaseth, they shall hate and persecute and betray one
   another, [2510] and then shall appear the world-deceiver [2511] as the
   Son of God, [2512] and shall do signs and wonders, [2513] and the earth
   shall be delivered into his hands, and he shall do iniquitous things
   which have never yet come to pass since the beginning. 5. Then shall
   the creation of men come into the fire of trial, [2514] and many shall
   be made to stumble and shall perish; but they that endure in their
   faith shall be saved [2515] from under the curse itself. [2516] 6. And
   then shall appear the signs of the truth; [2517] first, the sign of an
   out-spreading [2518] in heaven; then the sign of the sound of the
   trumpet; and the third, the resurrection of the dead; 7. yet not of
   all, but as it is said: The Lord shall come and all His saints with
   Him. [2519] 8. Then shall the world see the Lord coming upon the clouds
   of heaven. [2520]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2503] The resemblance between this chapter and Apostolic
   Constitutions, vii. 31, 32, is mainly in order of topics and in the
   identity of some phrases and terms. Verses 3 and 4 (to the word
   "world-deceiver") are reproduced almost verbatim. That the writer of
   the Teaching used Matt. xxiv. is extremely probable, but the connection
   of Apostolic Constitutions, with this passage is evident. In Barnabas,
   iv., there are a few corresponding phrases.

   [2504] Or, "over your life;" the clause occurs verbatim in Apostolic
   Constitutions.

   [2505] Comp. Luke xii. 35, which is exactly cited in Apostolic
   Constitutions.

   [2506] Matt. xxiv. 42.

   [2507] Here Barnabas, iv., furnishes a parallel.

   [2508] This reference to the last days as present or impending is an
   evidence of early date; comp. Barnabas, iv., and many passages in the
   New Testament. The mistake has been in measuring God's prophetic
   chronology by our mathematical standard of years.

   [2509] Comp. Matt. xxiv. 11, 12.

   [2510] Comp. Matt. xxiv. 10.

   [2511] ho kosmoplanos, found only here and in Apostolic Constitutions,
   vii. 32. Comp. 2 Thess. ii. 3, 4, 8; Rev. xii. 9.

   [2512] Not found in Apostolic Constitutions. The expression plainly
   implies the belief that Jesus Christ was Son of God.

   [2513] Comp. Matt. xxiv. 24. The rest of the verse has no parallel.

   [2514] Comp. 1 Pet. iv. 12. where purosis also occurs.

   [2515] Comp. Matt x. 22 and similar passages; none of them directly
   cited here.

   [2516] hup' autou tou katathematos, "from under the curse itself:"
   namely, that which has just been described. Bryennios and others render
   "by the curse Himself;" that is, Christ, whom they were tempted to
   revile. All other interpretations either rest on textual emendations or
   are open to grammatical objections. Of the two given above, that of
   Hall and Napier seems preferable.

   [2517] "Truth" might refer to Christ Himself, but the personal advent
   is spoken of in verse 8; it is better, then, to refer it to the truth
   respecting the parousia held by the early Christians. For this belief
   they were mocked, and hence dwelt upon it and the prophecies respecting
   it. The verse is probably based upon Matt. xxiv. 30, 31; but some find
   here, as in verse 4, an allusion to Paul's eschatological statements in
   the Epistles to the Thessalonians.

   [2518] Professor Hall now prefers to render ekpetaseos, "outspreading,"
   instead of "unrolling," as in his version originally. Hitchcock and
   Brown, Schaff, and others, prefer "opening;" that is, the apparent o
   pening in heaven through which the Lord will descend. "Outspreading" is
   usually explained (so Professor Hall) as meaning the expanded sign of
   the cross in the heavens, the patristic interpretation of Matt. xxiv.
   30. Bryennios and Farrar refer it to the flying forth of the saints to
   meet the Lord. There are other interpretations based on textual
   emendations. As the word is very rare, it is difficult to determine the
   exact sense. "Opening" seems lexically allowable and otherwise free
   from objection.

   [2519] Zech. xiv. 5. This citation is given substantially in Apostolic
   Constitutions. As here used, it seems to point to the first
   resurrection. Comp. 1 Thess. iv. 17; 1 Cor. xv. 23; Rev. xx. 5.
   Probably it is based upon the Pauline eschatology rather than upon that
   of the Apocalypse. At all events, there is no allusion to the
   millennial statement of the latter. Since there was in the early
   Church, in connection with the expectation of the speedy coming of
   Christ, a marked tendency to Chiliasm, the silence respecting the
   millennium may indicate that the writer was not acquainted with the
   Apocalypse. This inference is allowable, however, only on the
   assumption of the early date of the Teaching.

   [2520] Comp. Matt. xxiv. 30. The conclusion is abrupt, and in Apostolic
   Constitutions the New-Testament doctrine of future punishment and
   reward is added. The absence of all reference to the destruction of
   Jerusalem would indicate that some time had elapsed since that event.
   An interval of from thirty to sixty years may well be claimed.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Elucidations.

      I

   (Thus baptize ye, p. 379.)

   If we compare this chapter with the corresponding one in the Apostolic
   Constitutions, the Teaching seems to me to be a somewhat abridged form
   of a common original. This being designed for the catechumens, there is
   an omission of what they are afterwards to know. A form originally
   drawn up for clergy and people has been very inartificially expurgated
   for the instruction of young disciples. This appears from the ninth
   chapter (p. 380), where only certain receptive or responsive forms are
   given. The liturgy of the Apostolic Constitutions, book viii., embodies
   what was studiously kept from all but the te'leioi, i.e., those "of
   full age."


      II

   (Concerning Apostles, p. 380, note 16.)

   The reference to "apostles," probably itinerant, in Rev. ii. 2,
   corresponds with this. There were officers known in the Apostolic day
   (compare 2 Cor. viii. 23, Greek) as apo'stoloi ekklesion, for the
   pseud-apostles of the Apocalypse could not have pretended what they did
   had it been otherwise. Neither would it have been needful to "try those
   who said they were apostles," in that case: the mere assertion of such
   a pretence would have sufficiently convicted them.

   The very childish directions (suited to mere catechumens) given in the
   text illustrates Rev ii. 2, and is, so far, evidence of the very early
   origin of the Teaching.

   The name apostles was made technical by Christ Himself: "He named them
   Apostles" (Luke vi. 13). And the word is never used in the loose way
   which Bishop Lightfoot hazardously suggests, as I must venture to
   believe.

      III

   (Incipient fanaticism, p. 381, note 25.)

   Unquestionably, for even in St. Paul's day his admonitions imply
   nothing less. See 1 Cor. cap. xiv., passim. But, as in the Introductory
   Notice [2521] I hinted my suspicions of incipient Montanism in the
   Teaching, so I am strengthened in this idea by the learned critic to
   whose note I venture to append this remark for the purpose of asking a
   reference to my annotations of Hermas in vol. ii. of this series. May I
   also ask a reference to the same volume, pp. [266]4, 5, and 6? The
   "meal" (note 23, p. 380) of the Teaching is doubtless the Agape, which
   had been abused at so early a day, that St. Peter [2522] himself was
   forced to denounce the "false prophets" who polluted this feast of
   charity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2521] P. 371, supra.

   [2522] 2 Pet. ii. 13. Compare 1 John iv. 1.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2369] The longer title is supposed to be the original one; the
   shorter, a popular abridgment. The latter has no real connection with
   Acts ii. 42. Many hold that the term "nations" (or "Gentiles") points
   to a Jewish Christian as the author (so Bryennios), though this is
   denied by others (so Brown). A similar diversity of opinion exists as
   to the class of readers; but, if the early date is accepted, the more
   probable theory is, that the first part at least of the manual was for
   the instruction of catechumens of Gentile birth (so Bryennios, Schaff).
   Others extend it to Gentile Christians.

Constitutions of the Holy Apostles. [2523]

      [Edited, with Notes, by James Donaldson, D.D.]

     __________________________________________________________________


  Introductory Notice

        to

Constitutions of the Holy Apostles.

   ___________________

   Having learned from the erudite Beveridge what I long supposed to be a
   just view of the Constitutions, I have found in the recent literature
   of the subject not a little to increase my confidence in the general
   conclusions to which he was led by all that could be known in his
   times. The treatise of Krabbe guided me to some results of more modern
   investigations; and Dr. Bunsen, though not apart from his critics, has
   enabled me still further to correct some of my impressions. But, in
   connection with the late discovery of Bryennios, the field of
   discussion and inquiry has been so much enlarged, that I have felt it
   due to the readers and students of this republication to invoke the aid
   of Professor Riddle, who is able to enrich the work with the results of
   genuine learning and much patient research. Whatever may be my own
   convictions on some subordinate points, I have been glad to secure the
   judgment of a critical scholar who, I am persuaded, aims to shed upon
   the subject the colourless light of scientific investigation. This is
   all I can desire, anxious only to see facts clearly established and
   historic truth illustrated, no matter to what results they may seem to
   point. Where the professor's decisions coincide with my own
   impressions, I am naturally gratified by his valued and independent
   corroboration: where the case is otherwise, I am hardly less gratified
   to present my indulgent readers with opinions deserving of their
   highest respect, and by which they will be stimulated, as well as
   influenced, in forming convictions for themselves.

   The Constitutions are so full of material on which it is well for one
   in my position not to speak very freely in such a work as this, that I
   rejoice all the more to confide the task of annotation almost
   exclusively to another and to one from whom American Christians must
   ever be glad to hear on subjects requiring in an almost equal degree
   the skill of an expert critic and the candour of a conscientious
   Christian.

   I prefix Professor Riddle's Preface to the Introductory Notice of the
   Edinburgh editor, as follows:--


   New interest has been awakened in the Apostolic Constitutions by the
   discovery of an ancient manuscript in Constantinople. [2524] While it
   does not contain the Constitutions, it affords much material for
   discussion respecting the sources and authorship of this compilation.
   The so-called Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, found in the Codex at
   Constantinople, and published by Bryennios in 1883, is recognised as
   the basis of the seventh book of the Constitutions. The verbal
   coincidences, the order of topics, and other obvious phenomena, leave
   little room for reasonable doubt on this point. That the reader may be
   in possession of the main facts, the corresponding portions have been
   indicated both in book vii. of the Constitutions and in the version of
   the Teaching inserted in this volume. This literary connection has some
   bearing on the discussion as to the age of the Constitutions. If the
   Teaching is substantially the early work bearing that name, then some
   of the references by early writers which have been applied to the
   larger work must now be regarded as pointing to the Teaching; still,
   this only bears against the theory of a date as early as the third
   century. The new critical material furnished by the Bryennios
   manuscript for the Ignatian controversy has a bearing on the question
   respecting the work before us. The opinion has been strengthened (see
   below), that the same hand enlarged the Ignatian Epistles and adapted
   earlier matter (such as the Teaching) for the Apostolic Constitutions.

   We may accept as established the following positions:--

   1. The Apostolic Constitutions are a compilation, the material being
   derived from sources differing in age.

   2. The first six books are the oldest; the seventh, in its present
   form, somewhat later, but, from its connection with the Teaching,
   proven to contain matter of a very ancient date. The eighth book is of
   latest date.

   3. It now seems to be generally admitted that the entire work is not
   later than the fourth century, although the usual allowance must be
   made for later textual changes, whether by accident or design.

   Dr. Von Drey [2525] regards the first six books as of Eastern origin
   (mainly Syrian), and to be assigned to the second half of the third
   century. The seventh and eighth were more recent, he thinks, but united
   with the others before a.d. 325. With this, Schaff (in his Church
   History, vol. ii, rev. ed., [267]p. 185) substantially agreed; but, in
   his later work on the Teaching, seems to assign the completion of the
   compilation to a date somewhat later. This is the view of Harnack, who,
   "by a critical analysis and comparison, comes to the conclusion [2526]
   that pseudo-Clement, alias pseudo-Ignatius, was a Eusebian, a
   semi-Arian, and rather worldly-minded anti-ascetic Bishop of Syria, a
   friend of the Emperor Constantius between 340 and 360; that he enlarged
   and adapted the Didascalia of the third and the Didache of the second
   century, as well as the Ignatian Epistles, to his own view of morals,
   worship, and discipline, and clothed them with Apostolic authority."
   [2527]

   This is, at all events, a more reasonable view than that of Krabbe, who
   assigns the first six books to the end of the third century, and the
   eighth to the beginning of the fifth. The latter, it is true, he
   regards a compilation from older sources. The purpose of the whole, in
   his view, was to confirm the episcopal hierarchy, and to establish the
   unity of the Catholic Church on the basis of the unity of the
   priesthood, etc. But it is now generally held that the purpose of the
   compilation was merely to present a manual of instruction, worship,
   polity, and usage for both clergy and laity. Had it been designed to
   further some ecclesiastical tendency, it would be far less valuable,
   since it would less fairly reproduce the ecclesiastical life of the age
   or ages in which it originated. Bishop Beveridge at first attributed
   the Constitutions to Clemens Alexandrinus (end of second century), but
   afterwards accepted the third century as the more probable date. The
   views now prevalent do full justice to his opinions, but seem to be
   better sustained in detail.

   The collection of Canons at the close of the Constitutions is
   undoubtedly a compilation. Some are evidently much more ancient than
   others, and there is every evidence that various collections or
   recensions existed. That of Dionysius (about a.d. 500), in Latin,
   contained fifty canons; that of John (Scholasticus) of Antioch (about
   a.d. 565) contained eighty-five canons: and "it is undeniable that the
   Greek copy which Dionysius had before him belonged to a different
   family of collections from that used by John Scholasticus, for they
   differ frequently, if not essentially, both in text and in the way of
   numbering the canons." [2528]

   Bishop Beveridge sought to trace these to the synods of the first two
   centuries, while Daillé held that the collection was made as late as
   the fifth century. The latter view is not generally accepted, though
   the existence of a variety of collections tells against some of the
   views of Bishop Beveridge. [2529] It is impossible to enter into a full
   discussion here. It seemed better to annotate the Canons from the
   results of Drey and Hefele, two most candid and scholarly
   Roman-Catholic investigators. [2530] The brief notes indicate the
   sources according to these authors. The reader will at once perceive
   from the views thus suggested, as well as from the contents of the
   Canons, that, while some canons are presumably quite ancient, a number
   belong to the fourth century, and that, as a complete collection, they
   cannot antedate the compilation of the Apostolic Constitutions. Indeed,
   Drey, who accepts the latter as Ante-Nicene (see above), thinks five of
   the canons (30, 67, 74, 81, 83) were derived from the canons of the
   Fourth OEcumenical Council at Chalcedon, a.d. 451, and quite a number
   of others he traces to synods and councils of the fourth century.
   Hefele doubts the positions taken by Drey in regard to most of these.
   He does not, however, insist that the collection is Ante-Nicene, while
   he traces the origin of many of the canons to the Apostolic
   Constitutions.

    [The following is Dr. Donaldson's Introductory Notice:--]


   There has always existed a great diversity of opinion as to the author
   and date of the Apostolical Constitutions Earlier writers were inclined
   to assign them to the apostolic age, and to Clement; but much
   discussion ensued, and the questions to which they give rise are still
   unsettled.

   The most peculiar opinion in regard to them is that of Whiston, who
   devoted a volume (vol. iii.) of his Primitive Christianity Revived to
   prove that "they are the most sacred of the canonical books of the New
   Testament;" for "these sacred Christian laws or constitutions were
   delivered at Jerusalem, and in Mount Sion, by our Saviour to the eleven
   apostles there assembled after His resurrection."

   Krabbe, who wrote an elaborate treatise on the origin and contents of
   the Apostolical Constitutions, tried to show that the first seven books
   were written "towards the end of the third century." The eighth book,
   he thinks, must have been written at the end of the fourth or beginning
   of the fifth.

   Bunsen thinks that, if we expunge a few interpolations of the fourth
   and fifth centuries, "we find ourselves unmistakeably in the midst of
   the life of the Church of the second and third centuries." [2531] "I
   think," he says, "I have proved in my analysis, more clearly than has
   been hitherto done, the Ante-Nicene origin of a book, or rather books,
   called by an early fiction Apostolical Constitutions, and consequently
   the still higher antiquity of the materials, both ecclesiastical and
   literary, which they contain. I have shown that the compilers made use
   of the Epistle of Barnabas, [2532] which belongs to the first half of
   the second century; that the eighth is an extract or transcript of
   Hippolytus; and that the first six books are so full of phrases found
   in the second interpolation of the Ignatian Epistles, that their last
   compiler, the author of the present text, must either have lived soon
   after that interpolation was made, or vice versa, or the interpolator
   and compiler must have been one and the same person. [2533] This last
   circumstance renders it probable that at least the first six books of
   the Greek compilation, like the Ignatian forgeries, [2534] were the
   produce of Asia Minor. Two points are self-evident--their Oriental
   origin, and that they belong neither to Antioch nor to Alexandria. I
   suppose nobody now will trace them to Palestine." [2535]

   Modern critics are equally at sea in determining the date of the
   collections of canons given at the end of the eighth book. Most believe
   that some of them belong to the apostolic age, while others are of a
   comparatively late date. The subject is very fully discussed in Krabbe.

   Bovius first gave a complete edition of the Constitutions (Venice,
   1563), but only in a Latin form. The Greek was first edited by the
   Jesuit Turrianus (Venice, 1563). It was reprinted several times.
   Cotelerius gave it in his Apostolical Fathers. In the second edition of
   this work, as prepared by Clericus (1724), the readings of two Vienna
   manuscripts were given. These V. mss. and Oxford ms. of book viii. are
   supposed by Bunsen to be nearer the original than the others, alike in
   what they give and in what they omit. The Constitutions have been
   edited by Ültzen (1853), and by Lagarde in Bunsen's Analecta
   Ante-Nicoena, vol. ii. (1854). Lagarde has partially introduced
   readings from the Syriac, Arabic, Æthiopic, and Coptic forms of the
   Constitutions. Whiston devoted the second volume of his Primitive
   Christianity to the Constitutions and Canons, giving both the Greek and
   English. It is his translation which we have republished, with
   considerable alterations. We have not deemed it necessary to give a
   tithe of the various readings, but have confined ourselves to those
   that seem important. We have also given no indication of the Syriac
   form of the first six books. We shall give this form by itself. The
   translation of Whiston was reprinted by Irah Chase, D.D., very
   carefully revised, with a translation of Krabbe's Essay on the Origin
   and Contents of the Constitutions, and his Dissertation on the Canons
   (New York, 1848). [2536]

constitutions of the holy apostles. [2537]

  Book I.

  Concerning the Laity.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Sec. I.--General Commandments.

   The apostles and elders to all those who from among the Gentiles have
   believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; grace and peace from Almighty God,
   through our Lord Jesus Christ, be multiplied unto you in the
   acknowledgment of Him.

   The Catholic Church is the plantation of God and His beloved vineyard;
   [2538] containing those who have believed in His unerring divine
   religion; who are the heirs by faith of His everlasting kingdom; who
   are partakers of His divine influence, and of the communication of the
   Holy Spirit; who are armed through Jesus, and have received His fear
   into their hearts; who enjoy the benefit of the sprinkling of the
   precious and innocent blood of Christ; who have free liberty to call
   Almighty God, Father; being fellow-heirs and joint-partakers of His
   beloved Son: hearken to this holy doctrine, you who enjoy His promises,
   as being delivered by the command of your Saviour, and agreeable to His
   glorious words. Take care, ye children of God, to do all things in
   obedience to God; and in all things please Christ our Lord. [2539] For
   if any man follows unrighteousness, and does those things that are
   contrary to the will of God, such a one will be esteemed by God as the
   disobedient heathen.

    Concerning Covetousness.

   I. Abstain, therefore, from all unlawful desires and injustice. For it
   is written in the law, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor
   his field, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor
   his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbour's;" [2540] for all coveting
   of these things is from the evil one. For he that covets his
   neighbour's wife, or his man-servant, or his maid-servant, is already
   in his mind an adulterer and a thief; and if he does not repent, is
   condemned by our Lord Jesus Christ: through whom [2541] glory be to God
   for ever, Amen. For He says in the Gospel, recapitulating, and
   confirming, and fulfilling the ten commandments of the law: "It is
   written in the law, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you,
   that is, I said in the law, by Moses. But now I say unto you myself,
   Whosoever shall look on his neighbour's wife to lust after her, hath
   committed adultery with her already in his heart." [2542] Such a one is
   condemned of adultery, who covets his neighbour's wife in his mind. But
   does not he that covets an ox or an ass design to steal them? to apply
   them to his own use, and to lead them away? Or, again, does not he that
   covets a field, and continues in such a disposition, wickedly contrive
   how to remove the landmarks, and to compel the possessor to part with
   somewhat for nothing? For as the prophet somewhere speaks: "Woe to
   those who join house to house, and lay field to field, that they may
   deprive their neighbour of somewhat which was his." [2543] Wherefore he
   says: "Must you alone inhabit the earth? For these things have been
   heard in the ears of the Lord of hosts." And elsewhere: "Cursed be he
   who removeth his neighbour's landmarks: and all the people shall say,
   Amen." [2544] Wherefore Moses says: "Thou shalt not remove thy
   neighbour's landmarks [2545] which thy fathers have set." [2546] Upon
   this account, therefore, terrors, death, tribunals, and condemnations
   follow such as these from God. But as to those who are obedient to God,
   there is one law of God, simple, [2547] true, living, which is this:
   "Do not that to another which thou hatest another should do to thee."
   [2548] Thou wouldst not that any one should look upon thy wife with an
   evil design to corrupt her; do not thou, therefore, look upon thy
   neighbour's wife with a wicked intention. Thou wouldst not that thy
   garment should be taken away; do not thou, therefore, take away
   another's. Thou wouldst not be beaten, reproached, affronted; do not
   thou, therefore, serve any other in the like manner.

    That We Ought Not to Return Injuries, Nor Revenge Ourselves on Him that Does
    Us Wrong.

   II. But if any one curse thee, do thou bless him. For it is written in
   the book of Numbers: "He that blesseth thee is blessed, and he that
   curseth thee is cursed." [2549] In the same manner it is written in the
   Gospel: "Bless them that curse you." [2550] Being injured, do not
   avenge yourselves, but bear it with patience; for the Scripture speaks
   thus: "Say not thou, I will avenge myself on my enemy for what injuries
   he has offered me; but acquiesce under them, that the Lord may right
   thee, and bring vengeance upon him who injures thee." [2551] For so
   says He again in the Gospel: "Love your enemies, do good to them that
   hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute
   you; and ye shall be the children of your Father which is in heaven:
   for He maketh His sun to shine on the evil and on the good, and raineth
   on the just and unjust." [2552] Let us therefore, beloved, attend to
   these commandments, that we may be found to be the children of light by
   doing them. Bear, therefore, with one another, ye servants and sons of
   God.

    Sec. II.--Commandments to Men.

    Concerning the Adornment of Ourselves, and the Sin Which Arises from Thence.

   Let the husband not be insolent nor arrogant towards his wife; but
   compassionate, bountiful, willing to please his own wife alone, [2553]
   and treat her honourably and obligingly, endeavouring to be agreeable
   to her; (III.) not adorning thyself in such a manner as may entice
   another woman to thee. For if thou art overcome by her, and sinnest
   with her, eternal death will overtake thee from God; and thou wilt be
   punished with sensible and bitter torments. Or if thou dost not
   perpetrate such a wicked act, but shakest her off, and refusest her, in
   this case thou art not wholly innocent, even though thou art not guilty
   of the crime itself, but only in so far as through thy adorning thou
   didst entice the woman to desire thee. For thou art the cause that the
   woman was so affected, and by her lusting after thee was guilty of
   adultery with thee: yet art thou not so guilty, because thou didst not
   send to her, who was ensnared by thee; nor didst thou desire her.
   Since, therefore, thou didst not deliver up thyself to her, thou shalt
   find mercy with the Lord thy God, who hath said, "Thou shalt not commit
   adultery," and, "Thou shalt not covet." [2554] For if such a woman,
   upon sight of thee, or unseasonable meeting with thee, was smitten in
   her mind, and sent to thee, but thou as a religious person didst refuse
   her, [2555] if she was wounded in her heart by thy beauty, and youth,
   and adorning, and fell in love with thee, thou wilt be found guilty of
   her transgressions, as having been the occasion of scandal to her,
   [2556] and shalt inherit a woe. [2557] Wherefore pray thou to the Lord
   God that no mischief may befall thee upon this account: for thou art
   not to please men, so as to commit sin; but God, so as to attain
   holiness of life, and be partaker of everlasting rest. That beauty
   which God and nature has bestowed on thee, do not further beautify; but
   modestly diminish it before men. Thus, do not thou permit the hair of
   thy head to grow too long, but rather cut it short; lest by a nice
   combing thy hair, and wearing it long, and anointing thyself, thou draw
   upon thyself such ensnared or ensnaring women. Neither do thou wear
   over-fine garments to seduce any; neither do thou, with an evil
   subtilty, affect over-fine stockings or shoes for thy feet, but only
   such as suit the measures of decency and usefulness. Neither do thou
   put a gold ring upon thy fingers; for all these ornaments are the signs
   of lasciviousness, which if thou be solicitous about in an indecent
   manner, thou wilt not act as becomes a good man: for it is not lawful
   for thee, a believer and a man of God, to permit the hair of thy head
   to grow long, and to brush it up together, nor to suffer it to spread
   abroad, nor to puff it up, nor by nice combing and platting to make it
   curl and shine; since that is contrary to the law, which says thus, in
   its additional precepts: "You shall not make to yourselves curls and
   round rasures." [2558] Nor may men destroy the hair of their beards,
   and unnaturally change the form of a man. For the law says: "Ye shall
   not mar your beards." [2559] For God the Creator has made this decent
   for women, but has determined that it is unsuitable for men. But if
   thou do these things to please men, in contradiction to the law, thou
   wilt be abominable with God, who created thee after His own image. If,
   therefore, thou wilt be acceptable to God, abstain from all those
   things which He hates, and do none of those things that are unpleasing
   to Him.

    That We Ought Not to Be Over-Curious About Those Who Live Wickedly, But to
    Be Intent Upon Our Own Proper Employment.

   IV. Thou shalt not be as a wanderer and gadder abroad, rambling about
   the streets, without just cause, to spy out such as live wickedly. But
   by minding thy own trade and employment, endeavour to do what is
   acceptable to God. And keeping in mind the oracles of Christ, meditate
   in the same continually. For so the Scripture says to thee: "Thou shalt
   meditate in His law day and night; when thou walkest in the field, and
   when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou liest down, and when
   thou risest up, that thou mayest have understanding in all things."
   [2560] Nay, although thou beest rich, and so dost not want a trade for
   thy maintenance, be not one that gads about, and walks abroad at
   random; but either go to some that are believers, and of the same
   religion, and confer and discourse with them about the lively oracles
   of God:--

    What Books of Scripture We Ought to Read.

   V. Or if thou stayest at home, read the books of the Law, of the Kings,
   with the Prophets; sing the hymns of David; and peruse diligently the
   Gospel, which is the completion of the other.

    That We Ought to Abstain from All the Books of Those that are Out of the
    Church.

   VI. Abstain from all the heathen books. For what hast thou to do with
   such foreign discourses, or laws, or false prophets, which subvert the
   faith of the unstable? For what defect dost thou find in the law of
   God, that thou shouldest have recourse to those heathenish fables? For
   if thou hast a mind to read history, thou hast the books of the Kings;
   if books of wisdom or poetry, thou hast those of the Prophets, of Job,
   and the Proverbs, in which thou wilt find greater depth of sagacity
   than in all the heathen poets and sophisters, because these are the
   words of the Lord, the only wise God. If thou desirest something to
   sing, thou hast the Psalms; if the origin of things, thou hast Genesis;
   if laws and statutes, thou hast the glorious law of the Lord God. Do
   thou therefore utterly abstain from all strange and diabolical books.
   Nay, when thou readest the law, think not thyself bound to observe the
   additional precepts; though not all of them, yet some of them. Read
   those barely for the sake of history, in order to the knowledge of
   them, and to glorify God that He has delivered thee from such great and
   so many bonds. Propose to thyself to distinguish what rules were from
   the law of nature, and what were added afterwards, or were such
   additional rules as were introduced and given in the wilderness to the
   Israelites after the making of the calf; for the law contains those
   precepts which were spoken by the Lord God before the people fell into
   idolatry, and made a calf like the Egyptian Apis--that is, the ten
   commandments. But as to those bonds which were further laid upon them
   after they had sinned, do not thou draw them upon thyself: for our
   Saviour came for no other reason but that He might deliver those that
   were obnoxious thereto from the wrath which was reserved far them, that
   [2561] He might fulfil the Law and the Prophets, and that He might
   abrogate or change those secondary bonds which were superadded to the
   rest of the law. For therefore did He call to us and say, "Come unto
   me, [2562] all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest." [2563] When, therefore, thou hast read the Law, which is
   agreeable to the Gospel and to the Prophets, read also the books of the
   Kings, that thou mayest thereby learn which of the kings were
   righteous, and how they were prospered by God, and how the promise of
   eternal life continued with them from Him; but those kings which went
   a-whoring from God did soon perish in their apostasy by the righteous
   judgment of God, and were deprived of His life, inheriting, instead of
   rest, eternal punishment. Wherefore by reading these books thou wilt be
   mightily strengthened in the faith, and edified in Christ, whose body
   and member thou art. Moreover, when thou walkest abroad in public, and
   hast a mind to bathe, make use of that bath which is appropriated to
   men, lest, by discovering thy body in an unseemly manner to women, or
   by seeing a sight not seemly for men, either thou beest ensnared, or
   thou ensnarest and enticest to thyself those women who easily yield to
   such temptations. [2564] Take care, therefore, and avoid such things,
   lest thou admit a snare upon thy own soul.

    Concerning a Bad Woman.

   VII. For let us learn what the sacred word says in the book of Wisdom:
   "My son, keep my words, and hide my commandments with thee. Say unto
   Wisdom, Thou art my sister; and make understanding familiar with thee:
   that she may keep thee from the strange and wicked woman, in case such
   a one accost thee with sweet words. For from the window of her house
   she looks into the street, to see if she can espy some young man among
   the foolish children, without understanding, walking in the
   market-place, in the meeting of the street near her house, and talking
   in the dusk of the evening, or in the silence and darkness of the
   night. A woman meets him in the appearance of an harlot, who steals
   away the hearts of young persons. She rambles about, and is dissolute;
   her feet abide not in her house: sometimes she is without, sometimes in
   the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner. Then she catches him,
   and kisses him, and with an impudent face says unto him, I have
   peace-offerings with me; this day do I pay my vows: therefore came I
   forth to meet thee; earnestly I have desired thy face, and I have found
   thee. I have decked my bed with coverings; with tapestry from Egypt
   have I adorned it. I have perfumed my bed with saffron, and my house
   with cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning;
   come, let us solace ourselves with love," etc. To which he adds: "With
   much discourse she seduced him, with snares from her lips she forced
   him. He goes after her like a silly bird." [2565] And again: "Do not
   hearken to a wicked woman; for though the lips of an harlot are like
   drops from an honey-comb, which for a while is smooth in thy throat,
   yet afterwards thou wilt find her more bitter than gall, and sharper
   than any two-edged sword." [2566] And again: "But get away quickly, and
   tarry not; fix not thine eyes upon her: for she hath thrown down many
   wounded; yea, innumerable multitudes have been slain by her." [2567]
   "If not," says he, "yet thou wilt repent at the last, when thy flesh
   and thy body are consumed, and wilt say, How have I hated instruction,
   and my heart has avoided the reproofs of the righteous! I have not
   hearkened to the voice of my instructor, nor inclined mine ear to my
   teacher. I have almost been in all evil." [2568] But we will make no
   more quotations; and if we have omitted any, be so prudent as to select
   the most valuable out of the Holy Scriptures, and confirm yourselves
   with them, rejecting all things that are evil, that so you may be found
   holy with God in eternal life.

    Sec. III.--Commandments to Women.

    Concerning the Subjection of a Wife to Her Husband, and that She Must Be
    Loving and Modest.

   VIII. Let the wife be obedient to her own proper husband, because "the
   husband is the head of the wife." [2569] But Christ is the head of that
   husband who walks in the way of righteousness; and "the head of Christ
   is God," even His Father. Therefore, O wife, next after the Almighty,
   our God and Father, the Lord of the present world and of the world to
   come, the Maker of everything that breathes, and of every power; and
   after His beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom [2570] glory
   be to God, do thou fear thy husband, and reverence him, pleasing him
   alone, rendering thyself acceptable to him in the several affairs of
   life, that so on thy account thy husband may be called blessed,
   according to the Wisdom of Solomon, which thus speaks: "Who can find a
   virtuous woman? for such a one is more precious than costly stones. The
   heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that she shall have
   no need of spoil: for she does good to her husband all the days of her
   life. She buyeth wool and flax, and worketh profitable things with her
   hands. She is like the merchants' ships, she bringeth her food from
   far. She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her
   household, and food to her maidens. She considereth a field, and buyeth
   it; with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth
   her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. She tasteth that
   it is good to labour; her lamp goeth not out all the whole night. She
   stretcheth out her arms for useful work, and layeth her hands to the
   spindle. She openeth her hands to the needy; yea, she reacheth forth
   her hands to the poor. Her husband takes no care of the affairs of his
   house; for all that are with her are clothed with double garments. She
   maketh coats for her husband, clothings of silk and purple. Her husband
   is eminent in the gates, when he sitteth with the elders of the land.
   She maketh fine linen, and selleth it to the Phoenicians, and girdles
   to the Canaanites. She is clothed with glory and beauty, and she
   rejoices in the last days. She openeth her mouth with wisdom and
   discretion, and puts her words in order. The ways of her household are
   strict; she eateth not the bread of idleness. She will open her mouth
   with wisdom and caution, and upon her tongue are the laws of mercy. Her
   children arise up and praise her for her riches, and her husband joins
   in her praises. Many daughters have obtained wealth and done worthily,
   but thou surpassest and excellest them all. May lying flatteries and
   the vain beauty of a wife be far from thee. For a religious wife is
   blessed. Let her praise the fear of the Lord: [2571] give her of the
   fruits of her lips, and let her husband be praised in the gates."
   [2572] And again: "A virtuous wife is a crown to her husband." [2573]
   And again: "Many wives have built an house." [2574] You have learned
   what great commendations a prudent and loving wife receives from the
   Lord God. If thou desirest to be one of the faithful, and to please the
   Lord, O wife, do not superadd ornaments to thy beauty, in order to
   please other men; neither affect to wear fine broidering, garments, or
   shoes, to entice those who are allured by such things. For although
   thou dost not these wicked things with design of sinning thyself, but
   only for the sake of ornament and beauty, yet wilt thou not so escape
   future punishment, as having compelled another to look so hard at thee
   as to lust after thee, and as not having taken care both to avoid sin
   thyself, and the affording scandal to others. But if thou yield thyself
   up, and commit the crime, thou art both guilty of thy own sin, and the
   cause of the ruin of the other's soul also. Besides, when thou hast
   committed lewdness with one man, and beginnest to despair, thou wilt
   again turn away from thy duty, and follow others, and grow past
   feeling; as says the divine word: "When a wicked man comes into the
   depth of evil, he becomes a scorner, and then disgrace and reproach
   come upon him." [2575] For such a woman afterward being wounded,
   ensnares without restraint the souls of the foolish. Let us learn,
   therefore, how the divine word triumphs over such women, saying: "I
   hated a woman who is a snare and net to the heart of men worse than
   death; her hands are fetters." [2576] And in another passage: "As a
   jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is beauty in a wicked woman."
   [2577] And again: "As a worm in wood, so does a wicked woman destroy
   her husband." [2578] And again: "It is better to dwell in the corner of
   the house-top, than with a contentious and an angry woman." [2579] You,
   therefore, who are Christian women, do not imitate such as these. But
   thou who designest to be faithful to thine own husband, take care to
   please him alone. And when thou art in the streets, cover thy head; for
   by such a covering thou wilt avoid being viewed of idle persons. Do not
   paint thy face, which is God's workmanship; for there is no part of
   thee which wants ornament, inasmuch as all things which God has made
   are very good. But the lascivious additional adorning of what is
   already good is an affront to the bounty of the Creator. Look downward
   when thou walkest abroad, veiling thyself as becomes women.

    That a Woman Must Not Bathe with Men.

   IX. Avoid also that disorderly practice of bathing in the same place
   with men; for many are the nets of the evil one. And let not a
   Christian woman bathe with an hermaphrodite; for if she is to veil her
   face, and conceal it with modesty from strange men, how can she bear to
   enter naked into the bath together with men? But if the bath be
   appropriated to women, let her bathe orderly, modestly, and moderately.
   But let her not bathe without occasion, nor much, nor often, nor in the
   middle of the day, nor, if possible, every day; and let the tenth hour
   of the day be the set time for such seasonable bathing. For it is
   convenient that thou, who art a Christian woman, shouldst ever
   constantly avoid a curiosity which has many eyes.

    Concerning a Contentious and Brawling Woman.

   X. But as to a spirit of contention, be sure to curb it as to all men,
   but principally as to thine husband; lest, if he be an unbeliever or an
   heathen, he may have an occasion of scandal or of blaspheming God, and
   thou be partaker of a woe from God. For, says He, "Woe to him by whom
   My name is blasphemed among the Gentiles;" [2580] and lest, if thy
   husband be a Christian, he be forced, from his knowledge of the
   Scriptures, to say that which is written in the book of Wisdom: "It is
   better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry
   woman." [2581] You wives, therefore, demonstrate your piety by your
   modesty and meekness to all without the Church, whether they be women
   or men, in order to their conversion and improvement in the faith. And
   since we have warned you, and instructed you briefly, whom we do esteem
   our sisters, daughters, and members, as being wise yourselves,
   persevere all your lives in an unblameable course of life. Seek to know
   such kinds of learning whereby you may arrive at the kingdom of our
   Lord, and please Him, and so rest for ever and ever. Amen.

  Book II.

  Of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Sec. I.--On Examining Candidates for the Episcopal Office.

    That a Bishop Must Be Well Instructed and Experienced in the Word.

   I. But concerning bishops, we have heard from our Lord, that a pastor
   who is to be ordained a bishop for the churches in every parish, must
   be unblameable, unreprovable, free from all kinds of wickedness common
   among men, not under fifty years of age; for such a one is in good part
   past youthful disorders, and the slanders of the heathen, as well as
   the reproaches which are sometimes cast upon many persons by some false
   brethren, who do not consider the word of God in the Gospel: "Whosoever
   speaketh an idle word shall give an account thereof to the Lord in the
   day of judgment." [2582] And again: "By thy words thou shalt be
   justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned." [2583] Let him
   therefore, if it is possible, be well educated; but if he be
   unlettered, let him at any rate be [2584] skilful in the word, and of
   competent age. But if in a small parish one advanced in years is not to
   be found, [2585] let some younger person, who has a good report among
   his neighbours, and is esteemed by them worthy of the office of a
   bishop,--who has carried himself from his youth with meekness and
   regularity, like a much elder person,--after examination, and a general
   good report, be ordained in peace. For Solomon at twelve years of age
   was king of Israel, [2586] and Josiah at eight years of age reigned
   righteously, [2587] and in like manner Joash governed the people at
   seven years of age. [2588] Wherefore, although the person be young, let
   him be meek, gentle, and quiet. For the Lord God says by Esaias: "Upon
   whom will I look, but upon him who is humble and quiet, and always
   trembles at my words?" [2589] In like manner it is in the Gospel also:
   "Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth." [2590] Let
   him also be merciful; for again it is said: "Blessed are the merciful:
   for they shall obtain mercy." [2591] Let him also be a peacemaker; for
   again it is said: "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be
   called the sons of God." [2592] Let him also be one of a good
   conscience, purified from all evil, and wickedness, and
   unrighteousness; for it is said again: "Blessed are the pure in heart:
   for they shall see God." [2593]

    What Ought to Be the Characters of a Bishop and of the Rest of the Clergy.

   II. Let him therefore be sober, prudent, decent, firm, stable, not
   given to wine; no striker, but gentle; not a brawler, not covetous;
   "not a novice, lest, being puffed up with pride, he fall into
   condemnation, and the snare of the devil: for every one that exalteth
   himself shall be abased." [2594] Such a one a bishop ought to be, who
   has been the "husband of one wife," [2595] who also has herself had no
   other husband, "ruling well his own house." [2596] In this manner let
   examination be made when he is to receive ordination, and to be placed
   in his bishopric, whether he be grave, faithful, decent; whether he
   hath a grave and faithful wife, or has formerly had such a one; whether
   he hath educated his children piously, and has "brought them up in the
   nurture and admonition of the Lord;" [2597] whether his domestics do
   fear and reverence him, and are all obedient to him: for if those who
   are immediately about him for worldly concerns are seditious and
   disobedient, how will others not of his family, when they are under his
   management, become obedient to him?

    In What Things a Bishop is to Be Examined Before He is Ordained.

   III. Let examination also be made whether he be unblameable as to the
   concerns of this life; for it is written: "Search diligently for all
   the faults of him who is to be ordained for the priesthood." [2598]

    Sec. II.--On the Character and Teaching of the Bishop.

   On which account let him also be void of anger; for Wisdom says: "Anger
   destroys even the prudent." [2599] Let him also be merciful, of a
   generous and loving temper; for our Lord says: "By this shall all men
   know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another." [2600] Let him
   be also ready to give, a lover of the widow and the stranger; ready to
   serve, and minister, and attend; resolute in his duty; and let him know
   who is the most worthy of his assistance.

    That Charitable Distributions are Not to Be Made to Every Widow, But that
    Sometimes a Woman Who Has a Husband is to Be Preferred: and that No
    Distributions are to Be Made to Any One Who is Given to Gluttony,
    Drunkenness, and Idleness.

   IV. For if there be a widow who is able to support herself, and another
   woman who is not a widow, but is needy by reason of sickness, or the
   bringing up many children, or infirmity of her hands, let him stretch
   out his hand in charity rather to this latter. But if any one be in
   want by gluttony, drunkenness, or idleness, he does not deserve any
   assistance, or to be esteemed a member of the Church of God. For the
   Scripture, speaking of such persons, says: "The slothful hideth his
   hand in his bosom, and is not able to bring it to his mouth again."
   [2601] And again: "The sluggard folds up his hands, and eats his own
   flesh." [2602] "For every drunkard and whoremonger shall come to
   poverty, and every drowsy person shall be clothed with tatters and
   rags." [2603] And in another passage: "If thou give thine eyes to
   drinking and cups, thou shalt afterwards walk more naked than a
   pestle." [2604] For certainly idleness is the mother of famine.

    That a Bishop Must Be No Accepter of Persons in Judgment; That He Must
    Possess a Gentle Disposition, and Be Temperate in His Mode of Life.

   V. A bishop must be no accepter of persons; neither revering nor
   flattering a rich man contrary to what is right, nor overlooking nor
   domineering over a poor man. For, says God to Moses, "Thou shalt not
   accept the person of the rich, nor shalt thou pity a poor man in his
   cause: for the judgment is the Lord's." [2605] And again: "Thou shalt
   with exact justice follow that which is right." [2606] Let a bishop be
   frugal, and contented with a little in his meat and drink, that he may
   be ever in a sober frame, and disposed to instruct and admonish the
   ignorant; and let him not be costly in his diet, a pamperer of himself,
   given to pleasure, or fond of delicacies. Let him he patient and gentle
   in his admonitions, well instructed himself, meditating in and
   diligently studying the Lord's books, and reading them frequently, that
   so he may be able carefully to interpret the Scriptures, expounding the
   Gospel in correspondence with the prophets and with the law; and let
   the expositions from the law and the prophets correspond to the Gospel.
   For the Lord Jesus says: "Search the Scriptures; for they are those
   which testify of me." [2607] And again: "For Moses wrote of me." [2608]
   But, above all, let him carefully distinguish between the original law
   and the additional precepts, and show which are the laws for believers,
   and which the bonds for the unbelievers, lest any should fall under
   those bonds. Be careful, therefore, O bishop, to study the word, that
   thou mayest be able to explain everything exactly, and that thou mayest
   copiously nourish thy people with much doctrine, and enlighten them
   with the light of the law; for God says: "Enlighten yourselves with the
   light of knowledge, while we have yet opportunity." [2609]

    That a Bishop Must Not Be Given to Filthy Lucre, Nor Be a Surety Nor an
    Advocate.

   VI. Let not a bishop be given to filthy lucre, especially before the
   Gentiles, rather suffering than offering injuries; not covetous, nor
   rapacious; no purloiner; no admirer of the rich, nor hater of the poor;
   no evil-speaker, nor false witness; not given to anger; no brawler; not
   entangled with the affairs of this life; not a surety for any one, nor
   an accuser in suits about money; not ambitious; not double-minded, nor
   double-tongued; not ready to hearken to calumny or evil-speaking; not a
   dissembler; not addicted to the heathen festivals; not given to vain
   deceits; not eager after worldly things, nor a lover of money. For all
   these things are opposite to God, and pleasing to demons. Let the
   bishop earnestly give all these precepts in charge to the laity also,
   persuading them to imitate his conduct. For, says He, "Do ye make the
   children of Israel pious." [2610] Let him be prudent, humble, apt to
   admonish with the instructions of the Lord, well-disposed, one who has
   renounced all the wicked projects of this world, and all heathenish
   lusts; let hint be orderly, sharp in observing the wicked, and taking
   heed of them, but yet a friend to all; just, discerning; and whatsoever
   qualities are commendable among men, let the bishop possess them in
   himself. For if the pastor be unblameable as to any wickedness, he will
   compel his own disciples, and by his very mode of life press them to
   become worthy imitators of his own actions. As the prophet somewhere
   says, "And it will be, as is the priest, so is the people;" [2611] for
   our Lord and Teacher Jesus Christ, the Son [2612] of God, began first
   to do, and then to teach, as Luke somewhere says: [2613] "which Jesus
   began to do and to teach." [2614] Wherefore he says: "Whosoever shall
   do and teach, he shall be called great in the kingdom of God." [2615]
   For you bishops are to be guides and watchmen to the people, as you
   yourselves have Christ for your guide and watchman. Do you therefore
   become good guides and watchmen to the people of God. For the Lord says
   by Ezekiel, speaking to every one of you: "Son of man, I have given
   thee for a watchman to the house of Israel; and thou shalt hear the
   word from my mouth, and shalt observe, and shalt declare it from me.
   When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not
   speak to warn the wicked from his wickedness, that wicked man shall die
   in his iniquity, and his blood will I require at thine hand. But if
   thou warn the wicked from his way, that he may turn from it, and he
   does not turn from it, he shall die in his iniquity, and thou hast
   delivered thy soul." [2616] "In the same manner, if the sword of war be
   approaching, and the people set a watchman to watch, and he see the
   same approach, and does not forewarn them, and the sword come and take
   one of them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood shall be
   required at the watchman's hand, because he did not blow the trumpet.
   But if he blew the trumpet, and he who heard it would not take warning,
   and the sword come and take him away, his blood shall be upon him,
   because he heard the trumpet and took not warning. But he who took
   warning has delivered his soul; and the watchman, because he gave
   warning, shall surely live." [2617] The sword here is the judgment; the
   trumpet is the holy Gospel; the watchman is the bishop, who is set in
   the Church, who is obliged by his preaching to testify and vehemently
   to forewarn [2618] concerning that judgment. If ye do not declare and
   testify this to the people, the sins of those who are ignorant of it
   will be found upon you. Wherefore do you warn and reprove the
   uninstructed with boldness, teach the ignorant, confirm those that
   understand, bring back those that go astray. If we repeat the very same
   things on the same occasions, brethren, we shall not do amiss. For by
   frequent hearing it is to be hoped that some will be made ashamed, and
   at least do some good action, and avoid some wicked one. For says God
   by the prophet: "Testify those things to them; perhaps they will hear
   thy voice." [2619] And again: "If perhaps they will hear, if perhaps
   they will submit." [2620] Moses also says to the people: "If hearing
   thou wilt hear the Lord God, and do that which is good and right in His
   eyes." [2621] And again: [2622] "Hear, O Israel; the Lord our God is
   one Lord." [2623] And our Lord is often recorded in the Gospel to have
   said: "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." [2624] And wise
   Solomon says: "My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and reject
   not the laws of thy mother." [2625] And, indeed, to this day men have
   not heard; for while they seem to have heard, they have not heard
   aright, as appears by their having left the one and only true God, and
   their being drawn into destructive and dangerous heresies, concerning
   which we shall speak again afterwards.

    Sec. III.--How the Bishop is to Treat the Innocent, the Guilty, and the
    Penitent.

    What Ought to Be the Character of the Initiated.

   VII. Beloved, be it known to you that those who are baptized into the
   death of our Lord Jesus are obliged to go on no longer in sin; for as
   those who are dead cannot work wickedness any longer, so those who are
   dead with Christ cannot practice wickedness. We do not therefore
   believe, brethren, that any one who has received the washing of life
   continues in the practice of the licentious acts of transgressors. Now
   he who sins after his baptism, unless he repent and forsake his sins,
   shall be condemned to hell-fire.

    Concerning a Person Falsely Accused, or a Person Convicted.

   VIII. But if any one be maliciously prosecuted by the heathen, because
   he will not still go along with them to the same excess of riot, let
   him know that such a one is blessed of God, according as our Lord says
   in the Gospel: "Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, or
   persecute you, or say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
   sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for your reward is great in
   heaven." [2626] If, therefore, any one be slandered and falsely
   accused, such a one is blessed; for the Scripture says, "A man that is
   a reprobate is not tried by God." [2627] But if any one be convicted as
   having done a wicked action, such a one not only hurts himself, but
   occasions the whole body of the Church and its doctrine to be
   blasphemed; as if we Christians did not practice those things that we
   declare to be good and honest, and we ourselves shall be reproached by
   the Lord, that "they say and do not." [2628] Wherefore the bishop must
   boldly reject such as these upon full conviction, unless they change
   their course of life.

    That a Bishop Ought Not to Receive Bribes.

   IX. For the bishop must not only himself give no offence, but must be
   no respecter of persons; in meekness instructing those that offend. But
   if he himself has not a good conscience, and is a respecter of persons
   for the sake of filthy lucre, and receiving of bribes, and spares the
   open offender, and permits him to continue in the Church, he disregards
   the voice of God and of our Lord, which says, "Thou shalt exactly
   execute right judgment." [2629] "Thou shalt not accept persons in
   judgment: thou shalt not justify the ungodly." [2630] "Thou shalt not
   receive gifts against any one's life; for gifts do blind the eyes of
   the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous." [2631] And elsewhere
   He says: "Take away from among yourselves that wicked person." [2632]
   And Solomon says in his Proverbs: "Cast out a pestilent fellow from the
   congregation, and strife will go out along with him." [2633]

    That a Bishop Who by Wrong Judgment Spares an Offender is Himself Guilty.

   X. But he who does not consider these things, will, contrary to
   justice, spare him who deserves punishment; as Saul spared Agag, [2634]
   and Eli [2635] his sons, "who knew not the Lord." Such a one profanes
   his own dignity, and that Church of God which is in his parish. Such a
   one is esteemed unjust before God and holy men, as affording occasion
   of scandal to many of the newly baptized, and to the catechumens; as
   also to the youth of both sexes, to whom a woe belongs, add "a
   mill-stone about his neck," [2636] and drowning, on account of his
   guilt. For, observing what a person their governor is, through his
   wickedness and neglect of justice they will grow sceptical, and,
   indulging the same disease, will be compelled to perish with him; as
   was the case of the people joining with Jeroboam, [2637] and those
   which were in the conspiracy with Corah. [2638] But if the offender
   sees that the bishop and deacons are innocent and unblameable, and the
   flock pure, he will either not venture to despise their authority, and
   to enter into the Church of God at all, as one smitten by his own
   conscience: or if he values nothing, and ventures to enter in, either
   he will be convicted immediately, as Uzza [2639] at the ark, when he
   touched it to support it; and as Achan, [2640] when he stole the
   accursed thing; and as Gehazi, [2641] when he coveted the money of
   Naaman, and so will be immediately punished: or else he will be
   admonished by the pastor, and drawn to repentance. For when he looks
   round the whole Church one by one, and can spy no blemish, neither in
   the bishop nor in the people who are under his care, he will be put to
   confusion, and pricked at the heart, and in a peaceable manner will go
   his way with shame and many tears, and the flock will remain pure. He
   will apply himself to God with tears, and will repent of his sins, and
   have hope. Nay, the whole flock, at the sight of his tears, will be
   instructed, because a sinner avoids destruction by repentance.

    How a Bishop Ought to Judge Offenders.

   XI. Upon this account, therefore, O bishop, endeavour to be pure in thy
   actions, and to adorn thy place and dignity, which is that of one
   sustaining the character of God among men, as being set over all men,
   over priests, kings, rulers, fathers, children, teachers, and in
   general over all those who are subject to thee: and so sit in the
   Church when thou speakest, as having authority to judge offenders. For
   to you, O bishops, it is said: "Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
   be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be
   loosed in heaven." [2642]

    Instruction as to How a Bishop Ought to Behave Himself to the Penitent.

   XII. Do thou therefore, O bishop, judge with authority like God, yet
   receive the penitent; for God is a God of mercy. Rebuke those that sin,
   admonish those that are not converted, exhort those that stand to
   persevere in their goodness, receive the penitent; for the Lord God has
   promised with an oath to afford remission to the penitent for what
   things they have done amiss. For He says by Ezekiel: "Speak unto them,
   As I live, saith the Lord, I would not the death of a sinner, but that
   the wicked turn from his evil way, and live. Turn ye therefore front
   your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?" [2643] Here
   the word [2644] affords hope to sinners, that if they will repent they
   shall have hope of salvation, lest otherwise out of despair they yield
   themselves up to their transgressions; but that, having hope of
   salvation, they may he converted, and may address to God with tears, on
   account of their sins, and may repent from their hearts, and so appease
   His displeasure towards them; so shall they receive a pardon from Him,
   as from a merciful Father.

    That We Ought to Beware How We Make Trial of Any Sinful Course.

   XIII. Yet it is very necessary that those who are yet innocent should
   continue so, and not make an experiment what sin is, that they may not
   have occasion for trouble, sorrow, and those lamentations which are in
   order to forgiveness. For how dost thou know, O man, when thou sinnest,
   whether thou shalt live any number of days in this present state, that
   thou mayest have time to repent? For the time of thy departure out of
   this world is uncertain; and if thou diest in sin, there will remain no
   repentance for thee; as God says by David, "In the grave who will
   confess to Thee?" [2645] It behoves us, therefore, to be ready in the
   doing of our duty, that so we may await our passage into another world
   without sorrow. Wherefore also the Divine Word exhorts, speaking to
   thee by the wise Solomon, [2646] "Prepare thy works against thy exit,
   and provide all beforehand in the field," [2647] lest some of the
   things necessary to thy journey be wanting; as the oil of piety was
   deficient in the five foolish virgins [2648] mentioned in the Gospel,
   when they, on account of their having extinguished their lamps of
   divine knowledge, were shut out of the bride-chamber. Wherefore he who
   values the security of his soul will take care to be out of danger, by
   keeping free from sin, that so he may preserve the advantage of his
   former good works to himself. Do thou, therefore, so judge as executing
   judgment for God. For, as the Scripture says, "the judgment is the
   Lord's." [2649] In the first place, therefore, condemn the guilty
   person with authority; afterwards try to bring him home with mercy and
   compassion, and readiness to receive him, promising him salvation if he
   will change his course of life, and become a penitent; and when he does
   repent, and has submitted to his chastisement, receive him: remembering
   that our Lord has said, "There is joy in heaven over one sinner that
   repenteth." [2650]

    Concerning Those Who Affirm that Penitents are Not to Be Received into the
    Church. That a Righteous Person, Although He Converse with a Sinner, Will
    Not Perish with Him. That No Person is Punished for Another, But Every One
    Must Give an Account of Himself. That We Must Assist Those Who are Weak in
    the Faith; And that a Bishop Must Not Be Governed by Any Turbulent Person
    Among the Laity.

   XIV. But if thou refusest to receive him that repents, thou exposest
   him to those who lie in wait to destroy, forgetting what David says:
   "Deliver not my soul, which confesses to Thee, unto destroying beasts."
   [2651] Wherefore Jeremiah, when he is exhorting men to repentance, says
   thus: "Shall not he that falleth arise? or he that turneth away, cannot
   he return? Wherefore have my people gone back by a shameless
   backsliding? and they are hardened in their purpose. [2652] Turn, ye
   backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings." [2653]
   Receive, therefore, without any doubting, him that repents. Be not
   hindered by such unmerciful men, who say that we must not be defiled
   with such as those, nor so much as speak to them: for such advice is
   from men that are unacquainted with God and His providence, and are
   unreasonable judges, and unmerciful brutes. These men are ignorant that
   we ought to avoid society with offenders, not in discourse, but in
   actions: for "the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and
   the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him." [2654] And again: "If
   a land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously, and I stretch out
   my hand upon it, and break the staff of bread upon it, and send famine
   upon it, and destroy man and beast therein: though these three men,
   Noah, Job, and Daniel, were in the midst of it, they shall only save
   their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God." [2655] The
   Scripture most clearly shows that a righteous man that converses with a
   wicked man does not perish with him. For in the present world the
   righteous and the wicked are mingled together in the common affairs of
   life, but not in holy communion: and in this the friends and favourites
   of God are guilty of no sin. For they do but imitate "their Farther
   which is in heaven, who maketh His sun to rise on the righteous and
   unrighteous, and sendeth His rain on the evil and on the good;" [2656]
   and the righteous man undergoes no peril on this account. For those who
   conquer and those who are conquered are in the same place of running,
   but only those who have bravely undergone the race are where the
   garland is bestowed; and "no one is crowned, unless he strive
   lawfully." [2657] For every one shall give account of himself, and God
   will not destroy the righteous with the wicked; for with Him it is a
   constant rule, that innocence is never punished. For neither did He
   drown Noah, nor burn up Lot, nor destroy Rahab for company. And if you
   desire to know how this matter was among us, Judas was one of us, and
   took the like part of the ministry which we had; and Simon the magician
   received the seal of the Lord. Yet both the one and the other proving
   wicked, the former hanged himself, and the latter, as he flew in the
   air in a manner unnatural, was dashed against the earth. Moreover, Noah
   and his sons with him were in the ark; but Ham, who alone was found
   wicked, received punishment in his son. [2658] But if fathers are not
   punished for their children, nor children for their fathers, it is
   thence clear that neither will wives be punished for their husbands,
   nor servants for their masters, nor one relation for another, nor one
   friend for another, nor the righteous for the wicked. But every one
   will be required an account of his own doing. For neither was
   punishment inflicted on Noah for the world, nor was Lot destroyed by
   fire for the Sodomites, nor was Rahab slain for the inhabitants of
   Jericho, nor Israel for the Egyptians. For not the dwelling together,
   but the agreement in their sentiments, alone could condemn the
   righteous with the wicked. We ought not therefore to hearken to such
   persons who call for death, and hate mankind, and love accusations, and
   under fair pretences bring men to death. For one man shall not die for
   another, but "every one is held with the chains of his own sins."
   [2659] And, "behold, the man and his work is before his face." [2660]
   Now we ought to assist those who are with us, [2661] and are in danger,
   and fall, and, as far as lies in our power, to reduce them to sobriety
   by our exhortations, and so save them from death. For "the whole have
   no need of the physician, but the sick;" [2662] since "it is not
   pleasing in the sight of your Father that one of these little ones
   should perish." [2663] For we ought not to establish the will of
   hard-hearted men, but the will of the God and Father of the universe,
   which is revealed to us by Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom be glory for
   ever. Amen.

   For it is not equitable that thou, O bishop, who art the head, shouldst
   submit to the tail, that is, to some seditious person among the laity,
   to the destruction of another, but to God alone. For it is thy
   privilege to govern those under thee, but not to be governed by them.
   For neither does a son, who is subject by the course of generation,
   govern his father; nor a slave, who is subject by law, govern his
   master; nor does a scholar govern his teacher, nor a soldier his king,
   nor any of the laity his bishop. For that there is no reason to suppose
   that such as converse with the wicked, in order to their instruction in
   the word, are defiled by or partake of their sins, Ezekiel, as it were
   on purpose preventing the suspicions of ill-disposed persons, says
   thus: "Why do you speak this proverb concerning the land of Israel? The
   fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on
   edge. As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not henceforth have
   occasion to use this proverb in Israel. For all souls are mine, in like
   manner as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine:
   the soul that sinneth, it shall die. But the man who is righteous, and
   does judgment and justice" (and so the prophet reckons up the rest of
   the virtues, and then adds for a conclusion, "Such a one is just"), "he
   shall surely live, saith the Lord God. And if he beget a son who is a
   robber, a shedder of blood, and walks not in the way of his righteous
   father" (and when the prophet had added what follows, he adds in the
   conclusion), "he shall certainly not live: he has done all this
   wickedness; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him. Yet they
   will ask thee, Why? Does not the son bear the iniquity of the father;
   or his righteousness, having exercised righteousness and mercy himself?
   And thou shalt say unto them, The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The
   son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not
   bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall
   be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him."
   [2664] And a little after he says: "When the righteous turneth away
   from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, all his righteousness,
   by reason of all his wickedness which he has committed, shall not be
   mentioned to him: in his iniquity which he hath committed, and in his
   sin which he hath sinned, in them shall he die." And a little after he
   adds: "When the wicked turneth away from his wickedness which he hath
   committed, and doth judgment and justice, he hath preserved his soul,
   he hath turned away from all his ungodliness which he hath done; he
   shall surely live, he shall not die." And afterwards: "I will judge
   every one of you according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the
   Lord God."

    That a Priest Must Neither Overlook Offences, Nor Be Rash in Punishing Them.

   XV. Observe, you who are our beloved sons, how merciful yet righteous
   the Lord our God is; how gracious and kind to men; and yet most
   certainly "He will not acquit the guilty:" [2665] though He welcomes
   the returning sinner, and revives him, leaving no room for suspicion to
   such as wish to judge sternly and to reject offenders entirely, and to
   refuse to vouchsafe to them exhortations which might bring them to
   repentance. In contradiction to such, God by Isaiah says to the
   bishops: "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, ye priests: speak
   comfortably to Jerusalem." It therefore behoves you, upon hearing those
   words of His, to encourage those who have offended, and lead them to
   repentance, and afford them hope, and not vainly to suppose that you
   shall be partakers of their offences on account of such your love to
   them. Receive the penitent with alacrity, and rejoice over them, and
   with mercy and bowels of compassion judge the sinners. For if a person
   was walking by the side of a river, and ready to stumble, and thou
   shouldest push him and thrust him into the river, instead of offering
   him thy hand for his assistance, thou wouldst be guilty of the murder
   of thy brother; whereas thou oughtest rather to lend thy helping hand
   as he was ready to fall, lest he perish without remedy, that both the
   people may take warning, and the offender may not utterly perish. It is
   thy duty, O bishop, neither to overlook the sins of the people, nor to
   reject those who are penitent, that thou mayst not unskilfully destroy
   the Lord's flock, or dishonour His new name, which is imposed on His
   people, and thou thyself beest reproached as those ancient pastors
   were, of whom God speaks thus to Jeremiah: "Many shepherds have
   destroyed my vineyard; they have polluted my heritage." [2666] And in
   another passage: "My anger is waxed hot against the shepherds, and
   against the lambs shall I have indignation." [2667] And elsewhere: "Ye
   are the priests that dishonour my name." [2668]

    Of Repentance, the Manner of It, and Rules About It.

   XVI. When thou seest the offender, with severity command him to be cast
   out; and as he is going out, let the deacons also treat him with
   severity, and then let them go and seek for him, and detain him out of
   the Church; and when they come in, let them entreat thee for him. For
   our Saviour Himself entreated His Father for those who had sinned, as
   it is written in the Gospel: "Father, forgive them; for they know not
   what they do." [2669] Then order the offender to come in; and if upon
   examination thou findest that he is penitent, and fit to be received at
   all into the Church when thou hast afflicted him his days of fasting,
   according to the degree of his offence--as two, three, five, or seven
   weeks--so set him at liberty, and speak such things to him as are fit
   to be said in way of reproof, instruction, and exhortation to a sinner
   for his reformation, that so he may continue privately in his humility,
   and pray to God to be merciful to him, saying: "If Thou, O Lord,
   shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who should stand? For with Thee
   there is propitiation." [2670] Of this sort of declaration is that
   which is said in the book of Genesis to Cain: "Thou hast sinned; be
   quiet;" [2671] that is, do not go on in sin. For that a sinner ought to
   be ashamed for his own sin, that oracle of God delivered to Moses
   concerning Miriam is a sufficient proof, when he prayed that she might
   be forgiven. For says God to him: "If her father had spit in her face,
   should she not be ashamed? Let her be shut out of the camp seven days,
   and afterwards let her come in again." [2672] We therefore ought to do
   so with offenders, when they profess their repentance,--namely, to
   separate them some determinate time, according to the proportion of
   their offence, and afterwards, like fathers to children, receive them
   again upon their repentance.

    That a Bishop Must Be Unblameable, and a Pattern for Those Who are Under His
    Charge.

   XVII. But if the bishop himself be an offender, how will he be able any
   longer to prosecute the offence of another? Or how will he be able to
   reprove another, either he or his deacons, if by accepting of persons,
   or receiving of bribes, they have not all a clear conscience? For when
   the ruler asks, and the judge receives, judgment is not brought to
   perfection; but when both are "companions of thieves, and regardless of
   doing justice to the widows," [2673] those who are under the bishop
   will not be able to support and vindicate him: for they will say to him
   what is written in the Gospel, "Why beholdest thou the mote that is in
   thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own
   eye?" [2674] Let the bishop, therefore, with his deacons, dread to bear
   any such thing; that is, let him give no occasion for it. For an
   offender, when he sees any other doing as bad as himself, will be
   encouraged to do the very same things; and then the wicked one, taking
   occasion from a single instance, works in others, which God forbid: and
   by that means the flock will be destroyed. For the greater number of
   offenders there are, the greater is the mischief that is done by them:
   for sin which passes without correction grows worse and worse, and
   spreads to others; since "a little leaven infects the whole lump,"
   [2675] and one thief spreads the abomination over a whole nation and
   "dead flies spoil the whole pot of sweet ointment;" [2676] and "when a
   king hearkens to unrighteous counsel, all the servants under him are
   wicked." [2677] So one scabbed sheep, if not separated from those that
   are whole, infects the rest with the same distemper; and a man infected
   with the plague is to be avoided by all men; and a mad dog is dangerous
   to every one that he touches. If, therefore, we neglect to separate the
   transgressor from the Church of God, we shall make the "Lord's house a
   den of thieves." [2678] For it is the bishop's duty not to be silent in
   the case of offenders, but to rebuke them, to exhort them, to beat them
   down, to afflict them with fastings, that so he may strike a pious
   dread into the rest: for, as He says, "make ye the children of Israel
   pious." [2679] For the bishop must be one who discourages sin by his
   exhortations, and sets a pattern of righteousness, and proclaims those
   good things which are prepared by God, and declares that wrath which
   will come at the day of judgment, lest he contemn and neglect the
   plantation of God; and, on account of his carelessness, hear that which
   is said in Hosea: "Why have ye held your peace at impiety, and have
   reaped the fruit thereof?" [2680]

    That a Bishop Must Take Care that His People Do Not Sin, Considering that He
    is Set for a Watchman Among Them.

   XVIII. Let the bishop, therefore, extend his concern to all sorts of
   people: to those who have not offended, that they may continue
   innocent; to those who offend, that they may repent. For to you does
   the Lord speak thus: "Take heed that ye offend not one of these little
   ones." [2681] It is your duty also to give remission to the penitent.
   For as soon as ever one who has offended says, in the sincerity of his
   soul, "I have sinned against the Lord," the Holy Spirit answers, "The
   Lord also hath forgiven thy sin; be of good cheer, thou shalt not die."
   [2682] Be sensible, therefore, O bishop, of the dignity of thy place,
   that as thou hast received the power of binding, so hast thou also that
   of loosing. Having therefore the power of loosing, know thyself, and
   behave thyself in this world as becomes thy place, being aware that
   thou hast a great account to give. "For to whom," as the Scripture
   says, "men have entrusted much, of him they will require the more."
   [2683] For no one man is free from sin, excepting Him that was made man
   for us; since it is written: "No man is pure from filthiness; no, not
   though he be but one day old." [2684] Upon which account the lives and
   conduct of the ancient holy men and patriarchs are described; not that
   we may reproach them from our reading, but that we ourselves may
   repent, and have hope that we also shall obtain forgiveness. For their
   blemishes are to us both security and admonition, because we hence
   learn, when we have offended, that if we repent we shall have pardon.
   For it is written: "Who can boast that he has a clean heart? and who
   dare affirm that he is pure from sin?" [2685] No man, therefore, is
   without sin. Do thou therefore labour to the utmost of thy power to be
   unblameable; and be solicitous of all the parts of thy flock, lest any
   one be scandalized on thy account, and thereby perish. For the layman
   is solicitous only for himself, but thou for all, as having a greater
   burden, and carrying a heavier load. For it is written: "And the Lord
   said unto Moses, Thou and Aaron shall bear the sins of the priesthood."
   [2686] Since, therefore, thou art to give an account of all, take care
   of all. Preserve those that are sound, admonish those that sin; and
   when thou hast afflicted them with fasting, give them ease by
   remission; and when with tears the offender begs readmission, receive
   him, and let the whole Church pray for him; and when by imposition of
   thy hand thou hast admitted him, give him leave to abide afterwards in
   the flock. But for the drowsy and the careless, do thou endeavour to
   convert and confirm, and warn and cure them, as sensible how great a
   reward thou shalt have for doing so, and how great danger thou wilt
   incur if thou beest negligent therein. For Ezekiel speaks thus to those
   overseers who take no care of the people: "Woe unto the shepherds of
   Israel, for they have fed themselves; the shepherds feed not the sheep,
   but themselves. Ye eat the milk, and are clothed with the wool; ye slay
   the strong, ye do not feed the sheep. The weak have ye not
   strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have
   ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that
   which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but,
   violently ye chastised them with insult: and they were scattered,
   because there was no shepherd; and they became meat to all the beasts
   of the forest." And again: "The shepherds did not search for my sheep;
   and the shepherds fed themselves, but they fed not my sheep." And a
   little after: "Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will require
   my sheep at their hands, and cause them to cease from feeding my sheep,
   neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; and I will
   deliver my sheep out of their hands, and they shall not be meat for
   them." And he also adds, speaking to the people: "Behold, I will judge
   between sheep and sheep, and between rams and rams. Seemed it a small
   thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, and to have trodden
   down with your feet the residue of your pasture, and that the sheep
   have eaten what was trodden down with your feet? "And a little after He
   adds: "And ye shall know that I am the Lord, and you the sheep of my
   pasture; ye are my men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God." [2687]

    That a Shepherd Who is Careless of His Sheep Will Be Condemned, and that a
    Sheep Which Will Not Be Led by the Shepherd is to Be Punished.

   XIX. Hear, O ye bishops; and hear, O ye of the laity, how God speaks:
   "I will judge between ram and ram, and between sheep and sheep." And He
   says to the shepherds: "Ye shall be judged for your unskilfulness, and
   for destroying the sheep." That is, I will judge between one bishop and
   another, and between one lay person and another, and between one ruler
   and another (for these sheep and these rams are not irrational, but
   rational creatures): lest at any time a lay person should say, I am a
   sheep and not a shepherd, and I am not concerned for myself; let the
   shepherd look to that, for he alone will be required to give an account
   for me. For as that sheep that will not follow its good shepherd is
   exposed to the wolves, to its destruction; so that which follows a bad
   shepherd is also exposed to unavoidable death, since his shepherd will
   devour him. Wherefore care must be had to avoid destructive shepherds.

    How the Governed are to Obey the Bishops Who are Set Over Them.

   XX. As to a good shepherd, let the lay person honour him, love him,
   reverence him as his lord, as his master, as the high priest of God, as
   a teacher of piety. For he that heareth him, heareth Christ; and he
   that rejecteth him, rejecteth Christ; and he who does not receive
   Christ, does not receive His God and Father: for, says He, "He that
   heareth you, heareth me; and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me; and
   he that rejecteth me, rejecteth Him that sent me." [2688] In like
   manner, let the bishop love the laity as his children, fostering and
   cherishing them with affectionate diligence; as eggs, in order to the
   hatching of young ones; or as young ones, taking them in his arms, to
   the rearing them into birds: admonishing all men; reproving all who
   stand in need of reproof; reproving, that is, but not striking; beating
   them down to make them ashamed, but not overthrowing them; warning them
   in order to their conversion: chiding them in order to their
   reformation and better course of life; watching the strong, that is,
   keeping him firm in the faith who is already strong; feeding the people
   peaceably; strengthening the weak, that is, confirming with exhortation
   that which is tempted; healing that which is sick, that is, curing by
   instruction that which is weak in the faith through doubtfulness of
   mind; binding up that which is broken, that is, binding up by
   comfortable admonitions that which is gone astray, or wounded, bruised,
   or broken by their sins, and put out of the way; leasing it of its
   offences, and giving hope: by this means restore it in strength to the
   Church, bringing it back into the flock. Bring again that which is
   driven away, that is, do not permit that which is in its sins, and is
   cast out by way of punishment, to continue excluded; but receiving it,
   and bringing it back, restore it to the flock, that is, to the people
   of the undefiled Church. Seek for that which is lost, that is, do not
   suffer that which desponds of its salvation, by reason of the multitude
   of its offences, utterly to perish. Do thou search for that which is
   grown sleepy, drowsy, and sluggish, and that which is unmindful of its
   own life, through the depth of its sleep, and which is at a great
   distance from its own flock, so as to be in danger of falling among the
   wolves, and being devoured by them. Bring it back by admonition, exhort
   it to be watchful; and insinuate hope, not permitting it to say that
   which was said by some: "Our impieties are upon us, and we pine away in
   them; how shall we then live?" [2689] As far as possible, therefore,
   let the bishop make the offence his own, and say to the sinner, Do thou
   but return, and I will undertake to suffer death for thee, as our Lord
   suffered death for me, and for all men. For "the good shepherd lays
   down his life for the sheep; but he that is an hireling, and not the
   shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, that is,
   the devil, and he leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf seizes
   upon them." [2690] We must know, therefore, that God is very merciful
   to those who have offended, and hath promised repentance with an oath.
   But he who has offended, and is unacquainted with this promise of God
   concerning repentance, and does not understand His long-suffering and
   forbearance, and besides is ignorant of the Holy Scriptures, which
   proclaim repentance, inasmuch as he has never learned them from you,
   perishes through his folly. But do thou, like a compassionate shepherd,
   and a diligent feeder of the flock, search out, and keep an account of
   thy flock. Seek that which is wanting; [2691] as the Lord God our
   gracious Father has sent His own Son, the good Shepherd and Saviour,
   our Master Jesus, and has commanded Him to "leave the ninety-nine upon
   the mountains, and to go in search after that which was lost, and when
   He had found it, to take it upon His shoulders, and to carry it into
   the flock, rejoicing that He had found that which was lost." [2692] In
   like manner, be obedient, O bishop, and do thou seek that which was
   lost, guide that which has wandered out of the right way, bring back
   that which is gone astray: for thou hast authority to bring them back,
   and to deliver those that are broken-hearted by remission. For by thee
   does our Saviour say to him who is discouraged under the sense of his
   sins, "Thy sins are forgiven thee: thy faith hath saved thee; go in
   peace." [2693] But this peace and haven of tranquillity is the Church
   of Christ, into which do thou, when thou hast loosed them from their
   sins, restore them, as being now sound and unblameable, of good hope,
   diligent, laborious in good works. As a skilful and compassionate
   physician, heal all such as have wandered in the ways of sin; for "they
   that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick. For
   the Son of man came to save and to seek that which was lost." [2694]
   Since thou art therefore a physician of the Lord's Church, provide
   remedies suitable to every patient's case. Cure them, heal them by all
   means possible; restore them sound to the Church. Feed the flock, "not
   with insolence and contempt, as lording it over them," [2695] but as a
   gentle shepherd, "gathering the lambs into thy bosom, and gently
   leading those which are with young." [2696]

    That It is a Dangerous Thing to Judge Without Hearing Both Sides, or to
    Determine of Punishment Against a Person Before He is Convicted.

   XXI. Be gentle, gracious, mild, without guile, without falsehood; not
   rigid, not insolent, not severe, not arrogant, not unmerciful, not
   puffed up, not a man-pleaser, not timorous, not double-minded, not one
   that insults over the people that are under thee, not one that conceals
   the divine laws and the promises to repentance, not hasty in thrusting
   out and expelling, but steady, not one that delights in severity, not
   heady. Do not admit less evidence to convict any one than that of three
   witnesses, and those of known and established reputation; inquire
   whether they do not accuse out of ill-will or envy: for there are many
   that delight in mischief, forward in discourse, slanderous, haters of
   the brethren, making it their business to scatter the sheep of Christ;
   whose affirmation if thou admittest without nice scanning the same,
   thou wilt disperse thy flock, and betray it to be devoured by wolves,
   that is, by demons and wicked men, or rather not men, but wild beasts
   in the shape of men--by the heathen, by the Jews, and by the atheistic
   heretics. For those destroying wolves soon address themselves to any
   one that is cast out of the Church, and esteem him as a lamb delivered
   for them to devour, reckoning his destruction their own gain. For he
   that is "their father, the devil, is a murderer." [2697] He also who is
   separated unjustly by thy want of care in judging will be overwhelmed
   with sorrow, and be disconsolate, and so will either wander over to the
   heathen, or be entangled in heresies, and so will be altogether
   estranged from the Church and from hope in God, and will be entangled
   in impiety, whereby thou wilt be guilty of his perdition: for it is not
   fair to be too hasty in casting out an offender, but slow in receiving
   him when he returns; to be forward in cutting off, but unmerciful when
   he is sorrowful, and ought to be healed. For of such as these speaks
   the divine Scripture: "Their feet run to mischief; they are hasty to
   shed blood. Destruction and misery are in their ways, and the way of
   peace have they not known. The fear of God is not before their eyes."
   [2698] Now the way of peace is our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has taught
   us, saying: "Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Give, and it shall be
   given to you;" [2699] that is, give remission of sins, and your
   offences shall be forgiven you. As also He instructed us by His prayer
   to say unto God: "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."
   [2700] If, therefore, you do not forgive offenders, how can you expect
   the remission of your own sins? Do not you rather bind yourselves
   faster, by pretending in your prayers to forgive, when you really do
   not forgive? Will you not be confronted with your own words, when you
   say you forgive and do not forgive? For know ye, that he who casts out
   one who has not behaved himself wickedly, or who will not receive him
   that returns, is a murderer of his brother, and sheds his blood, as
   Cain did that of his brother Abel, and his "blood cries to God," [2701]
   and will be required. For a righteous man unjustly slain by any one
   will be in rest with God for ever. The same is the case of him who
   without cause is separated by his bishop. He who has cast him out as a
   pestilent fellow when he was innocent, is more furious than a murderer.
   Such a one has no regard to the mercy of God, nor is mindful of His
   goodness to those that are penitent, nor keeping in his eye the
   examples of those who, having been once great offenders, received
   forgiveness upon their repentance. Upon which account, he who casts off
   an innocent person is more cruel than he that murders the body. In like
   manner, he who does not receive the penitent, scatters the flock of
   Christ, being really against Him. For as God is just in judging of
   sinners, so is He merciful in receiving them when they return. For
   David, the man after God's own heart, in his hymns ascribes both mercy
   and judgment to Him.

    That David, the Ninevites, Hezekiah, and His Son Manasseh, are Eminent
    Examples of Repentance, the Prayer of Manasseh King of Judah.

   XXII. It is also thy duty, O bishop, to have before thine eyes the
   examples of those that have gone before, and to apply them skilfully to
   the cases of those who want words of severity or of consolation.
   Besides, it is reasonable that in thy administration of justice thou
   shouldest follow the will of God; and as God deals with sinners, and
   with those who return, that thou shouldest act accordingly in thy
   judging. Now, did not God by Nathan reproach David for his offence? And
   yet as soon as he said he repented, He delivered him from death,
   saying, "Be of good cheer; thou shalt not die." [2702] So also, when
   God had caused Jonah [2703] to be swallowed up by the sea and the
   whale, upon his refusal to preach to the Ninevites, when yet he prayed
   to Him out of the belly of the whale, He retrieved his life from
   corruption. And when Hezekiah had been puffed up for a while, yet, as
   soon as he prayed with lamentation, He remitted his offence. But, O ye
   bishops, hearken to an instance useful upon this occasion. For it is
   written thus in the fourth book of Kings and the second book of
   Chronicles: "And Hezekiah died; and Manasseh his son reigned. He was
   twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five
   years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Hephzibah. And he did
   evil in the sight of the Lord: he did not abstain from the abominations
   of the heathen, whom the Lord destroyed from the face of the children
   of Israel. And Manasseh returned and built the high places which
   Hezekiah his father had overthrown; and he reared pillars for Baal, and
   set up an altar for Baal, and made groves, as did Ahab king of Israel.
   And he made altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord spake to
   David and to Solomon his son, saying, Therein will I put my name. And
   Manasseh set up altars, and by them served Baal, and said, My name
   shall continue for ever. [2704] And he built altars to the host of
   heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord; and he made his
   children pass through the fire in a place named Ge Benennom; [2705] and
   he consulted enchanters, and dealt with wizards and familiar spirits,
   and with conjurers and observers of times, and with teraphim. And he
   sinned exceedingly in the eyes of the Lord, to provoke Him to anger.
   And he set a molten and a graven image, the image of his grove, which
   he made in the house of the Lord, wherein the Lord had chosen to put
   His name in Jerusalem, the holy city, for ever, and had said, I will no
   more remove my foot from the land of Israel, which I gave to their
   fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have
   commanded them, and according to all the precepts that my servant Moses
   commanded them. And they hearkened not. And Manasseh seduced them to do
   more evil before the Lord than did the nations whom the Lord cast out
   from the face of the children of Israel. And the Lord spake concerning
   Manasseh and concerning His people by the hand of His servants the
   prophets, saying, Because Manasseh king of Judah has done all these
   wicked abominations in a higher degree than the Amorite did which was
   before him, and hath made Judah to sin with his idols, thus saith the
   Lord God of Israel, Behold, I bring evils upon Jerusalem and Judah,
   that whosoever heareth of them, both his ears shall tingle. And I will
   stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the
   house of Ahab; and I will blot out Jerusalem as a table-book is blotted
   out by wiping it. And I will turn it upside down; and I will give up
   the remnant of my inheritance, and will deliver them into the hands of
   their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their
   enemies, because of all the evils which they have done in mine eyes,
   and have provoked me to anger from the day that I brought their fathers
   out of the land of Egypt even until this day. Moreover, Manasseh shed
   innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to
   another, beside his sins wherewith he made Judah to sin in doing evil
   in the sight of the Lord. And the Lord brought upon him the captains of
   the host of the king of Assyria, and they caught Manasseh in bonds, and
   they bound him in fetters of brass, and brought him to Babylon; and he
   was bound and shackled with iron all over in the house of the prison.
   And bread made of bran was given unto him scantily, and by weight, and
   water mixed with vinegar but a little and by measure, so much as would
   keep him alive; and he was in straits and sore affliction. And when he
   was violently afflicted, he besought the face of the Lord his God, and
   humbled himself greatly before the face of the Lord God of his fathers.
   And he prayed unto the Lord, saying, O Lord, almighty God of our
   fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of their righteous seed, who
   hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof, who hast
   bound the sea by the word of Thy commandment, who hast shut up the
   deep, and sealed it by Thy terrible and glorious name, whom all men
   fear and tremble before Thy power; for the majesty of Thy glory cannot
   be borne, and Thine angry threatening towards sinners is insupportable.
   But Thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; for Thou art
   the most high Lord, [2706] of great compassion, long-suffering, very
   merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to
   Thy great goodness, hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them
   that have sinned against Thee, and of Thine infinite mercy hast
   appointed repentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. Thou
   therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, has not appointed
   repentance to the just as to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, which have
   not sinned against Thee; but Thou hast appointed repentance unto me
   that am a sinner: for I have sinned above the number of the sands of
   the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied; my transgressions
   are multiplied, and I am not worthy to behold and see the height of
   heaven for the multitude of mine iniquity. I am bowed down with many
   iron bands; for I have provoked Thy wrath, and done evil before Thee,
   setting up abominations, and multiplying offences. Now, therefore, I
   bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching Thee of grace. I have sinned, O
   Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities; wherefore I
   humbly beseech Thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and destroy me not
   with mine iniquities. Be not angry with me for ever, by reserving evil
   for me; neither condemn me into the lower part of the earth. For Thou
   art the God, even the God of them that repent, and in me Thou wilt show
   Thy goodness; for Thou wilt save me that am unworthy, according to Thy
   great mercy. Therefore I will praise Thee for ever all the days of my
   life; for all the powers of the heavens do praise Thee, and Thine is
   the glory for ever and ever. Amen. And the Lord heard his voice, and
   had compassion upon him. And there appeared a flame of fire about him,
   and all the iron shackles and chains which were about him fell off; and
   the Lord healed Manasseh from his affliction, and brought him back to
   Jerusalem unto his kingdom: and Manasseh knew that the Lord He is God
   alone. And he worshipped the Lord God alone with all his heart, and
   with all his soul, all the days of his life; and he was esteemed
   righteous. And he took away the strange gods and the graven image out
   of the house of the Lord, and all the altars which he had built in the
   house of the Lord, and all the altars in Jerusalem, and he cast them
   out of the city. And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed
   thereon peace-offerings and thank-offerings. And Manasseh spake to
   Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel. And he slept in peace with his
   fathers; and Amon his son reigned in his stead. And he did evil in the
   sight of the Lord according to all things that Manasseh his father had
   done in the former part of his reign. And he provoked the Lord his God
   to anger." [2707]

   Ye have heard, our beloved children, how the Lord God for a while
   punished him that was addicted to idols, and had slain many innocent
   persons; and yet that He received him when he repented, and forgave him
   his offences, and restored him to his kingdom. For He not only forgives
   the penitent, but reinstates them in their former dignity.

    Amon May be an Example to Such as Sin with an High Hand.

   XXIII. There is no sin more grievous than idolatry, for it is an
   impiety against God: and yet even this sin has been forgiven, upon
   sincere repentance. But if any one sin in direct opposition, and on
   purpose to try whether God will punish the wicked or not, such a one
   shall have no remission, although he say with himself, "All is well,
   and I will walk according to the conversation of my evil heart." Such a
   one was Amon the son of Manasseh. For the Scripture says: "And Amon
   reasoned an evil reasoning of transgression, and said, My father from
   his childhood was a great transgressor, and repented in his old age;
   and now I will walk as my soul lusteth, and afterwards I will return
   unto the Lord. And he did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that
   were before him. And the Lord God soon destroyed him utterly from His
   good land. And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his
   own house, and he reigned two years only."

    That Christ Jesus Our Lord Came to Save Sinners by Repentance.

   XXIV. Take heed, therefore, ye of the laity, lest any one of you fix
   the reasoning of Amon in his heart, and be suddenly cut off, and
   perish. In the same manner, let the bishop take all the care he can
   that those which are yet innocent may not fall into sin; and let him
   heal and receive those which turn from their sins. But if he is
   pitiless, and will not receive the repenting sinner, he will sin
   against the Lord his God, pretending to be more just than God's
   justice, and not receiving him whom He has received, through Christ;
   for whose sake He sent His Son upon earth to men, as a man; for whose
   sake God was pleased that He, who was the Maker of man and woman,
   should be born of a woman; for whose sake He did not spare Him from the
   cross, from death, and burial, but permitted Him to die, who by nature
   could not suffer, His beloved Son, God the Word, the Angel of His great
   council, that he might deliver those from death who were obnoxious to
   death. Him do those provoke to anger who do not receive the penitent.
   For He was not ashamed of me, Matthew, who had been formerly a
   publican; and admitted of Peter, when he had through fear denied Him
   three times, but had appeased Him by repentance, and had wept bitterly;
   nay, He made him a shepherd to His own lambs. Moreover, He ordained
   Paul, our fellow-apostle, to be of a persecutor an apostle, and
   declared him a chosen vessel, even when he had heaped many mischiefs
   upon us before, and had blasphemed His sacred name. He says also to
   another, a woman that was a sinner: "Thy sins, which are many, are
   forgiven, for thou lovest much." [2708] And when the elders had set
   another woman which had sinned before Him, and had left the sentence to
   Him, and were gone out, our Lord, the Searcher of the hearts, inquiring
   of her whether the elders had condemned her, and being answered No, He
   said unto her: "Go thy way therefore, for neither do I condemn thee."
   [2709] This Jesus, O ye bishops, our Saviour, our King, and our God,
   ought to be set before you as your pattern; and Him you ought to
   imitate, in being meek, quiet, compassionate, merciful, peaceable,
   without passion, apt to teach, and diligent to convert, willing to
   receive and to comfort; no strikers, not soon angry, not injurious, not
   arrogant, not supercilious, not wine-bibbers, not drunkards, not vainly
   expensive, not lovers of delicacies, not extravagant, using the gifts
   of God not as another's, but as their own, as good stewards appointed
   over them, as those who will be required by God to give an account of
   the same.

      Sec. IV.--On the Management of the Resources Collected for the Support of
      the Clergy, and the Relief of the Poor.

   Let the bishop esteem such food and raiment sufficient as suits
   necessity and decency. Let him not make use of the Lord's goods as
   another's, but moderately; "for the labourer is worthy of his reward."
   [2710] Let him not be luxurious in diet, or fond of idle furniture, but
   contented with so much alone as is necessary for his sustenance.

    Of First-Fruits and Tithes, and After What Manner the Bishop is Himself to
    Partake of Them, or to Distribute Them to Others.

   XXV. Let him use those tenths and first-fruits, which are given
   according to the command of God, as a man of God; as also let him
   dispense in a right manner the free-will offerings which are brought in
   on account of the poor, to the orphans, the widows, the afflicted, and
   strangers in distress, as having that God for the examiner of his
   accounts who has committed the disposition to him. Distribute to all
   those in want with righteousness, and yourselves use the things which
   belong to the Lord, but do not abuse them; eating of them, but not
   eating them all up by yourselves: communicate with those that are in
   want, and thereby show yourselves unblameable before God. For if you
   shall consume them by yourselves, you will be reproached by God, who
   says to such unsatiable people, who alone devour all, "Ye eat up the
   milk, and clothe yourselves with the wool;" [2711] and in another
   passage, "Must you alone live upon the earth"? [2712] Upon which
   account you are commanded in the law, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself." [2713] Now we say these things, not as if you might not
   partake of the fruits of your labours; for it is written, "Thou shalt
   not muzzle the mouth of the ox which treadeth out the corn;" [2714] but
   that you should do it with moderation and righteousness. As, therefore,
   the ox that labours in the threshing-floor without a muzzle eats
   indeed, but does not eat all up; so do you who labour in the
   threshing-floor, that is, in the Church of God, eat of the Church:
   which was also the case of the Levites, who served in the tabernacle of
   the testimony, which was in all things a type of the Church. Nay,
   further, its very name implied that that tabernacle was fore-appointed
   for a testimony of the Church. Here, therefore, the Levites also, who
   attended upon the tabernacle partook of those things that were offered
   to God by all the people,--namely, gifts, offerings, and first-fruits,
   and tithes, and sacrifices, and oblations, without disturbance, they
   and their wives, and their sons and their daughters. Since their
   employment was the ministration to the tabernacle, therefore they had
   not any lot or inheritance in the land among the children of Israel,
   because the oblations of the people were the lot of Levi, and the
   inheritance of their tribe. You, therefore, O bishops, are to your
   people priests and Levites, ministering to the holy tabernacle, the
   holy Catholic Church; who stand at the altar of the Lord your God, and
   offer to Him reasonable and unbloody sacrifices through Jesus the great
   High Priest. You are to the laity prophets, rulers, governors, and
   kings; the mediators between God and His faithful people, who receive
   and declare His word, well acquainted with the Scriptures. Ye are the
   voice of God, and witnesses of His will, who bear the sins of all, and
   intercede for all; whom, as you have heard, the word severely threatens
   if you hide the key of knowledge from men, who are liable to perdition
   if you do not declare His will to the people that are under you; who
   shall have a certain reward from God, and unspeakable honour and glory,
   if you duly minister to the holy tabernacle. For as yours is the
   burden, so you receive as your fruit the supply of food and other
   necessaries. For you imitate Christ the Lord; and as He "bare the sins
   of us all upon the tree" at His crucifixion, the innocent for those who
   deserved punishment, so also you ought to make the sins of the people
   your own. For concerning our Saviour it is said in Isaiah, "He bears
   our sins, and is afflicted for us." [2715] And again: "He bare the sins
   of many, and was delivered for our offences." [2716] As, therefore, you
   are patterns for others, so have you Christ for your pattern. As,
   therefore, He is concerned for all, so be you for the laity under you.
   For do not thou imagine that the office of a bishop is an easy or light
   burden. As, therefore, you bear the weight, so have you a right to
   partake of the fruits before others, and to impart to those that are in
   want, as being to give an account to Him, who without bias will examine
   your accounts. For those who attend upon the Church ought to be
   maintained by the Church, as being priests, Levites, presidents, and
   ministers of God; as it is written in the book of Numbers concerning
   the priests: "And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou, and thy sons, and the
   house of thy family, shall bear the iniquities of the holy things of
   priesthood." [2717] "Behold, I have given unto you the charge of the
   first-fruits, from all that are sanctified to me by the children of
   Israel; I have given them for a reward to thee, and to thy sons after
   thee, by an ordinance for ever. This shall be yours out of the holy
   things, out of the oblations, and out of the gifts, and out of all the
   sacrifices, and out of every trespass-offering, and sin-offerings; and
   all that they render unto me out of all their holy things, they shall
   belong to thee, and to thy sons: in the sanctuary shall they eat them."
   [2718] And a little after: "All the first-fruits of the oil, and of the
   wine, and of the wheat, all which they shall give unto the Lord, to
   thee have I given them; and all that is first ripe, to thee have I
   given it, and every devoted thing. Every first-born of man and of
   beast, clean and unclean, and of sacrifice, with the breast, and the
   right shoulder, all these appertain to the priests, and to the rest of
   those belonging to them, even to the Levites." [2719]

   Hear this, you of the laity also, the elect Church of God. For the
   people were formerly called "the people of God," [2720] and "an holy
   nation." [2721] You, therefore, are the holy and sacred "Church of God,
   enrolled in heaven, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar
   people," [2722] a bride adorned for the Lord God, a great Church, a
   faithful Church. Hear attentively now what was said formerly: oblations
   and tithes belong to Christ our High Priest, and to those who minister
   to Him. Tenths of salvation are the first letter of the name of Jesus.
   Hear, O thou Holy Catholic Church, who hast escaped the ten plagues,
   and hast received the ten commandments, and hast learned the law, and
   hast kept the faith, and hast believed in Jesus, and hast known the
   decad, and hast believed in the iota which is the first letter of the
   name of Jesus, [2723] and art named after His name, and art
   established, and shinest in the consummation of His glory. Those which
   were then the sacrifices now are prayers, and intercessions, and
   thanksgivings. Those which were then first-fruits, and tithes, and
   offerings, and gifts, now are oblations, which are presented by holy
   bishops to the Lord God, through Jesus Christ, who has died for them.
   For these are your high priests, as the presbyters are your priests,
   and your present deacons instead of your Levites; as are also your
   readers, your singers, your porters, your deaconesses, your widows,
   your virgins, and your orphans: but He who is above all these is the
   High Priest.

    According to What Patterns and Dignity Every Order of the Clergy is
    Appointed by God.

   XXVI. The bishop, he is the minister of the word, the keeper of
   knowledge, the mediator between God and you in the several parts of
   your divine worship. He is the teacher of piety; and, next after God,
   he is your father, who has begotten you again to the adoption of sons
   by water and the Spirit. He is your ruler and governor; he is your king
   and potentate; he is, next after God, your earthly god, who has a right
   to be honoured by you. For concerning him, and such as he, it is that
   God pronounces, "I have said, Ye are gods; and ye are all children of
   the Most High." [2724] And, "Ye shall not speak evil of the gods."
   [2725] For let the bishop preside over you as one honoured with the
   authority of God, which he is to exercise over the clergy, and by which
   he is to govern all the people. But let the deacon minister to him, as
   Christ does to His Father; [2726] and let him serve him unblameably in
   all things, as Christ does nothing of Himself, but does always those
   things that please His Father. Let also the deaconess be honoured by
   you in the place of the Holy Ghost, and not do or say anything without
   the deacon; as neither does the Comforter say or do anything of
   Himself, but gives glory to Christ by waiting for His pleasure. And as
   we cannot believe on Christ without the teaching of the Spirit, so let
   not any woman address herself to the deacon or bishop without the
   deaconess. Let the presbyters be esteemed by you to represent us the
   apostles, and let them be the teachers of divine knowledge; since our
   Lord, when He sent us, said, "Go ye, and make disciples of all nations,
   baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
   Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
   commanded you." [2727] Let the widows and orphans be esteemed as
   representing the altar of burnt-offering; and let the virgins be
   honoured as representing the altar of incense, and the incense itself.

    That It is a Horrible Thing for a Man to Thrust Himself into Any Sacerdotal
    Office, as Did Corah and His Company, Saul and Uzziah.

   XXVII. As, therefore, it was not lawful for one of another tribe, that
   was not a Levite, to offer anything, or to approach the altar without
   the priest, so also do you do nothing without the bishop; [2728] for if
   any one does anything without the bishop, he does it to no purpose. For
   it will not be esteemed as of any avail to him. For as Saul, when he
   had offered without Samuel, was told, "It will not avail for thee;"
   [2729] so every person among the laity, doing anything without the
   priest, labours in vain. And as Uzziah the king, [2730] who was not a
   priest, and yet would exercise the functions of the priests, was
   smitten with leprosy for his transgression; so every lay person shall
   not be unpunished who despises God, and is so mad as to affront His
   priests, and unjustly to snatch that honour to himself: not imitating
   Christ, "who glorified not Himself to be made an high priest;" [2731]
   but waited till He heard from His Father, "The Lord sware, and will not
   repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek."
   [2732] If, therefore, Christ did not glorify Himself without the
   Father, how dare any man thrust himself into the priesthood who has not
   received that dignity from his superior, and do such things which it is
   lawful only for the priests to do? Were not the followers of Corah,
   even though they were of the tribe of Levi, consumed with fire, because
   they rose up against Moses and Aaron, and meddled with such things as
   did not belong to them? And Dathan and Abiram went down quick into
   hell; and the rod that budded put a stop to the readiness of the
   multitude, and demonstrated who was the high priest ordained by God.
   [2733] You ought therefore, brethren, to bring your sacrifices and your
   oblations to the bishop, as to your high priest, either by yourselves
   or by the deacons; and do you bring not those only, but also your
   first-fruits, and your tithes, and your free-will offerings to him. For
   he knows who they are that are in affliction, and gives to every one as
   is convenient, that so one may not receive alms twice or oftener the
   same day, or the same week, while another has nothing at all. For it is
   reasonable rather to supply the wants of those who really are in
   distress, than of those who only appear to be so.

    Of an Entertainment, and After What Manner Each Distinct Order of the Clergy
    is to Be Treated by Those Who Invite Them to It.

   XXVIII. If any determine to invite elder women to an entertainment of
   love, or a feast, as our Saviour calls it, [2734] let them most
   frequently send to such a one whom the deacons know to be in distress.
   But let what is the pastor's due, I mean the first-fruits, [2735] be
   set apart in the feast for him, even though he be not at the
   entertainment, as being your priest, and in honour of that God who has
   entrusted him with the priesthood. But as much as is given to every one
   of the elder women, let double so much be given to the deacons, in
   honour of Christ. Let also a double portion be set apart for the
   presbyters, as for such who labour continually about the word and
   doctrine, upon the account of the apostles of our Lord, whose place
   they sustain, as the counsellors of the bishop and the crown of the
   Church. For they are the Sanhedrim and senate of the Church. If there
   be a reader there, let him receive a single portion, in honour of the
   prophets, and let the singer and the porter have as much. Let the
   laity, therefore, pay proper honours in their presents, and utmost
   marks of respect to each distinct order. But let them not on all
   occasions trouble their governor, but let them signify their desires by
   those who minister to him, that is, by the deacons, with whom they may
   be more free. For neither may we address ourselves to Almighty God, but
   only by Christ. In the same manner, therefore, let the laity make known
   all their desires to the bishop by the deacon, and accordingly let them
   act as he shall direct them. For there was no holy thing offered or
   done in the temple formerly without the priest. "For the priest's lips
   shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his mouth," as the
   prophet somewhere says, "for he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty."
   [2736] For if the worshippers of demons, in their hateful, abominable,
   and impure performances, imitate the sacred rules till this very day
   (it is a wide comparison indeed, and there is a vast distance between
   their abominations and God's sacred worship), in their mockeries of
   worship they neither offer nor do anything without their pretended
   priest, but esteem him as the very mouth of their idols of stone,
   waiting to see what commands he will lay upon them. And whatsoever he
   commands them, that they do, and without him they do nothing; and they
   honour him, their pretended priest, and esteem his name as venerable in
   honour of lifeless statues, and in order to the worship of wicked
   spirits. If these heathens, therefore, who give glory to lying
   vanities, and place their hope upon nothing that is firm, endeavour to
   imitate the sacred rules, how much more reasonable is it that you, who
   have a most certain faith and undoubted hope, and who expect glorious,
   and eternal, and never-failing promises, should honour the Lord God in
   those set over you, and esteem your bishop to be the mouth of God!

    What is the Dignity of a Bishop and of a Deacon.

   XXIX. For if Aaron, because he declared to Pharaoh the words of God
   from Moses, is called a prophet; and Moses himself is called a god to
   Pharaoh, on account of his being at once a king and a high priest, as
   God says to him, "I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy
   brother shall be thy prophet;" [2737] why do not ye also esteem the
   mediators of the word to be prophets, and reverence them as gods?

    After What Manner the Laity are to Be Obedient to the Deacon.

   XXX. For now the deacon is to you Aaron, and the bishop Moses. If,
   therefore, Moses was called a god by the Lord, let the bishop be
   honoured among you as a god, and the deacon as his prophet. For as
   Christ does nothing without His Father, so neither does the deacon do
   anything without his bishop; and as the Son without His Father is
   nothing, so is the deacon nothing without his bishop; and as the Son is
   subject to His Father, so is every deacon subject to his bishop; and as
   the Son is the messenger and prophet of the Father, so is the deacon
   the messenger and prophet of his bishop. Wherefore let all things that
   he is to do with any one be made known to the bishop, and be finally
   ordered by him.

    That the Deacon Must Not Do Anything Without the Bishop.

   XXXI. Let him not do anything at all without his bishop, nor give
   anything without his consent. For if he gives to any one as to a person
   in distress without the bishop's knowledge, he gives it so that it must
   tend to the reproach of the bishop, and he accuses him as careless of
   the distressed. But he that casts reproach on his bishop, either by
   word or deed, opposes God, not hearkening to what He says: "Thou shalt
   not speak evil of the gods." [2738] For He did not make that law
   concerning deities of wood and of stone, which are abominable, because
   they are falsely called gods, but concerning the priests and the
   judges, to whom He also said, "Ye are gods, and children of the Most
   High." [2739]

    That the Deacon Must Not Make Any Distributions Without the Consent of the
    Bishop, Because that Will Turn to the Reproach of the Bishop.

   XXXII. If therefore, O deacon, thou knowest any one to be in distress,
   put the bishop in mind of him, and so give to him; but do nothing in a
   clandestine way, so as may tend to his reproach, lest thou raise a
   murmur against him; for the murmur will not be against him, but against
   the Lord God: and the deacon, with the rest, will hear what Aaron and
   Miriam heard, when they spake against Moses: "How is it that ye were
   not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?" [2740] And again, Moses
   says to those who rose up against him: "Your murmuring is not against
   us, but against the Lord our God." [2741] For if he that calls one of
   the laity Raka, [2742] or fool, shall not be unpunished, as doing
   injury to the name [2743] of Christ, how dare any man speak against his
   bishop, by whom the Lord gave the Holy Spirit among you upon the laying
   on of his hands, by whom ye have learned the sacred doctrines, and have
   known God, and have believed in Christ, by whom ye were known of God,
   by whom ye were sealed with the oil of gladness and the ointment of
   understanding, by whom ye were declared to be the children of light, by
   whom the Lord in your illumination testified by the imposition of the
   bishop's hands, and sent out His sacred voice upon every one of you,
   saying, "Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee?" [2744] By thy
   bishop, O man, God adopts thee for His child. Acknowledge, O son, that
   right hand which was a mother to thee. Love him who, after God, is
   become a father to thee, and honour him.

    After What Manner the Bishops are to Be Honoured, and to Be Reverenced as
    Our Spiritual Parents.

   XXXIII. For if the divine oracle says, concerning our parents according
   to the flesh, "Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well
   with thee;" [2745] and, "He that curseth his father or his mother, let
   him die the death;" [2746] how much more should the word exhort you to
   honour your spiritual parents, and to love them as your benefactors and
   ambassadors with God, who have regenerated you by water, and endued you
   with the fulness of the Holy Spirit, who have fed you with the word as
   with milk, who have nourished you with doctrine, who have confirmed you
   by their admonitions, who have imparted to you the saving body and
   precious blood of Christ, who have loosed you from your sins, who have
   made you partakers of the holy and sacred eucharist, who have admitted
   you to be partakers and fellow-heirs of the promise of God! Reverence
   these, and honour them with all kinds of honour; for they have obtained
   from God the power of life and death, in their judging of sinners, and
   condemning them to the death of eternal fire, as also of loosing
   returning sinners from their sins, and of restoring them to a new life.

    That Priests are to Be Preferred Before Rulers and Kings.

   XXXIV. Account these worthy to be esteemed your rulers and your kings,
   and bring them tribute as to kings; for by you they and their families
   ought to be maintained. As Samuel made constitutions for the people
   concerning a king, [2747] in the first book of Kings, and Moses did so
   concerning priests in Leviticus, so do we also make constitutions for
   you concerning bishops. For if there the multitude distributed the
   inferior services in proportion to so great a king, ought not therefore
   the bishop much more now to receive of you those things which are
   determined by God for the sustenance of himself and of the rest of the
   clergy belonging to him? But if we may add somewhat further, let the
   bishop receive more than the other received of old: for he only managed
   the affairs of the soldiery, being entrusted with war and peace for the
   preservation of men's bodies; but the other is entrusted with the
   exercise of the priestly office in relation to God, in order to
   preserve both body and soul from dangers. By how much, therefore, the
   soul is more valuable than the body, so much the priestly office is
   beyond the kingly. For it binds and looses those that are worthy of
   punishment or of remission. Wherefore you ought to love the bishop as
   your father, and fear him as your king, and honour him as your lord,
   bringing to him your fruits and the works of your hands, for a blessing
   upon you, giving to him your first-fruits, and your tithes, and your
   oblations, and your gifts, as to the priest of God; the first-fruits of
   your wheat, and wine, and oil, and autumnal fruits, and wool, [2748]
   and all things which the Lord God gives thee. And thy offering shall be
   accepted as a savour of a sweet smell to the Lord thy God; and the Lord
   will bless the works of thy hands, and will multiply the good things of
   the land. "For a blessing is upon the head of him that giveth." [2749]

    That Both the Law and the Gospel Prescribe Offerings.

   XXXV. Now you ought to know, that although the Lord has delivered you
   from the additional bonds, and has brought you out of them to your
   refreshment, and does not permit you to sacrifice irrational creatures
   for sin-offerings, and purifications, and scapegoats, and continual
   washings and sprinklings, yet has He nowhere freed you from those
   oblations which you owe to the priests, nor from doing good to the
   poor. For the Lord says to you in the Gospel: "Unless your
   righteousness abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
   shall by no means enter into the kingdom of heaven." [2750] Now herein
   will your righteousness exceed theirs, if you take greater care of the
   priests, the orphans, and the widows; as it is written: "He hath
   scattered abroad; he hath given to the poor; his righteousness
   remaineth for ever." [2751] And again: "By acts of righteousness and
   faith iniquities are purged." [2752] And again: "Every bountiful soul
   is blessed." [2753] So therefore shalt thou do as the Lord has
   appointed, and shalt give to the priest what things are due to him, the
   first-fruits of thy floor, and of thy wine-press, and sin-offerings, as
   to the mediator between God and such as stand in need of purgation and
   forgiveness. For it is thy duty to give, and his to administer, as
   being the administrator and disposer of ecclesiastical affairs. Yet
   shalt thou not call thy bishop to account, nor watch his
   administration, how he does it, when, or to whom, or where, or whether
   he do it well or ill, or indifferently; for he has One who will call
   him to an account, the Lord God, who put this administration into his
   hands, and thought him worthy of the priesthood of so great dignity.

    The Recital of the Ten Commandments, and After What Manner They Do Here
    Prescribe to Us.

   XXXVI. Have before thine eyes the fear of God, and always remember the
   ten commandments of God,--to love the one and only Lord God with all
   thy strength; to give no heed to idols, or any other beings, as being
   lifeless gods, or irrational beings or dæmons. Consider the manifold
   workmanship of God, which received its beginning through Christ. Thou
   shalt observe the Sabbath, on account of Him who ceased from His work
   of creation, but ceased not from His work of providence: it is a rest
   for meditation of the law, not for idleness of the hands. Reject every
   unlawful lust, everything destructive to men, and all anger. Honour thy
   parents, as the authors of thy being. Love thy neighbour as thyself.
   Communicate the necessaries of life to the needy. Avoid swearing
   falsely, and swearing often, and in vain; for thou shalt not be held
   guiltless. Do not appear before the priests empty, and offer thy
   free-will offerings continually. Moreover, do not leave the church of
   Christ; but go thither in the morning before all thy work, and again
   meet there in the evening, to return thanks to God that He has
   preserved thy life. Be diligent, and constant, and laborious in thy
   calling. Offer to the Lord thy free-will offerings; for says He,
   "Honour the Lord with the fruit of thy honest labours." [2754] If thou
   art not able to cast anything considerable into the Corban, [2755] yet
   at least bestow upon the strangers one, or two, or five mites. "Lay up
   to thyself heavenly treasure, which neither the moth nor thieves can
   destroy." [2756] And in doing this, do not judge thy bishop, or any of
   thy neighbours among the laity; for if thou judge thy brother, thou
   becomest a judge, without being constituted such by anybody, for the
   priests are only entrusted with the power of judging. For to them it is
   said, "Judge righteous judgment;" [2757] and again "Approve yourselves
   to be exact money-changers." [2758] For to you this is not entrusted;
   for, on the contrary, it is said to those who are not of the dignity of
   magistrates or ministers: "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged."

      Sec. V.--On Accusations, and the Treatment of Accusers.

    Concerning Accusers and False Accusers, and How a Judge is Not Rashly Either
    to Believe Them or Disbelieve Them, But After an Accurate Examination.

   XXXVII. But it is the duty of the bishop to judge rightly, as it is
   written, "Judge righteous judgment;" [2760] and elsewhere, "Why do ye
   not even of yourselves judge what is right?" [2761] Be ye therefore as
   skilful dealers in money: for as these reject bad money, but take to
   themselves what is current, in the same manner it is the bishops's duty
   to retain the unblameable, but either to heal, or, if they be past
   cure, to cast off those that are blameworthy, so as not to be hasty in
   cutting off, nor to believe all accusations; for it sometimes happens
   that some, either through passion or envy, do insist on a false
   accusation against a brother, as did the two elders in the case of
   Susanna in Babylon, [2762] and the Egyptian woman in the case of
   Joseph. [2763] Do thou therefore, as a man of God, not rashly receive
   such accusations, lest thou take away the innocent and slay the
   righteous; for he that will receive such accusations is the author of
   anger rather than of peace. But where there is anger, there the Lord is
   not; for that anger, which is the friend of Satan--I mean that which is
   excited unjustly by the means of false brethren--never suffers
   unanimity to be in the Church. Wherefore, when you know such persons to
   be foolish, quarrelsome, passionate, and such as delight in mischief,
   do not give credit to them; but observe such as they are, when you hear
   anything from them against their brother: for murder is nothing in
   their eyes, and they cast a man down in such a way as one would not
   suspect. Do thou therefore consider diligently the accuser, [2764]
   wisely observing his mode of life, what, and of what sort it is; and in
   case thou findest him a man of veracity, do according to the doctrine
   of our Lord, [2765] and taking him who is accused, rebuke him, that he
   may repent, when nobody is by. But if he be not persuaded, take with
   thee out or two more, and so show him his fault, and admonish him with
   mildness and instruction; for "wisdom will rest upon an heart that is
   good, but is not understood in the heart of the foolish." [2766]

    That Sinners are Privately to Be Reproved, and the Penitent to Be Received,
    According to the Constitution of Our Lord.

   XXXVIII. If, therefore, he be persuaded by the mouth of you three, it
   is well. But if any one hardens himself, "tell it to the Church: but if
   he neglects to hear the Church, let him be to thee as an heathen man
   and a publican;" [2767] and receive him no longer into the Church as a
   Christian, but reject him as an heathen. But if he be willing to
   repent, receive him. For the Church does not receive an heathen or a
   publican to communion, before they every one repent of their former
   impieties; for our Lord Jesus, the Christ of God, has appointed place
   for the acceptance of men upon their repentance.

    Examples of Repentance.

   XXXIX. For I Matthew, one of those twelve which speak to you in this
   doctrine, am an apostle, having myself been formerly a publican, but
   now have obtained mercy through believing, and have repented of my
   former practices, and have been vouchsafed the honour to be an apostle
   and preacher of the word. And Zacchæus, whom the Lord received upon his
   repentance and prayers to Him, was also himself in the same manner a
   publican at first. And, besides, even the soldiers and multitude of
   publicans, who came to hear the word of the Lord about repentance,
   heard this from the prophet John, after he had baptized them: "Do
   nothing more than that which is appointed you." [2768] In like manner,
   life is not refused to the heathen, if they repent and cast away their
   unbelief. Esteem, therefore, every one that is convicted of any wicked
   action, and has not repented, as a publican or an heathen. But if he
   afterward repents, and turns from his error, then, as we receive the
   heathen, when they wish to repent, into the Church indeed to hear the
   word, but do not receive them to communion until they have received the
   seal of baptism, and are made complete Christians; so do we also permit
   such as these to enter only to hear, until they show the fruit of
   repentance, that by hearing the word they may not utterly and
   irrecoverably perish. But let them not be admitted to communion in
   prayer; and let them depart after the reading of the law, and the
   prophets, and the Gospel, that by such departure they may be made
   better in their course of life, by endeavouring to meet every day about
   the public assemblies, and to be frequent in prayer, that they also may
   be at length admitted, and that those who behold them may be affected,
   and be more secured by fearing to fall into the same condition.

    That We are Not to Be Implacable to Him Who Has Once or Twice Offended.

   XL. But yet do not thou, O bishop, presently abhor any person who has
   fallen into one or two offences, nor shalt thou exclude him from the
   word of the Lord, nor reject him from common intercourse, since neither
   did the Lord refuse to eat with publicans and sinners; and when He was
   accused by the Pharisees on this account, He said: "They that are well
   have no need of the physician, but they that are sick." [2769] Do you,
   therefore, live and dwell with those who are separated from you for
   their sins; and take care of them, comforting them, and confirming
   them, and saying to them: "Be strengthened, ye weak hands and feeble
   knees." [2770] For we ought to comfort those that mourn, and afford
   encouragement to the fainthearted, lest by immoderate sorrow they
   degenerate into distraction, since "he that is fainthearted is
   exceedingly distracted." [2771]

    After What Manner We Ought to Receive a Penitent; How We Ought to Deal with
    Offenders, and When They are to Be Cut Off from the Church.

   XLI. But if any one returns, and shows forth the fruit of repentance,
   then do ye receive him to prayer, as the lost son, the prodigal, who
   had consumed his father's substance with harlots, who fed swine, and
   desired to be fed with husks, and could not obtain it. This son, when
   he repented, and returned to his father, and said, "I have sinned
   against Heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy
   son;" [2772] the father, full of affection to his child, received him
   with music, and restored him his old robe, and ring, and shoes, and
   slew the fatted calf, and made merry with his friends. Do thou
   therefore, O bishop, act in the same manner. And as thou receivest an
   heathen after thou hast instructed and baptized him, so do thou let all
   join in prayers for this man, and restore him by imposition of hands to
   his ancient place among the flock, as one purified by repentance; and
   that imposition of hands shall be to him instead of baptism: for by the
   laying on of our hands the Holy Ghost was given to believers. And in
   case some one of those brethren who had stood immoveable accuse thee,
   because thou art reconciled to him, say to him: "Thou art always with
   me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet to make merry and be
   glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost,
   and is found." For that God does not only receive the penitent, but
   restores them to their former dignity, holy David is a sufficient
   witness, who, after his sin in the matter of Uriah, prayed to God, and
   said: "Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation, and uphold me with Thy
   free Spirit." [2773] And again: "Turn Thy face from my sins, and blot
   out all mine offences. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a
   right spirit in my inward parts. Cast me not away from Thy presence,
   and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me." Do thou therefore, as a
   compassionate physician, heal all that have sinned, making use of
   saving methods of cure; not only cutting and searing, or using
   corrosives, but binding up, and putting in tents, and using gentle
   healing medicines, and sprinkling comfortable words. If it be an hollow
   wound, or great gash, nourish it with a suitable plaister, that it may
   be filled up, and become even with the rest of the whole flesh. If it
   be foul, cleanse it with corrosive powder, that is, with the words of
   reproof. If it have proud flesh, eat it down with a sharp plaister--the
   threats of judgment. If it spreads further, sear it, and cut off the
   putrid flesh, mortifying him with fastings. But if, after all that thou
   hast done, thou perceivest that from the feet to the head there is no
   room for a fomentation, or oil, or bandage, but that the malady spreads
   and prevents all cure, as a gangrene which corrupts the entire member;
   then, with a great deal of consideration, and the advice of other
   skilful physicians, cut off the putrefied member, that the whole body
   of the Church be not corrupted. Be not therefore ready and hasty to cut
   off, nor do thou easily have recourse to the saw, with its many teeth;
   but first use a lancet to lay open the wound, that the inward cause
   whence the pain is derived being drawn out, may keep the body free from
   pain. But if thou seest any one past repentance, and he is become
   insensible, then cut off the incurable from the Church with sorrow and
   lamentation. For: "Take out from among yourselves that wicked person."
   [2774] And: "Ye shall make the children of Israel to fear." [2775] And
   again: "Thou shalt not accept the persons of the rich in judgment."
   [2776] And: "Thou shalt not pity a poor man in his cause: for the
   judgment is the Lord's." [2777]

    That a Judge Must Not Be a Respecter of Persons.

   XLII. But if the slanderous accusation be false, and you that are the
   pastors, with the deacons, admit of that falsehood for truth, either by
   acceptance of persons or receiving of bribes, as willing to do that
   which will he pleasing to the devil, and so you thrust out from the
   Church him that is accused, but is clear of the crime, you shall give
   an account in the day of the Lord. For it is written: "The innocent and
   the righteous thou shalt not slay." [2778] "Thou shalt not take gifts
   to smite the soul: for gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and destroy
   the words of the righteous." [2779] And again: "They that justify the
   wicked for gifts, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from
   him." [2780] Be careful, therefore, not to condemn any persons
   unjustly, and so to assist the wicked. For "woe to him that calls evil
   good, and good evil; bitter sweet, and sweet bitter; that puts light
   for darkness, and darkness for light." [2781] Take care, therefore,
   lest by any means ye become acceptors of persons, and thereby fall
   under this voice of the Lord. [2782] For if you condemn others
   unjustly, you pass sentence against yourselves. For the Lord says:
   "With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and as you condemn,
   you shall be condemned." [2783] If, therefore, ye judge without respect
   of persons, ye will discover that accuser who bears false witness
   against his neighbour, and will prove him to be a sycophant, a spiteful
   person, and a murderer, causing perplexity by accusing the man as if he
   were wicked, inconstant in his words, contradicting himself in what he
   affirms, and entangled with the words of his own mouth; for his own
   lips are a dangerous snare to him: whom, when thou hast convicted him
   of speaking falsely, thou shalt judge severely, and shalt deliver him
   to the fiery sword, and thou shalt do to him as he wickedly proposed to
   do to his brother; for as much as in him lay he slew his brother, by
   forestalling the ears of the judge. [2784] Now it is written, that "he
   that sheddeth man's blood, for that his own blood shall be shed."
   [2785] And: "Thou shalt take away that innocent blood, which was shed
   without cause, from thee." [2786]

    After What Manner False Accusers are to Be Punished.

   XLIII. Thou shalt therefore cast him out of the congregation as a
   murderer of his brother. Some time afterwards, if he says that he
   repents, mortify him with fastings, and afterwards ye shall lay your
   hands upon him and receive him, but still securing him, that he does
   not disturb anybody a second time. But if, when he is admitted again,
   he be alike troublesome, and will not cease to disturb and to quarrel
   with his brother, spying faults out of a contentious spirit, cast him
   out as a pernicious person, that he may not lay waste the Church of
   God. For such a one is the raiser of disturbances in cities; for he,
   though he be within, does not become the Church, but is a superfluous
   and vain member, casting a blot, as far as in him lies, on the body of
   Christ. For if such men as are born with superfluous members of their
   body, which hang to them as fingers, or excrescences of flesh, cut them
   away from themselves on account of their indecency, whereby the
   unseemliness vanishes, and the man recovers his natural good shape by
   the means of the surgeon; how much more ought you, the pastors of the
   Church (for the Church is a perfect body, and sound members; of such as
   believe in God, in the fear of the Lord, and in love), to do the like
   when there is found in it a superfluous member with wicked designs, and
   rendering the rest of the body unseemly, and disturbing it with
   sedition, and war, and evil-speaking; causing fears, disturbances,
   blots, evil-speaking, accusations, disorders, and doing the like works
   of the devil, as if he were ordained by the devil to cast a reproach on
   the Church by calumnies, and mighty disorders, and strife, and
   division! Such a one, therefore, when he is a second time cast out of
   the Church, is justly cut off entirely from the congregation of the
   Lord. And now the Church of the Lord will be more beautiful than it was
   before, when it had a superfluous, and to itself a disagreeable member.
   Wherefore henceforward it will be free from blame and reproach, and
   become clear of such wicked, deceitful, abusive, unmerciful, traitorous
   persons; of such as are "haters of those that are good, lovers of
   pleasure," [2787] affecters of vainglory, deceivers, and pretenders to
   wisdom; of such as make it their business to scatter, or rather utterly
   to disperse, the lambs of the Lord.

    Sec. VI.--The Disputes of the Faithful to Be Settled by the Decisions of the
    Bishop, and the Faithful to Be Reconciled.

   Do thou therefore, O bishop, together with thy subordinate clergy,
   endeavour rightly to divide the word of truth. For the Lord says: "If
   you walk cross-grained to me, I will walk cross-grained to you." [2788]
   And elsewhere: "With the holy Thou wilt be holy, and with the perfect
   man Thou wilt be perfect, and with the froward Thou wilt be froward."
   [2789] Walk therefore holily, that you may rather appear worthy of
   praise from the Lord than of complaint from the adversary.

    That the Deacon is to Ease the Burden of the Bishops, and to Order the
    Smaller Matters Himself.

   XLIV. Be ye of one mind, O ye bishops, one with another, and be at
   peace with one another; sympathize with one another, love the brethren,
   and feed the people with care; with one consent teach those that are
   under you to be of the same sentiments and to be of the same opinions
   about the same matters, "that there may be no schisms among you; that
   ye may be one body and one spirit, perfectly joined together in the
   same mind and in the same judgment," [2790] according to the
   appointment of the Lord. And let the deacon refer all things to the
   bishop, as Christ does to His Father. But let him order such things as
   he is able by himself, receiving power from the bishop, as the Lord did
   from His Father the power of creation and of providence. But the
   weighty matters let the bishop judge; but let the deacon be the
   bishop's ear, and eye, and mouth, and heart, and soul, that the bishop
   may not be distracted with many cares, but with such only as are more
   considerable, as Jethro did appoint for Moses, and his counsel was
   received. [2791]

    That Contentions and Quarrels are Unbecoming Christians.

   XLV. It is therefore a noble encomium for a Christian to have no
   contest with any one; [2792] but if by any management or temptation a
   contest arises with any one, let him endeavour that it may be composed,
   though thereby he be obliged to lose somewhat; and let it not come
   before an heathen tribunal. Nay, indeed, you are not to permit that the
   rulers of this world should pass sentence against your people; for by
   them the devil contrives mischief to the servants of God, and occasions
   a reproach to be cast upon us, as though we had not "one wise man that
   is able to judge between his brethren," or to decide their
   controversies.

    That Believers Ought Not to Go to Law Before Unbelievers; Nor Ought Any
    Unbeliever to Be Called for a Witness Against Believers.

   XLVI. Let not the heathen therefore know of your differences among one
   another, nor do you receive unbelievers as witnesses against
   yourselves, nor be judged by them, nor owe them anything on account of
   tribute or fear; but "render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and
   unto God the things that are God's," [2793] as tribute, taxes, or
   poll-money, as our Lord by giving a piece of money was freed from
   disturbance. [2794] Choose therefore rather to suffer harm, and to
   endeavour after those things that make for peace, not only among the
   brethren, but also among the unbelievers. For by suffering loss in the
   affairs of this life, thou wilt be sure not to suffer in the concerns
   of piety, and wilt live religiously, and according to the command of
   Christ. [2795] But if brethren have lawsuits one with another, which
   God forbid, you who are the rulers ought thence to learn that such as
   these do not do the work of brethren in the Lord, but rather of public
   enemies; and one of the parties will be found to be mild, gentle, and
   the child of light; but the other unmerciful, insolent, and covetous.
   Let him, therefore, who is condemned be rebuked, let him be separated,
   let him undergo the punishment of his hatred to his brother.
   Afterwards, when he repents, let him be received; and so, when they
   have learned prudence, they will ease your judicatures. It is also a
   duty to forgive each other's trespasses--not the duty of those that
   judge, but of those that have quarrels; as the Lord determined when I
   Peter asked Him, "How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I
   forgive him? Till seven times?" He replied, "I say not unto thee, Until
   seven times, but until seventy times seven." [2796] For so would our
   Lord have us to be truly His disciples, and never to have anything
   against anybody; as, for instance, anger without measure, passion
   without mercy, covetousness without justice, hatred without
   reconciliation. Draw by your instruction those who are angry to
   friendship, and those who are at variance to agreement. For the Lord
   says: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the
   children of God." [2797]

    That the Judicatures of Christians Ought to Be Held on the Second Day of the
    Week.

   XLVII. Let your judicatures be held on the second day of the week, that
   if any controversy arise about your sentence, having an interval till
   the Sabbath, [2798] you may be able to set the controversy right, and
   to reduce those to peace who have the contests one with another against
   the Lord's day. Let also the deacons and presbyters be present at your
   judicatures, to judge without acceptance of persons, as men of God,
   with righteousness. When, therefore, both the parties are come,
   according as the law says, [2799] those that have the controversy shall
   stand severally in the middle of the court; and when you have heard
   them, give your votes holily, endeavouring to make them both friends
   before the sentence of the bishop, that judgment against the offender
   may not go abroad into the world; knowing that he has in the court the
   Christ of God as conscious of and confirming his judgment. But if any
   persons are accused by any one, and their fame suffers as if they did
   not walk uprightly in the Lord, in like manner you shall hear both
   parties--the accuser and accused; but not with prejudice, nor with
   hearkening to one part only, but with righteousness, as passing a
   sentence concerning eternal life or death. For says God: "He shall
   prosecute that which is right justly." [2800] For he that is justly
   punished and separated by you is rejected from eternal life and glory;
   he becomes dishonourable among holy men, and one condemned of God.

    That the Same Punishment is Not to Be Inflicted for Every Offence, But
    Different Punishments for Different Offenders.

   XLVIII. Do not pass the same sentence for every sin, but one suitable
   to each crime, distinguishing all the several sorts of offences with
   much prudence, the great from the little. Treat a wicked action after
   one manner, and a wicked word after another; a bare intention still
   otherwise. So also in the case of a contumely or suspicion. And some
   thou shalt curb by threatenings alone; some thou shalt punish with
   fines to the poor; some thou shalt mortify with fastings; and others
   thou shalt separate according to the greatness of their several crimes.
   For the law did not allot the same punishment to every offence, but had
   a different regard to a sin against God, against the priest, against
   the temple, or against the sacrifice; from a sin against the king, or
   ruler, or a soldier, or a fellow-subject; and so were the offences
   different which were against a servant, a possession, or a brute
   creature. And again, sins were differently rated according as they were
   against parents and kinsmen, and those differently which were done on
   purpose from those that happened involuntarily. Accordingly the
   punishments were different: as death either by crucifixion or by
   stoning, fines, scourgings, or the suffering the same mischiefs they
   had done to others. Wherefore do you also allot different penalties to
   different offences, lest any injustice should happen, and provoke God
   to indignation. For of what unjust judgment soever you are the
   instruments, of the same you shall receive the reward from God. "For
   with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged." [2801]

    What are to Be the Characters of Accusers and Witnesses.

   XLIX. When, therefore, you are set down at your tribunal, and the
   parties are both of them present (for we will not call them brethren
   until they receive each other in peace), examine diligently concerning
   those who appear before you; and first concerning the accuser, whether
   this be the first person he has accused, or whether he has advanced
   accusations against some others before, and whether this contest and
   accusation of theirs does not arise from some quarrel, and what sort of
   life the accuser leads. Yet, though he be of a good conscience, do not
   give credit to him alone, for that is contrary to the law; but let him
   have others to join in his testimony, and those of the same course of
   life. As the law says: "At the mouth of two or three witnesses
   everything shall be established." [2802] But why did we say that the
   character of the witnesses was to be inquired after, of what sort it
   is? Because it frequently happens that two and more testify for
   mischief, and with joint consent prefer a lie; as did the two elders
   against Susanna in Babylon, [2803] and the sons of transgressors
   against Naboth in Samaria, [2804] and the multitude of the Jews against
   our Lord at Jerusalem, [2805] and against Stephen His first martyr.
   [2806] Let the witnesses therefore be meek, free from anger, full of
   equity, kind, prudent, continent, free from wickedness, faithful,
   religious; for the testimony of such persons is firm on account of
   their character, and true on account of their mode of life. But as to
   those of a different character, do not ye receive their testimony,
   although they seem to agree together in their evidence against the
   accused; for it is ordained in the law: "Thou shalt not be with a
   multitude for wickedness; thou shalt not receive a vain report; thou
   shalt not consent with a multitude to pervert judgment." [2807] You
   ought also particularly to know him that is accused; what he is in his
   course and mode of life; whether he have a good report as to his life;
   whether he has been unblameable; whether he has been zealous in
   holiness; whether he be a lover of the widows, a lover of the
   strangers, a lover of the poor, and a lover of the brethren; whether he
   be not given to filthy lucre; whether he be not an extravagant person,
   or a spendthrift; whether he be sober, and free from luxury, or a
   drunkard, or a glutton; whether he be compassionate and charitable.

    That Former Offences Do Sometimes Render After Accusations Credible.

   L. For if he has been before addicted to wicked works, the accusations
   which are now brought against him will thence in some measure appear to
   be true, unless justice do plainly plead for him. For it may be, that
   though he had formerly been an offender, yet that he may not be guilty
   of this crime of which he is accused. Wherefore be exactly cautious
   about such circumstances, and so render your sentences, when pronounced
   against the offender convicted, safe and firm. And if, after his
   separation, he begs pardon, and falls down before the bishop, and
   acknowledges his fault, receive him. But neither do you suffer a false
   accuser to go unpunished, that he may not calumniate another who lives
   well, or encourage some other person to do like him. Nor, to be sure,
   do ye suffer a person convicted to go off clear, lest another be
   ensnared in the same crimes. For neither shall a witness of mischiefs
   be unpunished, nor shall he that offends be without censure.

    Against Judging Without Hearing Both Sides.

   LI. We said before that judgment ought not to be given upon hearing
   only one of the parties; for if you hear one of them when the other is
   not there, and so cannot make his defence to the accusation brought
   against him, and rashly give your votes for condemnation, you will be
   found guilty of that man's destruction, and partaker with the false
   accuser before God, the just Judge. For "as he that holdeth the tail of
   a dog, so is he that presides at unjust judgment." [2808] But if ye
   become imitators of the elders in Babylon, who, when they had borne
   witness against Susanna, unjustly condemned her to death, you will
   become obnoxious to their judgment and condemnation. For the Lord by
   Daniel delivered Susanna from the hand of the ungodly, but condemned to
   the fire those elders who were guilty of her blood, and reproaches you
   by him, saying: "Are ye so foolish, ye children of Israel? Without
   examination, and without knowing the truth, have ye condemned a
   daughter of Israel? Return again to the place of judgment, for these
   men have borne false witness against her." [2809]

    The Caution Observed at Heathen Tribunals Before the Condemnation of
    Criminals Affords Christians a Good Example.

   LII. Consider even the judicatures of this world, by whose power we see
   murderers, adulterers, wizards, robbers of sepulchres, and thieves
   brought to trial; and those that preside, when they have received their
   accusations from those that brought them, ask the malefactor whether
   those things be so. And though he does not deny the crimes, they do not
   presently send him out to punishment; but for several days they make
   inquiry about him with a full council, and with the veil interposed.
   And he that is to pass the final decree and suffrage of death against
   him, lifts up his hands to the sun, and solemnly affirms that he is
   innocent of the blood of the man. Though they be heathens, and know not
   the Deity, nor the vengeance which will fall upon men from God on
   account of those that are justly condemned, they avoid such unjust
   judgments.

    That Christians Ought Not to Be Contentious One with Another.

   LIII. But you who know who our God is, and what are His judgments, how
   can you bear to pass an unjust judgment, since your sentence will be
   immediately known to God? And if you have judged righteously, you will
   be deemed worthy of the recompenses of righteousness, both now and
   hereafter; but if unrighteously, you will partake of the like. We
   therefore advise you, brethren, rather to deserve commendation from God
   than rebukes; for the commendation of God is eternal life to men, as is
   His rebuke everlasting death. Be ye therefore righteous judges,
   peacemakers, and without anger. For "he that is angry with his brother
   without a cause is obnoxious to the judgment." [2810] But if it happens
   that by any one's contrivance you are angry at anybody, "let not the
   sun go down upon your wrath;" [2811] for says David, "Be angry and sin
   not;" [2812] that is, be soon reconciled, lest your wrath continue so
   long that it turn to a settled hatred, and work sin. "For the souls of
   those that bear a settled hatred are to death," [2813] says Solomon.
   But our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ says in the Gospels: "If thou
   bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother
   hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go
   thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer
   thy gift to God." [2814] Now the gift to God is every one's prayer and
   thanksgiving. If, therefore, thou hast anything against thy brother, or
   he has anything against thee, neither will thy prayers be heard, nor
   will thy thanksgivings be accepted, by reason of that hidden anger. But
   it is your duty, brethren, to pray continually. Yet, because God hears
   not those which are at enmity with their brethren by unjust quarrels,
   even though they should pray three times an hour, it is our duty to
   compose all our enmity and littleness of soul, that we may be able to
   pray with a pure and unpolluted heart. For the Lord commanded us to
   love even our enemies, and by no means to hate our friends. And the
   lawgiver says: "Thou shalt not hate any man; thou shalt not hate thy
   brother in thy mind. Thou shalt certainly reprove thy brother, and not
   incur sin on his account." [2815] "Thou shalt not hate an Egyptian, for
   thou wast a sojourner with him. Thou shalt not hate an Idumæan, for he
   is thy brother." [2816] And David says: "If I have repaid those that
   requited me evil." [2817] Wherefore, if thou wilt be a Christian,
   follow the law of the Lord: "Loose every band of wickedness;" [2818]
   for the Lord has given thee authority to remit those sins to thy
   brother which he has committed against thee as far as "seventy times
   seven," [2819] that is, four hundred and ninety times. How oft,
   therefore, hast thou remitted to thy brother, that thou art unwilling
   to do it now, when thou also hast heard Jeremiah saying, "Do not any of
   you impute the wickedness of his neighbour in your hearts?" [2820] But
   thou rememberest injuries, and keepest enmity, and comest into
   judgment, and art suspicious of His anger, and thy prayer is hindered.
   Nay, if thou hast remitted to thy brother four hundred and ninety
   times, do thou still multiply thy acts of gentleness more, to do good
   for thy own sake. Although he does not do so, yet, however, do thou
   endeavour to forgive thy brother for God's sake, "that thou mayest be
   the son of thy Father which is in heaven," [2821] and when thou
   prayest, mayest be heard as a friend of God.

    That the Bishops Must by Their Deacon Put the People in Mind of the
    Obligation They are Under to Live Peaceably Together.

   LIV. Wherefore, O bishop, when you are to go to prayer after the
   lessons, and the psalmody, and the instruction out of the Scriptures,
   let the deacon stand nigh you, and with a loud voice say: Let none have
   any quarrel with another; let none come in hypocrisy; that if there be
   any controversy found among any of you, they may be affected in
   conscience, and may pray to God, and be reconciled to their brethren.
   For if, upon coming into any one's house, we are to say, "Peace be to
   this house," [2822] like sons of peace bestowing peace on those who are
   worthy, as it is written, "He came and preached peace to you that are
   nigh, and them that are far off, whom the Lord knows to be His," [2823]
   much more is it incumbent on those that enter into the Church of God
   before all things to pray for the peace of God. But if he prays for it
   upon others, much more let himself be within the same, as a child of
   light; for he that has it not within himself is not fit to bestow it
   upon others. Wherefore, before all things, it is our duty to be at
   peace in our own minds; for he that does not find any disorder in
   himself will not quarrel with another, but will be peaceable, friendly,
   gathering the Lord's people, and a fellow-worker with him, in order to
   the increasing the number of those that shall be saved in unanimity.
   For those who contrive enmities, and strifes, and contests, and
   lawsuits, are wicked, and aliens from God.

    An Enumeration of the Several Instances of Divine Providence, and How in
    Every Age from the Beginning of the World God Has Invited All Men to
    Repentance.

   LV. For God, being a God of mercy from the beginning, called every
   generation to repentance by righteous men and prophets. He instructed
   those before the flood by Abel and Sem, and Seth, also by Enos, and by
   Enoch that was translated; those at the flood by Noah; the inhabitants
   of Sodom by hospitable Lot; those after the flood by Melchizedek, and
   the patriarchs, and Job the beloved of God; the Egyptians by Moses; the
   Israelites by him, and Joshua, and Caleb, and Phineas, and the rest;
   those after the law by angels and prophets, and the same by His own
   incarnation [2824] of the Virgin; those a little before His bodily
   appearance by John His forerunner, and the same by the same person
   after Christ's birth, saying, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is
   at hand;" [2825] those after His passion by us, the twelve apostles,
   and Paul the chosen vessel. We therefore, who have been vouchsafed the
   favour of being the witnesses of His appearance, together with James
   the brother of our Lord, and the other seventy-two disciples, and his
   seven deacons, have heard from the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   by exact knowledge declare "what is the will of God, that good, and
   acceptable, and perfect will" [2826] which is made known to us by
   Jesus; that none should perish, but that all men with one accord should
   believe in Him, and send unanimously praise to Him, and thereby live
   for ever.

    That It is the Will of God that Men Should Be of One Mind in Matters of
    Religion, in Accord with the Heavenly Powers.

   LVI. For this is that which our Lord taught us when we pray to say to
   His Father, "Thy will be done, as in heaven, so upon earth;" [2827]
   that as the heavenly natures of the incorporeal powers do all glorify
   God with one consent, so also upon earth all men with one mouth and one
   purpose may glorify the only, the one, and the true God, by Christ His
   only-begotten. It is therefore His will that men should praise Him with
   unanimity, and adore Him with one consent. [2828] For this is His will
   in Christ, that those who are saved by Him may be many; but that you do
   not occasion any loss or diminution to Him, nor to the Church, or
   lessen the number by one soul of man, as destroyed by you, which might
   have been saved by repentance; and which therefore perishes not only by
   its own sin, but also by your treachery besides, whereby you fulfil
   that which is written, "He that gathereth not with me, scattereth."
   [2829] Such a one is a disperser of the sheep, an adversary, an enemy
   of God, a destroyer of those lambs whose Shepherd was the Lord, and we
   were the collectors out of various nations and tongues, by much pains
   and danger, and perpetual labour, by watchings, by fastings, by lyings
   on the ground, by persecutions, by stripes, by imprisonments, that we
   might do the will of God, and fill the feast-chamber with guests to sit
   down at His table, that is, the holy and Catholic Church, with joyful
   and chosen people, singing hymns and praises to God that has called
   them by us to life. And you, as much as in you lies, have dispersed
   them. Do you also of the laity be at peace with one another,
   endeavouring like wise men to increase the Church, and to turn back,
   and tame, and restore those which seem wild. For this is the greatest
   reward by His promise from God, "If thou fetch out the worthy and
   precious from the unworthy, thou shalt be as my mouth." [2830]

    Sec. VII.--On Assembling in the Church.

    An Exact Description of a Church and the Clergy, and What Things in
    Particular Every One is to Do in the Solemn Assemblies of the Clergy and
    Laity For Religious Worship.

   LVII. But be thou, O bishop, holy, unblameable, no striker, not soon
   angry, not cruel; but a builder up, a converter, apt to teach,
   forbearing of evil, of a gentle mind, meek, long-suffering, ready to
   exhort, ready to comfort, as a man of God.

   When thou callest an assembly of the Church as one that is the
   commander of a great ship, appoint the assemblies to be made with all
   possible skill, charging the deacons as mariners to prepare places for
   the brethren as for passengers, with all due care and decency. And
   first, let the building be long, with its head to the east, with its
   vestries on both sides at the east end, and so it will be like a ship.
   In the middle let the bishop's throne be placed, and on each side of
   him let the presbytery sit down; and let the deacons stand near at
   hand, in close and small girt garments, for they are like the mariners
   and managers of the ship: with regard to these, let the laity sit on
   the other side, with all quietness and good order. And let the women
   sit by themselves, they also keeping silence. In the middle, let the
   reader stand upon some high place: let him read the books of Moses, of
   Joshua the son of Nun, of the Judges, and of the Kings and of the
   Chronicles, and those written after the return from the captivity; and
   besides these, the books of Job and of Solomon, and of the sixteen
   prophets. But when there have been two lessons severally read, let some
   other person sing the hymns of David, and let the people join at the
   conclusions of the verses. Afterwards let our Acts be read, and the
   Epistles of Paul our fellow-worker, which he sent to the churches under
   the conduct of the Holy Spirit; and afterwards let a deacon or a
   presbyter read the Gospels, both those which I Matthew and John have
   delivered to you, and those which the fellow-workers of Paul received
   and left to you, Luke and Mark. And while the Gospel is read, let all
   the presbyters and deacons, and all the people, stand up in great
   silence; for it is written: "Be silent, and hear, O Israel." [2831] And
   again: "But do thou stand there, and hear." [2832] In the next place,
   let the presbyters one by one, not all together, exhort the people, and
   the bishop in the last place, as being the commander. Let the porters
   stand at the entries of the men, and observe them. Let the deaconesses
   also stand at those of the women, like shipmen. For the same
   description and pattern was both in the tabernacle of the testimony and
   in the temple of God. [2833] But if any one be found sitting out of his
   place, let him be rebuked by the deacon, as a manager of the foreship,
   and be removed into the place proper for him; for the Church is not
   only like a ship, but also like a sheepfold. For as the shepherds place
   all the brute creatures distinctly, I mean goats and sheep, according
   to their kind and age, and still every one runs together, like to his
   like; so is it to be in the Church. Let the young persons sit by
   themselves, if there be a place for them; if not, let them stand
   upright. But let those that are already stricken in years sit in order.
   For the children which stand, let their fathers and mothers take them
   to them. Let the younger women also sit by themselves, if there be a
   place for them; but if there be not, let them stand behind the women.
   Let those women which are married, and have children, be placed by
   themselves; but let the virgins, and the widows, and the elder women,
   stand or sit before all the rest; and let the deacon be the disposer of
   the places, that every one of those that comes in may go to his proper
   place, and may not sit at the entrance. In like manner, let the deacon
   oversee the people, that nobody may whisper, nor slumber, nor laugh,
   nor nod; for all ought in the church to stand wisely, and soberly, and
   attentively, having their attention fixed upon the word of the Lord.
   After this, let all rise up with one consent, and looking towards the
   east, after the catechumens and penitents are gone out, pray to God
   eastward, who ascended up to the heaven of heavens to the east;
   remembering also the ancient situation of paradise in the east, from
   whence the first man, when he had yielded to the persuasion of the
   serpent, and disobeyed the command of God, was expelled. As to the
   deacons, after the prayer is over, let some of them attend upon the
   oblation of the Eucharist, ministering to the Lord's body with fear.
   Let others of them watch the multitude, and keep them silent. But let
   that deacon who is at the high priest's hand say to the people, Let no
   one have any quarrel against another; let no one come in hypocrisy.
   Then let the men give the men, and the women give the women, the Lord's
   kiss. But let no one do it with deceit, as Judas betrayed the Lord with
   a kiss. After this let the deacon pray for the whole Church, for the
   whole world, and the several parts of it, and the fruits of it; for the
   priests and the rulers, for the high priest and the king, and the peace
   of the universe. After this let the high priest pray for peace upon the
   people, and bless them, as Moses commanded the priests to bless the
   people, in these words: "The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord
   make His face to shine upon thee, [2834] and give thee peace." [2835]
   Let the bishop pray for the people, and say: "Save Thy people, O Lord,
   and bless Thine inheritance, which Thou hast obtained with the precious
   blood of Thy Christ, and hast called a royal priesthood, and an holy
   nation." [2836] After this let the sacrifice follow, the people
   standing, and praying silently; and when the oblation has been made,
   let every rank by itself partake of the Lord's body and precious blood
   in order, and approach with reverence and holy fear, as to the body of
   their king. Let the women approach with their heads covered, as is
   becoming the order of women; but let the door be watched, lest any
   unbeliever, or one not yet initiated, come in. [2837]

    Of Commendatory Letters in Favour of Strangers, Lay Persons, Clergymen, and
    Bishops; And that Those Who Come into the Church Assemblies are to Be
    Received Without Regard to Their Quality.

   LVIII. If any brother, man or woman, come in from another parish,
   bringing recommendatory letters, let the deacon be the judge of that
   affair, inquiring whether they be of the faithful, and of the Church?
   whether they be not defiled by heresy? and besides, whether the party
   be a married woman or a widow? And when he is satisfied in these
   questions, that they are really of the faithful, and of the same
   sentiments in the things of the Lord, let him conduct every one to the
   place proper for him. And if a presbyter comes from another parish, let
   him be received to communion by the presbyters; if a deacon, by the
   deacons; if a bishop, let him sit with the bishop, and be allowed the
   same honour with himself; and thou, O bishop, shalt desire him to speak
   to the people words of instruction: for the exhortation and admonition
   of strangers is very acceptable, and exceeding profitable. For, as the
   Scripture says, "no prophet is accepted in his own country." [2838]
   Thou shalt also permit him to offer the Eucharist; but if, out of
   reverence to thee, and as a wise man, to preserve the honour belonging
   to thee, he will not offer, at least thou shalt compel him to give the
   blessing to the people. But if, after the congregation is sat down, any
   other person comes upon you of good fashion and character in the world,
   whether he be a stranger, or one of your own country, neither do thou,
   O bishop, if thou art speaking the word of God, or hearing him that
   sings or reads, accept persons so far as to leave the ministry of the
   word, that thou mayest appoint an upper place for him; but continue
   quiet, not interrupting thy discourse, nor thy attention. But let the
   brethren receive him by the deacons; and if there be not a place, let
   the deacon by speaking, but not in anger, raise the junior, and place
   the stranger there. And it is but reasonable that one that loves the
   brethren should do so of his own accord; but if he refuse, let him
   raise him up by force, and set him behind all, that the rest may be
   taught to give place to those that are more honourable. Nay, if a poor
   man, or one of a mean family, or a stranger, comes upon you, whether he
   be old or young, and there be no place, the deacon shall find a place
   for even these, and that with all his heart; that, instead of accepting
   persons before men, his ministration towards God may be well-pleasing.
   The very same thing let the deaconess do to those women, whether poor
   or rich, that come unto them.

    That Every Christian Ought to Frequent the Church Diligently Both Morning
    and Evening.

   LIX. When thou instructest the people, O bishop, command and exhort
   them to come constantly to church morning and evening every day, and by
   no means to forsake it on any account, but to assemble together
   continually; neither to diminish the Church by withdrawing themselves,
   and causing the body of Christ to be without its member. For it is not
   only spoken concerning the priests, but let every one of the laity
   hearken to it as concerning himself, considering that it is said by the
   Lord: "He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathereth not
   with me scattereth abroad." [2839] Do not you therefore scatter
   yourselves abroad, who are the members of Christ, by not assembling
   together, since you have Christ your head, according to His promise,
   present, and communicating to you. [2840] Be not careless of
   yourselves, neither deprive your Saviour of His own members, neither
   divide His body nor disperse His members, neither prefer the occasions
   of this life to the word of God; but assemble yourselves together every
   day, morning and evening, singing psalms and praying in the Lord's
   house: in the morning saying the sixty-second Psalm, and in the evening
   the hundred and fortieth, but principally on the Sabbath-day. And on
   the day of our Lord's resurrection, which is the Lord's day, meet more
   diligently, sending praise to God that made the universe by Jesus, and
   sent Him to us, and condescended to let Him suffer, and raised Him from
   the dead. Otherwise what apology will he make to God who does not
   assemble on that day to hear the saving word concerning the
   resurrection, on which we pray thrice standing in memory of Him who
   arose in three days, in which is performed the reading of the prophets,
   the preaching of the Gospel, the oblation of the sacrifice, the gift of
   the holy food?

    The Vain Zeal Which the Heathens and Jews Show in Frequenting Their Temples
    and Synagogues is a Proper Example and Motive to Excite Christians to
    Frequent the Church.

   LX. And how can he be other than an adversary to God, who takes pains
   about temporary things night and day, but takes no care of things
   eternal? who takes care of washings and temporary food every day, but
   does not take care of those that endure for ever? How can such a one
   even now avoid hearing that word of the Lord, "The Gentiles are
   justified more than you?" [2841] as He says, by way of reproach, to
   Jerusalem, "Sodom is justified rather than thou." For if the Gentiles
   every day, when they arise from sleep, run to their idols to worship
   them, and before all their work and all their labours do first of all
   pray to them, and in their feasts and in their solemnities do not keep
   away, but attend upon them; and not only those upon the place, but
   those living far distant do the same; and in their public shows all
   come together, as into a synagogue: in the same manner those which are
   vainly called Jews, when they have worked six days, on the seventh day
   rest, and come together into their synagogue, never leaving nor
   neglecting either rest from labour or assembling together, while yet
   they are deprived of the efficacy of the word in their unbelief, nay,
   and of the force of that name Judah, by which they call
   themselves,--for Judah is interpreted Confession,--but these do not
   confess to God (having unjustly occasioned the suffering on the cross),
   so as to be saved on their repentance;--if, therefore, those who are
   not saved frequently assemble together for such purposes as do not
   profit them, what apology wilt thou make to the Lord God who forsakest
   His Church, not imitating so much as the heathen, but by such thy
   absence growest slothful, or turnest apostate, or actest wickedness? To
   whom the Lord says by Jeremiah: "Ye have not kept my ordinances; nay,
   ye have not walked according to the ordinances of the heathen, and you
   have in a manner exceeded them." [2842] And again: "Israel has
   justified his soul more than treacherous Judah." [2843] And afterwards:
   "Will the Gentiles change their gods which are not gods? [2844]
   Wherefore pass over to the isles of Chittim, and behold, and send to
   Kedar, and observe diligently whether such things have been done. For
   those nations have not changed their ordinances; but," says He, "my
   people has changed its glory for that which will not profit." [2845]
   How, therefore, will any one make his apology who has despised or
   absented himself from the church of God?

    That We Must Not Prefer the Affairs of This Life to Those Which Concern the
    Worship of God.

   LXI. But if any one allege the pretence of his own work, and so is a
   despiser, "offering pretences for his sins," let such a one know that
   the trades of the faithful are works by the by, but the worship of God
   is their great work. Follow therefore your trades as by the by, for
   your maintenance, but make the worship of God your main business; as
   also our Lord said: "Labour not for the meat which perishes, but for
   that which endureth unto everlasting life." [2846] And again: "This is
   the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent." [2847]
   Endeavour therefore never to leave the Church of God; but if any one
   overlooks it, and goes either into a polluted temple of the heathens,
   or into a synagogue of the Jews or heretics, what apology will such a
   one make to God in the day of judgment, who has forsaken the oracles of
   the living God, and the living and quickening oracles, such as are able
   to deliver from eternal punishment, and has gone into an house of
   demons, or into a synagogue of the murderers of Christ, or the
   congregation of the wicked?--not hearkening unto him that says: "I have
   hated the congregation of the wicked, and I will not enter with the
   ungodly. I have not sat with the assembly of vanity, neither will I sit
   with the ungodly." [2848] And again: "Blessed is the man that hath not
   walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners,
   and hath not sat in the seat of the scornful; but his delight is in the
   law of the Lord, and in His law will he meditate day and night." [2849]
   But thou, forsaking the gathering together of the faithful, the Church
   of God, and His laws, hast respect to those "dens of thieves," calling
   those things holy which He has called profane, and making such things
   unclean which He has sanctified. And not only so, but thou already
   runnest after the pomps of the Gentiles, and hastenest to their
   theatres, being desirous to be reckoned one of those that enter into
   them, and to partake of unseemly, not to say abominable words; not
   hearkening to Jeremiah, who says, "O Lord, I have not sat in their
   assemblies, for they are scorners; but I was afraid because of Thy
   hand;" [2850] nor to Job, who speaks in like manner, "If I have gone at
   any time with the scornful; for I shall be weighed in a just balance."
   [2851] But why wilt thou be a partaker of the heathen oracles, which
   are nothing but dead men declaring by the inspiration of the devil
   deadly things, and such as tend to subvert the faith, and to draw those
   that attend to them to polytheism? Do you therefore, who attend to the
   laws. of God, esteem those laws more honourable than the necessities of
   this life, and pay a greater respect to them, and run together to the
   Church of the Lord, "which He has purchased with the blood of Christ,
   the beloved, the first-born of every creature." [2852] For this Church
   is the daughter of the Highest, which has been in travail of you by the
   word of grace, and has "formed Christ in you," of whom you are made
   partakers, and thereby become His holy and chosen members, "not having
   spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but as being holy and unspotted in
   the faith, ye are complete in Him, after the image of God that created
   you." [2853]

    That Christians Must Abstain from All the Impious Practices of the Heathens.

   LXII. Take heed, therefore, not to join yourselves in your worship with
   those that perish, which is the assembly of the Gentiles, to your
   deceit and destruction. For there is no fellowship between God and the
   devil; for he that assembles himself with those that favour the things
   of the devil, will be esteemed one of them, and will inherit a woe.
   Avoid also indecent spectacles: I mean the theatres and the pomps of
   the heathens; their enchantments, observations of omens, soothsayings,
   purgations, divinations, observations of birds; their necromancies and
   invocations. For it is written: "There is no divination in Jacob, nor
   soothsaying in Israel." [2854] And again: "Divination is iniquity."
   [2855] And elsewhere: "Ye shall not be soothsayers, and follow
   observers of omens, nor diviners, nor dealers with familiar spirits. Ye
   shall not preserve alive wizards." [2856] Wherefore Jeremiah exhorts,
   saying: "Walk ye not according to the ways of the heathen, and be not
   afraid of the signs of heaven." [2857] So that it is the duty of a
   believer to avoid the assemblies of the ungodly, of the heathen, and of
   the Jews, and of the rest of the heretics, lest by uniting ourselves to
   them we bring snares upon our own souls; that we may not by joining in
   their feasts, which are celebrated in honour of demons, be partakers
   with them in their impiety. You are also to avoid their public
   meetings, and those sports which are celebrated in them. For a believer
   ought not to go to any of those public meetings, unless to purchase a
   slave, and save a soul, [2858] and at the same time to buy such other
   things as suit their necessities. Abstain, therefore, from all
   idolatrous pomp and state, all their public meetings, banquets, duels,
   and all shows belonging to demons.

    Sec. VIII.--On the Duty of Working for a Livelihood.

    That a Christian Who Will Not Work Must Not Eat, as Peter and the Rest of
    the Apostles Were Fishermen, But Paul and Aquila Tentmakers, Jude the Son of
    James an Husbandman.

   LXIII. Let the young persons of the Church endeavour to minister
   diligently in all necessaries: mind your business with all becoming
   seriousness, that so you may always have sufficient to support
   yourselves and those that are needy, and not burden the Church of God.
   For we ourselves, besides our attention to the word of the Gospel, do
   not neglect our inferior employments. For some of us are fishermen,
   some tentmakers, some husbandmen, that so we may never be idle. So says
   Solomon somewhere: "Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways
   diligently, and become wiser than she. For she, having neither field,
   overseer, nor ruler, prepareth her food in the summer, and layeth up a
   great store in the harvest. Or else go to the bee, and learn how
   laborious she is, and her work how valuable it is, whose labours both
   kings and mean men make use of for their health. She is desirable and
   glorious, though she be weak in strength, yet by honouring wisdom she
   is improved, etc. How long wilt thou lie on thy bed, O sluggard? When
   wilt thou wake out of thy sleep? Thou sleepest awhile thou liest down
   awhile, thou slumberest awhile, thou foldest thy hands on thy breast to
   sleep awhile. Then poverty comes on thee like an evil traveller, and
   want as a swift racer. But if thou beest diligent, thy harvest shall
   come as a fountain, and want shall fly from thee as an evil runagate."
   [2859] And again: "He that manageth his own land shall be filled with
   bread." [2860] And elsewhere he says: "The slothful has folded his own
   hands together, and has eaten his own flesh." [2861] And afterwards:
   "The sluggard hides his hand; he will not be able to bring it to his
   mouth." [2862] And again: "By slothfulness of the hands a floor will be
   brought low." [2863] Labour therefore continually; for the blot of the
   slothful is not to be healed. But "if any one does not work, let not
   such a one eat" [2864] among you. For the Lord our God hates the
   slothful. For no one of those who are dedicated to God ought to be
   idle.

   (To purchase a slave, and save a soul, [271]p. 424.)

   The calm and patient course of the Church in gradually obliterating
   slavery has been well defended by the pious Spanish Ultramontane writer
   Jacques Balmès. [2865] Of course, he imagines that "the Catholic
   Church," which wrought the change, was his own Tridentine Communion,
   [2866] Lecky's remarks on the gladiators and slavery as the product of
   famines and distress are worthy of note, and even he is forced to
   recognise the ameliorating influences of Christianity from the
   beginning. [2867] He says:--

   "Christianity for the first time made charity a rudimentary virtue,
   giving it a foremost place in the moral type and in the exhortations of
   its teachers. Besides its general influence in stimulating the
   affections, it effected a complete revolution in this sphere, by
   representing the poor as the special representatives of the Christian
   founder, and thus making the love of Christ rather than the love of man
   the principle of charity. Even in the days of persecution, collections
   for the relief of the poor were made at the Sunday meetings. The agapæ,
   or feasts of love, were intended mainly for the poor; and food that was
   saved by the fasts was devoted to their benefit. A vast organization of
   charity, presided over by the bishops, and actively directed by the
   deacons, soon ramified over Christendom, till the bond of charity
   became the bond of unity, and the most distant sections of the
   Christian Church corresponded by the interchange of mercy. [2868] Long
   before the era of Constantine it was observed that the charities of the
   Christians were so extensive--it may perhaps be said so excessive--that
   they drew very many impostors to the Church; and, when the victory of
   Christianity was achieved, the enthusiasm for charity displayed itself
   in the erection of numerous institutions that were altogether unknown
   to the pagan world."

    Sec. I.--Concerning Widows.

      The Age at Which Widows Should Be Chosen.

   I. Choose your "widows not under sixty years of age," [2869] that in
   some measure the suspicion of a second marriage may be prevented by
   their age. But if you admit one younger into the order of widows, and
   she cannot bear her widowhood in her youth, and marries, she will
   procure indecent reflections on the glory of the order of the widows,
   and shall give an account to God; not because she married a second
   time, but because she has "waxed wanton against Christ," [2870] and not
   kept her promise, because she did not come and keep her promise with
   faith and the fear of God. [2871] Wherefore such a promise ought not to
   be rashly made, but with great caution: "for it is better for her not
   to vow, than to vow and not to pay." [2872] But if any younger woman,
   who has lived but a while with her husband, and has lost him by death
   or some other occasion, and remains by herself, having the gift of
   widowhood, she will be found to be blessed, and to be like the widow of
   Sarepta, belonging to Sidon, with whom the holy prophet of God, Elijah,
   [2873] lodged. Such a one may also be compared to "Anna, the daughter
   of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser, which departed not from the temple,
   but continued in supplications and prayers night and day, who was
   fourscore years old, and had lived with an husband seven years from her
   virginity, who glorified the coming of Christ, and gave thanks to the
   Lord, and spake concerning Him to all those who looked for redemption
   in Israel." [2874] Such a widow will have a good report, and will be
   honoured, having both glory with men upon earth, and eternal praise
   with God in heaven.

      That We Must Avoid the Choice of Younger Widows, Because of Suspicion.

   II. But let not the younger widows be placed in the order of widows,
   lest, under pretence of inability to contain in the flower of their
   age, they come to a second marriage, and become subject to imputation.
   But let them be assisted and supported, that so they may not, under
   pretence of being deserted, come to a second marriage, and so be
   ensnared in an unseemly imputation. For you ought to know this, that
   once marrying according to the law is righteous, as being according to
   the will of God; but second marriages, after the promise, are wicked,
   not on account of the marriage itself, but because of the falsehood.
   Third marriages are indications of incontinency. But such marriages as
   are beyond the third are manifest fornication, and unquestionable
   uncleanness. For God in the creation gave one woman to one man; for
   "they two shall be one flesh." [2875] But to the younger women let a
   second marriage be allowed after the death of their first husband, lest
   they fall into the condemnation of the devil, and many snares, and
   foolish lusts, which are hurtful to souls, and which bring upon them
   punishment rather than rest.

      What Character the Widows Ought to Be Of, and How They Ought to Be
      Supported by the Bishop.

   III. But the true widows are those which have had only one husband,
   having a good report among the generality for good works; widows
   indeed, sober, chaste, faithful, pious, who have brought up their
   children well, and have entertained strangers unblameably, which are to
   be supported as devoted to God. Besides, do thou, O bishop, be mindful
   of the needy, both reaching out thy helping hand and making provision
   for them as the steward of God, distributing seasonably the oblations
   to every one of them, to the widows, the orphans, the friendless, and
   those tried with affliction.

      That We Ought to Be Charitable to All Sorts of Persons in Want.

   IV. For what if some are neither widows nor widowers, but stand in need
   of assistance, either through poverty or some disease, or the
   maintenance of a great number of children? It is thy duty to oversee
   all people, and to take care of them all. For they that give gifts do
   not of their own head give them to the widows, but barely bring them
   in, calling them free-will offerings, that so thou that knowest those
   that are in affliction mayest as a good steward give them their portion
   of the gift. For God knows the giver, though thou distributest it to
   those in want when he is absent. And he has the reward of well-doing,
   but thou the blessedness of having dispensed it with a good conscience.
   But do thou tell them who was the giver, that they may pray for him by
   name. For it is our duty to do good to all men, not fondly preferring
   one or another, whoever they be. For the Lord says: "Give to every one
   that asketh of thee." [2876] It is evident that it is meant of every
   one that is really in want, whether he be friend or foe, whether he be
   a kinsman or a stranger, whether he be single or married. For in all
   the Scripture the Lord gives us exhortations about the needy, saying
   first by Isaiah: "Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poor
   which have no covering into thine house. If thou seest the naked, do
   thou cover him; and thou shalt not overlook those which are of thine
   own family and seed." [2877] And then by Daniel He says to the
   potentate: "Wherefore, O king, let my counsel please thee, and purge
   thy sins by acts of mercy, and thine iniquities by bowels of compassion
   to the needy." [2878] And He says by Solomon: "By acts of mercy and of
   faith iniquities are purged." [2879] And He says again by David:
   "Blessed is he that has regard to the poor and needy; the Lord shall
   deliver him in the evil day." [2880] And again: "He hath dispersed
   abroad, he hath given to the needy, his righteousness remaineth for
   ever." [2881] And Solomon says: "He that hath mercy on the poor lendeth
   to the Lord; [2882] according to his gift it shall be repaid him
   again." [2883] And afterwards: "He that stoppeth his ear, that he may
   not hear him that is in want, he also shall call himself, and there
   shall be none to hear him." [2884]

      That the Widows are to Be Very Careful of Their Behavior.

   V. Let every widow be meek, quiet, gentle, sincere, free from anger,
   not talkative, not clamorous, not hasty of speech, not given to
   evil-speaking, not captious, not double-tongued, not a busybody. If she
   see or hear anything that is not right, let her be as one that does not
   see, and as one that does not hear. And let the widow mind nothing but
   to pray for those that give, and for the whole Church; and when she is
   asked anything by any one, let her not easily answer, excepting
   questions concerning the faith, and righteousness, and hope in God,
   remitting those that desire to be instructed in the doctrines of
   godliness to the governors. Let her only answer so as may tend to the
   subversion of the error of polytheism, and let her demonstrate the
   assertion concerning the monarchy of God. But of the remaining
   doctrines let her not answer anything rashly, lest by saying anything
   unlearnedly she should make the word to be blasphemed. For the Lord has
   taught us that the word is like "a grain of mustard seed," [2885] which
   is of a fiery nature, which if any one uses unskilfully, he will find
   it bitter. For in the mystical points we ought not to be rash, but
   cautious; for the Lord exhorts us, saying: "Cast not your pearls before
   swine, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn again and rend
   you." [2886] For unbelievers, when they hear the doctrine concerning
   Christ not explained as it ought to be, but defectively, and especially
   that concerning His incarnation or His passion, will rather reject it
   with scorn, and laugh at it as false, than praise God for it. And so
   the aged women will be guilty of rashness, and of causing blasphemy,
   and will inherit a woe. For says He, "Woe to him by whom my name is
   blasphemed among the Gentiles." [2887]

      That Women Ought Not to Teach, Because It is Unseemly; And What Women
      Followed Our Lord.

   VI. We do not permit our "women to teach in the Church," [2888] but
   only to pray and hear those that teach; for our Master and Lord, Jesus
   Himself, when He sent us the twelve to make disciples of the people and
   of the nations, did nowhere send out women to preach, although He did
   not want such. For there were with us the mother of our Lord and His
   sisters; also Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Martha
   and Mary the sisters of Lazarus; Salome, and certain others. For, had
   it been necessary for women to teach, He Himself had first commanded
   these also to instruct the people with us. For "if the head of the wife
   be the man," [2889] it is not reasonable that the rest of the body
   should govern the head. Let the widow therefore own herself to be the
   "altar of God," and let her sit in her house, and not enter into the
   houses of the faithful, under any pretence, to receive anything; for
   the altar of God never runs about, but is fixed in one place. Let,
   therefore, the virgin and the widow be such as do not run about, or gad
   to the houses of those who are alien from the faith. For such as these
   are gadders and impudent: they do not make their feet to rest in one
   place, because they are not widows, but purses ready to receive,
   triflers, evil-speakers, counsellors of strife, without shame,
   impudent, who being such, are not worthy of Him that called them. For
   they do not come to the common station of the congregation on the
   Lord's day, [2890] as those that are watchful; but either they slumber,
   or trifle, or allure men, or beg, or ensnare others, bringing them to
   the evil one; not suffering them to be watchful in the Lord, but taking
   care that they go out as vain as they came in, because they do not hear
   the word of the Lord either taught or read. For of such as these the
   prophet Isaiah says: "Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand;
   and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: for the heart of this people
   is waxen gross, [2891] and they hear heavily with their ears." [2892]

      What are the Characters of Widows Falsely So Called.

   VII. In the same manner, therefore, the ears of the hearts of such
   widows as these are stopped, that they will not sit within in their
   cottages to speak to the Lord, but will run about with the design of
   getting, and by their foolish prattling fulfil the desires of the
   adversary. Such widows, therefore, are not affixed to the altar of
   Christ: for there are some widows which esteem gain their business; and
   since they ask without shame, and receive without being satisfied,
   render the generality more backward in giving. For when they ought to
   be content with their subsistence from the Church, as having moderate
   desires, on the contrary, they run from one of their neighbours' houses
   [2893] to another, and disturb them, heaping up to themselves plenty of
   money, and lend at bitter usury, and are only solicitous about mammon,
   whose bag is their god; who prefer eating and drinking before all
   virtue, saying, "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die;" [2894]
   who esteem these things as if they were durable and not perishing
   things. For she that uses herself to nothing but talking of money,
   worships mammon instead of God,--that is, is a servant to gain, but
   cannot be pleasing to God, nor resigned to His worship; not being able
   to intercede with Him continuously on account that her mind and
   disposition run after money: for "where the treasure is, there will the
   heart be also." [2895] For she is thinking in her mind whither she may
   go to receive, or that a certain woman her friend has forgot her, and
   she has somewhat to say to her. She that thinks of such things as these
   will no longer attend to her prayers, but to that thought which offers
   itself; so that though sometimes she would pray for anybody, she will
   not be heard, because she does not offer her petition to the Lord with
   her whole heart, but with a divided mind. But she that will attend to
   God will sit within, and mind the things of the Lord day and night,
   offering her sincere petition with a mouth ready to utter the same
   without ceasing. As therefore Judith, most famous for her wisdom, and
   of a good report for her modesty, "prayed to God night and day for
   Israel;" [2896] so also the widow who is like to her will offer her
   intercession without ceasing for the Church to God. And He will hear
   her, because her mind is fixed on this thing alone, and is not disposed
   to be either insatiable, or covetous, or expensive; when her eye is
   pure, and her hearing clean, and her hands undefiled, and her feet
   quiet, and her mouth prepared for neither gluttony nor trifling, but
   speaking the things that are fit, and partaking of only such things as
   are necessary for her maintenance. So, being grave, and giving no
   disturbance, she will be pleasing to God; and as soon as she asks
   anything, the gift will come to her: as He says, "While thou art
   speaking, I will say, Behold, I am here." [2897] Let such a one also be
   free from the love of money, free from arrogance, not given to filthy
   lucre, not insatiable, not gluttonous, but continent, meek, giving
   nobody disturbance, pious, modest, sitting at home, singing, and
   praying, and reading, and watching, and fasting; speaking to God
   continually in songs and hymns. And let her take wool, and rather
   assist others than herself want from them; being mindful of that widow
   who is honoured in the Gospel with the Lord's testimony, who, coming
   into the temple, "cast into the treasury two mites, which make a
   farthing. And Christ our Lord and Master, and Searcher of hearts, saw
   her, and said, Verily I say unto you, that this widow hath cast into
   the treasury more than they all: for all they have cast in of their
   abundance, but this woman of her penury hath cast in all the living
   that she had." [2898]

   The widows therefore ought to be grave, obedient to their bishops, and
   their presbyters, and their deacons, and besides these to the
   deaconesses, with piety, reverence, and fear; not usurping authority,
   nor desiring to do anything beyond the constitution without the consent
   of the deacon: as, suppose, the going to any one to eat or drink with
   him, or to receive anything from anybody. But if without direction she
   does any one of these things, let her be punished with fasting, or else
   let her be separated on account of her rashness.

      That the Widows Ought Not to Accept of Alms from the Unworthy No More Than
      the Bishop, or Any Other of the Faithful.

   VIII. For how does such a one know of what character the person is from
   whom she receives? or from what sort of ministration he supplies her
   with food, whether it does not arise from rapine or some other ill
   course of life? while the widow does not remember that if she receives
   in a way unworthy of God, she must give an account for every one of
   these things. For neither will the priests at any time receive a
   free-will offering from such a one, as, suppose, from a rapacious
   person or from a harlot. For it is written, "Thou shalt not covet the
   goods that are thy neighbour's;" [2899] and, "Thou shalt not offer the
   hire of an harlot to the Lord God." [2900] From such as these no
   offerings ought to be accepted, nor indeed from those that are
   separated from the Church. Let the widows also be ready to obey the
   commands given them by their superiors, and let them do according to
   the appointment of the bishop, being obedient to him as to God; for he
   that receives from such a one who is worthy of blame, or from one
   excommunicated, and prays for him, while he purposes to go on in a
   wicked course, and while he is not willing at any time to repent, holds
   communion with him in prayer, and grieves Christ, who rejects the
   unrighteous, and confirms them by means of the unworthy gift, and is
   defiled with them, not suffering them to come to repentance, so as to
   fall down before God with lamentation, and pray to Him.

      That Women Ought Not to Baptize, Because It is Impious, and Contrary to
      the Doctrine of Christ.

   IX. Now, as to women's baptizing, we let you know that there is no
   small peril to those that undertake it. Therefore we do not advise you
   to it; for it is dangerous, or rather wicked and impious. For if the
   "man be the head of the woman," [2901] and he be originally ordained
   for the priesthood, it is not just to abrogate the order of the
   creation, and leave the principal to come to the extreme part of the
   body. For the woman is the body of the man, taken from his side, and
   subject to him, from whom she was separated for the procreation of
   children. For says He, "He shall rule over thee." [2902] For the
   principal part of the woman is the man, as being her head. But if in
   the foregoing constitutions we have not permitted them to teach, how
   will any one allow them, contrary to nature, to perform the office of a
   priest? For this is one of the ignorant practices of the Gentile
   atheism, to ordain women priests to the female deities, not one of the
   constitutions of Christ. For if baptism were to be administered by
   women, certainly our Lord would have been baptized by His own mother,
   and not by John; or when He sent us to baptize, He would have sent
   along with us women also for this purpose. But now He has nowhere,
   either by constitution or by writing, delivered to us any such thing;
   as knowing the order of nature, and the decency of the action; [2903]
   as being the Creator of nature, and the Legislator of the constitution.

      That a Layman Ought Not to Do Any Office of the Priesthood: He Ought
      Neither to Baptize, Nor Offer, Nor Lay on Hands, Nor Give the Blessing.

   X. Neither do we permit the laity to perform any of the offices
   belonging to the priesthood; as, for instance, neither the sacrifice,
   nor baptism, nor the laying on of hands, nor the blessing, whether the
   smaller or the greater: for "no one taketh this honour to himself, but
   he that is called of God." [2904] For such sacred offices are conferred
   by the laying on of the hands of the bishop. But a person to whom such
   an office is not committed, but he seizes upon it for himself, he shall
   undergo the punishment of Uzziah. [2905]

      That None But a Bishop and Presbyter, None Even of the Inferior Ranks of
      the Clergy, are Permitted to Do the Offices of the Priests; That
      Ordination Belongs Wholly to the Bishop, and to Nobody Else.

   XI. Nay, further, we do not permit to the rest of the clergy to
   baptize,--as, for instance, neither to readers, nor singers, nor
   porters, nor ministers,--but to the bishops and presbyters alone, yet
   so that the deacons are to minister to them therein. But those who
   venture upon it shall undergo the punishment of the companions of
   Corah. [2906] We do not permit presbyters to ordain deacons, or
   deaconesses, or readers, or ministers, or singers, or porters, but only
   bishops; for this is the ecclesiastical order and harmony.

      The Rejection of All Uncharitable Actions.

   XII. Now, as concerning envy, or jealousy, or evil-speaking, or strife,
   or the love of contention, we have said already to you, that these are
   alien from a Christian, and chiefly in the case of widows. But because
   the devil, who works in men, is in his conduct cunning, and full of
   various devices, he goes to those that are not truly widows, as
   formerly to Cain (for some say they are widows, but do not perform the
   injunctions agreeable to the widowhood; as neither did Cain discharge
   the duties due to a brother: for they do not consider how it is not the
   name of widowhood that will bring them to the kingdom of God, but true
   faith and holy [2907] works). But if any one possesses the name of
   widowhood, but does the works of the adversary, her widowhood will not
   be imputed, but she will be thrust out of the kingdom, and delivered to
   eternal punishment. For we hear that some widows are jealous, envious
   calumniators, and envious at the quiet of others. Such widows as these
   are not the disciples of Christ, nor of His doctrine; for it becomes
   them, when one of their fellow-widows is clothed by any one, or
   receives money, or meat, or drink, or shoes, at the sight of the
   refreshment of their sister to say:--

      How the Widows are to Pray for Those that Supply Their Necessities.

   XIII. Thou art blessed, O God, who hast refreshed my fellow-widow.
   Bless, O Lord, and glorify him that has bestowed these things upon her,
   and let his good work ascend in truth to Thee, and remember him for
   good in the day of his visitation. And as for my bishop, who has so
   well performed his duty to Thee, and [2908] has ordered such a
   seasonable alms to be bestowed on my fellow-widow, who was naked, do
   Thou increase his glory, and give him a [2909] crown of rejoicing in
   the day of the revelation of Thy visitation. In the same manner, let
   the widow who has received the alms join with the other in praying for
   him who ministered to her.

      That She Who Has Been Kind to the Poor Ought Not to Make a Stir and Tell
      Abroad Her Name, According to the Constitution of the Lord.

   XIV. But if any woman has been good, let her, as a prudent person,
   conceal her own name, not sounding a trumpet before her, that her alms
   may be with God in secret, as the Lord says: "Thou, when thou doest
   thine alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand cloth, that
   thine alms may be in secret." [2910] And let the widow pray for him
   that gave her the alms, whosoever he be, as being the holy altar of
   Christ; [2911] and "the Father, who seeth in secret, will render to him
   that did good openly." But those widows which will not live according
   to the command of God, are solicitous and inquisitive what deaconess it
   is that gives the charity, and what widows receive it. And when she has
   learned those things, she murmurs at the deaconess who distributed the
   charity, saying, Dost not thou see that I am in more distress, and want
   of thy charity? Why, therefore, hast thou preferred her before me? She
   says these things foolishly, not understanding that this does not
   depend on the will of man, but the appointment of God. For if she is
   herself a witness that she was nearer, and, upon inquiry, was in
   greater want, and more naked than the other, she ought to understand
   who it is that made this constitution, and to hold her peace, and not
   to murmur at the deaconess who distributed the charity, but to enter
   into her own house, and to cast herself prostrate on her face to make
   supplication to God that her sin may be forgiven her. For God commanded
   the deaconess who brought the charity not to proclaim the same, and
   this widow murmured because she did not publish her name, that so she
   might know it, and run to receive; nay, did not only murmur, but also
   cursed her, forgetting Him that said: "He that blesseth thee is
   blessed, and he that curseth thee is cursed." [2912] But the Lord says:
   "When ye enter into an house, say, Peace be to this house. And if the
   son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if it be not
   worthy, your peace shall return to you." [2913]

      That It Does Not Become Us to Revile Our Neighbours, Because Cursing is
      Contrary to Christianity.

   XV. If, therefore, peace returns upon those that sent it, nay, upon
   those that before had actually given it, because it did not find
   persons fit to receive it, much rather will a curse return upon the
   head of him that unjustly sent it, because he to whom it was sent was
   not worthy to receive it: for all those who abuse others without a
   cause curse themselves, as Solomon says: "As birds and sparrows fly
   away, so the curse causeless shall not come upon any one." [2914] And
   again he says: "Those that bring reproaches are exceeding foolish."
   [2915] But as the bee, a creature as to its strength feeble, if she
   stings any one, loses her sting, and becomes a drone; in the same
   manner you also, whatsoever injustice you do to others, will bring it
   upon yourselves. "He hath graven and digged a pit, and he shall fall
   into the same ditch that he has made." [2916] And again: "He that
   diggeth a pit for his neighbour, shall fall into it." [2917] Wherefore
   he that avoids a curse, let him not curse another; for "what thou
   hatest should be done to thee, do not thou to another." [2918]
   Wherefore admonish the widows that are feeble-minded, strengthen those
   of them that are weak, and praise such of them as walk in holiness. Let
   them rather bless, and not calumniate. Let them make peace, and not
   stir up contention.

    Sec. II.--On Deacons and Deaconesses, the Rest of the Clergy, and on
    Baptism.

   Let not therefore either a bishop, or a presbyter, or a deacon, or any
   one else of the sacerdotal catalogue, defile his tongue with calumny,
   lest he inherit a curse instead of a blessing; and let it also be the
   bishop's business and care that no lay person utter any curse: for he
   ought to take care of all,--of the clergy, of the virgins, of the
   widows, of the laity. For which reason, O bishop, do thou ordain thy
   fellow-workers, the labourers for life and for righteousness, such
   deacons as are pleasing to God, such whom thou provest to be worthy
   among all the people, and such as shall be ready for the necessities of
   their ministration. Ordain also a deaconess who is faithful and holy,
   for the ministrations towards women. For sometimes he cannot send a
   deacon, who is a man, to the women, on account of unbelievers. Thou
   shalt therefore send a woman, a deaconess, on account of the
   imaginations of the bad. For we stand in need of a woman, a deaconess,
   for many necessities; and first in the baptism of women, the deacon
   shall anoint only their forehead with the holy oil, and after him the
   deaconess shall anoint them: [2919] for there is no necessity that the
   women should be seen by the men; but only in the laying on of hands the
   bishop shall anoint her head, as the priests and kings were formerly
   anointed, not because those which are now baptized are ordained
   priests, but as being Christians, or anointed, from Christ the
   Anointed, "a royal priesthood, and an holy nation, the Church of God,
   the pillar and ground of the marriage-chamber," [2920] who formerly
   were not a people, but now are beloved and chosen, upon whom is called
   His new name [2921] as Isaiah the prophet witnesses, saying: "And they
   shall call the people by His new name, which the Lord shall name for
   them." [2922]

      Concerning the Sacred Initiation of Holy Baptism.

   XVI. Thou therefore, O bishop, according to that type, shalt anoint the
   head of those that are to be baptized, whether they be men or women,
   with the holy oil, for a type of the spiritual baptism. After that,
   either thou, O bishop, or a presbyter that is under thee, shall in the
   solemn form name over them the Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, and
   shall dip them in the water; and let a deacon receive the man, and a
   deaconess the woman, that so the conferring of this inviolable seal may
   take place with a becoming decency. And after that, let the bishop
   anoint those that are baptized with ointment.

      What is the Meaning of Baptism into Christ, and on What Account Everything
      is There Said or Done.

   XVII. This baptism, therefore, is given into the death of Jesus: [2923]
   the water is instead of the burial, and the oil instead of the Holy
   Ghost; the seal instead of the cross; the ointment is the confirmation
   of the confession; the mention of the Father as of the Author and
   Sender; the joint mention of the Holy Ghost as of the witness; the
   descent into the water the dying together with Christ; the ascent out
   of the water the rising again with Him. The Father is the God over all;
   Christ is the only-begotten God, the beloved Son, the Lord of glory;
   the Holy Ghost is the Comforter, who is sent by Christ, land taught by
   Him, and proclaims Him.

      Of What Character He Ought to Be Who is Initiated.

   XVIII. But let him that is to be baptized be free from all iniquity;
   one that has left off to work sin, the friend of God, the enemy of the
   devil, the heir of God the Father, the fellow-heir of His Son; one that
   has renounced Satan, and the demons, and Satan's deceits; chaste, pure,
   holy, beloved of God, the son of God, praying as a son to his father,
   and saying, as from the common congregation of the faithful, thus: "Our
   Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come;
   Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven; give us this day our
   daily bread; and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and
   lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one: for
   Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen."
   [2924]

      What are the Characters of a Deacon.

   XIX. Let the deacons be in all things unspotted, as the bishop himself
   is to be, only more active; in number according to the largeness of the
   Church, that they may minister to the infirm as workmen that are not
   ashamed. And let the deaconess be diligent in taking care of the women;
   but both of them ready to carry messages, to travel about, to minister,
   and to serve, as spake Isaiah concerning the Lord, saying: "To justify
   the righteous, who serves many faithfully." [2925] Let every one
   therefore know his proper place, and discharge it diligently with one
   consent, with one mind, as knowing the reward of their ministration;
   but let them not be ashamed to minister to those that are in want, as
   even our "Lord Jesus Christ came not to be ministered unto, but to
   minister and to give His life a ransom for many." [2926] So therefore
   ought they also to do, and not to scruple it, if they should be obliged
   to lay down their life for a brother. For the Lord and our Saviour
   Jesus Christ did not scruple to "lay down His life," as Himself says,
   "for His friends." [2927] If, therefore, the Lord of heaven and earth
   underwent all His sufferings for us, how then do you make a difficulty
   to minister to such as are in want, who ought to imitate Him who
   underwent servitude, and want, and stripes, and the cross for us? We
   ought therefore also to serve the brethren, in imitation of Christ. For
   says He: "He that will be great among you, let him be your minister;
   and he that will be first among you, let him be your servant." [2928]
   For so did He really, and not in word only, fulfil the prediction of,
   "serving many faithfully." [2929] For "when He had taken a towel, He
   girded Himself. Afterward He puts water into a bason; and as we were
   sitting at meat, He came and washed the feet of us all, and wiped them
   with the towel." [2930] By doing this He demonstrated to us His
   kindness and brotherly affection, that so we also might do the same to
   one another. If, therefore, our Lord and Master so humbled Himself, how
   can you, the labourers of the truth, and administrators of piety, be
   ashamed to do the same to such of the brethren as are weak and infirm?
   Minister therefore with a kind mind, not murmuring nor mutinying; for
   ye do not do it on the account of man, but on the account of God, and
   shall receive from Him the reward of your ministry in the day of your
   visitation. It is your duty who are deacons to visit all those who
   stand in need of visitation. And tell your bishop of all those that are
   in affliction; for you ought to be like his soul and senses--active and
   attentive in all things to him [2931] as to your bishop, and father
   [2932] and master.

      That a Bishop Ought to Be Ordained by Three or by Two Bishops, But Not by
      One; For that Would Be Invalid.

   XX. We command that a bishop be ordained by three bishops, or at least
   by two; but it is not lawful that he be set over you by one; for the
   testimony of two or three witnesses is more firm and secure. But a
   presbyter and a deacon are to be ordained by one bishop and the rest of
   the clergy. Nor must either a presbyter or a deacon ordain from the
   laity into the clergy; but the presbyter is only to teach, to offer, to
   baptize, to bless the people, and the deacon is to minister to the
   bishop, and to the presbyters, that is, to do the office of a
   ministering deacon, but not to meddle with the other offices.

    Sec. I.--On Helping the Poor.

      Those Who Have No Children Should Adopt Orphans, and Treat Them as Their
      Own Children.

   I. When any Christian becomes an orphan, whether it be a young man or a
   maid, it is good that some one of the brethren who is without a child
   should take the young man, and esteem him in the place of a son; and he
   that has a son about the same age, and that is marriageable, should
   marry the maid to him: for they which do so perform a great work, and
   become fathers to the orphans, and shall receive the reward of this
   charity from the Lord God. But if any one that walks in the way of
   man-pleasing is rich, and therefore is ashamed of orphans, the Father
   of orphans and Judge of widows will make provision for the orphans, but
   himself shall have such an heir as will spend what he has spared; and
   it shall happen to him according as it is said: "What things the holy
   people have not eaten, those shall the Assyrians eat." As also Isaiah
   says: "Your land, strangers devour it in your presence." [2933]

      How the Bishop Ought to Provide for the Orphans.

   II. Do you therefore, O bishops, be solicitous about their maintenance,
   being in nothing wanting to them; exhibiting to the orphans the care of
   parents; to the widows the care of husbands; to those of suitable age,
   marriage; to the artificer, work; to the unable, commiseration; to the
   strangers, an house; to the hungry, food; to the thirsty, drink; to the
   naked, clothing; to the sick, visitation; to the prisoners, assistance.
   Besides these, have a greater care of the orphans, that nothing may be
   wanting to them; and that as to the maiden, till she arrives at the age
   of marriage, and ye give her in marriage to a brother: to the young man
   assistance, that he may learn a trade, and may be maintained by the
   advantage arising from it; that so, when he is dextrous in the
   management of it, he may thereby be enabled to buy himself the tools of
   his trade, that so he may no longer burden any of the brethren, or
   their sincere love to him, but may support himself: for certainly he is
   a happy man who is able to support himself, and does not take up the
   place of the orphan, the stranger, and the widow.

      Who Ought to Be Supported According to the Lord's Constitution.

   III. Since even the Lord said: "The giver was happier than the
   receiver." [2934] For it is again said by Him: "Woe to those that have,
   and receive in hypocrisy; or who are able to support themselves, yet
   will receive of others: for both of them shall give an account to the
   Lord God in the day of judgment." But an orphan who, by reason of his
   youth, or he that by the feebleness of old age, or the incidence of a
   disease, or the bringing up of many children, receives alms, such a one
   shall not only not be blamed, but shall be commended: for he shall be
   esteemed an altar to God, and be honoured by God, because of his
   zealous and constant prayers for those that give to him; not receiving
   idly, but to the uttermost of his power recompensing what is given him
   by his prayer. Such a one therefore shall be blessed by God in eternal
   life. But he that hath, and receives in hypocrisy or through idleness,
   instead of working and assisting others, shall be obnoxious to
   punishment before God, because he has snatched away the morsel of the
   needy. [2935]

      Of the Love of Money.

   IV. For he that has money and does not bestow it upon others, nor use
   it himself, is like the serpent, which they say sleeps over the
   treasures; and of him is that scripture true which says, "He has
   gathered riches of which he shall not taste;" [2936] and they will be
   of no use to him when he perishes justly. For it says, "Riches will not
   profit in the day of wrath." For such a one has not believed in God,
   but in his own gold; esteeming that his God, and trusting therein. Such
   a one is a dissembler of the truth, an accepter of persons, unfaithful,
   cheating, fearful, unmanly, light, of no value, a complainer, ever in
   pain, his own enemy, and nobody's friend. Such a one's money shall
   perish, and a man that is a stranger shall consume it, either by theft
   while he is alive, or by inheritance when he is dead. "For riches
   unjustly gotten shall be vomited up." [2937]

      With What Fear Men Ought to Partake of the Lord's Oblations.

   V. We exhort, therefore, the widows and orphans to partake of those
   things that are bestowed upon them with all fear, and all pious
   reverence, and to return thanks to God who gives food to the needy, and
   to lift up their eyes to Him. For, says He, "Which of you shall eat, or
   who shall drink without Him? For He openeth His hand, and filleth every
   living thing with His kindness: giving wheat to the young men, and wine
   to the maidens, and oil for the joy of the living, grass for the
   cattle, and green herb for the service of men, flesh for the wild
   beasts, seeds for the birds, and suitable food for all creatures."
   [2938] Wherefore the Lord says: [2939] "Consider the fowls of heaven,
   [2940] that they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns,
   and your Father feedeth them. Are not ye much better than they? Be not
   therefore solicitous, saying, What shall we eat? or what shall we
   drink? For your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things."
   [2941] Since ye therefore enjoy such a providential care from Him, and
   are partakers of the good things that are derived from Him, you ought
   to return praise to Him that receives the orphan and the widow, to
   Almighty God, through His beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord; through
   whom [2942] glory be to God in spirit and truth for ever. Amen.

      Whose Oblations are to Be Received, and Whose Not to Be Received.

   VI. Now the bishop ought to know whose oblations he ought to receive,
   and whose he ought not. For he is to avoid corrupt dealers, and not
   receive their gifts. "For, a corrupt dealer shall not be justified from
   sin." [2943] For of them it was that Isaiah reproached Israel, and
   said, "Thy corrupt dealers mingle wine with water." [2944] He is also
   to avoid fornicators, for "thou shall not offer the hire of an harlot
   to the Lord." [2945] He is also to avoid extortioners, and such as
   covet other men's goods, and adulterers; for the sacrifices of such as
   these are abominable with God. Also those that oppress the widow and
   overbear the orphan, and fill prisons with the innocent, and abuse
   their own servants wickedly, I mean with stripes, and hunger, and hard
   service, nay, destroy whole cities; do thou, O bishop, avoid such as
   these, and their odious oblations. Thou shalt also refuse rogues, and
   such pleaders that plead on the side of injustice, and idol-makers, and
   thieves, and unjust publicans, and those that deceive by false balances
   and deceitful measures, and a soldier who is a false accuser and not
   content with his wages, but does violence to the needy, a murderer, a
   cut-throat, and an unjust judge, a subverter of causes, him that lies
   in wait for men, a worker of abominable wickedness, a drunkard, a
   blasphemer, a sodomite, an usurer, and every one that is wicked and
   opposes the will of God. For the Scripture says that all such as these
   are abominable with God. For those that receive from such persons, and
   thereby support the widows and orphans, shall be obnoxious to the
   judgment-seat of God; as Adonias the prophet, in the book of Kings,
   when he disobeyed God, and both "eat bread and drank water in the place
   which the Lord had forbid him," [2946] because of the impiety of
   Jeroboam, was slain by a lion. For the bread which is distributed to
   the widows from labour is better, though it be short and little, than
   that from injustice and false accusation, though it be much and fine.
   For the Scripture says: "Better is a little to the righteous, than much
   riches of the sinners." [2947] Now, although a widow, who eats and is
   filled from the impious, pray for them, she shall not be heard. For
   God, who knows the heart, with judgment has declared concerning the
   impious, saying, "If Moses and Samuel stand before my face in their
   behalf, I will not hear them;" [2948] and, "Pray thou not for this
   people, and do not ask mercy for them, and do not intercede with me for
   them, for I will not hear thee." [2949]

      That the Oblations of the Unworthy, While They are Such, Do Not Only Not
      Propitiate God, But on the Contrary Provoke Him to Indignation.

   VII. And not these only, but those that are in sin and have not
   repented, will not only not be heard when they pray, but will provoke
   God to anger, as putting Him in mind of their own wickedness. Avoid
   therefore such ministrations, as you would the price of a dog and the
   hire of an harlot; for both of them are forbidden by the laws. For
   neither did Elisha receive the presents which were brought by Hazael,
   [2950] nor Ahijah those from Jeroboam; [2951] but if the prophets of
   God did not admit of presents from the impious, it is reasonable, O
   bishops, that neither should you. Nay, when Simon the magician offered
   money to me Peter and John, [2952] and tried to obtain the invaluable
   grace by purchase, we did not admit it, but bound him with everlasting
   maledictions, because he thought to possess the gift of God, not by a
   pious mind towards God, but by the price of money. Avoid therefore such
   oblations to God's altar as are not from a good conscience. For says
   He: "Abstain from all injustice, and thou shalt not fear, and trembling
   shall not come nigh thee." [2953]

      That It is Better to Afford, Though It Be Inconsiderable and Few,
      Contributions to the Widows from Our Own Labours, Than Those Which are
      Many and Large Received from the Ungodly; For It is Better to Perish by
      Famine Than to Receive an Oblation from the Ungodly.

   VIII. But if ye say that those who give alms are such as these, and if
   we do not receive from them, whence shall we administer to the widows?
   And whence shall the poor among the people be maintained? Ye shall hear
   from us, that therefore have ye received the gift of the Levites, the
   oblations of your people, that ye might have enough for yourselves, and
   for those that are in want; and that ye might not be so straitened as
   to receive from the wicked. But if the churches be so straitened, it is
   better to perish than to receive anything from the enemies of God, to
   the reproach and abuse of His friends. For of such as these the prophet
   speaks: "Let not the oil of a sinner moisten my head." [2954] Do ye
   therefore examine such persons, and receive from such as walk holily,
   and supply the afflicted. But receive not from those that are
   excommunicated, until they are thought worthy to become the members of
   the Church. But if a gift be wanting, inform the brethren, and make a
   collection from them, and thence minister to the orphans and widows in
   righteousness.

      That the People Ought to Be Exhorted by the Priest to Do Good to the
      Needy, as Says Solomon the Wise.

   IX. Say unto the people under thee what Solomon the wise says: "Honour
   the Lord out of thy just labours, and pay thy first-fruits to Him out
   of thy fruits of righteousness, that thy garners may be filled with
   fulness of wheat, and thy presses may burst out with wine." [2955]
   Therefore maintain and clothe those that are in want from the righteous
   labour of the faithful. And such sums of money as are collected from
   them in the manner aforesaid, appoint to be laid out in the redemption
   of the saints, the deliverance of slaves, and of captives, and of
   prisoners, and of those that have been abused, and of those that have
   been condemned by tyrants to single combat and death on account of the
   name of Christ. For the Scripture says: "Deliver those that are led to
   death, and redeem those that are ready to be slain, do not spare."
   [2956]

      A Constitution, that If Any One of the Ungodly by Force Will Cast Money to
      the Priests, They Spend It in Wood and Coals, But Not in Food.

   X. But if at any time you be forced unwillingly to receive money from
   any ungodly person, lay it out in wood and coals, that so neither the
   widow nor the orphan may receive any of it, or be forced to buy with it
   either meat or drink, which it is unfit to do. For it is reasonable
   that such gifts of the ungodly should be fuel for the fire, and not
   food for the pious. And this method is plainly appointed by the law,
   [2957] when it calls a sacrifice kept too long a thing not fit to be
   eaten, and commands it to be consumed with fire. For such oblations are
   not evil in their nature, but on account of the mind of those that
   bring them. And this we ordain, that we may not reject those that come
   to us, as knowing that the common conversation of the pious has often
   been very profitable to the ungodly, but religious communion with them
   is alone hurtful. And so much, beloved, shall suffice to have spoken to
   you in order to your security.

    Sec. II.--On Domestic and Social Life.

      Of Parents and Children.

   XI. Ye fathers, educate your children in the Lord, bringing them up in
   the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and teach them such trades as
   are agreeable and suitable to the word, lest they by such opportunity
   become extravagant, and continue without punishment from their parents,
   and so get relaxation before their time, and go astray from that which
   is good. Wherefore be not afraid to reprove them, and to teach them
   wisdom with severity. For your corrections will not kill them, but
   rather preserve them. As Solomon says somewhere in the book of Wisdom:
   "Chasten thy son, and he will refresh thee; so wilt thou have good hope
   of him. Thou verily shalt smite him with the rod, and shall deliver his
   soul from death." [2958] And again, says the same Solomon thus, "He
   that spareth his rod, hateth his son;" [2959] and afterwards, "Beat his
   sides whilst he is an infant, lest he be hardened and disobey thee."
   [2960] He, therefore, that neglects to admonish and instruct his own
   son, hates his own child. Do you therefore teach your children the word
   of the Lord. Bring them under with cutting stripes, and make them
   subject from their infancy, teaching them the Holy Scriptures, which
   are Christian and divine, and delivering to them every sacred writing,
   "not giving them such liberty that they get the mastery," [2961] and
   act against your opinion, not permitting them to club together for a
   treat with their equals. For so they will be turned to disorderly
   courses, and will fall into fornication; and if this happen by the
   carelessness of their parents, those that begat them will be guilty of
   their souls. For if the offending children get into the company of
   debauched persons by the negligence of those that begat them, they will
   not be punished alone by themselves; but their parents also will be
   condemned on their account. For this cause endeavour, at the time when
   they are of an age fit for marriage, to join them in wedlock, and
   settle them together, lest in the heat and fervour of their age their
   course of life become dissolute, and you be required to give an account
   by the Lord God in the day of judgment.

      Of Servants and Masters.

   XII. But as to servants, what can we say more than that the slave bring
   a good will to his master, with the fear of God, although he be impious
   and wicked, [2962] but yet not to yield any compliance as to his
   worship? And let the master love his servant, although he be his
   superior. Let him consider wherein they are equal, even as he is a man.
   And let him that has a believing master [2963] love him both as his
   master, and as of the same faith, and as a father, but still with the
   preservation of his authority as his master: "not as an eye-servant,
   but as a lover of his master; as knowing that God will recompense to
   him for his subjection." [2964] In like manner, let a master who has a
   believing servant love him as a son or as a brother, on account of
   their communion in the faith, but still preserving the difference of a
   servant.

      In What Things We Ought to Be Subject to the Rulers of This World.

   XIII. Be ye subject to all royal power and dominion in things which are
   pleasing to God, as to the ministers of God, and the punishers of the
   ungodly. [2965] Render all the fear that is due to them, all offerings,
   all customs, all honour, gifts, and taxes. [2966] For this is God's
   command, that you owe nothing to any one but the pledge of love, which
   God has commanded by Christ. [2967]

      Of Virgins.

   XIV. Concerning virginity we have received no commandment; [2968] but
   we leave it to the power of those that are willing, as a vow: exhorting
   them so far in this matter that they do not promise anything rashly;
   since Solomon says, "It is better not to vow, than to vow and not pay."
   [2969] Let such a virgin, therefore, be holy in body and soul, as the
   temple of God, [2970] as the house of Christ, as the habitation of the
   Holy Spirit. For she that vows ought to do such works as are suitable
   to her vow; and to show that her vow is real, and made on account of
   leisure for piety, not to cast a reproach on marriage. Let her not be a
   gadder abroad, nor one that rambles about unseasonably; not
   double-minded, but grave, continent, sober, pure, avoiding the
   conversation of many, and especially of those that are of ill
   reputation. [2971]

constitutions of the holy apostles

  Book V.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Sec. I.--Concerning the Martyrs.

      That It is Reasonable for the Faithful to Supply the Wants of Those Who
      are Afflicted for the Sake of Christ by the Unbelievers, According to the
      Constitution of the Lord.

   I. If any Christian, on account of the name of Christ, and love and
   faith towards God, be condemned by the ungodly to the games, to the
   beasts, or to the mines, do not ye overlook him; but send to him from
   your labour and your very sweat for his sustenance, and for a reward to
   the soldiers, that he may be eased and be taken care of; that, as far
   as lies in your power, your blessed brother may not be afflicted: for
   he that is condemned for the name of the Lord God is an holy martyr, a
   brother of the Lord, the son of the Highest, a receptacle of the Holy
   Spirit, by whom every one of the faithful has received the illumination
   of the glory of the holy Gospel, by being vouchsafed the incorruptible
   crown, and the testimony of Christ's sufferings, and the fellowship of
   His blood, to be made conformable to the death of Christ for the
   adoption of children. For this cause do you, all ye of the faithful, by
   your bishop, minister to the saints of your substance and of your
   labour. But if any one has not, let him fast a day, and set apart that,
   and order it for the saints. But if any one has superfluities, let him
   minister more to them according to the proportion of his ability. But
   if he can possibly sell all his livelihood, and redeem them out of
   prison, he will be blessed, and a friend of Christ. For if he that
   gives his goods to the poor be perfect, supposing his knowledge of
   divine things, much more is he so that does it on account of the
   martyrs. For such a one is worthy of God, and will fulfil His will by
   supplying those who have confessed Him before nations and kings, and
   the children of Israel; concerning whom our Lord declared, saying:
   "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before
   my Father." [2972] And if these be such as to be attested to by Christ
   before His Father, you ought not to be ashamed to go to them in the
   prisons. For if you do this, it will be esteemed to you for a
   testimony, because the real trial was to them a testimony; and your
   readiness will be so to you, as being partakers of their combat: for
   the Lord speaks somewhere to such as these, saying: "Come, ye blessed
   of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
   of the world. For I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty,
   and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and
   ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye
   came unto me. Then shall the righteous answer, and say, Lord, when saw
   we Thee an hungered, and fed Thee? or thirsty, and gave Thee drink?
   When saw we Thee naked, and clothed Thee? or sick, and visited Thee?
   When saw we Thee a stranger, and took Thee in? or in prison, and came
   unto Thee? And He will answer and say unto them, Inasmuch as ye have
   done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it
   unto me. And these shall go away into life everlasting. Then shall He
   say unto them on His left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
   everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was
   hungry, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
   I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not;
   sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they also answer
   and say, Lord when saw we Thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or
   naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto Thee? Then
   shall He answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as
   ye have not done it unto one of the least of these, neither have ye
   done it unto me. And these shall go away unto everlasting punishment."
   [2973]

      That We are to Avoid Intercourse with False Brethren When They Continue in
      Their Wickedness.

   II. But if any one who calls himself a brother is seduced by the evil
   one, and acts wickedness, and is convicted and condemned to death as an
   adulterer, or a murderer, depart from him, that ye may be secure, and
   none of you may be suspected as a partner in such an abominable
   practice; and that no evil report may be spread abroad, as if all
   Christians took a pleasure in unlawful actions. Wherefore keep far from
   them. But do you assist with all diligence those that for the sake of
   Christ are abused by the ungodly and shut up in prison, or who are
   given over to death, or bonds, or banishment, in order to deliver your
   fellow-members from wicked hands. And if any one who accompanies with
   them is caught, and falls into misfortune, he is blessed, because he is
   partaker with the martyr, and is one that imitates the sufferings of
   Christ; for we ourselves also, when we oftentimes received stripes from
   Caiaphas, and Alexander, and Annas, for Christ's sake, "went out
   rejoicing that we were counted worthy to suffer such things for our
   Saviour." [2974] Do you also rejoice when ye suffer such things, for ye
   shall be blessed in that day. [2975]

      That We Ought to Afford an Helping Hand to Such as are Spoiled for the
      Sake of Christ, Although We Should Incur Danger Ourselves.

   III. Receive also those that are persecuted on account of the faith,
   and who "fly from city to city" [2976] on account of the Lord's
   commandment; and assist them as martyrs, rejoicing that ye are made
   partakers of their persecution, as knowing that they are esteemed
   blessed by the Lord; for Himself says: "Blessed are ye when men shall
   reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you
   falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, because your
   reward is great in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which
   were before us." [2977] And again: "If they have persecuted me, they
   will also persecute you." [2978] And afterwards: "If they persecute you
   in this city, flee ye to another. For in the world ye have tribulation:
   for they shall deliver you into the synagogues; and ye shall be brought
   before rulers and kings for my sake, and for a testimony to them."
   [2979] And, "He that endureth unto the end, the same shall be saved."
   [2980] For he that is persecuted for the sake of the faith, and bears
   witness in regard to Him, Christ, and endures, is truly a man of God.

      That It is an Horrible and Destructive Thing to Deny Christ.

   IV. But he that denies himself to be a Christian, that he may not be
   hated of men, and so loves his own life more than he does the Lord, in
   whose hand his breath is, is wretched and miserable, as being
   detestable and abominable, who desires to be the friend of men, but is
   the enemy of God, having no longer his portion with the saints, but
   with those that are accursed; choosing instead of the kingdom of the
   blessed, that eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his
   angels: not being any longer hated by men, but rejected by God, and
   cast out from His presence. For of such a one our Lord declared,
   saying: "Whosoever shall deny me before men, and shall be ashamed of my
   name, I also will deny and be ashamed of him before my Father which is
   in heaven." [2981] And again He speaks thus to us ourselves, His
   disciples: "He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy
   of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy
   of me; and he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not
   worthy of me. He that findeth his life, shall lose it; and he that
   loseth his life for my sake, shall find it. For what is a man profited,
   if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall
   a man give in exchange for his soul?" [2982] And afterwards: "Fear not
   them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather
   fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." [2983]

      That We Ought to Imitate Christ in Suffering, and with Zeal to Follow His
      Patience.

   V. Every one therefore who learns any art, when he sees his master by
   his diligence and skill perfecting his art, does himself earnestly
   endeavour to make what he takes in hand like to it. If he is not able,
   he is not perfected in his work. We therefore who have a Master, our
   Lord Jesus Christ, why do we not follow His doctrine?--since He
   renounced repose, pleasure, glory, riches, pride, the power of revenge,
   His mother and brethren, nay, and moreover His own life, on account of
   His piety towards His Father, and His love to us the race of mankind;
   and suffered not only persecution and stripes, reproach and mockery,
   but also crucifixion, that He might save the penitent, both Jews and
   Gentiles. If therefore He for our sakes renounced His repose, was not
   ashamed of the cross, and did not esteem death inglorious, why do not
   we imitate His sufferings, and renounce on His account even our own
   life, with that patience which He gives us? For He did all for our
   sakes, but we do it for our own sakes: for He does not stand in need of
   us, but we stand in need of His mercy. He only requires the sincerity
   and readiness of our faith, as the Scripture says: "If thou beest
   righteous, what doest thou give to Him? or what will He receive at thy
   hand? Thy wickedness is to a man like thyself, and thy righteousness to
   a son of man." [2984]

      That a Believer Ought Neither Rashly to Run into Danger Through Security,
      Nor to Be Over-Timorous Through Pusillanimity, But to Fly Away for Fear;
      Yet that If He Does Fall into the Enemy's Hand, to Strive Earnestly, Upon
      Account of the Crown that is Laid Up for Him.

   VI. Let us therefore renounce our parents, and kinsmen, and friends,
   and wife, and children, and possessions, and all the enjoyments of
   life, when any of these things become an impediment to piety. For we
   ought to pray that we may not enter into temptation; but if we be
   called to martyrdom, with constancy to confess His precious name, and
   if on this account we be punished, let us rejoice, as hastening to
   immortality. When we are persecuted, let us not think it strange; let
   us not love the present world, nor the praises which come from men, nor
   the glory and honour of rulers, according as some of the Jews wondered
   at the mighty works of our Lord, yet did not believe on Him, for fear
   of the high priests and the rest of the rulers: "For they loved the
   praise of men more than the praise of God." [2985] But now, by
   confessing a good confession, we not only save ourselves, but we
   confirm those who are newly illuminated, and strengthen the faith of
   the catechumens. But if we remit any part of our confession, and deny
   godliness by the faintness of our persuasion, and the fear of a very
   short punishment, we not only deprive ourselves of everlasting glory,
   but we shall also become the causes of the perdition of others; and
   shall suffer double punishment, as affording suspicion, by our denial
   that that truth which we gloried in so much before is an erroneous
   doctrine. Wherefore neither let us be rash and hasty to thrust
   ourselves into dangers, for the Lord says: "Pray that ye fall not into
   temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
   [2986] Nor let us, when we do fall into dangers, be fearful or ashamed
   of our profession. For if a person, by the denial of his own hope,
   which is Jesus the Son of God, should be delivered from a temporary
   death, and the next day should fall dangerously sick upon his bed, with
   a distemper in his bowels, his stomach, or his head, or any of the
   incurable diseases, as a consumption, or gangrene, or looseness, or
   iliac passion, or dropsy, or colic, and has a sudden catastrophe, and
   departs this life; is not he deprived of the things present, and loses
   those eternal? Or rather, he is within the verge of eternal punishment,
   "and goes into outer darkness, where is weeping and gnashing of teeth."
   [2987] But let him who is vouchsafed the honour of martyrdom rejoice
   with joy in the Lord, as obtaining thereby so great a crown, and
   departing out of this life by his confession. Nay, though he be but a
   catechumen, let him depart without trouble; for his suffering for
   Christ will be to him a more genuine baptism, because he does really
   die with Christ, but the rest only in a figure. Let him therefore
   rejoice in the imitation of his Master, since is it thus ordained: "Let
   every one be perfect, as his Master is." [2988] Now his and our Master,
   Jesus the Lord, was smitten for our sake: He underwent reproaches and
   revilings with long-suffering. He was spit upon, He was smitten on the
   face, He was buffeted; and when He had been scourged, He was nailed to
   the cross. He had vinegar and gall to drink; and when He had fulfilled
   all things that were written, He said to His God and Father, "Into Thy
   hands I commend my spirit." [2989] Wherefore let him that desires to be
   His disciple earnestly follow His conflicts: let him imitate His
   patience, knowing that, although he be burned in the fire by men, he
   will suffer nothing, like the three children; [2990] or if he does
   suffer anything, he shall receive a reward from the Lord, believing in
   the one and the only true God and Father, through Jesus Christ, the
   great High Priest, and Redeemer of our souls, and rewarder of our
   sufferings. To whom be glory for ever. Amen.

      Several Demonstrations Concerning the Resurrection, Concerning the Sibyl,
      and What the Stoics Say Concerning the Bird Called the Phoenix.

   VII. For the Almighty God Himself will raise us up through our Lord
   Jesus Christ, according to His infallible promise, and grant us a
   resurrection with all those that have slept from the beginning of the
   world; and we shall then be such as we now are in our present form,
   without any defect or corruption. For we shall rise incorruptible:
   whether we die at sea, or are scattered on the earth, or are torn to
   pieces by wild beasts and birds, He will raise us by His own power; for
   the whole world is held together by the hand of God. Now He says: "An
   hair of your head shall not perish." [2991] Wherefore He exhorts us,
   saying: "In your patience possess ye your souls." [2992] But as
   concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the recompense of reward
   for the martyrs, Gabriel speaks to Daniel: "And many of them that sleep
   shall arise out of the dust of the earth, some to everlasting life, and
   some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they that understand shall
   shine as the sun, and as the firmament, and as the stars." [2993]
   Therefore the most holy Gabriel foretold that the saints should shine
   like the stars: for His sacred name did witness to them, that they
   might understand the truth. Nor is a resurrection only declared for the
   martyrs, but for all men, righteous and unrighteous, godly and ungodly,
   that every one may receive according to his desert. For God, says the
   Scripture, "will bring every work into judgment, with every secret
   thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil." [2994] This
   resurrection was not believed by the Jews, when of old they said, "Our
   bones are withered, and we are gone." [2995] To whom God answered, and
   said: "Behold, I open your graves, and will bring you out of them; and
   I will put my Spirit into you, and ye shall live: and ye shall know
   that I the Lord have spoken it, and will do it." And He says by Isaiah:
   "The dead shall rise, and those that are in the graves shall be raised
   up. And those that rest in the earth shall rejoice, for the dew which
   is from Thee shall be healing to them." [2996] There are indeed many
   and various things said concerning the resurrection, and concerning the
   continuance of the righteous in glory, and concerning the punishment of
   the ungodly, their fall, rejection, condemnation, shame, "eternal fire,
   and endless worm." [2997] Now that, if it had pleased Him that all men
   should be immortal, it was in His power, He showed in the examples of
   Enoch and Elijah, while He did not suffer them to have any experience
   of death. Or if it had pleased Him in every generation to raise those
   that died, that this also He was able to do He hath made manifest both
   by Himself and by others; as when He raised the widow's son [2998] by
   Elijah, and the Shunammite's son [2999] by Elisha. But we are persuaded
   that death is not a retribution of punishment, because even the saints
   have undergone it; nay, even the Lord of the saints, Jesus Christ, the
   life of them that believe, and the resurrection of the dead. Upon this
   account, therefore, according to the ancient practice, for those who
   live in the great city, after the combats He brings a dissolution for a
   while, that, when He raises up every one, He may either reject him or
   crown him. For He that made the body of Adam out of the earth will
   raise up the bodies of the rest, and that of the first man, after their
   dissolution, (to pay what is owing to the rational nature of man; we
   mean the continuance in being through all ages. He, therefore, who
   brings on the dissolution, will Himself procure the resurrection. And
   He that said, "The Lord took dust from the ground, and formed man, and
   breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living
   soul," [3000] added after the disobedience, "Earth thou art, and unto
   earth shalt thou return;" [3001] the same promised us a resurrection
   afterwards. [3002] ) For says He: "All that are in the graves shall
   hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live."
   [3003] Besides these arguments, we believe there is to be a
   resurrection also from the resurrection of our Lord. For it is He that
   raised Lazarus, when he had been in the grave four days, [3004] and
   Jairus' daughter, [3005] and the widow's son. [3006] It is He that
   raised Himself by the command of the Father in the space of three days,
   who is the pledge of our resurrection. For says He: "I am the
   resurrection and the life." [3007] Now He that brought Jonas [3008] in
   the space of three days, alive and unhurt, out of the belly of the
   whale, and the three children out of the furnace of Babylon, and Daniel
   out of the mouth of the lions, [3009] does not want power to raise us
   up also. But if the Gentiles laugh at us, and disbelieve our
   Scriptures, let at least their own prophetess Sibylla [3010] oblige
   them to believe, who says thus to them in express words:--


   "But when all things shall be reduced to dust and ashes,

   And the immortal God who kindled the fire shall have quenched it,

   God shall form those bones and that ashes into a man again,

   And shall place mortal men again as they were before.

   And then shall be the judgment, wherein God will do justice,

   And judge the world again. But as many mortals as have sinned through
   impiety

   Shall again be covered under the earth;

   But so many as have been pious shall live again in the world.

   When God puts His Spirit into them, and gives those at once that are
   godly both life and favour,

   Then shall all see themselves." [3011]

   If, therefore, this prophetess confesses the resurrection, and does not
   deny the restoration of all things, and distinguishes the godly from
   the ungodly, it is in vain for them to deny our doctrine. Nay, indeed,
   they say they can show a resemblance of the resurrection, while they do
   not themselves believe the things they declare: for they say that there
   is a bird single in its kind which affords a copious demonstration of
   the resurrection, which they say is without a mate, and the only one in
   the creation. They call it a phoenix, and relate that every five
   hundred years it comes into Egypt, to that which is called the altar of
   the sun, and brings with it a great quantity of cinnamon, and cassia,
   and balsam-wood, and standing towards the east, as they say, and
   praying to the sun, of its own accord is burnt, and becomes dust; but
   that a worm arises again out of those ashes, and that when the same is
   warmed it is formed into a new-born phoenix; and when it is able to
   fly, it goes to Arabia, which is beyond the Egyptian countries. If,
   therefore, as even themselves say, a resurrection is exhibited by the
   means of an irrational bird, wherefore do they vainly disparage our
   accounts, when we profess that He who by His power brings that into
   being which was not in being before, is able to restore this body, and
   raise it up again after its dissolution? For on account of this full
   assurance of hope we undergo stripes, and persecutions, and deaths.
   Otherwise we should to no purpose undergo such things if we had not a
   full assurance of these promises, whereof we profess ourselves to be
   the preachers. As, therefore, we believe Moses when he says, "In the
   beginning God made the heaven and the earth;" [3012] and we know that
   He did not want matter, but by His will alone brought those things into
   being which Christ was commanded to make; we mean the heaven, the
   earth, the sea, the light, the night, the day, the luminaries, the
   stars, the fowls, the fishes, and four-footed beasts, the creeping
   things, the plants, and the herbs; so also will He raise all men up by
   His will, as not wanting any assistance. For it is the work of the same
   power to create the world and to raise the dead. And then He made man,
   who was not a man before, of different parts, giving to him a soul made
   out of nothing. But now He will restore the bodies, which have been
   dissolved, to the souls that are still in being: for the rising again
   belongs to things laid down, not to things which have no being. He
   therefore that made the original bodies out of nothing, and fashioned
   various forms of them, will also again revive and raise up those that
   are dead. For He that formed man in the womb out of a little seed, and
   created in him a soul which was not in being before,--as He Himself
   somewhere speaks to Jeremiah, "Before I formed thee in the womb I knew
   thee;" [3013] and elsewhere, "I am the Lord who established the heaven,
   and laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the spirit of man in
   him," [3014] --will also raise up all men, as being His workmanship; as
   also the divine Scripture testifies that God said to Christ, His
   only-begotten, "Let us make man after our image, and after our
   likeness. And God made man: after the image of God made He him; male
   and female made He them." [3015] And the most divine and patient Job,
   of whom the Scripture says that it is written, that "he was to rise
   again with those whom the Lord raises up," [3016] speaks to God thus:
   "Hast not Thou milked me like milk, and curdled me like cheese? Thou
   hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and
   sinews. Thou hast granted me life and favour, and Thy visitation hath
   preserved my spirit. Having these things within me, I know that Thou
   canst do all things, and that nothing is impossible with Thee." [3017]
   Wherefore also [3018] our Saviour and Master Jesus Christ says, that
   "what is impossible with men is possible with God." [3019] And David,
   the beloved of God, says: "Thine hands have made me, and fashioned me."
   [3020] And again: "Thou knowest my frame." [3021] And afterward: "Thou
   hast fashioned me, and laid Thine hand upon me. The knowledge of Thee
   is declared to be too wonderful for me; it is very great, I cannot
   attain unto it." [3022] "Thine eyes did see my substance, being yet
   imperfect; and all men shall be written in Thy book." [3023] Nay, and
   Isaiah says in his prayer to Him: "We are the clay, and Thou art the
   framer of us." [3024] If, therefore, man be His workmanship, made by
   Christ, by Him most certainly will he after he is dead be raised again,
   with intention either of being crowned for his good actions or punished
   for his transgressions. But if He, being the legislator, judges with
   righteousness; as He punishes the ungodly, so does He do good to and
   saves the faithful. And those saints who for His sake have been slain
   by men, "some of them He will make light as the stars, and make others
   bright as the luminaries," [3025] as Gabriel said to Daniel. All we of
   the faithful, therefore, who are the disciples of Christ, believe His
   promises. For He that has promised it cannot lie; as says the blessed
   prophet David: "The Lord is faithful in all His words, and holy in all
   His works." [3026] For He that framed for Himself a body out of a
   virgin, is also the Former of other men. And He that raised Himself
   from the dead, will also raise again all that are laid down. He who
   raises wheat out of the ground with many stalks from one grain, He who
   makes the tree that is cut down send forth fresh branches, He that made
   Aaron's dry rod put forth buds, [3027] will raise us up in glory; He
   that raised Him up that had the palsy whole, [3028] and healed him that
   had the withered hand, [3029] He that supplied a defective part to him
   that was born blind from clay and spittle, [3030] will raise us up; He
   that satisfied five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, and
   caused a remainder of twelve baskets, [3031] and out of water made
   wine, [3032] and sent a piece of money out of a fish's mouth [3033] by
   me Peter to those that demanded tribute, will raise the dead. For we
   testify all these things concerning Him, and the prophets testify the
   other. We who have eaten and drunk with Him, and have been spectators
   of His wonderful works, and of His life, and of His conduct, and of His
   words, and of His sufferings, and of His death, and of His resurrection
   from the dead, and who associated with Him forty days after His
   resurrection, [3034] and who received a command from Him to preach the
   Gospel to all the world, and to make disciples of all nations, [3035]
   and to baptize them into His death by the authority of the God of the
   universe, who is His Father, and by the testimony of the Spirit, who is
   His Comforter,--we teach you all these things which He appointed us by
   His constitutions, before "He was received up in our sight into
   heaven," [3036] to Him that sent Him. And if you will believe, you
   shall be happy; but if you will not believe, we shall be found
   innocent, and clear from your incredulity.

      Concerning James the Brother of the Lord, and Stephen the First Martyr.

   VIII. Now concerning the martyrs, we say to you that they are to be had
   in all honour with you, as we honour the blessed James the bishop, and
   the holy Stephen our fellow-servant. For these are reckoned blessed by
   God, and are honoured by holy men, who were pure from all
   transgressions, immoveable when tempted to sin, or persuaded from good
   works, without dispute deserving encomiums: of whom also David speaks,
   "Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His holy ones;"
   [3037] and Solomon says, "The memory of the just is with encomiums:"
   [3038] of whom also the prophet speaks, "Righteous men are taken away."
   [3039]

      Concerning False Martyrs.

   IX. These things we have said concerning those that in truth have been
   martyrs for Christ, but not concerning false martyrs, concerning whom
   the oracle speaks, "The name of the ungodly is extinguished." [3040]
   For "a faithful witness will not lie, but an unjust witness inflames
   lies." [3041] For he that departs this life in his testimony without
   lying, for the sake of the truth, is a faithful martyr, worthy to be
   believed in such things wherein he strove for the word of piety by his
   own blood.

    Sec. II.--All Association with Idols is to Be Avoided.

      A Moral Admonition, that We are to Abstain from Vain Talking, Obscene
      Talking, Jesting, Drunkenness, Lasciviousness, and Luxury.

   X. Now we exhort you, brethren and fellow-servants, to avoid vain talk
   and obscene discourses, and jestings, drunkenness, lasciviousness,
   luxury, unbounded passions, with foolish discourses, since we do not
   permit you so much as on the Lord's days, which are days of joy, to
   speak or act anything unseemly; for the Scripture somewhere says:
   "Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice unto Him with trembling." [3042]
   Even your very rejoicings therefore ought to be done with fear and
   trembling: for a Christian who is faithful ought neither to repeat an
   heathen hymn nor an obscene song, because he will be obliged by that
   hymn to make mention of the idolatrous names of demons; and instead of
   the Holy Spirit, the wicked one will enter into him.

      An Admonition Instructing Men to Avoid the Abominable Sin of Idolatry.

   XI. You are also forbidden to swear by them, or to utter their
   abominable names through your mouth, and to worship them, or fear them
   as gods; for they are not gods, but either wicked demons or the
   ridiculous contrivances of men. For somewhere God says concerning the
   Israelites: "They have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no
   gods." [3043] And afterwards: "I will take away the names of your idols
   out of their mouth." [3044] And elsewhere: "They have provoked me to
   jealousy with them that are no gods; they have provoked me to anger
   with their idols." [3045] And in all the Scriptures these things are
   forbidden by the Lord God.

      That We Ought Not to Sing an Heathen or an Obscene Song, Nor to Swear by
      an Idol; Because It is an Impious Thing, and Contrary to the Knowledge of
      God.

   XII. Nor do the legislators give us only prohibitions concerning idols,
   but also warn us concerning the luminaries, not to swear by them, nor
   to serve them. For they say: "Lest, when thou seest the sun, and the
   moon, and the stars, thou shouldest be seduced to worship them." [3046]
   And elsewhere: "Do not ye learn to walk after the ways of the heathen,
   and be not afraid of the signs of heaven." [3047] For the stars and the
   luminaries were given to men to shine upon them, but not for worship;
   although the Israelites, by the perverseness of their temper,
   "worshipped the creature instead of the Creator," [3048] and acted
   insultingly to their Maker, and admired the creature more than is fit.
   And sometimes they made a calf, as in the wilderness; [3049] sometimes
   they worshipped Baalpeor; [3050] another time Baal, [3051] and Thamuz,
   [3052] and Astarte of Sidon; [3053] and again Moloch and Chamos; [3054]
   another time the sun, [3055] as it is written in Ezekiel; nay, and
   besides, brute creatures, as among the Egyptians Apis, and the
   Mendesian goat, and gods of silver and gold, as in Judea. On account of
   all which things He threatened them, and said by the prophet: "Is it a
   small thing to the house of Judah to do these abominations which they
   have done? For they have filled the land with their wickedness, to
   provoke me to anger: and, behold, they are as those that mock. And I
   will act with anger. Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have
   mercy; and they shall cry in mine ears with a great voice, and I will
   not hearken unto them." [3056] Consider, beloved, how many things the
   Lord declares against idolaters, and the worshippers of the sun and
   moon. Wherefore it is the duty of a man of God, as he is a Christian,
   not to swear by the sun, or by the moon, or by the stars; nor by the
   heaven, nor by the earth, by any of the elements, whether small or
   great. For if our Master charged us not to swear by the true God, that
   our word might be firmer than an oath, nor by heaven itself, for that
   is a piece of heathen wickedness, nor by Jerusalem, nor by the
   sanctuary of God, nor the altar, nor the gift, nor the gilding of the
   altar, nor one's own head, [3057] for this custom is a piece of Judaic
   corruption, and on that account was forbidden; and if He exhorts the
   faithful that their yea be yea, and their nay, nay, and says that "what
   is more than these is of the evil one," how much more blameable are
   those who appeal to deities falsely so called as the objects of an
   oath, and who glorify imaginary beings instead of those that are real,
   whom God for their perverseness "delivered over to foolishness, to do
   those things that are not convenient!" [3058]

    Sec. III.--On Feast Days and Fast Days.

      A Catalogue of the Feasts of the Lord Which are to Be Kept, and When Each
      of Them Ought to Be Observed.

   XIII. Brethren, observe the festival days; and first of all the
   birthday which you are to celebrate on the twenty-fifth of the ninth
   month; after which let the Epiphany be to you the most honoured, in
   which the Lord made to you a display of His own Godhead, and let it
   take place on the sixth of the tenth month; after which the fast of
   Lent is to be observed by you as containing a memorial of our Lord's
   mode of life and legislation. But let this solemnity be observed before
   the fast of the passover, beginning from the second day of the week,
   and ending at the day of the preparation. After which solemnities,
   breaking off your fast, begin the holy week of the passover, fasting in
   the same all of you with fear and trembling, praying in them for those
   that are about to perish.

      Concerning the Passion of Our Lord, and What Was Done on Each Day of His
      Sufferings; And Concerning Judas, and that Judas Was Not Present When the
      Lord Delivered the Mysteries to His Disciples.

   XIV. For they began to hold a council against the Lord on the second
   day of the week, in the first month, which is Xanthicus; and the
   deliberation continued on the third day of the week; but on the fourth
   day they determined to take away His life by crucifixion. And Judas
   knowing this, who for a long time had been perverted, but was then
   smitten by the devil himself with the love of money, although he had
   been long entrusted with the purse, [3059] and used to steal what was
   set apart for the needy, yet was he not cast off by the Lord, through
   much long-suffering; nay, and when we were once feasting with Him,
   being willing both to reduce him to his duty and instruct us in His own
   foreknowledge, He said: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of
   you will betray me;" and every one of us saying, "Is it I?" [3060] And
   the Lord being silent, I, who was one of the twelve, and more beloved
   by Him than the rest, arose up from lying in His bosom, and besought
   Him to tell who it should be that should betray Him. Yet neither then
   did our good Lord declare His name, but gave two signs of the betrayer:
   one by saying, "he that dippeth with me in the dish;" a second, "to
   whom I shall give the sop when I have dipped it." Nay, although he
   himself said, "Master, is it I?" the Lord did not say Yes, but, "Thou
   hast said." And being willing to affright him in the matter, He said:
   "Woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for
   him if he had never been born. Who, when he had heard that, went his
   way, and said to the priests, What will ye give me, and I will deliver
   Him unto you? And they bargained with him for thirty pieces of silver."
   [3061] And the scripture was fulfilled, which said, "And they took
   [3062] the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that was valued,
   whom they of the children of Israel did value, and gave them for the
   house of the potter." [3063] And on the fifth day of the week, when we
   had eaten the passover with Him, and when Judas had dipped his hand
   into the dish, and received the sop, and was gone out by night, the
   Lord said to us: "The hour is come that ye shall be dispersed, and
   shall leave me alone;" [3064] and every one vehemently affirming that
   they would not forsake Him, I Peter adding this promise, that I would
   even die with Him, He said, "Verily I say unto thee, Before the cock
   crows, thou shall thrice deny that thou knowest me." [3065] And when He
   had delivered to us the representative mysteries of His precious body
   and blood, Judas not being present with us, He went out to the Mount of
   Olives, near the brook Cedron, where there was a garden; [3066] and we
   were with Him, and sang an hymn according to the custom. [3067] And
   being separated not far [3068] from us, He prayed to His Father,
   saying: "Father, remove this cup away from me; yet not my will, but
   Thine be done." [3069] And when He had done this thrice, while we out
   of despondency of mind were fallen asleep, He came and said: "The hour
   is come, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. And
   behold Judas, and with him a multitude of ungodly men," [3070] to whom
   he shows the signal by which he was to betray Him--a deceitful kiss.
   But they, when they had received the signal agreed on, took hold of the
   Lord; and having bound Him, they led Him to the house of Caiaphas the
   high priest, wherein were assembled many, not the people, but a great
   rout, not an holy council, but an assembly of the wicked and council of
   the ungodly, who did many things against Him, and left no kind of
   injury untried, spitting upon Him, cavilling at Him, beating Him,
   smiting Him on the face, reviling Him, tempting Him, seeking vain
   divination instead of true prophecies from Him, calling Him a deceiver,
   a blasphemer, a transgressor of Moses, a destroyer of the temple, a
   taker away of sacrifices, an enemy to the Romans, an adversary to
   Cæsar. And these reproaches did these bulls and dogs [3071] in their
   madness cast upon Him, till it was very early in the morning, and then
   they lead Him away to Annas, who was father-in-law to Caiaphas; and
   when they had done the like things to Him there, it being the day of
   the preparation, they delivered Him to Pilate the Roman governor,
   accusing Him of many and great things, none of which they could prove.
   Whereupon the governor, as out of patience with them, said: "I find no
   cause against Him." [3072] But they bringing two lying witnesses,
   wished to accuse the Lord falsely; but they being found to disagree,
   and so their testimony not conspiring together, they altered the
   accusation to that of treason, saying, "This fellow says that He is a
   king, and forbids to give tribute to Cæsar." [3073] And themselves
   became accusers, and witnesses, and judges, and authors of the
   sentence, saying, "Crucify Him, crucify Him;" [3074] that it might be
   fulfilled which is written by the prophets concerning Him, "Unjust
   witnesses were gathered together against me, and injustice lied to
   itself;" [3075] and again, "Many dogs compassed me about, the assembly
   of the wicked laid siege against me;" [3076] and elsewhere, "My
   inheritance became to me as a lion in a wood, and has sent forth her
   voice against me." [3077] Pilate therefore, disgracing his authority by
   his pusillanimity, convicts himself of wickedness by regarding the
   multitude more than this just person, and bearing witness to Him that
   He was innocent, yet as guilty delivering Him up to the punishment of
   the cross, although the Romans had made laws that no man unconvicted
   should be put to death. But the executioners took the Lord of glory and
   nailed Him to the cross, crucifying Him indeed at the sixth hour, but
   having received the sentence of His condemnation at the third hour.
   After this they gave to Him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall. Then
   they divided His garments by lot. Then they crucified two malefactors
   with Him, on each side one, that it might be fulfilled which was
   written: "They gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirsty they gave me
   vinegar to drink." [3078] And again: "They divided my garment among
   themselves, and upon my vesture have they cast lots." [3079] And in
   another place: "And I was reckoned with the transgressors." [3080] Then
   there was darkness for three hours, from the sixth to the ninth, and
   again light in the evening; as it is written: "It shall not be day nor
   night, and at the evening there shall be light." [3081] All which
   things, [3082] when those malefactors saw that were crucified with Him,
   the one of them reproached Him as though He was weak and unable to
   deliver Himself; but the other rebuked the ignorance of his fellow and
   turning to the Lord, as being enlightened by Him, and acknowledging who
   He was that suffered, he prayed that He would remember him in His
   kingdom hereafter. [3083] He then presently granted him the forgiveness
   of his former sins, and brought him into paradise to enjoy the mystical
   good things; who also cried out about the ninth hour, and said to His
   Father: "My God! my God! why hast Thou forsaken me?" [3084] And a
   little afterward, when He had cried with a loud voice, "Father, forgive
   them, for they know not what they do," [3085] and had added, "Into Thy
   hands I commit my spirit," He gave up the ghost, [3086] and was buried
   before sunset in a new sepulchre. But when the first day of the week
   dawned He arose from the dead, and fulfilled those things which before
   His passion He foretold to us, saying: "The Son of man must continue in
   the heart of the earth three days and three nights." [3087] And when He
   was risen from the dead, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, and Mary
   the mother of James, then to Cleopas in the way, and after that to us
   His disciples, who had fled away for fear of the Jews, but privately
   were very inquisitive about Him. [3088] But these things are also
   written in the Gospel.

      Of the Great Week, and on What Account They Enjoin Us to Fast on Wednesday
      and Friday.

   XV. He therefore charged us Himself to fast these six days on account
   of the impiety and transgression of the Jews, commanding us withal to
   bewail over them, and lament for their perdition. For even He Himself
   "wept over them, because they knew not the time of their visitation."
   [3089] But He commanded us to fast on the fourth and sixth days of the
   week; the former on account of His being betrayed, and the latter on
   account of His passion. But He appointed us to break our fast on the
   seventh day at the cock-crowing, but to fast on the Sabbath-day. Not
   that the Sabbath-day is a day of fasting, being the rest from the
   creation, but because we ought to fast on this one Sabbath only, while
   on this day the Creator was under the earth. For on their very
   feast-day they apprehended the Lord, that oracle might be fulfilled
   which says: "They placed their signs in the middle of their feast, and
   knew them not." [3090] Ye ought therefore to bewail over them, because
   when the Lord came they did not believe on Him, but rejected His
   doctrine, judging themselves unworthy of salvation. You therefore are
   happy who once were not a people, but are now an holy nation, delivered
   from the deceit of idols, from ignorance, from impiety, who once had
   not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy through your hearty
   obedience: for to you, the converted Gentiles, is opened the gate of
   life, who formerly were not beloved, but are now beloved; a people
   ordained for the possession of God, to show forth His virtues,
   concerning whom our Saviour said, "I was found of them that sought me
   not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me. I said,
   Behold me, to a nation which did not call upon my name." [3091] For
   when ye did not seek after Him, then were ye sought for by Him; and you
   who have believed in Him have hearkened to His call, and have left the
   madness of polytheism, and have fled to the true monarchy, to Almighty
   God, through Christ Jesus, and are become the completion of the number
   of the saved--"ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
   thousands;" [3092] as it is written in David, "A thousand [3093] shall
   fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand;" [3094] and
   again, "The chariots of God are by tens of thousands, and thousands of
   the prosperous." [3095] But unto unbelieving Israel He says: "All the
   day long have I stretched out mine hands to a disobedient and
   gainsaying people, which go in a way that is not good, but after their
   own sins, a people provoking me before my face." [3096]

      An Enumeration of the Prophetical Predictions Which Declare Christ, Whose
      Completion Though the Jews Saw, Yet Out of the Evil Temper of Their Mind
      They Did Not Believe He Was the Christ of God, and Condemned the Lord of
      Glory to the Cross.

   XVI. See how the people provoked the Lord by not believing in Him!
   Therefore He says: "They provoked the Holy Spirit, and He was turned to
   be their enemy." [3097] For blindness is cast upon them, by reason of
   the wickedness of their mind, because when they saw Jesus they did not
   believe Him to be the Christ of God, who was before all ages [3098]
   begotten of Him, His only-begotten Son, God the Word, whom they did not
   own through their unbelief, neither on account of His mighty works, nor
   yet on account of the prophecies which were written concerning Him. For
   that He was to be born of a virgin, they read this prophecy: "Behold, a
   virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall
   call His name Emanuel." [3099] "For to us a Child is born, to us a Son
   is given, whose government is upon His shoulders; and His name is
   called the Angel of His Great Council, the Wonderful Counsellor, the
   Mighty God, the Potentate, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the
   Future Age." [3100] Now, that because of their exceeding great
   wickedness they would not believe in Him, the Lord shows in these
   words: "Who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the
   Lord been revealed?" [3101] And afterward: "Hearing ye shall hear, and
   shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
   for the heart of this people is waxed gross." [3102] Wherefore
   knowledge was taken from them, because seeing they overlooked, and
   hearing they heard not. But to you, the converted of the Gentiles, is
   the kingdom given, because you, who knew not God, have believed by
   preaching, and "have known Him, or rather are known of Him," [3103]
   through Jesus, the Saviour and Redeemer of those that hope in Him. For
   ye are translated from your former vain and tedious mode of life and
   have contemned the lifeless idols, and despised the demons, which are
   in darkness, and have run to the "true light," [3104] and by it have
   "known the one and only true God and Father," [3105] and so are owned
   to be heirs of His kingdom. For since ye have "been baptized into the
   Lord's death," [3106] and into His resurrection, as "new-born babes,"
   [3107] ye ought to be wholly free from all sinful actions; "for you are
   not your own, but His that bought you" [3108] with His own blood. For
   concerning the former Israel the Lord speaks thus, on account of their
   unbelief: "The kingdom of God shall be taken from them, and given to a
   nation bringing forth the fruits thereof;" [3109] that is to say, that
   having given the kingdom to you, who were once far estranged from Him,
   He expects the fruits of your gratitude and probity. For ye are those
   that were once sent into the vineyard, and did not obey, but these they
   that did obey; [3110] but you have repented of your denial, and you
   work therein now. But they, being uneasy on account of their own
   covenants, have not only left the vineyard uncultivated, but have also
   killed the stewards of the Lord of the vineyard, [3111] --one with
   stones, another with the sword; one they sawed asunder, [3112] another
   they slew in the holy place, "between the temple and the altar;" [3113]
   nay, at last they "cast the Heir Himself out of the vineyard, and slew
   Him." [3114] And by them He was rejected as an unprofitable stone,
   [3115] but by you was received as the corner-stone. Wherefore He says
   concerning you: "A people whom I knew not have served me, and at the
   hearing of the ear have they obeyed me." [3116]

      How the Passover Ought to Be Celebrated.

   XVII. It is therefore your duty, brethren, who are redeemed by the
   precious blood of Christ, to observe the days of the passover exactly,
   with all care, after the vernal equinox, lest ye be obliged to keep the
   memorial of the one passion twice in a year. Keep it once only in a
   year for Him that died but once.

   Do not you yourselves compute, but keep it when your brethren of the
   circumcision do so: keep it together with them; and if they err in
   their computation, be not you concerned. Keep your nights of watching
   in the middle of the days of unleavened bread. And when the Jews are
   feasting, do you fast and wail over them, because an the day of their
   feast they crucified Christ; and while they are lamenting and eating
   unleavened bread in bitterness, do you feast. [3117] But no longer be
   careful to keep the feast with the Jews, for we have now no communion
   with them; for they have been led astray in regard to the calculation
   itself, which they think they accomplish perfectly, that they may be
   led astray on every hand, and be fenced off from the truth. But do you
   observe carefully the vernal equinox, which occurs on the twenty-second
   of the twelfth month, which is Dystros (March), observing carefully
   until the twenty-first of the moon, lest the fourteenth of the moon
   shall fall on another week, and an error being committed, you should
   through ignorance celebrate the passover twice in the year, or
   celebrate the day of the resurrection of our Lord on any other day than
   a Sunday.

      A Constitution Concerning the Great Passover Week.

   XVIII. Do you therefore fast on the days of the passover, beginning
   from the second day of the week until the preparation, and the Sabbath,
   six days, making use of only bread, and salt, and herbs, and water for
   your drink; but do you abstain on these days from wine and flesh, for
   they are days of lamentation and not of feasting. Do ye who are able
   fast the day of the preparation and the Sabbath-day entirely, tasting
   nothing till the cock-crowing of the night; but if any one is not able
   to join them both together, at least let him observe the Sabbath-day;
   for the Lord says somewhere, speaking of Himself: "When the bridegroom
   shall be taken away from them, in those days shall they fast." [3118]
   In these days, therefore, He was taken from us by the Jews, falsely so
   named, and fastened to the cross, and "was numbered among the
   transgressors." [3119]

      Concerning the Watching All the Night of the Great Sabbath, and Concerning
      the Day of the Resurrection.

   XIX. Wherefore we exhort you to fast on those days, as we also fasted
   till the evening, when He was taken away from us; but on the rest of
   the days, before the day of the preparation, let every one eat at the
   ninth hour, or at the evening, or as every one is able. But from the
   even of the fifth day till cock-crowing break your fast when it is
   daybreak of the first day of the week, which is the Lord's day. From
   the even till cock-crowing keep awake, and assemble together in the
   church, watch and pray, and entreat God; reading, when you sit up all
   night, the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms, until cock-crowing, and
   baptizing your catechumens, and reading the Gospel with fear and
   trembling, and speaking to the people such things as tend to their
   salvation: put an end to your sorrow, and beseech God that Israel may
   be converted, and that He will allow them place of repentance, and the
   remission of their impiety; for the judge, who was a stranger, "washed
   his hands, and said, I am innocent of the blood of this just person:
   see ye to it. But Israel cried out, His blood be on us, and on our
   children." [3120] And when Pilate said, "Shall I crucify your king?
   they cried out, We have no king but Cæsar: crucify Him, crucify Him;
   for every, one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Cæsar." And,
   "If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar's friend." [3121] And
   Pilate the governor and Herod the king commanded Him to be crucified;
   and that oracle was fulfilled which says, "Why did the Gentiles rage,
   and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth set
   themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and
   against His Christ;" [3122] and, "They cast away the Beloved, as a dead
   man, who is abominable." [3123] And since He was crucified on the day
   of the Preparation, and rose again at break of day on the Lord's day,
   the scripture was fulfilled which saith, "Arise, O God; judge the
   earth: for Thou shalt have an inheritance in all the nations;" [3124]
   and again, "I will arise, saith the Lord; I will put Him in safety, I
   will wax bold through Him;" [3125] and, "But Thou, Lord, have mercy
   upon me, and raise me up again, and I shall requite them." [3126] For
   this reason do you also, now the Lord is risen, offer your sacrifice,
   concerning which He made a constitution by us, saying, "Do this for a
   remembrance of me;" [3127] and thenceforward leave off your fasting,
   and rejoice, and keep a festival, because Jesus Christ, the pledge of
   our resurrection, is risen from the dead. And let this be an
   everlasting ordinance till the consummation of the world, until the
   Lord come. For to Jews the Lord is still dead, but to Christians He is
   risen: to the former, by their unbelief; to the latter, by their full
   assurance of faith. For the hope in Him is immortal and eternal life.
   After eight days let there be another feast observed with honour, the
   eighth day itself, on which He gave me Thomas, who was hard of belief,
   full assurance, by showing me the print of the nails, and the wound
   made in His side by the spear. [3128] And again, from the first Lord's
   day count forty days, from the Lord's day till the fifth day of the
   week, and celebrate the feast of the ascension of the Lord, whereon He
   finished all His dispensation and constitution, and returned to that
   God and Father that sent Him, and sat down at the right hand of power,
   and remains there until His enemies are put under His feet; who also
   will come at the consummation of the world with power and great glory,
   to judge the quick and the dead, and to recompense to every one
   according to his works. And then shall they see the beloved Son of God
   whom they pierced; [3129] and when they know Him, they shall mourn for
   themselves, tribe by tribe, and their wives apart. [3130]

      A Prophetic Prediction Concerning Christ Jesus.

   XX. For even now, on the tenth day of the month Gorpiæus, when they
   assemble together, they read the Lamentations of Jeremiah, in which it
   is said, "The Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord was taken in
   their destructions;" [3131] and Baruch, in whom it is written, "This is
   our God; no other shall be esteemed with Him. He found out every way of
   knowledge, and showed it to Jacob His son, and Israel His beloved.
   Afterwards He was seen upon earth, and conversed with men." [3132] And
   when they read them, they lament and bewail, as themselves suppose,
   that desolation which happened by Nebuchadnezzar; but, as the truth
   shows, they unwillingly make a prelude to that lamentation which will
   overtake them. But after ten days from the ascension, which from the
   first Lord's day is the fiftieth day, do ye keep a great festival: for
   on that day, at the third hour, the Lord Jesus sent on us the gift of
   the Holy Ghost, and we were filled with His energy, and we "spake with
   new tongues, as that Spirit did suggest to us;" [3133] and we preached
   both to Jews and Gentiles, that He is the Christ of God, who is
   "determined by Him to be the Judge of quick and dead." [3134] To Him
   did Moses bear witness, and said: "The Lord received fire from the
   Lord, and rained it down." [3135] Him did Jacob see as a man, and said:
   "I have seen God face to face, and my soul is preserved." [3136] Him
   did Abraham entertain, and acknowledge to be the Judge, and his Lord.
   [3137] Him did Moses see in the bush; [3138] concerning Him did he
   speak in Deuteronomy: "A Prophet will the Lord your God raise up unto
   you out of your brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear in all
   things, whatsoever He shall say unto you. And it shall be, that every
   soul that will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among his
   people." [3139] Him did Joshua the son of Nun see, as the captain of
   the Lord's host, in armour, for their assistance against Jericho; to
   whom he fell down, and worshipped, as a servant does to his master.
   [3140] Him Samuel knew as the "Anointed of God," [3141] and thence
   named the priests and the kings the anointed. Him David knew, and sung
   an hymn concerning Him, "A song concerning the Beloved;" [3142] and
   adds in his person, and says, "Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O Thou
   who art mighty in Thy beauty and renown: go on, and prosper, and reign,
   for the sake of truth, and meekness, and righteousness; and Thy right
   hand shall guide Thee after a wonderful manner. Thy darts are
   sharpened, O Thou that art mighty; the people shall fall under Thee in
   the heart of the king's enemies. Wherefore God, Thy God, hath anointed
   Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows." Concerning Him also
   spake Solomon, as in His person: "The Lord created me the beginning of
   His ways, for His works: before the world He founded me, in the
   beginning before He made the earth, before the fountains of waters
   came, before the mountains were fastened; He begat me before all the
   hills." [3143] And again: "Wisdom built herself an house." [3144]
   Concerning Him also Isaiah said: "A Branch shall come out of the root
   of Jesse, and a Flower shall spring out of his root." And, "There shall
   be a root of Jesse; and He that is to rise to reign over the Gentiles,
   in Him shall the Gentiles trust." [3145] And Zechariah says: [3146]
   "Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, just, and having salvation; meek,
   and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt, the foal of an ass." [3147]
   Him Daniel describes as "the Son of man coming to the Father," [3148]
   and receiving all judgment and honour from Him; and as "the stone cut
   out of the mountain without hands, and becoming a great mountain, and
   filling the whole earth," [3149] dashing to pieces the many governments
   of the smaller countries, and the polytheism of gods, but preaching the
   one God, and ordaining the monarchy of the Romans. Concerning Him also
   did Jeremiah prophesy, saying: "The Spirit before His face, Christ the
   Lord, was taken in their snares: of whom we said, Under His shadow we
   shall live among the Gentiles." [3150] Ezekiel also, and the following
   prophets, affirm everywhere that He is the Christ, the Lord, the King,
   the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Angel of the Father, the only-begotten
   God. Him therefore do we also preach to you, and declare Him to be God
   the Word, who ministered to His God and Father for the creation of the
   universe. By believing in Him you shall live, but by disbelieving you
   shall be punished. For "he that is disobedient to the Son shall not see
   life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." [3151] Therefore, after you
   have kept the festival of Pentecost, keep one week more festival, and
   after that fast; for it is reasonable to rejoice for the gift of God,
   and to fast after that relaxation: for both Moses and Elijah fasted
   forty days, and Daniel for "three weeks of days did not eat desirable
   bread, and flesh and wine did not enter into his mouth." [3152] And
   blessed Hannah, when she asked for Samuel, said: "I have not drunk wine
   nor strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord." [3153] And
   the Ninevites, when they fasted three days and three nights, [3154]
   escaped the execution of wrath. And Esther, and Mordecai, and Judith,
   [3155] by fasting, escaped the insurrection of the ungodly Holofernes
   and Haman. And David says: "My knees are weak through fasting, and my
   flesh faileth for want of oil." [3156] Do you therefore fast, and ask
   your petitions of God. We enjoin you to fast every fourth day of the
   week, and every day of the preparation, and the surplusage of your fast
   bestow upon the needy; every Sabbath-day excepting one, and every
   Lord's day, hold your solemn assemblies, and rejoice: for he will be
   guilty of sin who fasts on the Lord's day, being the day of the
   resurrection, or during the time of Pentecost, or, in general, who is
   sad on a festival day to the Lord. For on them we ought to rejoice, and
   not to mourn.

    Sec. I.--On Heresies.

      Who They Were that Ventured to Make Schisms, and Did Not Escape
      Punishment.

   I. Above all things, O bishop, avoid the sad and dangerous and most
   atheistical heresies, eschewing them as fire that burns those that come
   near to it. Avoid also schisms: for it is neither lawful to turn one's
   mind towards wicked heresies, nor to separate from those of the same
   sentiment out of ambition. For some who ventured to set up such
   practices of old did not escape punishment. For Dathan and Abiram,
   [3157] who set up in opposition to Moses, were swallowed up into the
   earth. But Corah, and those two hundred and fifty who with him raised a
   sedition against Aaron, were consumed by fire. Miriam also, who
   reproached Moses, was cast out of the camp for seven days; for she said
   that Moses had taken an Ethiopian to wife. [3158] Nay, in the case of
   Azariah and Uzziah, [3159] the latter of which was king of Judah, but
   venturing to usurp the priesthood, and desiring to offer incense, which
   it was not lawful for him to do, was hindered by Azariah the high
   priest, and the fourscore priests; and when he would not obey he found
   the leprosy to arise in his forehead, and he hastened to go out,
   because the Lord had reproved him.

      That It is Not Lawful to Rise Up Either Against the Kingly or the Priestly
      Office.

   II. Let us therefore, beloved, consider what sort of glory that of the
   seditious is, and what their condemnation. For if he that rises up
   against kings is worthy of punishment, even though he be a son or a
   friend, how much more he that rises up against the priests! For by how
   much the priesthood is more noble than the royal power, as having its
   concern about the soul, so much has he a greater punishment who
   ventures to oppose the priesthood, than he who ventures to oppose the
   royal power, although neither of them goes unpunished. For neither did
   Absalom nor Abdadan [3160] escape without punishment; nor Corah and
   Dathan. [3161] The former rose against David, and strove concerning the
   kingdom; the latter against Moses, concerning pre-eminence. And they
   both spake evil; Absalom of his father David, as of an unjust judge,
   saying to every one: "Thy words are good, but there is no one that will
   hear thee, and do thee justice. Who will make me a ruler?" [3162] But
   Abdadan: "I have no part in David, nor any inheritance in the son of
   Jesse." [3163] It is plain that he could not endure to be under David's
   government, of whom God spake: "I have found David the son of Jesse, a
   man after my heart, who will do all my commands." [3164] But Dathan and
   Abiram, and the followers of Corah, said to Moses: "Is it a small thing
   that thou hast brought us out of the land of Egypt, out of a land
   flowing with milk and honey? And why hast thou put out our eyes? And
   wilt thou rule over us?" And they gathered together against him a great
   congregation; and the followers of Corah said: "Has God spoken alone to
   Moses? Why is it that He has given the high-priesthood to Aaron alone?
   Is not all the congregation of the Lord holy? And why is Aaron alone
   possessed of the priesthood?" [3165] And before this, one said: "Who
   made thee a ruler and a judge over us?" [3166]

      Concerning the Virtue of Moses and the Incredulity of the Jewish Nation,
      and What Wonderful Works God Did Among Them.

   III. And they raised a sedition against Moses the servant of God, the
   meekest of all men, [3167] and faithful, and affronted [3168] so great
   a man with the highest ingratitude; him who was their lawgiver, and
   guardian, and high priest, and king, the administrator of divine
   things; one that showed as a creator the mighty works of the Creator;
   the meekest man, freest from arrogance, and full of fortitude, and most
   benign in his temper; one who had delivered them from many dangers, and
   freed them from several deaths by his holiness; who had done so many
   signs and wonders from God before the people, and had performed
   glorious and wonderful works for their benefit; who had [3169] brought
   the ten plagues upon the Egyptians; who had divided the Red Sea, and
   had separated the waters as a wall on this side and on that side, and
   had led the people through them as through a dry wilderness, [3170] and
   had drowned Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and all that were in company
   with them; [3171] and had made the fountain sweet for them with wood,
   and had brought water out of the stony rock for them when they were
   thirsty; [3172] and had given them manna out of heaven, and had
   distributed flesh to them out of the air; [3173] and had afforded them
   a pillar of fire in the night to enlighten and conduct them, and a
   pillar of a cloud to shadow them in the day, by reason of the violent
   heat of the sun; [3174] and had exhibited to them the law of God,
   engraven from the mouth, and hand, and writing of God, in tables of
   stone, the perfect number of ten commandments; [3175] "to whom God
   spake face to face, as if a man spake to his friend;" [3176] of whom He
   said, "And there arose not a prophet like unto Moses." [3177] Against
   him arose the followers of Corah, and the Reubenites, [3178] and threw
   stones at Moses, who prayed, and said: "Accept not Thou their
   offering." [3179] And the glory of God appeared, and sent some down
   into the earth, and burnt up others with fire; and so, as to those
   ringleaders of this schismatical deceit which said, "Let us make
   ourselves a leader," [3180] the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed
   them up, and their tents, and what appertained to them, and they went
   down alive into hell; but he destroyed the followers of Corah with
   fire.

    Sec. II.--History and Doctrines of Heresies.

      That Schism is Made, Not by Him Who Separates Himself from the Ungodly,
      But Who Departs from the Godly.

   IV. If therefore God inflicted punishment immediately on those that
   made a schism on account of their ambition, how much rather will He do
   it upon those who are the leaders of impious heresies! Will not He
   inflict severer punishment on those that blaspheme His providence or
   His creation? But do you, brethren, who are instructed out of the
   Scripture, take care not to make divisions in opinion, nor divisions in
   unity. For those who set up unlawful opinions are marks of perdition to
   the people. In like manner, do not you of the laity come near to such
   as advance doctrines contrary to the mind of God; nor be you partakers
   of their impiety. For says God: "Separate yourselves from the midst of
   these men, lest you perish together with them." [3181] And again:
   "Depart from the midst of them, and separate yourselves, says the Lord,
   and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you." [3182]

      Upon What Account Israel, Falsely So Named, is Rejected by God,
      Demonstrated from the Prophetic Predictions.

   V. For those are most certainly to be avoided who blaspheme God. The
   greatest part of the ungodly, indeed, are ignorant of God; but these
   men, as fighters against God, are possessed with a wilful evil
   disposition, as with a disease. For from the wickedness of these
   heretics "pollution is gone out upon all the earth," [3183] as says the
   prophet Jeremiah. For the wicked synagogue is now cast off by the Lord
   God, and His house is rejected by Him, as He somewhere speaks: "I have
   forsaken mine house, I have left mine inheritance." [3184] And again,
   says Isaiah: "I will neglect my vineyard, and it shall not be pruned
   nor digged, and thorns shall spring up upon it, as upon a desert; and I
   will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it." [3185] He has
   therefore "left His people as a tent in a vineyard, and as a garner in
   a fig or olive yard, and as a besieged city." [3186] He has taken away
   from them the Holy Spirit, and the prophetic rain, and has replenished
   His Church with spiritual grace, as the "river of Egypt in the time of
   first-fruits;" [3187] and has advanced the same "as an house upon an
   hill, or as an high mountain; as a mountain fruitful for milk and
   fatness, wherein it has pleased God to dwell. For the Lord will inhabit
   therein to the end." [3188] And He says in Jeremiah: "Our sanctuary is
   an exalted throne of glory." [3189] And He says in Isaiah: "And it
   shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord
   shall be glorious, and the house of the Lord shall be upon the top of
   the mountains, and shall be advanced above the hills." [3190] Since,
   therefore, He has forsaken His people, He has also left His temple
   desolate, and rent the veil of the temple, and took from them the Holy
   Spirit; for says He, "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate."
   [3191] And He has bestowed upon you, the converted of the Gentiles,
   spiritual grace, as He says by Joel: "And it shall come to pass after
   these things, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all
   flesh; and your sons shall prophesy, and your daughters shall see
   visions, and your old men shall dream dreams." [3192] For God has taken
   away all the power and efficacy of His word, and such like visitations,
   from that people, and has transferred it to you, the converted of the
   Gentiles. For on this account the devil himself is very angry at the
   holy Church of God: he is removed to you, and has raised against you
   adversities, seditions, and reproaches, schisms, and heresies. For he
   had before subdued that people to himself, by their slaying of Christ.
   But you who have left his vanities he tempts in different ways, as he
   did the blessed Job. [3193] For indeed he opposed that great high
   priest Joshua the son of Josedek; [3194] and he oftentimes sought to
   sift us, that our faith might fail. [3195] But our Lord and Master,
   having brought him to trial, said unto him: "The Lord rebuke thee, O
   devil; and the Lord, who hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee. Is not
   this plucked out of the fire as a brand?" [3196] And who said then to
   those that stood by the high priest, "Take away his ragged garments
   from him;" and added, "Behold, I have taken thine iniquities away from
   thee;" He will say now, as He said formerly of us when we were
   assembled together, "I have prayed that your faith may not fail."
   [3197]

      That Even Among the Jews There Arose the Doctrine of Several Heresies
      Hateful to God.

   VI. For even the Jewish nation had wicked heresies: for of them were
   the Sadducees, who do not confess the resurrection of the dead; and the
   Pharisees, who ascribe the practice of sinners to fortune and fate; and
   the Basmotheans, who deny providence, and say that the world is made by
   spontaneous motion, and take away the immortality of the soul; and the
   Hemerobaptists, who every day, unless they wash, do not eat,--nay, and
   unless they cleanse their beds and tables, or platters and cups and
   seats, do not make use of any of them; and those who are newly risen
   amongst us, the Ebionites, who will have the Son of God to be a mere
   man, begotten by human pleasure, and the conjunction of Joseph and
   Mary. There are also those that separate themselves from all these, and
   observe the laws of their fathers, and these are the Essenes. These,
   therefore, arose among the former people. And now the evil one, who is
   wise to do mischief, and as for goodness, knows no such good thing, has
   cast out some from among us, and has wrought by them heresies and
   schisms.

      Whence the Heresies Sprang, and Who Was the Ringleader of Their Impiety.

   VII. Now the original of the new heresies began thus: the devil entered
   into one Simon, of a village called Gitthæ, a Samaritan, by profession
   a magician, and made him the minister of his wicked design. [3198] For
   when Philip our fellow-apostle, [3199] by the gift of the Lord and the
   energy of His Spirit, performed the miracles of healing in Samaria,
   insomuch that the Samaritans were affected, and embraced the faith of
   the God of the universe, and of the Lord Jesus, and were baptized into
   His name; nay, and that Simon himself, when he saw the signs and
   wonders which were done without any magic ceremonies, fell into
   admiration, and believed, and was baptized, and continued in fasting
   and prayer,--we heard of the grace of God which was among the
   Samaritans by Philip, and came down [3200] to them; and enlarging much
   upon the word of doctrine, we laid our hands upon all that were
   baptized, and we conferred upon them the participation of the Spirit.
   But when Simon saw that the Spirit was given to believers by the
   imposition of our hands, he took money, and offered it to us, saying,
   "Give me also the power, that on whomsoever I also shall lay my hand,
   he may receive the Holy Ghost;" [3201] being desirous that as the devil
   [3202] deprived Adam by his tasting of the tree of that immortality
   which was promised him, so also that Simon might entice us by the
   receiving of money, and might thereby cut us off from the gift of God,
   [3203] that so by exchange we might sell to him for money the
   inestimable gift of the Spirit. But as we were all troubled at this
   offer, I Peter, with a fixed attention on that malicious serpent which
   was in him, said to Simon: "Let thy money go with thee to perdition,
   because thou hast thought to purchase the gift of God with money. Thou
   hast no part in this matter, nor lot in this faith; for thy heart is
   not right in the sight of God. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness,
   and pray to the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be
   forgiven thee. For I perceive thou art in the gall of bitterness and
   the bond of iniquity." [3204] But then Simon was terrified, and said:
   "I entreat you, pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of those things
   which ye have spoken come upon me." [3205]

      Who Were the Successors of Simon's Impiety, and What Heresies They Set Up.

   VIII. But when we went forth among the Gentiles to preach the word of
   life, then the devil wrought in the people to send after us false
   apostles to the corrupting of the word; and they sent forth one
   Cleobius, and joined him with Simon, and these became disciples to one
   Dositheus, whom they despising, put him down from the principality.
   Afterwards also others were the authors of absurd doctrines: Cerinthus,
   and Marcus, and Menander, and Basilides, and Saturnilus. Of these some
   own the doctrine of many gods, some only of three, but contrary to each
   other, without beginning, and ever with one another, and some of an
   infinite number of them, and those unknown ones also. And some reject
   marriage; and their doctrine is, that it is not the appointment of God;
   and others abhor some kinds of food: some are impudent in uncleanness,
   such as those who are falsely called Nicolaitans. And Simon meeting me
   Peter, first at Cæsarea Stratonis (where the faithful Cornelius, a
   Gentile, believed on the Lord Jesus by me), endeavoured to pervert the
   word of God; there being with me the holy children, Zacchæus, who was
   once a publican, and Barnabas; and Nicetas and Aquila, brethren of
   Clement the bishop and citizen of Rome, who was the disciple of Paul,
   our fellow-apostle and fellow-helper in the Gospel. I thrice discoursed
   before them with him concerning the true Prophet, and concerning the
   monarchy of God; and when I had overcome him by the power of the Lord,
   and had put him to silence, I drove him away into Italy.

      How Simon, Desiring to Fly by Some Magical Arts, Fell Down Headlong from
      on High at the Prayers of Peter, and Brake His Feet, and Hands, and
      Ankle-Bones.

   IX. Now when he was in Rome, he mightily disturbed the Church, and
   subverted many, and brought them over to himself, and astonished the
   Gentiles with his skill in magic, insomuch that once, in the middle of
   the day, he went into their theatre, and commanded the people that they
   should bring me also by force into the theatre, and promised he would
   fly in the air; and when all the people were in suspense at this, I
   prayed by myself. And indeed he was carried up into the air by demons,
   and did fly on high in the air, saying that he was returning into
   heaven, and that he would supply them with good things from thence. And
   the people making acclamations to him, as to a god, I stretched out my
   hands to heaven, with my mind, and besought God through the Lord Jesus
   to throw down this pestilent fellow, and to destroy the power of those
   demons that made use of the same for the seduction and perdition of
   men, to dash him against the ground, and bruise him, but not to kill
   him. And then, fixing my eyes on Simon, I said to him: "If I be a man
   of God, and a real apostle of Jesus Christ, and a teacher of piety, and
   not of deceit, as thou art, Simon, I command the wicked powers of the
   apostate from piety, by whom Simon the magician is carried, to let go
   their hold, that he may fall down headlong from his height, that he may
   be exposed to the laughter of those that have been seduced by him."
   When I had said these words, Simon was deprived of his powers, and fell
   down headlong with a great noise, and was violently dashed against the
   ground, and had his hip and ankle-bones broken; and the people cried
   out, saying, "There is one only God, whom Peter rightly preaches in
   truth." And many left him; but some who were worthy of perdition
   continued in his wicked doctrine. And after this manner the most
   atheistical heresy of the Simonians was first established in Rome; and
   the devil wrought by the rest of the false apostles [3206] also.

      How the Heresies Differ from Each Other, and from the Truth.

   X. Now all these had one and the same design of atheism, to blaspheme
   Almighty God, to spread their doctrine that He is an unknown being, and
   not the Father of Christ, nor the Creator of the world; but one who
   cannot be spoken of, ineffable, not to be named, and begotten by
   Himself; that we are not to make use of the law and the prophets; that
   there is no providence and no resurrection to be believed; that there
   is no judgment nor retribution; that the soul is not immortal; that we
   must only indulge our pleasures, and turn to any sort of worship
   without distinction. Some of them say that there are many gods, some
   that there are three gods without beginning, some that there are two
   unbegotten gods, some that there are innumerable Æons. Further, some of
   them teach that men are not to marry, and must abstain from flesh and
   wine, affirming that marriage, and the begetting of children, and the
   eating of certain foods, are abominable; that so, as sober persons,
   they may make their wicked opinions to be received as worthy of belief.
   And some of them absolutely prohibit the eating of flesh, as being the
   flesh not of brute animals, but of creatures that have a rational soul,
   as though those that ventured to slay them would be charged with the
   crime of murder. But others of them affirm that we must only abstain
   from swine's flesh, but may eat such as are clean by the law; and that
   we ought to be circumcised, according to the law, and to believe in
   Jesus as in an holy man and a prophet. But others teach that men ought
   to be impudent in uncleanness, and to abuse the flesh, and to go
   through all unholy practices, as if this were the only way for the soul
   to avoid the rulers of this world. Now all these are the instruments of
   the devil, and the children of wrath.

    Sec. III.--The Heresies Attacked by the Apostles.

      An Exposition of the Preaching of the Apostles.

   XI. But we, who are the children of God and the sons of peace, do
   preach the holy and right word of piety, and declare one only God, the
   Lord of the law and of the prophets, the Maker of the world, the Father
   of Christ; not a being that caused Himself, or begat Himself, as they
   suppose, but eternal, and without original, and inhabiting light
   inaccessible; not two or three, or manifold, but eternally one only;
   not a being that cannot be known or spoken of, but who was preached by
   the law and the prophets; the Almighty, the Supreme Governor of all
   things, the All-powerful Being; the God and Father of the
   Only-begotten, and of the First-born of the whole creation; one God,
   the Father of one Son, not of many; the Maker of one Comforter by
   Christ, the Maker of the other orders, the one Creator of the several
   creatures by Christ, the same their Preserver and Legislator by Him;
   the cause of the resurrection, and of the judgment, and of the
   retribution which shall be made by Him: that this same Christ was
   pleased to become man, and went through life without sin, and suffered,
   and rose from the dead, and returned to Him that sent Him. We also say
   that every creature of God is good, and nothing abominable; that
   everything for the support of life, when it is partaken of righteously,
   is very good: for, according to the Scripture, "all things were very
   good." [3207] We believe that lawful marriage, and the begetting of
   children, is honourable and undefiled; for difference of sexes was
   formed in Adam and Eve for the increase of mankind. We acknowledge with
   us a soul that is incorporeal and immortal,--not corruptible as bodies
   are, but immortal, as being rational and free. We abhor all unlawful
   mixtures, and that which is practised by some against nature as wicked
   and impious. We profess there will be a resurrection both of the just
   and unjust, and a retribution. We profess that Christ is not a mere
   man, but God the Word, and man the Mediator between God and men, the
   High Priest of the Father; nor are we circumcised with the Jews, as
   knowing that He is come "to whom the inheritance was reserved," [3208]
   and on whose account the families were kept distinct--"the expectation
   of the Gentiles," Jesus Christ, who sprang out of Judah, [3209] the Son
   from the branch, the flower from Jesse, whose government is upon His
   shoulder. [3210]

      For Those that Confess Christ, But are Desirous to Judaize.

   XII. But because this heresy did then seem the more powerful to seduce
   men, and the whole Church was in danger, [3211] we the twelve assembled
   together at Jerusalem (for Matthias was chosen to be an apostle in the
   room of the betrayer, and took the lot of Judas; as it is said, "His
   bishopric [3212] let another take"). We deliberated, together with
   James the Lord's brother, what was to be done; and it seemed good to
   him and to the elders to speak to the people words of doctrine. For
   certain men likewise went down from Judea to Antioch, and taught the
   brethren who were there, saying: "Unless ye be circumcised after the
   manner of Moses, and walk according to the other customs which he
   ordained, ye cannot be saved." [3213] When, therefore, there had been
   no small dissension and disputation, the brethren which were at
   Antioch, when they knew that we were all met together about this
   question, sent out unto us men who were faithful and understanding in
   the Scriptures to learn concerning this question. And they, when they
   were come to Jerusalem, declared to us what questions were arisen in
   the church of Antioch,--namely, that some said men ought to be
   circumcised, and to observe the other purifications. And when some said
   one thing, and some another, I Peter stood up, and said unto them: "Men
   and brethren, ye know how that from ancient days God made choice among
   you that the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel by my mouth,
   and believe; and God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness.
   [3214] For an angel of the Lord appeared on a certain time to
   Cornelius, [3215] who was a centurion of the Roman government, and
   spake to him concerning me, that he should send for me, and hear the
   word of life from my mouth. He therefore sent for me from Joppa to
   Cæsarea Stratonis; and when I was ready to go to him, I would have
   eaten. And while they made ready I was in the upper room praying; and I
   saw heaven opened, and a vessel, knit at the four corners like a
   splendid sheet, let down to the earth, wherein were all manner of
   four-footed beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the
   heaven. And there came a voice out of heaven to me, saying, Arise,
   Peter; kill, and eat. And I said, By no means, Lord: for I have never
   eaten anything common or unclean. And there came a voice a second time,
   saying, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. And this was
   done thrice, and the vessel was received up again into heaven. But as I
   doubted what this vision should mean, the Spirit said to me, Behold,
   men seek thee; but rise up, and go thy way with them, nothing doubting,
   for I have sent them. [3216] These men were those which came from the
   centurion, and so by reasoning I understood the word of the Lord which
   is written: Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be
   saved.' [3217] And again: All the ends of the earth shall remember, and
   turn unto the Lord, and all the families of the heathen shall worship
   before Him: for the kingdom is in the Lord's, and He is the governor of
   the nations.' [3218] And observing that there were expressions
   everywhere concerning the calling of the Gentiles, I rose up, and went
   with them, and entered into the man's house. And while I was preaching
   the word, the Holy Spirit fell upon him, and upon those that were with
   him, as it did upon us at the beginning; and He put no difference
   between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. And I perceived
   that God is no respecter of persons; but that in every nation he that
   feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, will be accepted with Him. But
   even the believers which were of the circumcision were astonished at
   this. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to lay an heavy yoke upon the
   neck of the disciples, which neither we nor our fathers were able to
   bear? But by the grace of the Lord, we believe we shall be saved, even
   as they. [3219] For the Lord has loosed us from our bonds, and has made
   our burden light, and has loosed the heavy yoke from us by His
   clemency." While I spake these things, the whole multitude kept
   silence. But James the Lord's brother answered and said: "Men and
   brethren, hearken unto me; Simeon hath declared how God at first
   visited to take out a people from the Gentiles for His name. And to
   this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written: Afterwards I
   will return, and will raise again and rebuild the tabernacle of David,
   which is fallen down; and I will rebuild its ruins, and will again set
   it up, that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the
   nations upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doth these
   things.' [3220] Known unto God are all His works from the beginning of
   the world. Wherefore my sentence is, that we do not trouble those who
   from among the Gentiles turn unto God: but to charge them that they
   abstain from the pollutions of the Gentiles, and from what is
   sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and
   from fornication; which laws were given to the ancients who lived
   before the law, under the law of nature, Enos, Enoch, Noah,
   Melchizedek, Job, and if there be any other of the same sort." [3221]
   Then it seemed good to us the apostles, and to James the bishop, and to
   the elders, with the whole Church, to send men chosen from among our
   own selves, with Barnabas, and Paul of Tarsus, the apostle of the
   Gentiles, and Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men
   among the brethren, and wrote by their hand, as follows: "The apostles,
   and elders, and brethren, [3222] to the brethren of Antioch, Syria, and
   Cilicia of the Gentiles, send greeting: Since we have heard that some
   from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, to whom we
   gave no such commandment, it has seemed good to us, when we were met
   together with one accord, to send chosen men to you, with our beloved
   Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for our Lord
   Jesus Christ, by whom ye sent unto us. We have sent also with them
   Judas and Silas, who shall themselves declare the same things by mouth.
   For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay no other burden
   upon you than these necessary things; that ye abstain from things
   offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from
   fornication: from which things if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well.
   Fare ye well." [3223] We accordingly sent this epistle; but we
   ourselves remained in Jerusalem many days, consulting together for the
   public benefit, for the well ordering of all things.

      That We Must Separate from Heretics.

   XIII. But after a long time we visited the brethren, and confirmed them
   with the word of piety, and charged them to avoid those who, under the
   name of Christ and Moses, war against Christ and Moses, and in the
   clothing of sheep hide the wolf. For these are false Christs, and false
   prophets, and false apostles, deceivers and corrupters, portions of
   foxes, the destroyers of the herbs of the vineyards: "for whose sake
   the love of many will wax cold. But he that endureth stedfast to the
   end, the same shall be saved." [3224] Concerning whom, that He might
   secure us, the Lord declared, saying: "There will come to you men in
   sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know
   them by their fruits; take care of them. For false Christs and false
   prophets shall arise and shall deceive many." [3225]

      Who Were the Preachers of the Catholic Doctrine, and Which are the
      Commandments Given by Them.

   XIV. On whose account also we, who are now assembled in one
   place,--Peter and Andrew; James and John, sons of Zebedee; Philip and
   Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew; James the son of Alphæus, and Lebbæus
   who is surnamed Thaddæus; and Simon the Canaanite, [3226] and Matthias,
   who instead of Judas was numbered with us; and James the brother of the
   Lord and bishop of Jerusalem, and Paul the teacher of the Gentiles, the
   chosen vessel, having all met together, have written to you this
   Catholic doctrine for the confirmation of you, to whom the oversight of
   the universal Church is committed: wherein we declare unto you, that
   there is only one God Almighty, besides whom there is no other, and
   that you must worship and adore Him alone, through Jesus Christ our
   Lord, in the most holy Spirit; [3227] that you are to make use of the
   sacred Scriptures, the law, and the prophets; to honour your parents;
   to avoid all unlawful actions; to believe the resurrection and the
   judgment, and to expect the retribution; and to use all His creatures
   with thankfulness, as the works of God, and having no evil in them; to
   marry after a lawful manner, for such marriage is unblameable. For "the
   woman is suited to the man by the Lord;" [3228] and the Lord says: "He
   that made them from the beginning, made them male and female; and said,
   For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
   cleave unto his wife: and they two shall be one flesh." [3229] Nor let
   it be esteemed lawful after marriage to put her away who is without
   blame. For says He: "Thou shalt take care to thy spirit, and shalt not
   forsake the wife of thy youth; for she is the partner [3230] of thy
   life, and the remains of thy spirit. I and no other have made her."
   [3231] For the Lord says: "What God has joined together, let no man put
   asunder." [3232] For the wife is the partner of life, united by God
   unto one body from two. But he that divides that again into two which
   is become one, is the enemy of the creation of God, and the adversary
   of His providence. In like manner, he that retains her that is
   corrupted is a transgressor of the law of nature; since "he that
   retains an adulteress is foolish and impious." [3233] For says He, "Cut
   her off from thy flesh;" [3234] for she is not an help, but a snare,
   bending her mind from thee to another. Nor be ye circumcised in your
   flesh, but let the circumcision which is of the heart by the Spirit
   suffice for the faithful; for He says, "Be ye circumcised to your God,
   and be circumcised in the foreskin of your heart." [3235]

      That We Ought Not to Rebaptize, Nor to Receive that Baptism Which is Given
      by the Ungodly, Which is Not Baptism, But a Pollution.

   XV. Be ye likewise contented with one baptism alone, that which is into
   the death of the Lord; not that which is conferred by wicked heretics,
   but that which is conferred by unblameable priests, "in the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:" [3236] and let not that
   which comes from the ungodly be received by you, nor let that which is
   done by the godly be disannulled by a second. For as there is one God,
   one Christ, and one Comforter, and one death of the Lord in the body,
   so let that baptism which is unto Him be but one. But those that
   receive polluted baptism from the ungodly will become partners in their
   opinions. For they are not priests. For God says to them: "Because thou
   hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee from the office of a
   priest to me." [3237] Nor indeed are those that are baptized by them
   initiated, but are polluted, not receiving the remission of sins, but
   the bond of impiety. And, besides, they that attempt to baptize those
   already initiated crucify the Lord afresh, slay Him a second time,
   laugh at divine and ridicule holy things, affront the Spirit, dishonour
   the sacred blood of Christ as common blood, are impious against Him
   that sent, Him that suffered, and Him that witnessed. Nay, he that, out
   of contempt, will not be baptized, shall be condemned as an unbeliever,
   and shall be reproached as ungrateful and foolish. For the Lord says:
   "Except a man be baptized of water and of the Spirit, he shall by no
   means enter into the kingdom of heaven." [3238] And again: "He that
   believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not
   shall be damned." [3239] But he that says, When I am dying I will be
   baptized, lest I should sin and defile my baptism, is ignorant of God,
   and forgetful of his own nature. For "do not thou delay to turn unto
   the Lord, for thou knowest not what the next day will bring forth."
   [3240] Do you also baptize your infants, and bring them up in the
   nurture and admonition of God. For says He: "Suffer the little children
   to come unto me, and forbid them not." [3241]

      Concerning Books with False Inscriptions.

   XVI. We have sent all these things to you, that ye may know our
   opinion, what it is; and that ye may not receive those books which
   obtain in our name, but are written by the ungodly. For you are not to
   attend to the names of the apostles, but to the nature of the things,
   and their settled opinions. For we know that Simon and Cleobius, and
   their followers, have compiled poisonous books under the name of Christ
   and of His disciples, and do carry them about in order to deceive you
   who love Christ, and us His servants. And among the ancients also some
   have written apocryphal books of Moses, and Enoch, and Adam, and
   Isaiah, and David, and Elijah, and of the three patriarchs, pernicious
   and repugnant to the truth. The same things even now have the wicked
   heretics done, reproaching the creation, marriage, providence, the
   begetting of children, the law, and the prophets; inscribing certain
   barbarous names, and, as they think, of angels, but, to speak the
   truth, of demons, which suggest things to them: whose doctrine eschew,
   that ye may not be partakers of the punishment due to those that write
   such things for the seduction and perdition of the faithful and
   unblameable disciples of the Lord Jesus.

      Matrimonial Precepts Concerning Clergymen.

   XVII. We have already said, that a bishop, a presbyter, and a deacon,
   when they are constituted, must be but once married, whether their
   wives be alive or whether they be dead; and that it is not lawful for
   them, if they are unmarried when they are ordained, to be married
   afterwards; or if they be then married, to marry a second time, but to
   be content with that wife which they had when they came to ordination.
   [3242] We also appoint that the ministers, and singers, and readers,
   and porters, shall be only once married. But if they entered into the
   clergy before they were married, we permit them to marry, if they have
   an inclination thereto, lest they sin and incur punishment. [3243] But
   we do not permit any one of the clergy to take to wife either a
   courtesan, or a servant, or a widow, or one that is divorced, as also
   the law says. Let the deaconess be a pure virgin; or, at the least, a
   widow who has been but once married, faithful, and well esteemed.
   [3244]

      An Exhortation Commanding to Avoid the Communion of the Impious Heretics.

   XVIII. Receive ye the penitent, for this is the will of God in Christ.
   Instruct the catechumens in the elements of religion, and then baptize
   them. Eschew the antheistical heretics, who are past repentance, and
   separate them from the faithful, and excommunicate them from the Church
   of God, and charge the faithful to abstain entirely from them, and not
   to partake with them either in sermons or prayers: for these are those
   that are enemies to the Church, and lay snares for it; who corrupt the
   flock, and defile the heritage of Christ, pretenders only to wisdom,
   and the vilest of men; concerning whom Solomon the wise said: "The
   wicked doers pretend to act piously." For, says he, "there is a way
   which seemeth right to some, but the ends thereof look to the bottom of
   hell." [3245] These are they concerning whom the Lord declared His mind
   with bitterness and severity, saying that "they are false Christs and
   false teachers;" [3246] who have blasphemed the Spirit of grace, and
   done despite to the gift they had from Him after the grace of baptism,
   "to whom forgiveness shall not be granted, neither in this world nor in
   that which is to come;" [3247] who are both more wicked than the Jews
   and more atheistical than the Gentiles; who blaspheme the God over all,
   and tread under foot His Son, and do despite to the doctrine of the
   Spirit; who deny the words of God, or pretend hypocritically to receive
   them, to the affronting of God, and the deceiving of those that come
   among them; who abuse the Holy Scriptures, and as for righteousness,
   they do not so much as know what it is; who spoil the Church of God, as
   the "little foxes do the vineyard;" [3248] whom we exhort you to avoid,
   lest you lay traps for your own souls. "For he that walketh with wise
   men shall be wise, but he that walketh with the foolish shall be
   known." [3249] For we ought neither to run along with a thief, nor put
   in our lot with an adulterer; since holy David says: "O Lord, I have
   hated them that hate Thee, and I am withered away on account of Thy
   enemies. I hated them with a perfect hatred: they were to me as
   enemies." [3250] And God reproaches Jehoshaphat with his friendship
   towards Ahab, and his league with him and with Ahaziah, by Jonah the
   prophet: "Art thou in friendship with a sinner? Or dost thou aid him
   that is hated by the Lord?" [3251] "For this cause the wrath of the
   Lord would be upon thee suddenly, but that thy heart is found perfect
   with the Lord. For this cause the Lord hath spared thee; yet are thy
   works shattered, and thy ships broken to pieces." [3252] Eschew
   therefore their fellowship, and estrange yourselves from their
   friendship. For concerning them did the prophet declare, and say: "It
   is not lawful to rejoice with the ungodly," [3253] says the Lord. For
   these are hidden wolves, dumb dogs, that cannot bark, who at present
   are but few, but in process of time, when the end of the world draws
   nigh, will be more in number and more troublesome, of whom said the
   Lord, "Will the Son of man, when He comes, find faith on the earth?"
   [3254] and, "Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
   cold;" and, "There shall come false Christs and false prophets, and
   shall show signs in the heaven, so as, if it were possible, to deceive
   the elect:" [3255] from whose deceit God, through Jesus Christ, who is
   our hope, will deliver us. For we ourselves, as we passed through the
   nations, and confirmed the churches, curing some with much exhortation
   and healing words, restored them again when they were in the certain
   way to death. But those that were incurable we cast out from the flock,
   that they might not infect the lambs, which were found with their
   scabby disease, but might continue before the Lord God pure and
   undefiled, sound and unspotted. And this we did in every city,
   everywhere through the whole world, and have left to you the bishops
   and to the rest of the priests this very Catholic doctrine worthily and
   righteously, as a memorial or confirmation to those who have believed
   in God; and we have sent it by our fellow-minister Clement, our most
   faithful and intimate son in the Lord, together with Barnabas, and
   Timothy our most dearly beloved son, and the genuine Mark, together
   with whom we recommend to you also Titus and Luke, and Jason and
   Lucius, and Sosipater. [3256]

    Sec. IV.--Of the Law.

   By whom also we exhort you in the Lord to abstain from your old
   conversation, vain bonds, separations, observances, distinction of
   meats, and daily washings: for "old things are passed away; behold, all
   things are become new." [3257]

      To Those that Speak Evil of the Law.

   XIX. For since ye have known God through Jesus Christ, and all His
   dispensation, as it has been from the beginning, that He gave a plain
   law to assist the law of nature, [3258] such a one as is pure, saving,
   and holy, in which His own name was inscribed, [3259] perfect, which is
   never to fail, being complete in ten commands, unspotted, converting
   souls; [3260] which, when the Hebrews forgot, He put them in mind of it
   by the prophet Malachi, saying, "Remember ye the law of Moses, the man
   of God, who gave you in charge commandments and ordinances." [3261]
   Which law is so very holy and righteous, that even our Saviour, when on
   a certain time He healed one leper, and afterwards nine, said to the
   first, "Go, show thyself to the high priest, and offer the gift which
   Moses commanded for a testimony unto them;" [3262] and afterwards to
   the nine, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." [3263] For He nowhere
   has dissolved the law, as Simon pretends, but fulfilled it; for He
   says: "One iota, or one tittle, shall not pass from the law until all
   be fulfilled." For says He, "I come not to dissolve the law, but to
   fulfil it." [3264] For Moses himself, who was at once the lawgiver, and
   the high priest, and the prophet, and the king, and Elijah, the zealous
   follower of the prophets, were present at our Lord's transfiguration in
   the mountain, [3265] and witnesses of His incarnation and of His
   sufferings, as the intimate friends of Christ, but not as enemies and
   strangers. Whence it is demonstrated that the law is good and holy, as
   also the prophets.

      Which is the Law of Nature, and Which is that Afterwards Introduced, and
      Why It Was Introduced.

   XX. Now the law is the decalogue, which the Lord promulgated to them
   with an audible voice, [3266] before the people made that calf which
   represented the Egyptian Apis. [3267] And the law is righteous, and
   therefore is it called the law, because judgments are thence made
   according to the law of nature, which the followers of Simon abuse,
   supposing they shall not be judged thereby, and so shall escape
   punishment. This law is good, holy, and such as lays no compulsion in
   things positive. For He says: "If thou wilt make me an altar, thou
   shalt make it of earth." [3268] It does not say, "Make one," but, "If
   thou wilt make." It does not impose a necessity, but gives leave to
   their own free liberty. For God does not stand in need of sacrifices,
   being by nature above all want. But knowing that, as of old, Abel,
   beloved of God, and Noah and Abraham, and those that succeeded, without
   being required, but only moved of themselves by the law of nature, did
   offer sacrifice to God out of a grateful mind; so He did now permit the
   Hebrews, not commanding, but, if they had a mind, permitting them; and
   if they offered from a right intention, showing Himself pleased with
   their sacrifices. Therefore He says: "If thou desirest to offer, do not
   offer to me as to one that stands in need of it, for I stand in need of
   nothing; for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof." [3269] But
   when this people became forgetful of that, and called upon a calf as
   God, instead of the true God, and to him did ascribe the cause of their
   coming out of Egypt, saying, "These are thy gods, O Israel, which have
   brought thee out of the land of Egypt;" [3270] and when these men had
   committed wickedness with the "similitude of a calf that eateth hay;"
   and denied God who had visited them by Moses [3271] in their
   afflictions, and had done signs with his hand and rod, and had smitten
   the Egyptians with ten plagues; who had divided the waters of the Red
   Sea into two parts; who had led them in the midst of the water, as a
   horse upon the ground; who had drowned their enemies, and those that
   laid wait for them; who at Marah had made sweet the bitter fountain;
   who had brought water out of the sharp rock till they were satisfied;
   who had overshadowed them with a pillar of a cloud on account of the
   immoderate heat, and with a pillar of fire which enlightened and guided
   them when they knew not which way they were to go; who gave them manna
   from heaven, and gave them quails for flesh from the sea; [3272] who
   gave them the law in the mountain; whose voice He had vouchsafed to let
   them hear; Him did they deny, and said to Aaron, "Make us gods who
   shall go before us;" [3273] and they made a molten calf, and sacrificed
   to an idol;--then was God angry, as being ungratefully treated by them,
   and bound them with bonds which could not be loosed, with a mortifying
   burden and a hard collar, and no longer said, "If thou makest," but,
   "Make an altar," and sacrifice perpetually; for thou art forgetful and
   ungrateful. Offer burnt-offerings therefore continually, that thou
   mayest be mindful of me. For since thou hast wickedly abused thy power,
   I lay a necessity upon thee for the time to come, and I command thee to
   abstain from certain meats; and I ordain thee the distinction of clean
   and unclean creatures, although every creature is good, as being made
   by me; and I appoint thee several separations, purgations, frequent
   washings and sprinklings, several purifications, and several times of
   rest; and if thou neglectest any of them, I determine that punishment
   which is proper to the disobedient, that being pressed and galled by
   thy collar, thou mayest depart from the error of polytheism, and laying
   aside that, "These are thy gods, O Israel," [3274] mayest be mindful of
   that, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord;" [3275] and mayest
   run back again to that law which is inserted by me in the nature of all
   men, "that there is only one God in heaven and on earth, and to love
   Him with all thy heart, and all thy might, and all thy mind," and to
   fear none but Him, nor to admit the names of other gods into thy mind,
   nor to let thy tongue utter them out of thy mouth. He bound them for
   the hardness of their hearts, that by sacrificing, and resting, and
   purifying themselves, and by similar observances, they might come to
   the knowledge of God, who ordained these things for them.

      That We Who Believe in Christ are Under Grace, and Not Under the Servitude
      of that Additional Law.

   XXI. "But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they
   hear." [3276] Yours, I say, who have believed in the one God, not by
   necessity, but by a sound understanding, in obedience to Him that
   called you. For you are released from the bonds, and freed from the
   servitude. For says He: [3277] "I call you no longer servants, but
   friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father have I made
   known unto you." [3278] For to them that would not see nor hear, not
   for the want of those senses, but for the excess of their wickedness,
   "I gave statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they would
   not live;" [3279] they are looked upon as not good, as burnings and a
   sword, and medicines are esteemed enemies by the sick, and impossible
   to be observed on account of their obstinacy: whence also they brought
   death upon them being not obeyed.

      That the Law for Sacrifices is Additional, Which Christ When He Came Took
      Away.

   XXII. You therefore are blessed who are delivered from the curse, For
   Christ, the Son of God, by His coming has confirmed and completed the
   law, but has taken away the additional precepts, although not all of
   them, yet at least the more grievous ones; having confirmed the former,
   and abolished the latter, and has again set the free-will of man at
   liberty, not subjecting him to the penalty of a temporal death, but
   giving laws to him according to another constitution. Wherefore He
   says: "If any man will come after me, let him come." [3280] And again:
   "Will ye also go away?" [3281] And besides, before His coming He
   refused the sacrifices of the people, while they frequently offered
   them, when they sinned against Him, and thought He was to be appeased
   by sacrifices, but not by repentance. For thus He speaks: "Why dost
   thou bring to me frankincense from Saba, and cinnamon from a remote
   land? Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices are
   not sweet to me." [3282] And afterwards: "Gather your burnt-offerings,
   together with your sacrifices, and eat flesh. For I did not command
   you, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt, concerning
   burnt-offerings and sacrifices." [3283] And He says by Isaiah: "To what
   purpose do ye bring me a multitude of sacrifices? saith the Lord. I am
   full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and I will not accept the fat of
   lambs, and the blood of bulls and of goats. Nor do you come and appear
   before me; for who hath required these things at your hands? Do not go
   on to tread my courts any more. If you bring me fine flour, it is vain:
   incense is an abomination unto me: your new moons, and your Sabbaths,
   and your great day, I cannot bear them: your fasts, and your rests, and
   your feasts, my soul hateth them; I am over-full of them." [3284] And
   He says by another: "Depart from me; the sound of thine hymns, and the
   psalms of thy musical instruments, I will not hear." [3285] And Samuel
   says to Saul, when he thought to sacrifice: "Obedience is better than
   sacrifice, and hearkening than the fat of rams. For, behold, the Lord
   does not so much delight in sacrifice, as in obeying Him." [3286] And
   He says by David: "I will take no calves out of thine house, nor
   he-goats out of thy flock. If I should be hungry, I would not tell
   thee; for the whole world is mine, and the fulness thereof. Shall I eat
   the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Sacrifice to God the
   sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows to the Most High." [3287] And in
   all the Scriptures in like manner He refuses their sacrifices on
   account of their sinning against Him. For "the sacrifices of the
   impious are an abomination with the Lord, since they offer them in an
   unlawful manner." [3288] And again: "Their sacrifices are to them as
   bread of lamentation; all that eat of them shall be defiled." [3289]
   If, therefore, before His coining He sought for "a clean heart and a
   contrite spirit" [3290] more than sacrifices, much rather would He
   abrogate those sacrifices, I mean those by blood, when He came. Yet He
   so abrogated them as that He first fulfilled them. For He was both
   circumcised, and sprinkled, and offered sacrifices and whole
   burnt-offerings, and made use of the rest of their customs. And He that
   was the Lawgiver became Himself the fulfilling of the law; not taking
   away the law of nature, but abrogating those additional laws that were
   afterwards introduced, although not all of them neither.

      How Christ Became a Fulfiller of the Law, and What Parts of It He Put a
      Period To, or Changed, or Transferred.

   XXIII. For He did not take away the law of nature, but confirmed it.
   For He that said in the law, "The Lord thy God is one Lord;" [3291] the
   same says in the Gospel, "That they might know Thee, the only true
   God." [3292] And He that said, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself," [3293] says in the Gospel, renewing the same precept, "A new
   commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another." [3294] He who
   then forbade murder, does now forbid causeless anger. [3295] He that
   forbade adultery, does now forbid all unlawful lust. He that forbade
   stealing, now pronounces him most happy who supplies those that are in
   want out of his own labours. [3296] He that forbade hatred, now
   pronounces him blessed that loves his enemies. [3297] He that forbade
   revenge, now commands long-suffering; [3298] not as if just revenge
   were an unrighteous thing, but because long-suffering is more
   excellent. Nor did He make laws to root out our natural passions, but
   only to forbid the excess of them. [3299] He who had commanded to
   honour our parents, was Himself subject to them. [3300] He who had
   commanded to keep the Sabbath, by resting thereon for the sake of
   meditating on the laws, has now commanded us to consider of the law of
   creation, and of providence every day, and to return thanks to God. He
   abrogated circumcision when He had Himself fulfilled it. For He it was
   "to whom the inheritance was reserved, who was the expectation of the
   nations." [3301] He who made a law for swearing rightly, and forbade
   perjury, has now charged us not to swear at all. [3302] He has in
   several ways changed baptism, sacrifice, the priesthood, and the divine
   service, which was confined to one place: for instead of daily
   baptisms, He has given only one, which is that into His death. Instead
   of one tribe, He has appointed that out of every nation the best should
   be ordained for the priesthood; and that not their bodies should be
   examined for blemishes, but their religion and their lives. Instead of
   a bloody sacrifice, He has appointed that reasonable and unbloody
   mystical one of His body and blood, which is performed to represent the
   death of the Lord by symbols. Instead of the divine service confined to
   one place, He has commanded and appointed that He should be glorified
   from sunrising to sunsetting in every place of His dominion. [3303] He
   did not therefore take away the law from us, but the bonds. For
   concerning the law Moses says: "Thou shalt meditate on the word which I
   command thee, sitting in thine house, and rising up, and walking in the
   way." [3304] And David says: "His delight is in the law of the Lord,
   and in His law will he meditate day and night." [3305] For everywhere
   would he have us subject to His laws, but not transgressors of them.
   For says He: "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law
   of the Lord. Blessed are they that search out His testimonies; with
   their whole heart shall they seek Him." [3306] And again: "Blessed are
   we, O Israel, because those things that are pleasing to God are known
   to us." [3307] And the Lord says: "If ye know these things, happy are
   ye if ye do them." [3308]

      That It Pleased the Lord that the Law of Righteousness Should Be
      Demonstrated by the Romans.

   XXIV. Nor does He desire that the law of righteousness should only be
   demonstrated by us; but He is pleased that it should appear and shine
   by means of the Romans. For these Romans, believing in the Lord, left
   off their polytheism and injustice, and entertain the good, and punish
   the bad. But they hold the Jews under tribute, and do not suffer them
   to make use of their own ordinances.

      How God, on Account of Their Impiety Towards Christ, Made the Jews
      Captives, and Placed Them Under Tribute.

   XXV. Because, indeed, they drew servitude upon themselves voluntarily,
   when they said, "We have no king but Cæsar;" [3309] and, "If we do not
   slay Christ, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and
   will take away both our place and nation." [3310] And so they
   prophesied unwittingly. For accordingly the nations believed on Him,
   and they themselves were deprived by the Romans of their power, and of
   their legal worship; and they have been forbidden to slay whom they
   please, and to sacrifice when they will. Wherefore they are accursed,
   as not able to perform the things they are commanded to do. For says
   He: "Cursed be he that does not continue in all things that are written
   in the book of the law to do them." [3311] Now it is impossible in
   their dispersion, while they are among the heathen, for them to perform
   all things in their law. For the divine Moses forbids both to rear an
   altar out of Jerusalem, and to read the law out of the bounds of Judea.
   [3312] Let us therefore follow Christ, that we may inherit His
   blessings. Let us walk after the law and the prophets by the Gospel.
   Let us eschew the worshippers of many gods, and the murderers of
   Christ, and the murderers of the prophets, and the wicked and
   atheistical heretics. Let us be obedient to Christ as to our King, as
   having authority to change several constitutions, and having, as a
   legislator, wisdom to make new constitutions in different
   circumstances; yet so that everywhere the laws of nature be immutably
   preserved.

    Sec. V.--The Teaching of the Apostles in Opposition to Jewish and Gentile
    Superstitions, Especially in Regard to Marriage and Funerals.

      That We Ought to Avoid the Heretics as the Corrupters of Souls.

   XXVI. Do you therefore, O bishops, and ye of the laity, avoid all
   heretics who abuse the law and the prophets. For they are enemies to
   God Almighty, and disobey Him, and do not confess Christ to be the Son
   of God. For they also deny His generation according to the flesh; they
   are ashamed of the cross; they abuse His passion and His death; they
   know not His resurrection; they take away His generation before all
   ages. Nay, some of them are impious after another manner, imagining the
   Lord to be a mere man, supposing Him to consist of a soul and body. But
   others of them suppose that Jesus Himself is the God over all, and
   glorify Him as His own Father, and suppose Him to be both the Son and
   the Comforter; than which doctrines what can be more detestable?
   Others, again, of them do refuse certain meats, and say that marriage
   with the procreation of children is evil, and the contrivance of the
   devil; and being ungodly themselves, they are not willing to rise again
   from the dead on account of their wickedness. Wherefore also they
   ridicule the resurrection, and say, We are holy people, unwilling to
   eat and to drink; and they fancy that they shall rise again from the
   dead demons without flesh, who shall be condemned for ever in eternal
   fire. Fly therefore from them, lest ye perish with them in their
   impieties.

      Of Some Jewish and Gentile Observances.

   XXVII. Now if any persons keep to the Jewish customs and observances
   concerning the natural emission and nocturnal pollutions, and the
   lawful conjugal acts, [3313] let them tell us whether in those hours or
   days, when they undergo any such thing, they observe not to pray, or to
   touch a Bible, or to partake of the Eucharist? And if they own it to be
   so, it is plain they are void of the Holy Spirit, which always
   continues with the faithful. For concerning holy persons Solomon says:
   "That every one may prepare himself, that so when he sleeps it may keep
   him, and when he arises it may talk with him." [3314] For if thou
   thinkest, O woman, when thou art seven days in thy separation, that
   thou art void of the Holy Spirit, then if thou shouldest die suddenly
   thou wilt depart void of the Spirit, and without assured hope in God;
   or else thou must imagine that the Spirit always is inseparable from
   thee, as not being in a place. But thou standest in need of prayer and
   the Eucharist, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, as having been guilty
   of no fault in this matter. For neither lawful mixture, nor
   child-bearing, nor the menstrual purgation, nor nocturnal pollution,
   can defile the nature of a man, or separate the Holy Spirit from him.
   Nothing but impiety and unlawful practice can do that. For the Holy
   Spirit always abides with those that are possessed of it, so long as
   they are worthy; and those from whom it is departed, it leaves them
   desolate, and exposed to the wicked spirit. Now every man is filled
   either with the holy or with the unclean spirit; and it is not possible
   to avoid the one or the other, unless they can receive opposite
   spirits. For the Comforter hates every lie, and the devil hates all
   truth. But every one that is baptized agreeably to the truth is
   separated from the diabolical spirit, and is under the Holy Spirit; and
   the Holy Spirit remains with him so long as he is doing good, and fills
   him with wisdom and understanding, and suffers not the wicked spirit to
   approach him, but watches over his goings. Thou therefore, O woman, if,
   as thou sayest, in the days of thy separation thou art void of the Holy
   Spirit, thou art then filled with the unclean one; for by neglecting to
   pray and to read thou wilt invite him to thee, though he were
   unwilling. For this spirit, of all others, loves the ungrateful, the
   slothful, the careless, and the drowsy, since he himself by ingratitude
   was distempered with evil mind, and was thereby deprived by God his
   dignity; having rather chosen to be a devil than an archangel.
   Wherefore, O woman, eschew such vain words, and be ever mindful of God
   that created thee, and pray to Him. For He is thy Lord, and the Lord of
   the universe; and meditate in His laws without observing any such
   things, such as the natural purgation, lawful mixture, child-birth, a
   miscarriage, or a blemish of the body; since such observations are the
   vain inventions of foolish men, and such inventions as have no sense in
   them. Neither the burial of a man, nor a dead man's bone, nor a
   sepulchre, nor any particular sort of food, nor the nocturnal
   pollution, can defile the soul of man; but only impiety towards God,
   and transgression, and injustice towards one's neighbour; I mean
   rapine, violence, or if there be anything contrary to His
   righteousness, adultery or fornication. Wherefore, beloved, avoid and
   eschew such observations, for they are heathenish. For we do not
   abominate a dead man, as do they, seeing we hope that he will live
   again. Nor do we hate lawful mixture; for it is their practice to act
   impiously in such instances. For the conjunction of man and wife, if it
   be with righteousness, is agreeable to the mind of God. "For He that
   made them at the beginning made them male and female; and He blessed
   them, and said, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth." [3315] If,
   therefore, the difference of sexes was made by the will of God for the
   generation of multitudes, then must the conjunction of male and female
   be also acceptable to His mind.

      Of the Love of Boys, Adultery, and Fornication.

   XXVIII. But we do not say so of that mixture that is contrary to
   nature, or of any unlawful practice; for such are enmity to God. For
   the sin of Sodom is contrary to nature, as is also that with brute
   beasts. But adultery and fornication are against the law; the one
   whereof is impiety, the other injustice, and, in a word, no other than
   a great sin. But neither sort of them is without its punishment in its
   own proper nature. For the practisers of one sort attempt the
   dissolution of the world, and endeavour to make the natural course of
   things to change for one that is unnatural; but those of the second
   sort--the adulterers--are unjust by corrupting others' marriages, and
   dividing into two what God hath made one, rendering the children
   suspected, and exposing the true husband to the snares of others. And
   fornication is the destruction of one's own flesh, not being made use
   of for the procreation of children, but entirely for the sake of
   pleasure, which is a mark of incontinency, and not a sign of virtue.
   All these things are forbidden by the laws; for thus say the oracles:
   "Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind." [3316] "For such a
   one is accursed, and ye shall stone them with stones: they have wrought
   abomination." [3317] "Every one that lieth with a beast, slay ye him:
   he has wrought wickedness in his people." [3318] "And if any one defile
   a married woman, slay ye them both: they have wrought wickedness; they
   are guilty; let them die." [3319] And afterwards: "There shall not be a
   fornicator among the children of Israel, and there shall not be an
   whore among the daughters of Israel. Thou shalt not offer the hire of
   an harlot to the Lord thy God upon the altar, nor the price of a dog."
   [3320] "For the vows arising from the hire of an harlot are not clean."
   [3321] These things the laws have forbidden, but they have honoured
   marriage, and have called it blessed, since God has blessed it who
   joined male and female together. [3322] And wise Solomon somewhere
   says: "A wife is suited to her husband by the Lord." [3323] And David
   says: "Thy wife is like a flourishing vine in the sides of thine house;
   thy children like olive-branches round about thy table. Behold, thus
   shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord." [3324] Wherefore
   "marriage is honourable" [3325] and comely, and the begetting of
   children pure, for there is no evil in that which is good. Therefore
   neither is the natural purgation abominable before God, who has ordered
   it to happen to women within the space of thirty days for their
   advantage and healthful state, who do less move about, and keep usually
   at home in the house. Nay, moreover, even in the Gospel, when the woman
   with the perpetual purgation of blood [3326] touched the saving border
   of the Lord's garment in hope of being healed, He was not angry at her,
   nor did complain of her at all; but, on the contrary, He healed her,
   saying, "Thy faith hath saved thee." When the natural purgations do
   appear in the wives, let not their husbands approach them, out of
   regard to the children to be begotten; for the law has forbidden it,
   for it says: "Thou shalt not come near thy wife when she is in her
   separation." [3327] Nor, indeed, let them frequent their wives' company
   when they are with child. [3328] For they do this not for the begetting
   of children, but for the sake of pleasure. Now a lover of God ought not
   to be a lover of pleasure.

      How Wives Ought to Be Subject to Their Own Husbands, and Husbands Ought to
      Love Their Own Wives.

   XXXIX. Ye wives, be subject to your own husbands, and have them in
   esteem, and serve them with fear and love, as holy Sarah honoured
   Abraham. For she could not endure to call him by his name, but called
   him lord, when she said, "My lord is old." [3329] In like manner, ye
   husbands, love your own wives as your own members, as partners in life,
   and fellow-helpers for the procreation of children. For says He,
   "Rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Let her conversation be to thee as
   a loving hind, and a pleasant foal; let her alone guide thee, and be
   with thee at all times: for if thou beest every way encompassed with
   her friendship, thou wilt be happy in her society." [3330] Love them
   therefore as your own members, as your very bodies; for so it is
   written, "The Lord has testified between thee and between the wife of
   thy youth; and she is thy partner, and another has not made her: and
   she is the remains of thy spirit;" and, "Take heed to your spirit, and
   do not forsake the wife of thy youth." [3331] An husband, therefore,
   and a wife, when they company together in lawful marriage, and rise
   from one another, may pray without any observations, and without
   washing are clean. But whosoever corrupts and defiles another man's
   wife, or is defiled with an harlot, when he arises up from her, though
   he should wash himself in the entire ocean and all the rivers, cannot
   be clean.

    Sec. VI.--Conclusion of the Work.

      That It is the Custom of Jews and Gentiles to Observe Natural Purgations,
      and to Abominate the Remains of the Dead; But that All This is Contrary to
      Christianity.

   XXX. Do not therefore keep any such observances about legal and natural
   purgations, as thinking you are defiled by them. Neither do you seek
   after Jewish separations, or perpetual washings, or purifications upon
   the touch of a dead body. But without such observations assemble in the
   dormitories, reading the holy books, and singing for the martyrs which
   are fallen asleep, and for all the saints from the beginning of the
   world, and for your brethren that are asleep in the Lord, and offer the
   acceptable Eucharist, the representation of the royal body of Christ,
   both in your churches and in the dormitories; and in the funerals of
   the departed, accompany them with singing, if they were faithful in
   Christ. For "precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His
   saints." [3332] And again: "O my soul, return unto thy rest, for the
   Lord hath done thee good." [3333] And elsewhere: "The memory of the
   just is with encomiums." [3334] And, "The souls of the righteous are in
   the hands of God." [3335] For those that have believed in God, although
   they are asleep, are not dead. For our Saviour says to the Sadducees:
   "But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that
   which is written, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
   the God of Jacob? God, therefore, is not the God of the dead, but of
   the living; for all live to Him." [3336] Wherefore, of those that live
   with God, even their very relics are not without honour. For even
   Elisha the prophet, after he was fallen asleep, raised up a dead man
   who was slain by the pirates of Syria. [3337] For his body touched the
   bones of Elisha, and he arose and revived. Now this would not have
   happened unless the body of Elisha were holy. And chaste Joseph
   embraced Jacob after he was dead upon his bed; [3338] and Moses and
   Joshua the son of Nun carried away the relics of Joseph, [3339] and did
   not esteem it a defilement. Whence you also, O bishops, and the rest,
   who without such observances touch the departed, ought not to think
   yourselves defiled. Nor abhor the relics of such persons, but avoid
   such observances, for they are foolish. And adorn yourselves with
   holiness and chastity, that ye may become partakers of immortality, and
   partners of the kingdom of God, and may receive the promise of God, and
   may rest for ever, through Jesus Christ our Saviour.

   To Him, therefore, who is able to open the ears of your hearts to the
   receiving the oracles of God administered to you both by the Gospel and
   by the teaching of Jesus Christ of Nazareth; who was crucified under
   Pontius Pilate and Herod, and died, and rose again from the dead, and
   will come again at the end of the world with power and great glory, and
   will raise the dead, and put an end to this world, and distribute to
   every one according to his deserts: to Him that has given us Himself
   for an earnest of the resurrection; who was taken up into the heavens
   by the power of His God and Father in our sight, who ate and drank with
   Him for forty days after He arose from the dead; who is sat down on the
   right hand of the throne of the majesty of Almighty God upon the
   cherubim; to whom it was said, "Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make
   Thine enemies Thy footstool;" [3340] whom the most blessed Stephen saw
   standing at the right hand of power, and cried out, and said, "Behold,
   I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand
   of God," [3341] as the High Priest of all the rational orders,--through
   Him, worship, and majesty, and glory be given to Almighty God, both now
   and for evermore. [3342] Amen.

constitutions of the holy apostles

  Book VII.

  Concerning the Christian Life, and the Eucharist, and the Initiation into
  Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Sec. I.--On the Two Ways, [3343] --The Way of Life and the Way of Death.

      That There are Two Ways,--The One Natural, of Life, and the Other
      Introduced Afterwards, of Death; And that the Former is from God, and the
      Latter of Error, from the Snares of the Adversary.

   I. The lawgiver Moses said to the Israelites, "Behold, I have set
   before your face the way of life and the way of death;" [3344] and
   added, "Choose life, that thou mayest live." [3345] Elijah the prophet
   also said to the people: "How long will you halt with both your legs?
   If the Lord be God, follow Him." [3346] The Lord Jesus also said
   justly: "No one can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
   and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the
   other." [3347] We also, following our teacher Christ, "who is the
   Saviour of all men, especially of those that believe," [3348] are
   obliged to say that there are two ways--the one of life, the other of
   death; [3349] which have no comparison one with another, for they are
   very different, [3350] or rather entirely separate; and the way of life
   is that of nature, but that of death was afterwards introduced,--it not
   being according to the mind of God, but from the snares of the
   adversary. [3351]

      Moral Exhortations of the Lord's Constitutions Agreeing with the Ancient
      Prohibitions of the Divine Laws. The Prohibition of Anger, Spite,
      Corruption, Adultery, and Every Forbidden Action.

   II. The first way, therefore, is that of life; and is this, [3352]
   which the law also does appoint: "To love the Lord God with all thy
   mind, and with all thy soul, who is the one and only God, besides whom
   there is no other;" [3353] "and thy neighbour as thyself." [3354] And
   whatsoever thou wouldest not should be done to thee, that do not thou
   to another." [3355] "Bless them that curse you; pray for them that
   despitefully use you." [3356] "Love your enemies; for what thanks is it
   if ye love those that love you? for even the Gentiles do the same."
   [3357] "But do ye love those that hate you, and ye shall have no
   enemy." For says He, "Thou shalt not hate any man; no, not an Egyptian,
   nor an Edomite;" [3358] for they are all the workmanship of God. Avoid
   not the persons, but the sentiments, of the wicked. "Abstain from
   fleshly and worldly lusts." [3359] "If any one gives thee a stroke on
   thy right cheek, turn to him the other also." [3360] Not that revenge
   is evil, but that patience is more honourable. For David says, "If I
   have made returns to them that repaid me evil." [3361] "If any one
   compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain." [3362] And, "He that will
   sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak
   also." [3363] "And from him that taketh thy goods, require them not
   again." [3364] "Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would
   borrow of thee do not shut thy hand." [3365] For "the righteous man is
   pitiful, and lendeth." [3366] For your Father would have you give to
   all, who Himself "maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
   and sendeth His rain on the just and on the unjust." [3367] It is
   therefore reasonable to give to all out of thine own labours; for says
   He, "Honour the Lord out of thy righteous labours," [3368] but so that
   the saints be preferred. [3369] "Thou shalt not kill;" [3370] that is,
   thou shalt not destroy a man like thyself: for thou dissolvest what was
   well made. Not as if all killing were wicked, but only that of the
   innocent: but the killing which is just is reserved to the magistrates
   alone. "Thou shalt not commit adultery:" for thou dividest one flesh
   into two. "They two shall be one flesh:" [3371] for the husband and
   wife are one in nature, in consent, in union, in disposition, and the
   conduct of life; but they are separated in sex and number. "Thou shall
   not corrupt boys:" [3372] for this wickedness is contrary to nature,
   and arose from Sodom, which was therefore entirely consumed with fire
   sent from God. [3373] "Let such a one be accursed: and all the people
   shall say, So be it." [3374] "Thou shall not commit fornication:" for
   says He, "There shall not be a fornicator among the children of
   Israel." [3375] "Thou shalt not steal:" for Achan, when he had stolen
   in Israel at Jericho, was stoned to death; [3376] and Gehazi, who
   stole, and told a lie, inherited the leprosy of Naaman; [3377] and
   Judas, who stole the poor's money, betrayed the Lord of glory to the
   Jews, [3378] and repented, and hanged himself, and burst asunder in the
   midst, and all his bowels gushed out; [3379] and Ananias, and Sapphira
   his wife, who stole their own goods, and "tempted the Spirit of the
   Lord," were immediately, at the sentence of Peter our fellow-apostle,
   struck dead. [3380]

      The Prohibition of Conjuring, Murder of Infants, Perjury, and False
      Witness.

   III. Thou shalt not use magic. [3381] Thou shalt not use witchcraft;
   for He says, "Ye shall not suffer a witch to live." [3382] Thou shall
   not slay thy child by causing abortion, nor kill that which is
   begotten; for "everything that is shaped, and has received a soul from
   God, if it be slain, shall be avenged, as being unjustly destroyed."
   [3383] "Thou shalt not covet the things that belong to thy neighbour,
   as his wife, or his servant, or his ox, or his field." "Thou shalt not
   forswear thyself; for it is said, "Thou shalt not swear at all." [3384]
   But if that cannot be avoided, thou shalt swear truly; for "every one
   that swears by Him shall be commended." [3385] "Thou shalt not bear
   false witness;" for "he that falsely accuses the needy provokes to
   anger Him that made him." [3386]

      The Prohibition of Evil-Speaking and Passion, of Deceitful Conduct, or
      Idle Words, Lies, Covetousness, and Hypocrisy.

   IV. Thou shall not speak evil; [3387] for says He, "Love not to speak
   evil, lest thou beest taken away." Nor shalt thou be mindful of
   injuries; for "the ways of those that remember injuries are unto
   death." [3388] Thou shall not be double-minded nor double-tongued; for
   "a man's own lips are a strong snare to him," [3389] and "a talkative
   person shall not be prospered upon earth." [3390] Thy words shall not
   be vain; for "ye shall give an account of every idle word." [3391] Thou
   shalt not tell lies: for says He, "Thou shalt destroy all those that
   speak lies." [3392] Thou shalt not be covetous nor rapacious: for says
   He, "Woe to him that is covetous towards his neighbour with an evil
   covetousness." [3393]

      The Prohibition of Malignity, Acceptation of Persons, Wrath, Malice, and
      Envy.

   V. Thou shalt not be an hypocrite, lest thy "portion be with them."
   [3394] Thou shalt not be ill-natured nor proud: for "God resisteth the
   proud." [3395] "Thou shalt not accept persons in judgment; for the
   judgment is the Lord's." "Thou shalt not hate any man; thou shalt
   surely reprove thy brother, and not become guilty on his account;"
   [3396] and, "Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee." [3397] Eschew
   all evil, and all that is like it: for says He, "Abstain from
   injustice, and trembling shall not come nigh thee." [3398] Be not soon
   angry, nor spiteful, nor passionate, nor furious, nor daring, lest thou
   undergo the fate of Cain, and of Saul, and of Joab: for the first of
   these slew his brother Abel, because Abel was found to be preferred
   before him with God, and because Abel's sacrifice was preferred; [3399]
   the second persecuted holy David, who had slain Goliah the Philistine,
   being envious of the praises of the women who danced; [3400] the third
   slew two generals of armies--Abner of Israel, and Amasa of Judah.
   [3401]

      Concerning Augury and Enchantments.

   VI. Be not a diviner, for that leads to idolatry; [3402] for says
   Samuel, "Divination is sin;" [3403] and, "There shall be no divination
   in Jacob, nor soothsaying in Israel." [3404] Thou shalt not use
   enchantments or purgations for thy child. Thou shall not be a
   soothsayer nor a diviner by great or little birds. Nor shalt thou learn
   wicked arts; for all these things has the law forbidden. [3405] Be not
   one that wishes for evil, for thou wilt be led into intolerable sins.
   Thou shalt not speak obscenely, nor use wanton glances, nor be a
   drunkard; for from such causes arise whoredoms and adulteries. Be not a
   lover of money, lest thou "serve mammon instead of God." [3406] Be not
   vainglorious, nor haughty, nor high-minded. For from all these things
   arrogance does spring. Remember him who said: "Lord, my heart is not
   haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: I have not exercised myself in great
   matters, nor in things too high for me; but I was humble." [3407]

      The Prohibition of Murmuring, Insolence, Pride, and Arrogance.

   VII. Be not a murmurer, remembering the punishment which those
   underwent who murmured against Moses. Be not self-willed, be not
   malicious, be not hard-hearted, be not passionate, be not
   mean-spirited; for all these things lead to blasphemy. But be meek, as
   were Moses and David, [3408] since "the meek shall inherit the earth."
   [3409]

      Concerning Long-Suffering, Simplicity, Meekness, and Patience.

   VIII. Be slow to wrath; for such a one is very prudent, since "he that
   is hasty of spirit is a very fool." [3410] Be merciful; for "blessed
   are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy." [3411] Be sincere,
   quiet, good, "trembling at the word of God." [3412] Thou shalt not
   exalt thyself, as did the Pharisee; for "every one that exalteth
   himself shall be abased," [3413] and "that which is of high esteem with
   man is abomination with God." [3414] Thou shalt not entertain
   confidence in thy soul; for "a confident man shall fall into mischief."
   [3415] Thou shalt not go along with the foolish, but with the wise and
   righteous; for "he that walketh [3416] with wise men shall be wise, but
   he that walketh with the foolish shall be known." [3417] Receive the
   afflictions that fall upon thee with an even mind, and the chances of
   life without over-much sorrow, knowing that a reward shall be given to
   thee by God, as was given to Job and to Lazarus. [3418]

      That It is Our Duty to Esteem Our Christian Teachers Above Our
      Parents--The Former Being the Means of Our Well-Being, the Other Only of
      Our Being.

   IX. Thou shalt honour him that speaks to thee the word of God, and be
   mindful of him day and night; and thou shalt reverence him, [3419] not
   as the author of thy birth, but as one that is made the occasion of thy
   well-being. For where the doctrine concerning God is, there God is
   present. Thou shalt every day seek the face of the saints, that thou
   mayest acquiesce in their words.

      That We Ought Not to Divide Ourselves from the Saints, But to Make Peace
      Between Those that Quarrel, to Judge Righteously, and Not to Accept
      Persons.

   X. Thou shalt not make schisms among the saints, but be mindful of the
   followers of Corah. [3420] Thou shalt make peace between those that are
   at variance, as Moses did when he persuaded them to be friends. [3421]
   Thou shalt judge righteously; for "the judgment is the Lord's." [3422]
   Thou shalt not accept persons when thou reprovest for sins; but do as
   Elijah and Micaiah did to Ahab, and Ebedmelech the Ethiopian to
   Zedekiah, and Nathan to David, and John to Herod. [3423]

      Concerning Him that is Double-Minded and Desponding.

   XI. Be not of a doubtful mind in thy prayer, whether it shall be
   granted or no. For the Lord said to me Peter upon the sea: "O thou of
   little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" [3424] "Be not thou ready to
   stretch out thy hand to receive, and to shut it when thou shouldst
   give." [3425]

      Concerning Doing Good.

   XII. If thou hast by the work of thy hands, give, that thou mayest
   labour for the redemption of thy sins; for "by alms and acts of faith
   sins are purged away." [3426] Thou shalt not grudge to give to the
   poor, nor when thou hast given shalt thou murmur; for thou shalt know
   who will repay thee thy reward. For says he: "He that hath mercy on the
   poor man lendeth to the Lord; according to his gift, so shall it be
   repaid him again." [3427] Thou shalt not turn away from him that is
   needy; for says he: "He that stoppeth his ears, that he may not hear
   the cry of the needy, himself also shall call, and there shall be none
   to hear him." [3428] Thou shall communicate in all things to thy
   brother, and shall not say thy goods are thine own; for the common
   participation of the necessaries of life is appointed to all men by
   God. Thou shalt not take off thine hand from thy son or from thy
   daughter, but shalt teach them the fear of God from their youth; for
   says he: "Correct thy son, so shall he afford thee good hope." [3429]

      How Masters Ought to Behave Themselves to Their Servants, and How Servants
      Ought to Be Subject.

   XIII. Thou shall not command thy man-servant, or thy maid-servant, who
   trust in the same God, with bitterness of soul, lest they groan against
   thee, and wrath be upon thee from God. And, ye servants, "be subject to
   your masters," [3430] as to the representatives of God, with attention
   and fear, "as to the Lord, and not to men." [3431]

      Concerning Hypocrisy, and Obedience to the Laws, and Confession of Sins.

   XIV. Thou shalt hate all hypocrisy; and whatsoever is pleasing to the
   Lord, that shalt thou do. By no means forsake the commands of the Lord.
   But thou shalt observe what things thou hast received from Him, neither
   adding to them nor taking away from them. "For thou shalt not add unto
   His words, lest He convict thee, and thou becomest a liar." [3432] Thou
   shalt confess thy sins unto the Lord thy God; and thou shalt not add
   unto them, that it may be well with thee from the Lord thy God, who
   willeth not the death of a sinner, but his repentance.

      Concerning the Observance Due to Parents.

   XV. Thou shalt be observant to thy father and mother as the causes of
   thy being born, that thou mayest live long on the earth which the Lord
   thy God giveth thee. Do not overlook thy brethren or thy kinsfolk; for
   "thou shalt not overlook those nearly related to thee." [3433]

      Concerning the Subjection Due to the King and to Rulers.

   XVI. Thou shalt fear the king, knowing that his appointment is of the
   Lord. His rulers thou shalt honour as the ministers of God, for they
   are the revengers of all unrighteousness; to whom pay taxes, tribute,
   and every oblation with a willing mind.

      Concerning the Pure Conscience of Those that Pray.

   XVII. Thou shalt not proceed to thy prayer in the day of thy
   wickedness, before thou hast laid aside thy bitterness. This is the way
   of life, in which may ye be found, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

      That the Way Which Was Afterward Introduced by the Snares of the Adversary
      is Full of Impiety and Wickedness.

   XVIII. But the way of death [3434] is known by its wicked practices:
   for therein is the ignorance of God, and the introduction of many
   evils, and disorders, and disturbances; whereby come murders,
   adulteries, fornications, perjuries, unlawful lusts, thefts,
   idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false-witnesses,
   hypocrisies, double-heartedness, deceit, pride, malice, insolence,
   covetousness, obscene talk, jealousy, confidence, haughtiness,
   arrogance, impudence, persecution of the good, enmity to truth, love of
   lies, ignorance of righteousness. For they who do such things do not
   adhere to goodness, or to righteous judgment: they watch not for good,
   but for evil; from whom meekness and patience are far off, who love
   vain things, pursuing after reward, having no pity on the poor, not
   labouring for him that is in misery, nor knowing Him that made them;
   murderers of infants, destroyers of the workmanship of God, that turn
   away from the needy, adding affliction to the afflicted, the flatterers
   of the rich, the despisers of the poor, full of sin. May you, children,
   be delivered from all these.

      That We Must Not Turn from the Way of Piety Either to the Right Hand or to
      the Left. An Exhortation of the Lawgiver.

   XIX. See that no one seduce thee [3435] from piety; for says He: "Thou
   mayst not turn aside from it to the right hand, or to the left, that
   thou mayst have understanding in all that thou doest." [3436] For if
   thou dost not turn out of the right way, thou wilt not be ungodly.

    Sec. II.--On the Formation of the Character of Believers, and on Giving of
    Thanks to God.

      That We Ought Not to Despise Any of the Sorts of Food that are Set Before
      Us, But Gratefully and Orderly to Partake of Them.

   XX. Now concerning the several sorts of food, the Lord says to thee,
   "Ye shall eat the good things of the earth;" [3437] and, "All sorts of
   flesh shall ye eat, as the green herb;" [3438] but, "Thou shalt pour
   out the blood." [3439] For "not those things that go into the mouth,
   but those that come out of it, defile a man;" [3440] I mean
   blasphemies, evil-speaking, and if there be any other thing of the like
   nature. [3441] But "do thou eat the fat of the land with
   righteousness." [3442] For "if there be anything pleasant, it is His;
   and if there be anything good, it is His. Wheat for the young men, and
   wine to cheer the maids." For "who shall eat or who shall drink without
   Him?" [3443] Wise Ezra [3444] does also admonish thee and say: "Go your
   way, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and be not sorrowful."
   [3445]

      That We Ought to Avoid the Eating of Things Offered to Idols.

   XXI. But do ye abstain from things offered to idols; [3446] for they
   offer them in honour of demons, that is, to the dishonour of the one
   God, that ye may not become partners with demons.

      A Constitution of Our Lord, How We Ought to Baptize, and into Whose Death.

   XXII. Now concerning baptism, [3447] O bishop, or presbyter, we have
   already given direction, and we now say, that thou shalt so baptize as
   the Lord commanded us, saying: "Go ye, and teach all nations, baptizing
   them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
   (teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you):"
   [3448] of the Father who sent, of Christ who came, of the Comforter who
   testified. But thou shalt beforehand anoint the person with the holy
   oil, and afterward baptize him with the water, and in the conclusion
   shall seal him with the ointment; that the anointing with oil may be
   the participation of the Holy Spirit, and the water the symbol of the
   death of Christ, and the ointment the seal of the covenants. But if
   there be neither oil nor ointment, water is sufficient both for the
   anointing, and for the seal, and for the confession of Him that is
   dead, or indeed is dying together with Christ. But before baptism, let
   him that is to be baptized fast; for even the Lord, when He was first
   baptized by John, and abode in the wilderness, did afterward fast forty
   days and forty nights. [3449] But He was baptized, and then fasted, not
   having Himself any need of cleansing, or of fasting, or of purgation,
   who was by nature pure and holy; but that He might testify the truth to
   John, and afford an example to us. Wherefore our Lord was not baptized
   into His own passion, or death, or resurrection--for none of those
   things had then happened--but for another purpose. Wherefore He by His
   own authority fasted after His baptism, as being the Lord of John. But
   he who is to be initiated into His death ought first to fast, and then
   to be baptized. For it is not reasonable that he who has been buried
   with Christ, and is risen again with Him, should appear dejected at His
   very resurrection. For man is not lord of our Saviour's constitution,
   since one is the Master and the other the servant.

      Which Days of the Week We are to Fast, and Which Not, and for What
      Reasons.

   XXIII. But let not your fasts be with the hypocrites; [3450] for they
   fast on the second and fifth days of the week. But do you either fast
   the entire five days, or on the fourth day of the week, and on the day
   of the Preparation, because on the fourth day the condemnation went out
   against the Lord, Judas then promising to betray Him for money; and you
   must fast on the day of the Preparation, because on that day the Lord
   suffered the death of the cross under Pontius Pilate. But keep the
   Sabbath, and the Lord's day festival; because the former is the
   memorial of the creation, and the latter of the resurrection. But there
   is one only Sabbath to be observed by you in the whole year, which is
   that of our Lord's burial, on which men ought to keep a fast, but not a
   festival. For inasmuch as the Creator was then under the earth, the
   sorrow for Him is more forcible than the joy for the creation; for the
   Creator is more honourable by nature and dignity than His own
   creatures.

      What Sort of People Ought to Pray that Prayer that Was Given by the Lord.

   XXIV. Now, "when ye pray, be not ye as the hypocrites;" [3451] but as
   the Lord has appointed us in the Gospel, so pray ye: "Our Father which
   art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be
   done, as in heaven, so on earth; give us this day our daily bread; and
   forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors; and lead us not into
   temptation, but deliver us from evil; for Thine is the kingdom for
   ever. Amen." [3452] Pray thus thrice in a day, preparing yourselves
   beforehand, that ye may be worthy of the adoption of the Father; lest,
   when you call Him Father unworthily, you be reproached by Him, as
   Israel once His first-born son was told: "If I be a Father, where is my
   glory? And if I be a Lord, where is my fear?" [3453] For the glory of
   fathers is the holiness of their children, and the honour of masters is
   the fear of their servants, as the contrary is dishonour and confusion.
   For says He: "Through you my name is blasphemed among the Gentiles."
   [3454]

      A Mystical Thanksgiving.

   XXXV. Be ye always thankful, as faithful and honest servants; and
   concerning the eucharistical thanksgiving say thus: [3455] We thank
   Thee, our Father, for that life which Thou hast made known to us by
   Jesus Thy Son, by whom Thou madest all things, and takest care of the
   whole world; whom Thou hast sent to become man for our salvation; whom
   Thou hast permitted to suffer and to die; whom Thou hast raised up, and
   been pleased to glorify, and hast set Him down on Thy right hand; by
   whom Thou hast promised us the resurrection of the dead. Do thou, O
   Lord Almighty, everlasting God, so gather together Thy Church from the
   ends of the earth into Thy kingdom, as this corn was once scattered,
   and is now become one loaf. We also, our Father, thank Thee for the
   precious blood of Jesus Christ, which was shed for us and for His
   precious body, whereof we celebrate this representation, as Himself
   appointed us, "to show forth His death." [3456] For through Him glory
   is to be given to Thee for ever. Amen. Let no one eat of these things
   that is not initiated; but those only who have been baptized into the
   death of the Lord. But if any one that is not initiated conceal
   himself, and partake of the same, "he eats eternal damnation;" [3457]
   because, being not of the faith of Christ, he has partaken of such
   things as it is not lawful for him to partake of, to his own
   punishment. But if any one is a partaker through ignorance, instruct
   him quickly, and initiate him, that he may not go out and despise you.

      A Thanksgiving at the Divine Participation.

   XXVI. After the participation, [3458] give thanks in this manner: We
   thank thee, O God and Father of Jesus our Saviour, for Thy holy name,
   which Thou hast made to inhabit among us; and that knowledge, faith,
   love, and immortality which Thou hast given us through Thy Son Jesus.
   Thou, O Almighty Lord, the God of the universe, hast created the world,
   and the things that are therein, by Him; and hast planted a law in our
   souls, and beforehand didst prepare things for the convenience of men.
   O God of our holy and blameless fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
   Thy faithful servants; Thou, O God, who art powerful, faithful, and
   true, and without deceit in Thy promises; who didst send upon earth
   Jesus Thy Christ to live with men, as a man, when He was God the Word,
   and man, to take away error by the roots: do Thou even now, through
   Him, be mindful of this Thy holy Church, which Thou hast purchased with
   the precious blood of Thy Christ, and deliver it from all evil, and
   perfect it in Thy love and Thy truth, and gather us all together into
   Thy kingdom which Thou hast prepared. Let this Thy kingdom come. [3459]
   "Hosanna to the Son of David. Blessed be He that cometh in the name of
   the Lord" [3460] --God the Lord, who was manifested to us in the flesh.
   If any one be holy, let him draw near; but if any one be not such, let
   him become such by repentance. Permit also to your presbyters to give
   thanks.

      A Thanksgiving About the Mystical Ointment.

   XXVII. Concerning the ointment give thanks in this manner: We give Thee
   thanks, O God, the Creator of the whole world, both for the flagrancy
   of the ointment, and for the immortality which Thou hast made known to
   us by Thy Son Jesus. For Thine is the glory and the power for ever.
   Amen. Whosoever comes to you, [3461] and gives thanks in this manner,
   receive him as a disciple of Christ. But if he preach another doctrine,
   different from that which Christ by us has delivered to you, such a one
   you must not permit to give thanks; for such a one rather affronts God
   than glorifies Him.

      That We Ought Not to Be Indifferent About Communicating.

   XXVIII. But whosoever comes to you, let him be first examined, and then
   received: for ye have understanding, and are able to know the right
   hand from the left, [3462] and to distinguish false teachers from true
   teachers. But when a teacher comes to you, supply him with what he
   wants with all readiness. And even when a false teacher comes, you
   shall give him for his necessity, but shall not receive his error. Nor
   indeed may ye pray together with him, lest ye be polluted as well as
   he. Every true prophet or teacher [3463] that comes to you is worthy of
   his maintenance, as being a labourer in the word of righteousness.
   [3464]

      A Constitution Concerning Oblations.

   XXIX. All the first-fruits of the winepress, the threshing-floor, the
   oxen, and the sheep, shalt thou give to the priests, [3465] that thy
   storehouses and garners and the products of thy land may be blessed,
   and thou mayst be strengthened with corn and wine and oil, and the
   herds of thy cattle and flocks of thy sheep may be increased. Thou
   shalt give the tenth of thy increase to the orphan, and to the widow,
   and to the poor, and to the stranger. All the first-fruits of thy hot
   bread, of thy barrels of wine, or oil, or honey, or nuts, or grapes, or
   the first-fruits of other things, shalt thou give to the priests; but
   those of silver, and of garments, and of all sort of possessions, to
   the orphan and to the widow.

      How We Ought to Assemble Together, and to Celebrate the Festival Day of
      Our Saviour's Resurrection.

   XXX. On the day of the resurrection of the Lord, [3466] that is, the
   Lord's day, assemble yourselves together, without fail, giving thanks
   to God, and praising Him for those mercies God has bestowed upon you
   through Christ, and has delivered you from ignorance, error, and
   bondage, that your sacrifice may be unspotted, and acceptable to God,
   who has said concerning His universal Church: "In every place shall
   incense and a pure sacrifice be offered unto me; for I am a great King,
   saith the Lord Almighty, and my name is wonderful among the heathen."
   [3467]

      What Qualifications They Ought to Have Who are to Be Ordained.

   XXXI. Do you first ordain bishops worthy of the Lord, [3468] and
   presbyters and deacons, pious men, righteous, meek, free from the love
   of money, lovers of truth, approved, holy, not accepters of persons,
   who are able to teach the word of piety, and rightly dividing the
   doctrines of the Lord. [3469] And do ye honour such as your fathers, as
   your lords, as your benefactors, as the causes of your well-being.
   Reprove ye one another, not in anger, but in mildness, with kindness
   and peace. Observe all things that are commanded you by the Lord. Be
   watchful for your life. [3470] "Let your loins be girded about, and
   your lights burning, and ye like unto men who wait for their Lord, when
   He will come, at even, or in the morning, or at cock-crowing, or at
   midnight. For at what hour they think not, the Lord will come; and if
   they open to Him, blessed are those servants, because they were found
   watching. For He will gird Himself, and will make them to sit down to
   meat, and will come forth and serve them." [3471] Watch therefore, and
   pray, that ye do not sleep unto death. For your former good deeds will
   not profit you, if at the last part of your life you go astray from the
   true faith.

      A Prediction Concerning Futurities.

   XXXII. For in the last days false prophets shall be multiplied, and
   such as corrupt the word; and the sheep shall be changed into wolves,
   and love into hatred: for through the abounding of iniquity the love of
   many shall wax cold. For men shall hate, and persecute, and betray one
   another. And then shall appear the deceiver of the world, the enemy of
   the truth, the prince of lies, [3472] whom the Lord Jesus "shall
   destroy with the spirit of His mouth, who takes away the wicked with
   His lips; and many shall be offended at Him. But they that endure to
   the end, the same shall be saved. And then shall appear the sign of the
   Son of man in heaven;" [3473] and afterwards shall be the voice of a
   trumpet by the archangel; [3474] and in that interval shall be the
   revival of those that were asleep. And then shall the Lord come, and
   all His saints with Him, [3475] with a great concussion above the
   clouds, with the angels of His power, [3476] in the throne of His
   kingdom, to condemn the devil, the deceiver of the world, and to render
   to every one according to his deeds. "Then shall the wicked go away
   into everlasting punishment, but the righteous shall go into life
   eternal," [3477] to inherit those things "which eye hath not seen, nor
   ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, such things as God
   hath prepared for them that love Him;" [3478] and they shall rejoice in
   the kingdom of God, which is in Christ Jesus. Since we are vouchsafed
   such great blessings from Him, let us become His suppliants, and call
   upon Him by continual prayer, and say:--

      A Prayer Declarative of God's Various Providence.

   XXXIII. Our eternal Saviour, the King of gods, who alone art almighty,
   and the Lord, the God of all beings, and the God of our holy and
   blameless fathers, and of those before us; the God of Abraham, and of
   Isaac, and of Jacob; who art merciful and compassionate,
   long-suffering, and abundant in mercy; to whom every heart is naked,
   and by whom every heart is seen, and to whom every secret thought is
   revealed: to Thee do the souls of the righteous cry aloud, upon Thee do
   the hopes of the godly trust, Thou Father of the blameless, Thou hearer
   of the supplication of those that call upon Thee with uprightness, and
   who knowest the supplications that are not uttered: for Thy providence
   reaches as far as the inmost parts of mankind; and by Thy knowledge
   Thou searchest the thoughts of every one, and in every region of the
   whole earth the incense of prayer and supplication is sent up to Thee.
   O Thou who hast appointed this present world as a place of combat to
   righteousness, and hast opened to all the gate of mercy, and hast
   demonstrated to every man by implanted knowledge, and natural judgment,
   and the admonitions of the law, how the possession of riches is not
   everlasting, the ornament of beauty is not perpetual, our strength and
   force are easily dissolved; and that all is vapour and vanity; and that
   only the good conscience of faith unfeigned passes through the midst of
   the heavens, and returning with truth, takes hold of the right hand of
   the joy [3479] which is to come. And withal, before the promise of the
   restoration of all things is accomplished, the soul itself exults in
   hope, and is joyful. For from that truth which was in our forefather
   Abraham, when he changed his way Thou didst guide him by a vision, and
   didst teach him what kind of state this world is; and knowledge went
   before his faith, and faith was the consequence of his knowledge; and
   the covenant did follow after his faith. For Thou saidst: "I will make
   thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is by the
   seashore." [3480] Moreover, when Thou hadst given him Isaac, and
   knewest him to be like him in his mode of life, Thou wast then called
   his God, saying: "I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee."
   [3481] And when our father Jacob was sent into Mesopotamia, Thou
   showedst him Christ, and by him speakest, saying: "Behold, I am with
   thee, and I will increase thee, and multiply thee exceedingly." [3482]
   And so spakest Thou to Moses, Thy faithful and holy servant, at the
   vision of the bush: "I am He that is; this is my name for ever, and my
   memorial for generations of generations." [3483] O Thou great protector
   of the posterity of Abraham, Thou art blessed for ever.

      A Prayer Declarative of God's Various Creation.

   XXXIV. Thou art blessed, O Lord, the King of ages, who by Christ hast
   made the whole world, and by Him in the beginning didst reduce into
   order the disordered parts; who dividedst the waters from the waters by
   a firmament, and didst put into them a spirit of life; who didst fix
   the earth, and stretch out the heaven, and didst dispose every creature
   by an accurate constitution. For by Thy power, O Lord, the world is
   beautified, the heaven is fixed as an arch over us, and is rendered
   illustrious with stars for our comfort in the darkness. The light also
   and the sun were begotten for days and the production of fruit, and the
   moon for the change of seasons, by its increase and diminutions; and
   one was called Night, and the other Day. And the firmament was
   exhibited in the midst of the abyss, and Thou commandedst the waters to
   be gathered together, and the dry land to appear. But as for the sea
   itself, who can possibly describe it, which comes with fury from the
   ocean, yet runs back again, being stopped by the sand at Thy command?
   For Thou hast said: "Thereby shall her waves be broken." [3484] Thou
   hast also made it capable of supporting little and great creatures, and
   made it navigable for ships. Then did the earth become green, and was
   planted with all sorts of flowers, and the variety of several trees;
   and the shining luminaries, the nourishers of those plants, preserve
   their unchangeable course, and in nothing depart from Thy command. But
   where Thou biddest them, there do they rise and set for signs of the
   seasons and of the years, making a constant return of the work of men.
   Afterwards the kinds of the several animals were created--those
   belonging to the land, to the water, to the air, and both to air and
   water; and the artificial wisdom of Thy providence does still impart to
   every one a suitable providence. For as He was not unable to produce
   different kinds, so neither has He disdained to exercise a different
   providence towards every one. And at the conclusion of the creation
   Thou gavest direction to Thy Wisdom, and formedst a reasonable creature
   as the citizen of the world, saying, "Let us make man after our image,
   and after our likeness;" [3485] and hast exhibited him as the ornament
   of the world, and formed him a body out of the four elements, those
   primary bodies, but hadst prepared a soul out of nothing, and
   bestowedst upon him his five senses, and didst set over his sensations
   a mind as the conductor of the soul. And besides all these things, O
   Lord God, who can worthily declare the motion of the rainy clouds, the
   shining of the lightning, the noise of the thunder, in order to the
   supply of proper food, and the most agreeable temperature of the air?
   But when man was disobedient, Thou didst deprive him of the life which
   should have been his reward. Yet didst Thou not destroy him for ever,
   but laidst him to sleep for a time; and Thou didst by oath call him to
   a resurrection, and loosedst the bond of death, O Thou reviver of the
   dead, through Jesus Christ, who is our hope.

      A Prayer, with Thanksgiving, Declarative of God's Providence Over the
      Beings He Has Made.

   XXXV. Great art thou, O Lord Almighty, and great is Thy power, and of
   Thy understanding there is no number. Our Creator and Saviour, rich in
   benefits, long-suffering, and the bestower of mercy, who dost not take
   away Thy salvation from Thy creatures: for Thou art good by nature, and
   sparest sinners, and invitest them to repentance; for admonition is the
   effect of Thy bowels of compassion. For how should we abide if we were
   required to come to judgment immediately, when, after so much
   long-suffering, we hardly get clear of our miserable condition? The
   heavens declare Thy dominion, and the earth shakes with earthquakes,
   and, hanging upon nothing, declares Thy unshaken stedfastness. The sea
   raging with waves, and feeding a flock of ten thousand creatures, is
   bounded with sand, as standing in awe at Thy command, and compels all
   men to dry out: "How great are Thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast Thou
   made them all: the earth is full of Thy creation." [3486] And the
   bright host of angels and the intellectual spirits say to Palmoni,
   [3487] "There is but one holy Being;" [3488] and the holy seraphim,
   together with the six-winged cherubim, who sing to Thee their triumphal
   song, cry out with never-ceasing voices, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
   hosts! heaven and earth are full of Thy glory;" [3489] and the other
   multitudes of the orders, angels archangels, thrones, dominions,
   principalities, authorities, and powers cry aloud, and say, "Blessed be
   the glory of the Lord out of His place." [3490] But Israel, Thy Church
   on earth, taken out of the Gentiles, emulating the heavenly powers
   night and day, with a full heart and a willing soul sings, "The chariot
   of God is ten thousandfold thousands of them that rejoice: the Lord is
   among them in Sinai, in the holy place." [3491] The heaven knows Him
   who fixed it as a cube of stone, in the form of an arch, upon nothing,
   who united the land and water to one another, and scattered the vital
   air all abroad, and conjoined fire therewith for warmth, and the
   comfort against darkness. The choir of stars strikes us with
   admiration, declaring Him that numbers them, and showing Him that names
   them; the animals declare Him that puts life into them; the trees show
   Him that makes them grow: all which creatures, being made by Thy word,
   show forth the greatness of Thy power. Wherefore every man ought to
   send up an hymn from his very soul to Thee, through Christ, in the name
   of all the rest, since He has power over them all by Thy appointment.
   For Thou art kind in Thy benefits, and beneficent in Thy bowels of
   compassion, who alone art almighty: for when Thou willest, to be able
   is present with Thee; for Thy eternal power both quenches flame, and
   stops the mouths of lions, and tames whales, and raises up the sick,
   and overrules the power of all things, and overturns the host of
   enemies, and casts down a people numbered in their arrogance. Thou art
   He who art in heaven, He who art on earth, He who art in the sea, He
   who art in finite things, Thyself unconfined by anything. For of Thy
   majesty there is no boundary; for it is not ours, O Lord, but the
   oracle of Thy servant, who said, "And thou shalt know in thine heart
   that the Lord thy God He is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath,
   and there is none other besides Thee:" [3492] for there is no God
   besides Thee alone, there is none holy besides Thee, the Lord, the God
   of knowledge, the God of the saints, holy above all holy beings; for
   they are sanctified by Thy hands. Thou art glorious, and highly
   exalted, invisible by nature, and unsearchable in Thy judgments; whose
   life is without want, whose duration can never alter or fail, whose
   operation is without toil, whose greatness is unlimited, whose
   excellency is perpetual, whose habitation is inaccessible, whose
   dwelling is unchangeable, whose knowledge is without beginning, whose
   truth is immutable, whose work is without assistants, whose dominion
   cannot be taken away, whose monarchy is without succession, whose
   kingdom is without end, whose strength is irresistible, whose army is
   very numerous: for Thou art the Father of wisdom, the Creator of the
   creation, by a Mediator, as the cause; the Bestower of providence, the
   Giver of laws, the Supplier of want, the Punisher of the ungodly, and
   the Rewarder of the righteous; the God and Father of Christ, and the
   Lord of those that are pious towards Him, whose promise is infallible,
   whose judgment without bribes, whose sentiments are immutable, whose
   piety is incessant, whose thanksgiving is everlasting, through whom
   [3493] adoration is worthily due to Thee from every rational and holy
   nature.

      A Prayer Commemorative of the Incarnation of Christ, and His Various
      Providence to the Saints.

   XXXVI. O Lord Almighty Thou hast created the world by Christ, and hast
   appointed the Sabbath in memory thereof, because that on that day Thou
   hast made us rest from our works, for the meditation upon Thy laws.
   Thou hast also appointed festivals for the rejoicing of our souls, that
   we might come into the remembrance of that wisdom which was created by
   Thee; how He submitted to be made of a woman on our account; [3494] He
   appeared in life, and demonstrated Himself in His baptism; how He that
   appeared is both God and man; He suffered for us by Thy permission, and
   died, and rose again by Thy power: on which account we solemnly
   assemble to celebrate the feast of the resurrection on the Lord's day,
   and rejoice on account of Him who has conquered death, and has brought
   life and immortality to light. For by Him Thou hast brought home the
   Gentiles to Thyself for a peculiar people, the true Israel beloved of
   God, and seeing God. For Thou O Lord, broughtest our fathers out of the
   land of Egypt, and didst deliver them out of the iron furnace, from
   clay and brick-making, and didst redeem them out of the hands of
   Pharaoh, and of those under him, and didst lead them through the sea as
   through dry land, and didst bear their manners in the wilderness, and
   bestow on them all sorts of good things. Thou didst give them the law
   or decalogue, which was pronounced by Thy voice and written with Thy
   hand. Thou didst enjoin the observation of the Sabbath, not affording
   them an occasion of idleness, but an opportunity of piety, for their
   knowledge of Thy power, and the prohibition of evils; having limited
   them as within an holy circuit for the sake of doctrine, for the
   rejoicing upon the seventh period. On this account was there appointed
   one week, and seven weeks, and the seventh month, and the seventh year,
   and the revolution of these, the jubilee, which is the fiftieth year
   for remission, that men might have no occasion to pretend ignorance.
   [3495] On this account He permitted men every Sabbath to rest, that so
   no one might be willing to send one word out of his mouth in anger on
   the day of the Sabbath. For the Sabbath is the ceasing of the creation,
   the completion of the world, the inquiry after laws, and the grateful
   praise to God for the blessings He has bestowed upon men. All which the
   Lord's day excels, [3496] and shows the Mediator Himself, the Provider,
   the Lawgiver, the Cause of the resurrection, the First-born of the
   whole creation, God the Word, and man, who was born of Mary alone,
   without a man, who lived holily, who was crucified under Pontius
   Pilate, and died, and rose again from the dead. So that the Lord's day
   commands us to offer unto Thee, O Lord, thanksgiving for all. [3497]
   For this is the grace afforded by Thee, which on account of its
   greatness has obscured all other blessings.

      A Prayer Containing the Memorial of His Providence, and an Enumeration of
      the Various Benefits Afforded the Saints by the Providence of God Through
      Christ.

   XXXVII. Thou who hast fulfilled Thy promises made by the prophets, and
   hast had mercy on Zion, and compassion on Jerusalem, by exalting the
   throne of David, Thy servant, in the midst of her, by the birth of
   Christ, who was born of his seed according to the flesh, of a virgin
   alone; do Thou now, O Lord God, accept the prayers which proceed from
   the lips of Thy people which are of the Gentiles, which call upon Thee
   in truth, as Thou didst accept of the gifts of the righteous in their
   generations. In the first place Thou did respect the sacrifice of Abel,
   [3498] and accept it as Thou didst accept of the sacrifice of Noah when
   he went out of the ark; [3499] of Abraham, when he went out of the land
   of the Chaldeans; [3500] of Isaac at the Well of the Oath; [3501] of
   Jacob in Bethel; [3502] of Moses in the desert; [3503] of Aaron between
   the dead and the living; [3504] of Joshua the son of Nun in Gilgal;
   [3505] of Gideon at the rock, and the fleeces, before his sin; [3506]
   of Manoah and his wife in the field; of Samson in his thirst before the
   transgression; [3507] of Jephtha in the war before his rash vow; of
   Barak and Deborah in the days of Sisera; [3508] of Samuel in Mizpeh;
   [3509] of David in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite; [3510] of
   Solomon in Gibeon and in Jerusalem: [3511] of Elijah in Mount Carmel;
   [3512] of Elisha at the barren fountain; [3513] of Jehoshaphat in war;
   [3514] of Hezekiah in his sickness, and concerning Sennacherib; [3515]
   of Manasseh in the land of the Chaldeans, after his transgression;
   [3516] of Josiah in Phassa; [3517] of Ezra at the return; [3518] of
   Daniel in the den of lions; [3519] of Jonah in the whale's belly;
   [3520] of the three children in the fiery furnace; [3521] of Hannah in
   the tabernacle before the ark; [3522] of Nehemiah at the rebuilding of
   the walls; [3523] of Zerubbabel; of Mattathias and his sons in their
   zeal; [3524] of Jael in blessings. Now also do Thou receive the prayers
   of Thy people which are offered to Thee with knowledge, through Christ
   in the Spirit.

      A Prayer for the Assistance of the Righteous.

   XXXVIII. We give Thee thanks for all things, O Lord Almighty, that Thou
   hast not taken away Thy mercies and Thy compassions from us; but in
   every succeeding generation Thou dost save, and deliver, and assist,
   and protect: for Thou didst assist in the days of Enos and Enoch, in
   the days of Moses and Joshua, in the days of the judges, in the days of
   Samuel and of Elijah and of the prophets, in the days of David and of
   the kings, in the days of Esther and Mordecai, in the days of Judith,
   in the days of Judas Maccabeus and his brethren, and in our days hast
   Thou assisted us by Thy great High Priest, Jesus Christ Thy Son. For He
   has delivered us from the sword, and hath freed us from famine, and
   sustained us; has delivered us from sickness, has preserved us from an
   evil tongue. For all which things do we give Thee thanks through
   Christ, who has given us an articulate voice to confess withal, and
   added to it a suitable tongue as an instrument to modulate withal, and
   a proper taste, and a suitable touch, and a sight for contemplation,
   and the hearing of sounds, and the smelling of vapours, and hands for
   work, and feet for walking. And all these members dost Thou form from a
   little drop in the womb; and after the formation dost Thou bestow on it
   an immortal soul, and producest it into the light as a rational
   creature, even man. Thou hast instructed him by Thy laws, improved him
   by Thy statutes; and when Thou bringest on a dissolution for a while,
   Thou hast promised a resurrection. Wherefore what life is sufficient,
   what length of ages will be long enough, for men to be thankful? To do
   it worthily it is impossible, but to do it according to our ability is
   just and right. For Thou hast delivered us from the impiety of
   polytheism, and from the heresy of the murderers of Christ; Thou hast
   delivered us from error and ignorance; Thou hast sent Christ among men
   as a man, being the only begotten God; Thou hast made the Comforter to
   inhabit among us; Thou hast set angels over us; Thou hast put the devil
   to shame; Thou hast brought us into being when we were not. Thou takest
   care of us when made; Thou measurest out life to us; Thou affordest us
   food; Thou hast promised repentance. Glory and worship be to Thee for
   all these things, through Jesus Christ, [3525] now and ever, and
   through all ages. Amen. Meditate on these things, brethren; and the
   Lord be With you upon earth, and in the kingdom of His Father, who both
   sent Him, and has "delivered us by Him from the bondage of corruption
   into His glorious liberty;" [3526] and has promised life to those who
   through Him have believed in the God of the whole world.

    Sec. III.--On the Instruction of Catechumens, and Their Initiation into
    Baptism.

   Now, after what manner those ought to live that are initiated into
   Christ, and what thanksgivings they ought to send up to God through
   Christ, has been said in the foregoing directions. But it is reasonable
   not to leave even those who are not yet initiated without assistance.

      How the Catechumens are to Be Instructed in the Elements.

   XXXIX. Let him, therefore, who is to be taught the truth in regard to
   piety be instructed before his baptism in the knowledge of the
   unbegotten God, in the understanding of His only begotten Son, in the
   assured acknowledgment of the Holy Ghost. Let him learn the order of
   the several parts of the creation, the series of providence, the
   different dispensations of Thy laws. Let him be instructed why the
   world was made, and why man was appointed to be a citizen therein; let
   him also know his own nature, of what sort it is; let him be taught how
   God punished the wicked with water and fire, and did glorify the saints
   in every generation--I mean Seth, and Enos, and Enoch, and Noah, and
   Abraham and his posterity, and Melchizedek, and Job, and Moses, and
   Joshua, and Caleb, and Phineas the priest, and those that were holy in
   every generation; and how God still took care of and did not reject
   mankind, but called them from their error and vanity to the
   acknowledgment of the truth at various seasons, reducing them from
   bondage and impiety unto liberty and piety, from injustice to
   righteousness, from death eternal to everlasting life. Let him that
   offers himself to baptism learn these and the like things during the
   time that he is a catechumen; and let him who lays his hands upon him
   adore God, the Lord of the whole world, and thank Him for His creation,
   for His sending Christ His only begotten Son, that He might save man by
   blotting out his transgressions, and that He might remit ungodliness
   and sins, and might "purify him from all filthiness of flesh and
   spirit," [3527] and sanctify man according to the good pleasure of His
   kindness, that He might inspire him with the knowledge of His will, and
   enlighten the eyes of his heart to consider of His wonderful works, and
   make known to him the judgments of righteousness, that so he might hate
   every way of iniquity, and walk in the way of truth, that he might be
   thought worthy of the laver of regeneration, to the adoption of sons,
   which is in Christ, that "being planted together in the likeness of the
   death of Christ," [3528] in hopes of a glorious communication, he may
   be mortified to sin, and may live to God, as to his mind, and word, and
   deed, and may be numbered together in the book of the living. And after
   this thanksgiving, let him instruct him in the doctrines concerning our
   Lord's incarnation, and in those concerning His passion, and
   resurrection from the dead, and assumption.

      A Constitution How the Catechumens are to Be Blessed by the Priests in
      Their Initiation, and What Things are to Be Taught Them.

   XL. And when it remains that the catechumen is to be baptized, let him
   learn what concerns the renunciation of the devil, and the joining
   himself with Christ; for it is fit that he should first abstain from
   things contrary, and then be admitted to the mysteries. He must
   beforehand purify his heart from all wickedness of disposition, from
   all spot and wrinkle, and then partake of the holy things; for as the
   skilfullest husbandman does first purge his ground of the thorns which
   are grown up therein, and does then sow his wheat, so ought you also to
   take away all impiety from them, and then to sow the seeds of piety in
   them, and vouchsafe them baptism. For even our Lord did in this manner
   exhort us, saying first, "Make disciples of all nations;" [3529] and
   then He adds this, "and baptize them into the name of the Father, and
   of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Let, therefore, the candidate for
   baptism declare thus in his renunciation: [3530] --

      The Renunciation of the Adversary, and the Dedication to the Christ of
      God.

   XLI. I renounce Satan, and his works, and his pomps, and his worships,
   and his angels, and his inventions, and all things that are under him.
   And after his renunciation let him in his consociation say: And I
   associate myself to Christ, and believe, and am baptized into one
   unbegotten Being, the only true God Almighty, the Father of Christ, the
   Creator and Maker of all things, from whom are all things; and into the
   Lord Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son, the First-born of the whole
   creation, who before the ages was begotten by the good pleasure of the
   Father, by whom all things were made, both those in heaven and those on
   earth, visible and invisible; who in the last days descended from
   heaven, and took flesh, and was born of the holy Virgin Mary, and did
   converse holily according to the laws of His God and Father, and was
   crucified under Pontius Pilate, and died for us, and rose again from
   the dead after His passion the third day, and ascended into the
   heavens, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father, and again is to
   come at the end of the world with glory to judge the quick and the
   dead, of whose kingdom there shall be no end. And I am baptized into
   the Holy Ghost, that is, the Comforter, who wrought in all the saints
   from the beginning of the world, but was afterwards sent to the
   apostles by the Father, according to the promise of our Saviour and
   Lord, Jesus Christ; and after the apostles, to all those that believe
   in the Holy Catholic Church; into the resurrection of the flesh, and
   into the remission of sins, and into the kingdom of heaven, and into
   the life of the world to come. And after this vow, he comes in order to
   the anointing with oil.

      A Thanksgiving Concerning the Anointing with the Mystical Oil.

   XLII. Now this is blessed by the high priest for the remission of sins,
   and the first preparation for baptism. For he calls thus upon the
   unbegotten God, the Father of Christ, the King of all sensible and
   intelligible natures, that He would sanctify the oil in the name of the
   Lord Jesus, and impart to it spiritual grace and efficacious strength,
   the remission of sins, and the first preparation for the confession of
   baptism, that so the candidate for baptism, when he is anointed may be
   freed from all ungodliness, and may become worthy of initiation,
   according to the command of the Only-begotten.

      A Thanksgiving Concerning the Mystical Water.

   XLIII. After this he comes to the water, and blesses and glorifies the
   Lord God Almighty, the Father of the only begotten God; [3531] and the
   priest returns thanks that He has sent His Son to become man on our
   account, that He might save us; that He has permitted that He should in
   all things become obedient to the laws of that incarnation, to preach
   the kingdom of heaven, the remission of sins, and the resurrection of
   the dead. Moreover, he adores the only begotten God Himself, after His
   Father, and for Him, giving Him thanks that He undertook to die for all
   men by the cross, the type of which He has appointed to be the baptism
   of regeneration. He glorifies Him also, for that God who is the Lord of
   the whole world, in the name of Christ and by His Holy Spirit, has not
   cast off mankind but has suited His providence to the difference of
   seasons: at first giving to Adam himself paradise for an habitation of
   pleasure, and afterwards giving a command on account of providence, and
   casting out the offender justly, but through His goodness not utterly
   casting him off, but instructing his posterity in succeeding ages after
   various manners; on whose account, in the conclusion of the world, He
   has sent His Son to become man for man's sake, and to undergo all human
   passions without sin. Him, therefore, let the priest even now call upon
   in baptism, and let him say: Look down from heaven, and sanctify this
   water, and give it grace and power, that so he that is to be baptized,
   according to the command of Thy Christ, may be crucified with Him, and
   may die with Him, and may be buried with Him, and may rise with Him to
   the adoption which is in Him, that he may be dead to sin and live to
   righteousness. And after this, when he has baptized him in the name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, he shall anoint him
   with ointment, and shall add as follows:--

      A Thanksgiving Concerning the Mystical Ointment.

   XLIV. O Lord God, who art without generation, and without a superior,
   the Lord of the whole world, who hast scattered the sweet odour of the
   knowledge of the Gospel among all nations, do Thou grant at this time
   that this ointment may be efficacious upon him that is baptized, that
   so the sweet odour of Thy Christ may continue upon him firm and fixed;
   and that now he has died with Him, he may arise and live with Him. Let
   him say these and the like things, for this is the efficacy of the
   laying on of hands on every one; for unless there be such a recital
   made by a pious priest over every one of these, the candidate for
   baptism does only descend into the water as do the Jews, and he only
   puts off the filth of the body, not the filth of the soul. After this
   let him stand up, and pray that prayer which the Lord taught us. But,
   of necessity, he who is risen again ought to stand up and pray, because
   he that is raised up stands upright. Let him, therefore, who has been
   dead with Christ, and is raised up with Him, stand up. But let him pray
   towards the east. [3532] For this also is written in the second book of
   the Chronicles, that after the temple of the Lord was finished by King
   Solomon, in the very feast of dedication the priests and the Levites
   and the singers stood up towards the east, praising and thanking God
   with cymbals and psalteries, and saying, "Praise the Lord, for He is
   good; for His mercy endureth for ever." [3533]

      A Prayer for the New Fruits.

   XLV. But let him pray thus after the foregoing prayer, and say: O God
   Almighty, the Father of Thy Christ, Thy only begotten Son, give me a
   body undefiled, a heart pure, a mind watchful, an unerring knowledge,
   the influence of the Holy Ghost for the obtaining and assured enjoying
   of the truth, through Thy Christ, by whom [3534] glory be to Thee, in
   the Holy Spirit, for ever. Amen. We have thought it reasonable to make
   these constitutions concerning the catechumens.

    Sec. IV.--Enumeration Ordained by Apostles.

      Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?

   XLVI. Now concerning those bishops which have been ordained in our
   lifetime, we let you know that they are these:--James the bishop of
   Jerusalem, the brother of our Lord; [3535] upon whose death the second
   was Simeon the son of Cleopas; after whom the third was Judas the son
   of James. Of Cæsarea of Palestine, the first was Zacchæus, who was once
   a publican; after whom was Cornelius, and the third Theophilus. Of
   Antioch, Euodius, ordained by me Peter; and Ignatius by Paul. Of
   Alexandria, Annianus was the first, ordained by Mark the evangelist;
   the second Avilius by Luke, who was also an evangelist. Of the church
   of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul;
   [3536] and Clemens, after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me
   Peter. [3537] Of Ephesus, Timotheus, ordained by Paul; and John, by me
   John. Of Smyrna, Aristo the first; after whom Stratæas the son of Lois;
   [3538] and the third Aristo. Of Pergamus, Gaius. Of Philadelphia,
   Demetrius, by me. Of Cenchrea, Lucius, by Paul. Of Crete, Titus. Of
   Athens, Dionysius. Of Tripoli in Phoenicia, Marathones. Of Laodicea in
   Phrygia, Archippus. [3539] Of Colossæ, Philemon. [3540] Of Borea in
   Macedonia, Onesimus, once the servant of Philemon. [3541] Of the
   churches of Galatia, Crescens. [3542] Of the parishes of Asia, Aquila
   and Nicetas. Of the church of Æginæ, Crispus. These are the bishops who
   are entrusted by us with the parishes in the Lord; whose doctrine keep
   ye always in mind, and observe our words. And may the Lord be with you
   now, and to endless ages, as Himself said to us when He was about to be
   taken up to His own God and Father. For says He, "Lo, I am with you all
   the days, until the end of the world. Amen." [3543]

   XLVII. "Glory be to God in the highest, and upon earth peace, good-will
   among men." [3544] We praise Thee, we sing hymns to Thee, we bless
   Thee; we glorify Thee, we worship Thee by Thy great High Priest; Thee
   who art the true God, who art the One Unbegotten, the only inaccessible
   Being. For Thy great glory, O Lord and heavenly King, O God the Father
   Almighty, O Lord God, [3545] the Father of Christ the immaculate Lamb,
   who taketh away the sin of the world, receive our prayer, Thou that
   sittest upon the cherubim. For Thou only art holy, Thou only art the

   [3546] We praise Thee, we sing hymns to Thee, we bless Thee for Thy
   great glory, O Lord our King, the Father of Christ the immaculate Lamb,
   who taketh away the sin of the world. Praise becomes Thee, hymns become
   Thee, glory becomes Thee, the God and Father, [3547] through the Son,
   in the most holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen. "Now, O Lord, lettest
   Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word; for mine eyes
   have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast prepared before the face of
   all people, a light for the revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory
   of Thy people Israel." [3548]

      A Prayer at Dinner.

   XLIX. Thou art blessed, O Lord, who nourishest me from my youth, who
   givest food to all flesh. Fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that
   having always what is sufficient for us, we may abound to every good
   work, in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom [3549] glory, honour, and
   power be to Thee for ever. Amen.

    General notice

   Comparing the Teaching with chapters xxv. and xxvi. of these
   Constitutions, it seems to me that the nature of the eucharistic
   (thanksgiving) prayers becomes apparent. They presuppose the formulas
   to be found in the eighth book of the Constitutions, [3550] and are
   such instructions as were imparted only to catechumens; the part
   peculiar to presbyters being withheld, of course, as esoteric
   mysteries, until further knowledge was canonically appropriate. See
   Elucidation IV. vol. vi. [287]p. 236; and in this volume, Elucidation
   I. [288]p. 382. The Bryennios ms. is cleared from nearly all
   difficulties by Dr. Riddle's lucid notes, when compared with
   corresponding passages in the Constitutions, or illustrated by such as
   are supplementary.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3544] Luke ii. 14.

   [3545] One V. ms. gives a more orthodox form to this prayer: "O Lord,
   only begotten Son, and Holy Spirit, Lord God, the Lamb of God, the Son
   of the Father, who takest away the sins of the world, receive our
   prayer. Thou who sittest at the right hand of the Father, have mercy
   upon us, for Thou only art holy; Thou only art Christ, Jesus Christ, to
   the glory of God the Father. Amen."

   [3546] Ps. cxiii. 1.

   [3547] One V. ms. omits "the God and;" then reads, "to Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost."

   [3548] Luke ii. 29., etc.

   [3549] One V. ms. reads, "with whom."

  Concerning Gifts, and Ordinations, and the Ecclesiastical Canons.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Sec. I.--On the Diversity of Spiritual Gifts.

      On Whose Account the Powers of Miracles are Performed.

   I. Jesus Christ, our God and Saviour, delivered to us the great mystery
   of godliness, and called both Jews and Gentiles to the acknowledgment
   of the one and only [3551] true God His Father, [3552] as Himself
   somewhere says, when He was giving thanks for the salvation of those
   that had believed, "I have manifested Thy name to men, I have finished
   the work Thou gavest me;" [3553] and said concerning us to His Father,
   "Holy Father, although the world has not known Thee, yet have I known
   Thee; and these have known Thee." [3554] With good reason did He say to
   all of us together, when we were perfected concerning those gifts which
   were given from Him by the Spirit: "Now these signs shall follow them
   that have believed in my name: they shall cast out devils; they shall
   speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink
   any deadly thing, it shall by no means hurt them: they shall lay their
   hands on the sick, and they shall recover." [3555] These gifts were
   first bestowed on us the apostles when we were about to preach the
   Gospel to every creature, and afterwards were of necessity afforded to
   those who had by our means believed; not for the advantage of those who
   perform them, but for the conviction of the unbelievers, that those
   whom the word did not persuade, the power of signs might put to shame:
   for signs are not for us who believe, but for the unbelievers, both for
   the Jews and Gentiles. For neither is it any profit to us to cast out
   demons, but to those who are so cleansed by the power of the Lord; as
   the Lord [3556] Himself somewhere instructs us, and shows, saying:
   "Rejoice ye, not because the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice,
   because your names are written in heaven." [3557] Since the former is
   done by His power, but this by our good disposition and diligence, yet
   (it is manifest) by His assistance. It is not therefore necessary that
   every one of the faithful should cast out demons, or raise the dead, or
   speak with tongues; but such a one only who is vouchsafed this gift,
   for some cause which may be advantage to the salvation of the
   unbelievers, who are often put to shame, not with the demonstration of
   the world, but by the power of the signs; that is, such as are worthy
   of salvation: for all the ungodly are not affected by wonders; and
   hereof God Himself is a witness, as when He says in the law: "With
   other tongues will I speak to this people, and with other lips, and yet
   will they by no means believe." [3558] For neither did the Egyptians
   believe in God, when Moses had done so many signs and wonders; [3559]
   nor did the multitude of the Jews believe in Christ, as they believed
   Moses, who yet had healed every sickness and every disease among them.
   [3560] Nor were the former shamed by the rod which was turned into a
   living serpent, nor by the hand which was made white with leprosy, nor
   by the river Nile turned into blood; nor the latter by the blind who
   recovered their sight, nor by the lame who walked, nor by the dead who
   were raised. [3561] The one was resisted by Jannes and Jambres, the
   other by Annas and Caiaphas. [3562] Thus signs do not shame all into
   belief, but only those of a good disposition; for whose sake also it is
   that God is pleased, as a wise steward of a family, to appoint miracles
   to be wrought, not by the power of men, but by His own will. Now we say
   these things, that those who have received such gifts may not exalt
   themselves against those who have not received them; such gifts, we
   mean, as are for the working of miracles. For otherwise there is no man
   who has believed in God through Christ, [3563] that has not received
   some spiritual gift: for this very thing, having been delivered from
   the impiety of polytheism, and having believed in God the Father
   through Christ, [3564] this is a gift of God. And the having cast off
   the veil of Judaism, and having believed that, by the good pleasure of
   God, His only begotten Son, who was before all ages, [3565] was in the
   last time born of a virgin, [3566] without the company of a man, and
   that He lived as a man, yet without sin, and fulfilled all that
   righteousness which is of the law; and that, by the permission of God,
   He who was God the Word endured the cross, and despised the shame; and
   that He died, and was buried, and rose within three days; and that
   after His resurrection, having continued forty days with His apostles,
   and completed His whole constitutions, He was taken up in their sight
   to His God and Father, who sent Him: he who has believed these things,
   not at random and irrationally, but with judgment and full assurance,
   has received the gift of God. So also has He who is delivered from
   every heresy. Let not, therefore, any one that works signs and wonders
   judge any one of the faithful who is not vouchsafed the same: for the
   gifts of God which are bestowed by Him through Christ are various; and
   one man receives one gift, and another another. For perhaps one has the
   word of wisdom, and another the word of knowledge; [3567] another,
   discerning of spirits; another, foreknowledge of things to come;
   another, the word of teaching; another, long-suffering; another,
   continence according to the law: for even Moses, the man of God, when
   he wrought signs in Egypt, did not exalt himself against his equals:
   and when he was called a god, he did not arrogantly despise his own
   prophet Aaron. [3568] Nor did Joshua the son of Nun, who was the leader
   of the people after him, though in the war with the Jebusites he had
   made the sun stand still over against Gibeon, and the moon over against
   the valley of Ajalon, [3569] because the day was not long enough for
   their victory, insult over Phineas or Caleb. Nor did Samuel, who had
   done so many surprising things, disregard David the beloved of God: yet
   they were both prophets, and the one was high priest, and the other was
   king. And when there were only seven thousand holy men in Israel who
   had not bowed the knee to Baal, [3570] Elijah alone among them, and his
   disciple Elisha, were workers of miracles. Yet neither did Elijah
   despise Obadiah the steward, who feared God, but wrought no signs; nor
   did Elisha despise his own disciple when he trembled at the enemies.
   [3571] Moreover, neither did the wise Daniel who was twice delivered
   from the mouths of the lions, nor the three children who were delivered
   from the furnace of fire, [3572] despise the rest of their
   fellow-Israelites: for they knew that they had not escaped these
   terrible miseries by their own might; but by the power of God did they
   both work miracles, and were delivered from miseries. Wherefore let
   none of you exalt himself against his brother, though he be a prophet,
   or though he be a worker of miracles: for if it happens that there be
   no longer an unbeliever, all the power of signs will thenceforwards be
   superfluous. For to be pious is from any one's good disposition; but to
   work wonders is from the power of Him that works them by us: the first
   of which respects ourselves; but the second respects God that works
   them, for the reasons which we have already mentioned. Wherefore
   neither let a king despise his officers that are under him, nor the
   rulers those who are subject. For where there are none to be ruled
   over, rulers are superfluous; and where there are no officers, the
   kingdom will not stand. Moreover, let not a bishop be exalted against
   his deacons and presbyters, nor the presbyters against the people: for
   the subsistence of the congregation depends on each other. For the
   bishops and the presbyters are the priests with relation to the people;
   and the laity are the laity with relation to the clergy. And to be a
   Christian is in our own power; but to be an apostle, or a bishop, or in
   any other such office, is not in our own power, but at the disposal of
   God, who bestows the gifts. And thus much concerning those who are
   vouchsafed gifts and dignities.

      Concerning Unworthy Bishops and Presbyters.

   II. We add, in the next place, that neither is every one that
   prophesies holy, nor every one that casts out devils religious: for
   even Balaam the son of Beor the prophet did prophesy, [3573] though he
   was himself ungodly; as also did Caiaphas, the falsely-named high
   priest. [3574] Nay, the devil foretells many things, and the demons,
   about Him; and yet for all that, there is not a spark of piety in them:
   for they are oppressed with ignorance, by reason of their voluntary
   wickedness. It is manifest, therefore, that the ungodly, although they
   prophesy, do not by their prophesying cover their own impiety; nor will
   those who cast out demons be sanctified by the demons being made
   subject to them: for they only mock one another, as they do who play
   childish tricks for mirth, and destroy those who give heed to them. For
   neither is a wicked king any longer a king, but a tyrant; nor is a
   bishop oppressed with ignorance or an evil disposition a bishop, but
   falsely so called, being not one sent out by God, but by men, as
   Ananiah and Samoeah in Jerusalem, and Zedekiah and Achiah the false
   prophets in Babylon. [3575] And indeed Balaam the prophet, when he had
   corrupted Israel by Baal-peor, suffered punishment; [3576] and Caiaphas
   at last was his own murderer; and the sons of Sceva, endeavouring to
   cast out demons, were wounded by them, and fled away in an unseemly
   manner; [3577] and the kings of Israel and of Judah, when they became
   impious, suffered all sorts of punishments. It is therefore evident how
   bishops and presbyters, also falsely so called, will not escape the
   judgment of God. For it will be said to them even now: "O ye priests
   that despise my name, [3578] I will deliver you up to the slaughter, as
   I did Zedekiah and Achiah, whom the king of Babylon fried in a
   frying-pan," as says Jeremiah the prophet. [3579] We say these things,
   not in contempt of true prophecies, for we know that they are wrought
   in holy men by the inspiration of God, but to put a stop to the
   boldness of vainglorious men; and add this withal, that from such as
   these God takes away His grace: for "God resisteth the proud, but
   giveth grace to the humble." [3580] Now Silas and Agabus prophesied in
   our times; [3581] yet did they not equal themselves to the apostles,
   nor did they exceed their own measures though they were beloved of God.
   Now women prophesied also. Of old, Miriam the sister of Moses and
   Aaron, [3582] and after her Deborah, [3583] and after these Huldah
   [3584] and Judith [3585] --the former under Josiah, the latter under
   Darius. The mother of the Lord did also prophesy, and her kinswoman
   Elisabeth, and Anna; [3586] and in our time the daughters of Philip;
   [3587] yet were not these elated against their husbands, but preserved
   their own measures. [3588] Wherefore if among you also there be a man
   or a woman, and such a one obtains any gift, let him be humble, that
   God may be pleased with him. For says He: "Upon whom will I look, but
   upon him that is humble and quiet, and trembles at my words?" [3589]

    Sec. II.--Election and Ordination of Bishops: Form of Service on Sundays.

      That to Make Constitutions About the Offices to Be Performed in the
      Churches is of Great Consequence.

   III. We have now finished the first part of this discourse concerning
   gifts, whatever they be, which God has bestowed upon men according to
   His own will; and how He rebuked the ways of those who either attempted
   to speak lies, or were moved by the spirit of the adversary; and that
   God often employed the wicked [3590] for prophecy and the performance
   of wonders. But now our discourse hastens as to the principal part,
   that is, the constitution of ecclesiastical affairs, that so, when ye
   have learned this constitution from us, ye who are ordained bishops by
   us at the command of Christ, may perform all things according to the
   commands delivered you, knowing that he that heareth us heareth Christ,
   and he that heareth Christ heareth His God and Father, [3591] to whom
   be glory for ever. Amen.

      Concerning Ordinations.

   IV. Wherefore we, the twelve apostles of the Lord, who are now
   together, give you in charge those divine constitutions concerning
   every ecclesiastical form, there being present with us Paul the chosen
   vessel, our fellow-apostle, and James the bishop, and the rest of the
   presbyters, and the seven deacons. [3592] In the first place,
   therefore, I Peter say, [3593] that a bishop to be ordained is to be,
   as we have already, all of us, appointed, unblameable in all things, a
   select person, [3594] chosen by the whole people, who, when he is named
   and approved, let the people assemble, with the presbytery and bishops
   that are present, on the Lord's day, and let them give their consent.
   And let the principal of the bishops ask the presbytery and people
   whether this be the person whom they desire for their ruler. And if
   they give their consent, let him ask further whether he has a good
   testimony from all men as to his worthiness for so great and glorious
   an authority; whether all things relating to his piety towards God be
   right; whether justice towards men has been observed by him; whether
   the affairs of his family have been well ordered by him; whether he has
   been unblameable in the course of his life. And if all the assembly
   together do according to truth, and not according to prejudice, witness
   that he is such a one, let them the third time, as before God the
   Judge, and Christ, the Holy Ghost being also present, as well as all
   the holy and ministering spirits, ask again whether he be truly worthy
   of this ministry, that so "in the mouth of two or three witnesses every
   word may be established." [3595] And if they agree the third time that
   he is worthy, let them all be demanded their vote; and when they all
   give it willingly, let them be heard. And silence being made, let one
   of the principal bishops, together with two others, stand near to the
   altar, the rest of the bishops and presbyters praying silently, and the
   deacons holding the divine Gospels open upon the head of him that is to
   be ordained, and say to God thus [3596] :--

      The Form of Prayer for the Ordination of a Bishop.

   V. O Thou the great Being, O Lord God Almighty, who alone art
   unbegotten, and ruled over by none; who always art, and wast before the
   world; who standest in need of nothing, and art above all cause and
   beginning; who only art true, who only art wise; who alone art the most
   high; who art by nature invisible; whose knowledge is without
   beginning; who only art good, and beyond compare; who knowest all
   things before they are; who art acquainted with the most secret things;
   who art inaccessible, and without a superior; the God and Father of Thy
   only begotten Son, of our God and Saviour; the Creator of the whole
   world by Him; whose providence provides for and takes the care of all;
   the Father of mercies, and God of all consolation; [3597] who dwellest
   in the highest heavens, [3598] and yet lookest down on things below:
   Thou who didst appoint the rules of the Church, by the coming of Thy
   Christ in the flesh; of which the Holy Ghost is the witness, by Thy
   apostles, and by us the bishops, who by Thy grace are here present; who
   hast fore-ordained priests from the beginning for the government of Thy
   people--Abel in the first place, Seth and Enos, and Enoch and Noah, and
   Melchisedec and Job; who didst appoint Abraham, and the rest of the
   patriarchs, with Thy faithful servants Moses and Aaron, and Eleazar and
   Phineas; who didst choose from among them rulers and priests in the
   tabernacle of Thy testimony; who didst choose Samuel for a priest and a
   prophet; who didst not leave Thy sanctuary without ministers; who didst
   delight in those whom Thou chosest to be glorified in. Do Thou, by us,
   pour down the influence of Thy free Spirit, through the mediation of
   Thy Christ, which is committed to Thy beloved Son Jesus Christ; which
   He bestowed according to Thy will on the holy apostles of Thee the
   eternal God. Grant by Thy name, O God, who searchest the hearts, that
   this Thy servant, whom Thou hast chosen to be a bishop, may feed Thy
   holy flock, and discharge the office of an high priest to Thee, and
   minister to Thee, unblameably night and day; that he may appease Thee,
   and gather together the number of those that shall be saved, and may
   offer to Thee the gifts of Thy holy Church. Grant to him, O Lord
   Almighty, through Thy Christ, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, that
   so he may have power to remit sins according to Thy command; to give
   forth lots according to Thy command; to loose every bond, according to
   the power which Thou gavest the apostles; that he may please Thee in
   meekness and a pure heart, with a stedfast, unblameable, and
   unreprovable mind; to offer to Thee a pure and unbloody sacrifice,
   which by Thy Christ Thou hast appointed as the mystery of the new
   covenant, for a sweet savour, through Thy holy child Jesus Christ, our
   God and Saviour, through whom [3599] glory, honour, and worship be to
   Thee in the Holy Spirit, now and always, and for all ages. And when he
   has prayed for these things, let the rest of the priests add, Amen; and
   together with them all the people. And after the prayer let one of the
   bishops elevate the sacrifice upon the hands of him that is ordained,
   and early in the morning let him be placed in his throne, in a place
   set apart for him among the rest of the bishops, they all giving him
   the kiss in the Lord. [3600] And after the reading of the Law [3601]
   and the Prophets, and our Epistles, and Acts, and the Gospels, let him
   that is ordained salute they Church, saying, The grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, the love of God and the Father, and the fellowship of the
   Holy Ghost, be with you all; and let them all answer, And with Thy
   Spirit. And after these words let him speak to the people the words of
   exhortation; and when he has ended his word of doctrine (I Andrew
   [3602] the brother of Peter speak), all standing up, let the deacon
   ascend upon some high seat, and proclaim, Let none of the hearers, let
   none of the unbelievers stay; and silence being made, let him say:--

Oxford Ms. [3603]

   V. God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and
   the God of all consolation, who knowest all things before they take
   place; Thou who didst appoint the rules of the Church through the word
   of Thy grace; who didst appoint beforehand the race righteous from the
   beginning that came from Abraham to be rulers, and didst constitute
   them priests, not leaving Thy sanctuary without ministers; who from the
   foundation of the world didst delight in those whom Thou chosest to be
   glorified in; and now pour down the influence of Thy free Spirit, which
   through Thy beloved Son Jesus Christ Thou hast bestowed on Thy holy
   apostles, who set up the Church in the place of the sanctuary, to
   unending glory and praise of Thy name: O Thou, who knowest the hearts
   of all, grant that this Thy servant whom Thou hast chosen to the holy
   office of Thy bishop, may discharge the duty of a high priest to Thee,
   and minister to Thee unblameably night and day; that he may appease
   Thee unceasingly, and present to Thee the gifts of Thy holy Church, and
   in the spirit of the high-priesthood have power to remit sins according
   to Thy commandment, to give lots according to Thy injunction, to loose
   every bond according to the power which Thou hast given to the
   apostles, and be well-pleasing to Thee, in meekness and a pure heart
   offering a smell of sweet savour through Thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
   with whom to Thee be glory, power, and honour, along with the Holy
   Spirit, now and for ever. Amen.

      The Divine Liturgy, Wherein is the Bidding Prayer for the Catechumens.

   VI. Ye catechumens, pray, and let all the faithful pray for them in
   their mind, saying: Lord, have mercy upon them. And let the deacon bid
   prayers for them, saving: Let us all pray unto God for the catechumens,
   that He that is good, He that is the lover of mankind, will mercifully
   hear their prayers and their supplications, and so accept their
   petitions as to assist them and give them those desires of their hearts
   which are for their advantage, and reveal to them the Gospel of His
   Christ; give them illumination and understanding, instruct them in the
   knowledge of God, teach them His commands and His ordinances, implant
   in them His pure and saving fear, open the ears of their hearts, that
   they may exercise themselves in His law day and night; strengthen them
   in piety, unite them to and number them with His holy flock; vouchsafe
   them the laver of regeneration, and the garment of incorruption, which
   is the true life; and deliver them from all ungodliness, and give no
   place to the adversary against them; "and cleanse them from all
   filthiness of flesh and spirit, and dwell in them, and walk in them, by
   His Christ; bless their goings out and their comings in, and order
   their affairs for their good." [3604] Let us still earnestly put up our
   supplications for them, that they may obtain the forgiveness of their
   transgressions by their admission, and so may be thought worthy of the
   holy mysteries, and of constant communion with the saints. Rise up, ye
   catechumens, beg for yourselves the peace of God through His Christ, a
   peaceable day, and free from sin, and the like for the whole time of
   your life, and your Christian ends of it; a compassionate and merciful
   God; and the forgiveness of your transgressions. Dedicate yourselves to
   the only unbegotten God, through His Christ. Bow down your heads, and
   receive the blessing. But at the naming of every one by the deacon, as
   we said before, let the people say, Lord, have mercy upon him; and let
   the children say it first. And as they have bowed down their heads, let
   the bishop who is newly ordained bless them with this blessing: O God
   Almighty, unbegotten and inaccessible, who only art the true God, the
   God and Father of Thy Christ, Thy only begotten Son; the God [3605] of
   the Comforter, and Lord of the whole world; who by Christ didst appoint
   Thy disciples to be teachers for the teaching of piety; do Thou now
   also look down upon Thy servants, who are receiving instruction in the
   Gospel of Thy Christ, and "give them a new heart, and renew a right
   spirit in their inward parts," [3606] that they may both know and do
   Thy will with full purpose of heart, and with a willing soul. Vouchsafe
   them an holy admission, and unite them to Thy holy Church, and make
   them partakers of Thy divine mysteries, through Christ, who is our
   hope, and who died for them; by whom glory and worship be given to Thee
   in the Holy Spirit for ever. Amen. And after this, let the deacon say:
   Go out, ye catechumens, in peace. And after they are gone out, let him
   say: Ye energumens, afflicted with unclean spirits, pray, and let us
   all earnestly pray for them, that God, the lover of mankind, will by
   Christ rebuke the unclean and wicked spirits, and deliver His
   supplicants from the dominion of the adversary. May He that rebuked the
   legion of demons, and the devil, the prince of wickedness, [3607] even
   now rebuke these apostates from piety, and deliver His own workmanship
   from his power, and cleanse those creatures which He has made with
   great wisdom. Let us still pray earnestly for them. Save them, O God,
   and raise them up by Thy power. Bow down your heads, ye energumens, and
   receive the blessings. And let the bishop add this prayer, and say:--

      For the Energumens.

   VII. Thou, who hast bound the strong man, and spoiled all that was in
   his house, who hast given us power over serpents and scorpions to tread
   upon them, and upon all the power of the enemy; [3608] who hast
   delivered the serpent, that murderer of men, bound to us, as a sparrow
   to children, whom all things dread, and tremble before the face of Thy
   power; [3609] who hast cast him down as lightning from heaven to earth,
   [3610] not with a fall from a place, but from honour to dishonour, on
   account of his voluntary evil disposition; whose look dries the
   abysses, and threatening melts the mountains, and whose truth remains
   for ever; whom the infants praise, and sucking babes bless; whom angels
   sing hymns to, and adore; who lookest upon the earth, and makest it
   tremble; who touchest the mountains, and they smoke; who threatenest
   the sea, and driest it up, and makest all its rivers as desert, and the
   clouds are the dust of His feet; who walkest upon the sea as upon the
   firm ground; [3611] Thou only begotten God, [3612] the Son of the great
   Father, rebuke these wicked spirits, and deliver the works of Thy hands
   from the power of the adverse spirit. For to Thee is due glory, honour,
   and worship, and by Thee to Thy Father, in the Holy Spirit, for ever.
   Amen. And let the deacon say: Go out, ye energumens. And after them,
   let him cry aloud: Ye that are to be illuminated, pray. Let all us, the
   faithful, earnestly pray for them, that the Lord will vouchsafe that,
   being initiated into the death of Christ, they may rise with Him, and
   become partakers of His kingdom, and may be admitted to the communion
   of His mysteries; unite them to, number them among, those that are
   saved in His holy Church. Save them, and raise them up by Thy grace.
   And being sealed to God through His Christ, let them bow down their
   heads, and receive this blessing from the bishop:--

      For the Baptized.

   VIII. Thou who hast formerly said by Thy holy prophets to those that be
   initiated, "Wash ye, become clean," [3613] and hast appointed spiritual
   regeneration by Christ, do Thou now also look down upon these that are
   baptized, and bless them, and sanctify them, and prepare them that they
   may become worthy of Thy spiritual gift, and of the true adoption of
   Thy spiritual mysteries, of being gathered together with those that are
   saved through Christ our Saviour; by whom glory, honour, and worship be
   to Thee, in the Holy Ghost, for ever. Amen. And let the deacon say: Go
   out, ye that are preparing for illumination. And after that let him
   proclaim: Ye penitents, pray; let us all earnestly pray for our
   brethren in the state of penitence, that God, the lover of compassion,
   will show them the way of repentance, and accept their return and their
   confession, and bruise Satan under their feet suddenly, [3614] and
   redeem them from the snare of the devil, and the ill-usage of the
   demons, and free them from every unlawful word, and every absurd
   practice and wicked thought; forgive them all their offences, both
   voluntary and involuntary, and blot out that handwriting which is
   against them, [3615] and write them in the book of life; [3616] cleanse
   them from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, [3617] and restore and
   unite them to His holy flock. For He knoweth our frame. For who can
   glory that he has a clean heart? And who can boldly say, that he is
   pure from sin? [3618] For we are all among the blameworthy. Let us
   still pray for them more earnestly, for there is joy in heaven over one
   sinner that repenteth, [3619] that, being converted from every evil
   work, they may be joined to all good practice; that God, the lover of
   mankind, will suddenly accept their petitions, will restore [3620] to
   them the joy of His salvation, and strengthen them with His free
   Spirit; [3621] that they may not be any more shaken, [3622] but be
   admitted to the communion of His most holy things, and become partakers
   of His divine mysteries, that appearing worthy of His adoption, they
   may obtain eternal life. Let us all still earnestly say on their
   account: Lord, have mercy upon them. Save them, O God, and raise them
   up by Thy mercy. Rise up, and bow your heads to God through His Christ,
   and receive the blessings. Let the bishop then add this prayer:--

      Imposition of Hands; Prayer for PenItents.

   IX. Almighty, eternal God, Lord of the whole world, the Creator and
   Governor of all things, who hast exhibited man as the ornament of the
   world through Christ, and didst give him a law both naturally implanted
   and written, that he might live according to law, as a rational
   creature; and when he had sinned, Thou gavest him Thy goodness as a
   pledge in order to his repentance: Look down upon these persons who
   have bended the neck of their soul and body to Thee; for Thou desirest
   not the death of a sinner, but his repentance, that he turn from his
   wicked way, and live. [3623] Thou who didst accept the repentance of
   the Ninevites, who willest that all men be saved, and come to the
   acknowledgment of the truth; [3624] who didst accept of that son who
   had consumed his substance in riotous living, [3625] with the bowels of
   a father, on account of his repentance; do Thou now accept of the
   repentance of Thy supplicants: for there is no man that will not sin;
   for "if Thou, O Lord, markest iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? For
   with Thee there is propitiation." [3626] And do Thou restore them to
   Thy holy Church, into their former dignity and honour, through Christ
   our God and Saviour, by whom glory and adoration be to Thee, in the
   Holy Ghost, for ever. Amen. Then let the deacon say, Depart, ye
   penitents; and let him add, Let none of those who ought not to come
   draw near. All we of the faithful, let us bend our knee: let us all
   entreat God through His Christ; let us earnestly beseech God through
   His Christ.

      The Bidding Prayer for the Faithful.

   X. Let us pray for the peace and happy settlement of the world, and of
   the holy churches; that the God of the whole world may afford us His
   everlasting peace, and such as may not be taken away from us; that He
   may preserve us in a full prosecution of such virtue as is according to
   godliness. Let us pray for the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church which
   is spread from one end of the earth to the other; that God would
   preserve and keep it unshaken, and free from the waves of this life,
   until the end of the world, as founded upon a rock; and for the holy
   parish in this place, that the Lord of the whole world may vouchsafe us
   without failure to follow after His heavenly hope, and without ceasing
   to pay Him the debt of our prayer. Let us pray for every episcopacy
   which is under the whole heaven, of those that rightly divide the word
   of Thy truth. And let us pray for our bishop James, [3627] and his
   parishes; let us pray for our bishop Clement, and his parishes; let us
   pray for our bishop Euodius, and his parishes; let us pray for our
   bishop Annianus, and his parishes: that the compassionate God may grant
   them to continue in His holy churches in health, honour, and long life,
   and afford them an honourable old age in godliness and righteousness.
   And let us pray for our presbyters, that the Lord may deliver them from
   every unreasonable and wicked action, and afford them a presbyterate in
   health and honour. Let us pray for all the deacons and ministers in
   Christ, that the Lord may grant them an unblameable ministration. Let
   us pray for the readers, singers, virgins, widows, and orphans. Let us
   pray for those that are in marriage and in child-bearing, that the Lord
   may have mercy upon them all. Let us pray for the eunuchs who walk
   holily. Let us pray for those in a state of continence and piety. Let
   us pray for those that bear fruit in the holy Church, and give alms to
   the needy. And let us pray for those who offer sacrifices and oblations
   to the Lord our God, that God, the fountain of all goodness, may
   recompense them with His heavenly gifts, and "give them in this world
   an hundredfold, and in the world to come life everlasting;" [3628] and
   bestow upon them for their temporal things, those that are eternal; for
   earthly things, those that are heavenly. Let us pray for our brethren
   newly enlightened, that the Lord may strengthen and confirm them. Let
   us pray for our brethren exercised with sickness, that the Lord may
   deliver them from every sickness and every disease, and restore them
   sound into His holy Church. Let us pray for those that travel by water
   or by land. Let us pray for those that are in the mines, in
   banishments, in prisons, and in bonds, for the name of the Lord. Let us
   pray for those that are afflicted with bitter servitude. Let us pray
   for our enemies, and those that hate us. Let us pray for those that
   persecute us for the name of the Lord, that the Lord may pacify their
   anger, and scatter their wrath against us. Let us pray for those that
   are without, and are wandered out of the way, that the Lord may convert
   them. Let us be mindful of the infants of the Church, that the Lord may
   perfect them in His fear, and bring them to a complete age. Let us pray
   one for another, that the Lord may keep us and preserve us by His grace
   to the end, and deliver us from the evil one. and from all the scandals
   of those that work iniquity, and preserve us unto His heavenly kingdom.
   Let us pray for every Christian soul. Save us, and raise us up, O God,
   by Thy mercy. Let us rise up, and let us pray earnestly, and dedicate
   ourselves and one another to the living God, through His Christ. And
   let the high priest add this prayer, and say:--

      The Form of Prayer for the Faithful.

   XI. O Lord Almighty, the Most High, who dwellest on high, the Holy One,
   that restest among the saints, without beginning, the Only Potentate,
   who hast given to us by Christ the preaching of knowledge, to the
   acknowledgment of Thy glory and of Thy name, which He has made known to
   us, for our comprehension, do Thou now also look down through Him upon
   this Thy flock, and deliver it from all ignorance and wicked practice,
   and grant that we may fear Thee in earnest, and love Thee with
   affection, and have a due reverence of Thy glory. Be gracious and
   merciful to them, and hearken to them when they pray unto Thee; and
   keep them, that they may be unmoveable, unblameable, and unreprovable,
   that they may be holy in body and spirit, not having spot or wrinkle,
   or any such thing; but that they may be complete, and none of them may
   be defective or imperfect. O our support, our powerful God, who dost
   not accept persons, be Thou the assister of this Thy people, [3629]
   which Thou hast redeemed with the precious blood of Thy Christ; be Thou
   their protector, aider, provider, and guardian, their strong wall of
   defence, their bulwark and security. For "none can snatch out of Thy
   hand:" [3630] for there is no other God like Thee; for on Thee is our
   reliance. "Sanctify them by Thy truth: for Thy word is truth." [3631]
   Thou who dost nothing for favour, Thou whom none can deceive, deliver
   them from every sickness, and every disease, and every offence, every
   injury and deceit, "from fear of the enemy, from the dart that flieth
   in the day, from the mischief that walketh about in darkness;" [3632]
   and vouchsafe them that everlasting life which is in Christ Thy only
   begotten Son, our God and Saviour, through whom glory and worship be to
   Thee, in the Holy Spirit, now and always, and for ever and ever. Amen.
   And after this let the deacon say, Let us attend. And let the bishop
   salute the church, and say, The peace of God be with you all. And let
   the people answer, And with thy spirit; and let the deacon say to all,
   Salute ye one another with the holy kiss. And let the clergy salute the
   bishop, the men of the laity salute the men, the women the women. And
   let the children stand at the reading-desk; and let another deacon
   stand by them, that they may not be disorderly. [3633] And let other
   deacons walk about and watch the men and women, that no tumult may be
   made, and that no one nod, or whisper, or slumber; and let the deacons
   [3634] stand at the doors of the men, and the sub-deacons at those of
   the women, that no one go out, nor a door be opened, although it be for
   one of the faithful, at the time of the oblation. But let one of the
   sub-deacons bring water to wash the hands of the priests, which is a
   symbol of the purity of those souls that are devoted to God.

      The Constitution of James the Brother of John, the Son of Zebedee.

   XII. And I James, [3635] the brother of John, the son of Zebedee, say,
   that the deacon shall immediately say, Let none of the catechumens, let
   none of the hearers, let none of the unbelievers, let none of the
   heterodox, stay here. You who have prayed the foregoing prayer, depart.
   [3636] Let the mothers receive their children; let no one have anything
   against any one; let no one come in hypocrisy; let us stand upright
   before the Lord with fear and trembling, to offer. When this is done,
   let the deacons bring the gifts to the bishop at the altar; and let the
   presbyters stand on his right hand, and on his left, as disciples stand
   before their Master. But let two of the deacons, on each side of the
   altar, hold a fan, made up of thin membranes, or of the feathers of the
   peacock, or of fine cloth, and let them silently drive away the small
   animals that fly about, that they may not come near to the cups. Let
   the high priest, therefore, together with the priests, pray [3637] by
   himself; and let him put on his shining garment, and stand at the
   altar, and make the sign of the cross upon his forehead with his hand,
   [3638] and say: The grace of Almighty God, and the love of our Lord
   Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with you all.
   And let all with one voice say: And with thy spirit. The high priest:
   Lift up your mind. All the people: We lift it up unto the Lord. The
   high priest: Let us give thanks to the Lord. All the people: It is meet
   and right so to do. Then let the high priest say: It is very meet and
   right before all things to sing an hymn to Thee, who art the true God,
   who art before all beings, "from whom the whole family in heaven and
   earth is named;" [3639] who only art unbegotten, and without beginning,
   and without a ruler, and without a master; who standest in need of
   nothing; who art the bestower of everything that is good; who art
   beyond all cause and generation; who art alway and immutably the same;
   from whom all things came into being, as from their proper original.
   For Thou art eternal knowledge, everlasting sight, unbegotten hearing,
   untaught wisdom, the first by nature, and the measure of being, and
   beyond all number; who didst bring all things out of nothing into being
   by Thy only begotten Son, but didst beget Him before all ages by Thy
   will, Thy power, and Thy goodness, without any instrument, the only
   begotten Son, God the Word, the living Wisdom, "the First-born of every
   creature, the angel of Thy Great Counsel," [3640] and Thy High Priest,
   but the King and Lord of every intellectual and sensible nature, who
   was before all things, by whom were all things. For Thou, O eternal
   God, didst make all things by Him, and through Him it is that Thou
   vouchsafest Thy suitable providence over the whole world; for by the
   very same that Thou bestowedst being, didst Thou also bestow
   well-being: the God and Father of Thy only begotten Son, who by Him
   didst make before all things the cherubim and the seraphim, the æons
   and hosts, the powers and authorities, the principalities and thrones,
   the archangels and angels; and after all these, didst by Him make this
   visible world, and all things that are therein. For Thou art He who
   didst frame the heaven as an arch, and "stretch it out like the
   covering of a tent," [3641] and didst found the earth upon nothing by
   Thy mere will; who didst fix the firmament, and prepare the night and
   the day; who didst bring the light out of Thy treasures, and on its
   departure didst bring on darkness, for the rest of the living creatures
   that move up and down in the world; who didst appoint the sun in heaven
   to rule over the day, and the moon to rule over the night, and didst
   inscribe in heaven the choir of stars to praise Thy glorious majesty;
   who didst make the water for drink and for cleansing, the air in which
   we live for respiration and the affording of sounds, by the means of
   the tongue, which strikes the air, and the hearings which co-operates
   therewith, so as to perceive speech when it is received by it, and
   falls upon it; who madest fire for our consolation in darkness, for the
   supply of our want, and that we might be warmed and enlightened by it;
   who didst separate the great sea from the land, and didst render the
   former navigable and the latter fit for walking, and didst replenish
   the former with small and great living creatures, and filledst the
   latter with the same, both tame and wild; didst furnish it with various
   plants, and crown it with herbs, and beautify it with flowers, and
   enrich it with seeds; who didst ordain the great deep, and on every
   side madest a mighty cavity for it, which contains seas of salt waters
   heaped together, [3642] yet didst Thou every way bound them with
   barriers of the smallest sand; [3643] who sometimes dost raise it to
   the height of mountains by the winds, and sometimes dost smooth it into
   a plain; sometimes dost enrage it with a tempest, and sometimes dost
   still it with a calm, that it may be easy to seafaring men in their
   voyages; who didst encompass this world, which was made by Thee through
   Christ, with rivers, and water it with currents, and moisten it with
   springs that never fail, and didst bind it round with mountains for the
   immoveable and secure consistence of the earth: for Thou hast
   replenished Thy world, and adorned it with sweet-smelling and with
   healing herbs, with many and various living creatures, strong and weak,
   for food and for labour, tame and wild; with the noises of creeping
   things, the sounds of various sorts of flying creatures; with the
   circuits of the years, the numbers of months and days, the order of the
   seasons, the courses of the rainy clouds, for the production of the
   fruits and the support of living creatures. Thou hast also appointed
   the station of the winds, which blow when commanded by Thee, and the
   multitude of the plants and herbs. And Thou hast not only created the
   world itself, but hast also made man for a citizen of the world,
   exhibiting him as the ornament of the world; for Thou didst say to Thy
   Wisdom: "Let us make man according to our image, and according to our
   likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
   the fowls of the heaven." [3644] Wherefore also Thou hast made him of
   an immortal soul and of a body liable to dissolution--the former out of
   nothing, the latter out of the four elements--and hast given him as to
   his soul rational knowledge, the discerning of piety and impiety, and
   the observation of right and wrong; and as to his body, Thou hast
   granted him five senses and progressive motion: for Thou, O God
   Almighty, didst by Thy Christ plant a paradise in Eden, [3645] in the
   east, adorned with all plants fit for food, and didst introduce him
   into it, as into a rich banquet. And when Thou madest him, Thou gavest
   him a law implanted within him, that so he might have at home and
   within himself the seeds of divine knowledge; and when Thou hadst
   brought him into the paradise of pleasure, Thou allowedst him the
   privilege of enjoying all things, only forbidding the tasting of one
   tree, in hopes of greater blessings; that in case he would keep that
   command, he might receive the reward of it, which was immortality. But
   when he neglected that command, and tasted of the forbidden fruit, by
   the seduction of the serpent and the counsel of his wife, Thou didst
   justly cast him out of paradise.

   Yet of Thy goodness Thou didst not overlook him, nor suffer him to
   perish utterly, for he was Thy creature; but Thou didst subject the
   whole creation to him, and didst grant him liberty to procure himself
   food by his own sweat and labours, whilst Thou didst cause all the
   fruits of the earth to spring up, to grow, and to ripen. But when Thou
   hadst laid him asleep for a while, Thou didst with an oath call him to
   a restoration again, didst loose the bond of death, and promise him
   life after the resurrection. And not this only; but when Thou hadst
   increased his posterity to an innumerable multitude, those that
   continued with Thee Thou didst glorify, and those who did apostatize
   from Thee Thou didst punish. And while Thou didst accept of the
   sacrifice of Abel [3646] as of an holy person, Thou didst reject the
   gift of Cain, the murderer of his brother, as of an abhorred wretch.
   And besides these, Thou didst accept of Seth and Enos, [3647] and didst
   translate Enoch: [3648] for Thou art the Creator of men, and the giver
   of life, and the supplier of want, and the giver of laws, and the
   rewarder of those that observe them, and the avenger of those that
   transgress them; who didst bring the great flood upon the world by
   reason of the multitude of the ungodly, [3649] and didst deliver
   righteous Noah from that flood by an ark, [3650] with eight souls, the
   end of the foregoing generations, and the beginning of those that were
   to come; who didst kindle a fearful fire against the five cities of
   Sodom, and "didst turn a fruitful land into a salt lake for the
   wickedness of them that dwelt therein," [3651] but didst snatch holy
   Lot out of the conflagration. Thou art He who didst deliver Abraham
   from the impiety of his fore-fathers, and didst appoint him to be the
   heir of the world, and didst discover to him Thy Christ; who didst
   aforehand ordain Melchisedec an high priest for Thy worship; [3652] who
   didst render Thy patient servant Job the conqueror of that serpent who
   is the patron of wickedness; who madest Isaac the son of the promise,
   and Jacob the father of twelve sons, and didst increase his posterity
   to a multitude, and bring him into Egypt with seventy-five souls.
   [3653] Thou, O Lord, didst not overlook Joseph, but grantedst him, as a
   reward of his chastity for Thy sake, the government over the Egyptians.
   Thou, O Lord, didst not overlook the Hebrews when they were afflicted
   by the Egyptians, on account of the promises made unto their fathers;
   but Thou didst deliver them and punish the Egyptians. [3654] And when
   men had corrupted the law of nature, and had sometimes esteemed the
   creation the effect of chance, and sometimes honoured it more than they
   ought, and equalled it to the God of the universe, Thou didst not,
   however, suffer them to go astray, but didst raise up Thy holy servant
   Moses, and by him didst give the written law for the assistance of the
   law of nature, [3655] and didst show that the creation was Thy work,
   and didst banish away the error of polytheism. Thou didst adorn Aaron
   and his posterity with the priesthood, and didst punish the Hebrews
   when they sinned, and receive them again when they returned to Thee.
   Thou didst punish the Egyptians with a judgment of ten plagues, and
   didst divide the sea, and bring the Israelites through it, and drown
   and destroy the Egyptians who pursued after them. Thou didst sweeten
   the bitter water with wood; Thou didst bring water out of the rock of
   stone; Thou didst rain manna from heaven, and quails, as meat out of
   the air; Thou didst afford them a pillar of fire by night to give them
   light, and a pillar of a cloud by day to overshadow them from the heat;
   Thou didst declare Joshua to be the general of the army, and didst
   overthrow the seven nations of Canaan by him; [3656] Thou didst divide
   Jordan, and dry up the rivers of Etham; [3657] Thou didst overthrow
   walls without instruments or the hand of man. [3658] For all these
   things, glory be to Thee, O Lord Almighty. Thee do the innumerable
   hosts of angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities,
   authorities, and powers, Thine everlasting armies, adore. The cherubim
   and the six-winged seraphim, with twain covering their feet, with twain
   their heads, and with twain flying, [3659] say, together with thousand
   thousands of archangels, and ten thousand times ten thousand of angels,
   [3660] incessantly, and with constant and loud voices, and let all the
   people say it with them: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord of hosts, heaven and
   earth are full of His glory: be Thou blessed for ever. Amen." [3661]
   And afterwards let the high priest say: For Thou art truly holy, and
   most holy, the highest and most highly exalted for ever. Holy also is
   Thy only begotten Son our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, who in all things
   ministered to His God and Father, both in Thy various creation and Thy
   suitable providence, and has not overlooked lost mankind. But after the
   law of nature, after the exhortations in the positive law, after the
   prophetical reproofs and the government of the angels, when men had
   perverted both the positive law and that of nature, and had cast out of
   their mind the memory of the flood, the burning of Sodom, the plagues
   of the Egyptians, and the slaughters of the inhabitant of Palestine,
   and being just ready to perish universally after an unparalleled
   manner, He was pleased by Thy good will to become man, who was man's
   Creator; to be under the laws, who was the Legislator; to be a
   sacrifice, who was an High Priest; to be a sheep, who was the Shepherd.
   And He appeased Thee, His God and Father, and reconciled Thee to the
   world, and freed all men from the wrath to come, and was made of a
   virgin, and was in flesh, being God the Word, the beloved Son, the
   first-born of the whole creation, and was, according to the prophecies
   which were foretold concerning Him by Himself, of the seed of David and
   Abraham, of the tribe of Judah. And He was made in the womb of a
   virgin, who formed all mankind that are born into the world; He took
   flesh, who was without flesh; He who was begotten before time, was born
   in time; He lived holily, and taught according to the law; He drove
   away every sickness and every disease from men, and wrought signs and
   wonders among the people; and He was partaker of meat, and drink, and
   sleep, who nourishes all that stand in need of food, and "fills every
   living creature with His goodness;" [3662] "He manifested His name to
   those that knew it not;" [3663] He drave away ignorance; He revived
   piety, and fulfilled Thy will; He finished the work which Thou gavest
   Him to do; and when He had set all these things right, He was seized by
   the hands of the ungodly, of the high priests and priests, falsely so
   called, and of the disobedient people, by the betraying of him who was
   possessed of wickedness as with a confirmed disease; He suffered many
   things from them, and endured all sorts of ignominy by Thy permission;
   He was delivered to Pilate the governor, and He that was the Judge was
   judged, and He that was the Saviour was condemned; He that was
   impassible was nailed to the cross, and He who was by nature immortal
   died, and He that is the giver of life was buried, that He might loose
   those for whose sake He came from suffering and death, and might break
   the bonds of the devil, and deliver mankind from his deceit. He arose
   from the dead the third day; and when He had continued with His
   disciples forty days, He was taken up into the heavens, and is sat down
   on the right hand of Thee, who art His God and Father.

   Being mindful, therefore, of those things that He endured for our
   sakes, we give Thee thanks, O God Almighty, not in such a manner as we
   ought, but as we are able, and fulfil His constitution: "For in the
   same night that He was betrayed, He took bread" [3664] in His holy and
   undefiled hands, and, looking up to Thee His God and Father, "He brake
   it, and gave it to His disciples, saying, This is the mystery of the
   new covenant: take of it, and eat. This is my body, which is broken for
   many, for the remission of sins." [3665] In like manner also "He took
   the cup," and mixed it of wine and water, and sanctified it, and
   delivered it to them, saying: "Drink ye all of this; for this is my
   blood which is shed for many, for the remission of sins: do this in
   remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this
   cup, ye do show forth my death until I come." Being mindful, therefore,
   of His passion, and death, and resurrection from the dead, and return
   into the heavens, and His future second appearing, wherein He is to
   come with glory and power to judge the quick and the dead, and to
   recompense to every one according to his works, we offer to Thee, our
   King and our God, according to His constitution, this bread and this
   cup, giving Thee thanks, through Him, that Thou hast thought us worthy
   to stand before Thee, and to sacrifice to Thee; and we beseech Thee
   that Thou wilt mercifully look down upon these gifts which are here set
   before Thee, O Thou God, who standest in need of none of our offerings.
   And do Thou accept them, to the honour of Thy Christ, and send down
   upon this sacrifice Thine Holy Spirit, the Witness of the Lord Jesus'
   sufferings, that He may show this bread to be the body of Thy Christ,
   and the cup to be the blood of Thy Christ, that those who are partakers
   thereof may be strengthened for piety, may obtain the remission of
   their sins, may be delivered from the devil and his deceit, may be
   filled with the Holy Ghost, may be made worthy of Thy Christ, and may
   obtain eternal life upon Thy reconciliation to them, O Lord Almighty.
   We further pray unto Thee, O Lord, for thy holy Church spread from one
   end of the world to another, which Thou hast purchased with the
   precious blood of Thy Christ, that Thou wilt preserve it unshaken and
   free from disturbance until the end of the world; for every episcopate
   who rightly divides the word of truth. We further pray to Thee for me,
   who am nothing, who offer to Thee, for the whole presbytery, for the
   deacons and all the clergy, that Thou wilt make them wise, and
   replenish them with the Holy Spirit. We further pray to Thee, O Lord,
   "for the king and all in authority," [3666] for the whole army, that
   they may be peaceable towards us, that so, leading the whole time of
   our life in quietness and unanimity, we may glorify Thee through Jesus
   Christ, who is our hope. We further offer to Thee also for all those
   holy persons who have pleased Thee from the beginning of the
   world--patriarch, prophets, righteous men, apostles, martyrs,
   confessors, bishops, presbyters, deacons, sub-deacons, readers,
   singers, virgins, widows, and lay persons, with all whose names Thou
   knowest. We further offer to Thee for this people, that Thou wilt
   render them, to the praise of Thy Christ, "a royal priesthood and an
   holy nation;" [3667] for those that are in virginity and purity; for
   the widows of the Church; for those in honourable marriage and
   child-bearing; for the infants of Thy people, that Thou wilt not permit
   any of us to "become castaways." We further beseech Thee also for this
   city and its inhabitants; for those that are sick; for those in bitter
   servitude; for those in banishments; for those in prison; for those
   that travel by water or by land; that Thou, the helper and assister of
   all men, wilt be their supporter. We further also beseech Thee for
   those that hate us and persecute us for Thy name's sake; for those that
   are without, and wander out of the way; that Thou wilt convert them to
   goodness, and pacify their anger. We further also beseech Thee for the
   catechumens of the Church, and for those that are vexed by the
   adversary, and for our brethren the penitents, that Thou wilt perfect
   the first in the faith, that Thou wilt deliver the second from the
   energy of the evil one, and that Thou wilt accept the repentance of the
   last, and forgive both them and us our offences. We further offer to
   Thee also for the good temperature of the air, and the fertility of the
   fruits, that so, partaking perpetually of the good things derived from
   Thee, we may praise Thee without ceasing, "who gavest food to all
   flesh." [3668] We further beseech Thee also for those who are absent on
   a just cause, that Thou wilt keep us all in piety, and gather us
   together in the kingdom of Thy Christ, the God of all sensible and
   intelligent nature, our King that Thou wouldst keep us immoveable,
   unblameable, and unreprovable: for to Thee belongs all glory and
   worship, and thanksgiving, honour and adoration, the Father, with the
   Son, and to the Holy Ghost, both now and always, and for everlasting,
   and endless ages for ever. And let all the people say, Amen. And let
   the bishop say, "The peace of God be with you all." And let all the
   people say, "And with thy spirit." And let the deacon proclaim again:--

      The Bidding Prayer for the Faithful After the Divine Oblation.

   XIII. Let us still further beseech God through His Christ, and let us
   beseech Him on account of the gift which is offered to the Lord God,
   that the good God will accept it, through the mediation of His Christ,
   upon His heavenly altar, for a sweet-smelling savour. Let us pray for
   this church and people. Let us pray for every episcopate, every
   presbytery, all the deacons and ministers in Christ, for the whole
   congregation, that the Lord will keep and preserve them all. Let us
   pray "for kings and those in authority," that they may be peaceable
   toward us, "that so we may have and lead a quiet and peaceable life in
   all godliness and honesty." [3669] Let us be mindful of the holy
   martyrs, that we may be thought worthy to be partakers of their trial.
   Let us pray for those that are departed in the faith. Let us pray for
   the good temperature of the air, and the perfect maturity of the
   fruits. Let us pray for those that are newly enlightened, that they may
   be strengthened in the faith, and all may be mutually comforted by one
   another. [3670] Raise us up, O God, by Thy grace. Let us stand up, and
   dedicate ourselves to God, through His Christ. And let the bishop say:
   O God, who art great, and whose name is great, who art great in counsel
   and mighty in works, the God and Father of Thy holy child Jesus, our
   Saviour; look down upon us, and upon this Thy flock, which Thou hast
   chosen by Him to the glory of Thy name; and sanctify our body and soul,
   and grant us the favour to be "made pure from all filthiness of flesh
   and spirit," [3671] and may obtain the good things laid up for us, and
   do not account any of us unworthy; but be Thou our comforter, helper,
   and protector, through Thy Christ, with whom glory, honour, praise,
   doxology, and thanksgiving be to Thee and to the Holy Ghost for ever.
   Amen. And after that all have said Amen, let the deacon say: Let us
   attend. And let the bishop speak thus to the people: Holy things for
   holy persons. And let the people answer: There is One that is holy;
   there is one Lord, one Jesus Christ, blessed for ever, to the glory of
   God the Father. Amen. "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
   good-will among men. Hosanna to the son of David! Blessed be He that
   cometh in the name of the Lord," being the Lord God who appeared to us,
   "Hosanna in the highest." [3672] And after that, let the bishop
   partake, then the presbyters, and deacons, and [3673] sub-deacons, and
   the readers, and the singers, and the ascetics; and then of the women,
   the deaconesses, and the virgins, and the widows; then the children;
   and then all the people in order, with reverence and godly fear,
   without tumult. And let the bishop give the oblation, saying, The body
   of Christ; and let him that receiveth say, Amen. And let the deacon
   take the cup; and when he gives it, say, The blood of Christ, the cup
   of life; and let him that drinketh say, Amen. [3674] And let the
   thirty-third psalm be said, while the rest are partaking; and when all,
   [3675] both men and women, have partaken, let the deacons carry what
   remains into the vestry. And when the singer has done, let the deacon
   say:--

      The Bidding Prayer After the Participation.

   XIV. Now we have received the precious body and the precious blood of
   Christ, let us give thanks to Him who has thought us worthy to partake
   of these His holy [3676] mysteries; and let us beseech Him that it may
   not be to us for condemnation, but for salvation, to the advantage of
   soul and body, to the preservation of piety, to the remission of sins,
   and to the life of the world to come. Let us arise, and by the grace of
   Christ let us dedicate ourselves to God, to the only unbegotten God,
   and to His Christ. And let the bishop give thanks:--

      The Form of Prayer After the Participation.

   XV. O Lord God Almighty, the Father of Thy Christ, Thy blessed Son, who
   hearest those who call upon Thee with uprightness, who also knowest the
   supplications of those who are silent; we thank Thee that Thou hast
   thought us worthy to partake of Thy holy mysteries, which Thou hast
   bestowed upon us, for the entire confirmation of those things we have
   rightly known, for the preservation of piety, for the remission of our
   offences; for the name of thy Christ is called upon us, and we are
   joined To Thee. O Thou that hast separated us froth the communion of
   the ungodly, unite us with those that are consecrated to Thee in
   holiness; confirm us in the truth, by the assistance of Thy Holy
   Spirit; reveal to us what things we are ignorant of, supply what things
   we are defective in, confirm us in what things we already know,
   preserve the priests blameless in Thy worship; keep the kings in peace,
   and the rulers in righteousness, the air in a good temperature, the
   fruits in fertility, the world in an all-powerful providence; pacify
   the warring nations, convert those that are gone astray, sanctify Thy
   people, keep those that are in virginity, preserve those in the faith
   that are in marriage, strengthen those that are in purity, bring the
   infants to complete age, confirm the newly admitted; instruct the
   catechumens, and render them worthy of admission; and gather us all
   together into Thy kingdom of heaven, by Jesus Christ our Lord, with
   whom glory, honour, and worship be to Thee, in the Holy Ghost, for
   ever. Amen. And let the deacon say: Bow down to [3677] God through His
   Christ, and receive the blessing. And let the bishop add this prayer,
   and say: O God Almighty, the true God, to whom nothing can be compared,
   who art everywhere, and present in all things, and art in nothing as
   one of the things themselves; who art not bounded by place, nor grown
   old by time; who art not terminated by ages, nor deceived by words; who
   art not subject to generation, and wantest no guardian; who art above
   all corruption, free from all change, and invariable by nature; "who
   inhabitest light inaccessible;" [3678] who art by nature invisible, and
   yet art known to all reasonable natures who seek Thee with a good mind,
   and art comprehended by those that seek after Thee with a good mind;
   the God of Israel, Thy people which truly see, and which have believed
   in Christ: Be gracious to me, and hear me, for Thy name's sake, and
   bless those that bow down their necks unto Thee, and grant them the
   petitions of their hearts, which are for their good, and do not reject
   any one of them from Thy kingdom; but sanctify, guard, cover, and
   assist them; deliver them from the adversary and every enemy; keep
   their houses, and guard "their comings in and their goings out." [3679]
   For to Thee belongs the glory, praise, majesty, worship, and adoration,
   and to Thy Son Jesus, Thy Christ, our Lord and God and King, and to the
   Holy Ghost, now and always, for ever and ever. Amen. And [3680] the
   deacon shall say, Depart in peace. [3681] These constitutions
   concerning this mystical worship, we, the apostles, do ordain for you,
   the bishops, presbyters, and deacons.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3590] We have adopted the reading of one V. ms., apecharesato. It
   means more than is in the text--that God used the wicked in a way in
   which they would not be naturally used; lit., "abused," or "misused."
   The other mss. and the Coptic read apecharisato, "gave His gifts to the
   wicked for prophecy." Whiston has tried to make sense by giving a new
   meaning to apecharisato, "taking away His grace from the wicked."

   [3591] Luke x. 16.

   [3592] The Coptic and one V. ms. omit from the commencement of the
   chapter to "deacons." The V. ms. has: "Peter, the chief of the
   apostles, proclaimed the Gospel to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
   Bithynia, and finally in Rome, where he was crucified by the prefect in
   the reign of Nero, and where also he is buried."

   [3593] From this to the end of ch. xxvi., only small portions of what
   is now in the received text occur in the Coptic version. The Oxford ms.
   is also deficient. It has only a portion of the fifth, nothing of ch.
   vi. to xvi., and only a single sentence in ch. xxii. The portions in
   Coptic are printed in italics.

   [3599] One V. ms. reads, "with whom."

   [3600] The Coptic inserts, "let the holy Gospels be read."

   [3601] The Coptic reads "Gospel" instead of "Law."

   [3602] One V. ms. has the following note: "Andrew the brother of Peter
   preaches the Gospel to the Scythians, Sogdiani, and Thracians, who on
   account of preaching Christ is crowned with the martyrdom of the cross
   by Ægæa the proconsul, and was buried in Patræ. Afterwards he was
   removed to Constantinople by the Emperor Constantine."

   [3603] The Oxford ms. has this chapter in an abbreviated form as in the
   parallel columns.

   [3604] 2 Cor. vii. 1, vi. 6; Ps. cxxi. 8.

   [3635] One V. ms. gives the following note: "James the son of Zebedee,
   brother of John, preached the Gospel in Judea, was slain with the sword
   by Herod the tetrarch, and lies in Cæsarea."

   [3636] [N.B.--No non-communicating attendance permitted.]

   [3637] The Coptic adds, "over the oblation, that the Holy Spirit may
   descend upon it, making the bread the body of Christ, and the cup the
   blood of Christ; and prayers being ended." It then goes on with the

    Sec. III.--Ordination and Duties of the Clergy.

      Concerning the Ordination of Presbyters--The Constitution of John, Who Was
      Beloved by the Lord.

   XVI. Concerning the ordination of presbyters, I [3682] who am loved by
   the Lord make this constitution for you the bishops: When thou
   ordainest a presbyter, O bishop, lay thy hand upon his head, in the
   presence of the presbyters and deacons, [3683] and pray, saying: O Lord
   Almighty, our God, who hast created all things by Christ, and dost in
   like manner take care of the whole world by Him; for He who had power
   to make different creatures, has also power to take care of them,
   according to their different natures; on which account, O God, Thou
   takest care of immortal beings by bare preservation, but of those that
   are mortal by succession--of the soul by the provision of laws, of the
   body by the supply of its wants. Do Thou therefore now also look down
   upon Thy holy Church, and increase the same, and multiply those that
   preside in it, and grant them power, that they may labour both in word
   and work for the edification of Thy people. Do Thou now also look down
   upon this Thy servant, who is put into the presbytery by the vote and
   determination of the whole clergy; and do Thou replenish him with the
   Spirit of grace and counsel, to assist and govern Thy people with a
   pure heart, in the same manner as Thou didst look down upon Thy chosen
   people, and didst command Moses to choose elders, whom Thou didst fill
   with Thy Spirit. [3684] Do Thou also now, O Lord, grant this, and
   preserve in us the Spirit of Thy grace, that this person, being filled
   with the gifts of healing and the word of teaching, may in meekness
   instruct Thy people, and sincerely serve Thee with a pure mind and a
   willing soul, and may fully discharge the holy ministrations for Thy
   people, through Thy Christ, with whom glory, honour, and worship be to
   Thee, and to the Holy Ghost, for ever. Amen.

      Concerning the Ordination of Deacons--The Constitution of Philip.

   XVII. Concerning the ordination of deacons, I Philip [3685] make this
   constitution: Thou shalt ordain a deacon, O bishop, by laying thy hands
   upon him in the presence of the whole presbytery, and of the deacons,
   and shall pray, and say:--

      The Form of Prayer for the Ordination of a Deacon.

   XVIII. O God Almighty, the true and faithful God, who art rich unto all
   that call upon Thee in truth, who art fearful in counsels, and wise in
   understanding, who art powerful and great, hear our prayer, O Lord, and
   let Thine ears receive our supplication, and "cause the light of Thy
   countenance to shine upon this Thy servant," who is to be ordained for
   Thee to the office of a deacon; and replenish him with Thy Holy Spirit,
   and with power, as Thou didst replenish Stephen, who was Thy martyr,
   and follower of the sufferings of Thy Christ. [3686] Do Thou render him
   worthy to discharge acceptably the ministration of a deacon, steadily,
   unblameably, and without reproof, that thereby he may attain an higher
   degree, through the mediation of Thy only begotten Son, with whom
   glory, honour, and worship be to Thee and the Holy Spirit for ever.
   Amen.

      Concerning the Deaconess--The Constitution of Bartholomew.

   XIX. Concerning a deaconess, I Bartholomew [3687] make this
   constitution: O bishop, thou shalt lay thy hands upon her in the
   presence of the presbytery, and of the deacons and deaconesses, and
   shall say:--

      The Form of Prayer for the Ordination of a Deaconess.

   XX. O Eternal God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Creator of
   man and of woman, who didst replenish with the Spirit Miriam, and
   Deborah, and Anna, and Huldah; [3688] who didst not disdain that Thy
   only begotten Son should be born of a woman; who also in the tabernacle
   of the testimony, and in the temple, didst ordain women to be keepers
   of Thy holy gates,--do Thou now also look down upon this Thy servant,
   who is to be ordained to the office of a deaconess, and grant her Thy
   Holy Spirit, and "cleanse her from all filthiness of flesh and spirit,"
   [3689] that she may worthily discharge the work which is committed to
   her to Thy glory, and the praise of Thy Christ, with whom glory and
   adoration be to Thee and the Holy Spirit for ever. Amen.

      Concerning the Sub-Deacons--The Constitution of Thomas.

   XXI. Concerning the sub-deacons, I Thomas [3690] make this constitution
   for you the bishops: [3691] When thou dost ordain a sub-deacon, [3692]
   O bishop, thou shalt lay thy hands upon him, and say: O Lord God, the
   Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things that are therein; who
   also in the tabernacle of the testimony didst appoint overseers and
   keepers of Thy holy vessels; [3693] do Thou now look down upon this Thy
   servant, appointed a sub-deacon; and grant him the Holy Spirit, that he
   may worthily handle the vessels of Thy ministry, and do Thy will
   always, through Thy Christ, with whom glory, honour, and worship be to
   Thee and to the Holy Spirit for ever. Amen.

      Concerning the Readers--The Constitution of Matthew.

   XXII. Concerning readers, [3694] I Matthew, also called Levi, who was
   once a tax-gatherer, make a constitution: Ordain a reader by laying thy
   hands upon him, and pray unto God, and say: O Eternal God, who art
   plenteous in mercy and compassions, who hast made manifest the
   constitution of the world by Thy operations therein, and keepest the
   number of Thine elect, do Thou also now look down upon Thy servant, who
   is to be entrusted to read Thy Holy Scriptures to Thy people, and give
   him Thy Holy Spirit, the prophetic Spirit. Thou who didst instruct
   Esdras Thy servant to read Thy laws to the people, [3695] do Thou now
   also at our prayers instruct Thy servant, and grant that he may without
   blame perfect the work committed to him, and thereby be declared worthy
   of an higher degree, through Christ, with whom glory and worship be to
   Thee and to the Holy Ghost for ever. Amen.

      Concerning the Confessors--The Constitution of James the Son of Alpheus.

   XXIII. And I James, the son of Alphæus, make a constitution in regard
   to confessors: A confessor is not ordained; for he is so by choice and
   patience, and is worthy of great honour, as having confessed the name
   of God, and of His Christ, before nations and kings. But if there be
   occasion, he is to be ordained [3696] either a bishop, priest, or
   deacon. But if any one of the confessors who is not ordained snatches
   to himself any such dignity upon account of his confession, let the
   same person be deprived and rejected; for he is not in such an office,
   since he has denied the constitution of Christ, and is "worse than an
   infidel." [3697]

      The Same Apostle's Constitution Concerning Virgins.

   XXIV. I, the same, make a constitution in regard to virgins: A virgin
   is not ordained, for we have no such command from the Lord; [3698] for
   this is a state of voluntary trial, not for the reproach of marriage,
   but on account of leisure for piety.

      The Constitution of Lebbæus, Who Was Surnamed Thaddæus, Concerning Widows.

   XXV. And I Lebbæus, [3699] surnamed Thaddæus, make this constitution in
   regard to widows: A widow is not ordained; yet if she has lost her
   husband a great while, and has lived soberly and unblameably, and has
   taken extraordinary care of her family, as Judith [3700] and Anna
   [3701] --those women of great reputation--let her be chosen into the
   order of widows. But if she has lately lost her yokefellow, let her not
   be believed, but let her youth be judged of by the time; for the
   affections do sometimes grow aged with men, if they be not restrained
   by a better bridle.

      The Same Apostle Concerning the Exorcist.

   XXVI. I the same make a constitution in regard to an exorcist. An
   exorcist is not ordained. For it is a trial of voluntary goodness, and
   of the grace of God through Christ by the inspiration of the Holy
   Spirit. For he who has received the gift of healing is declared by
   revelation from God, the grace which is in him being manifest to all.
   But if there be occasion for him, he must be ordained [3702] a bishop,
   or a presbyter, or a deacon.

      Simon the Canaanite Concerning the Number Necessary for the Ordination of
      a Bishop.

   XXVII. [3703] And I Simon the Canaanite [3704] make a constitution to
   determine by how many a bishop ought to be elected. Let a bishop be
   ordained by three or two bishops; but if any one be ordained by one
   bishop, let him be deprived, both himself and he that ordained him. But
   if there be a necessity that he have only one to ordain him, because
   more bishops cannot come together, as in time of persecution, or for
   such like causes, let him bring the suffrage of permission from more
   bishops.

      The Same Apostle's Canons Concerning Bishops, Presbyters, Deacons, and the
      Rest of the Clergy.

   XXVIII. Concerning [3705] the canons I the same make a constitution. A
   bishop blesses, but does not receive the blessing. He lays on hands,
   ordains, offers, receives the blessing from bishops, but by no means
   from presbyters. A bishop deprives any clergyman who deserves
   deprivation, excepting a bishop; for of himself he has not power to do
   that. A presbyter blesses, but does not receive the blessing; yet does
   he receive the blessing from the bishop or a fellow-presbyter. In like
   manner does he give it to a fellow-presbyter. He lays on hands, but
   does not ordain; he does not deprive, yet does he separate those that
   are under him, if they be liable to such a punishment. A deacon does
   not bless, does not give the blessing, but receives it from the bishop
   and presbyter: he does not baptize, he does not offer; but when a
   bishop or presbyter has offered, he distributes to the people, not as a
   priest, but as one that ministers to the priests. But it is not lawful
   for any one of the other clergy to do the work of a deacon. A deaconess
   does not bless, nor perform anything belonging to the office of
   presbyters or deacons, but only is to keep the doors, and to minister
   to the presbyters in the baptizing of women, on account of decency. A
   deacon separates a sub-deacon, a reader, a singer, and a deaconess, if
   there be any occasion, in the absence of a presbyter. It is not lawful
   for a sub-deacon to separate either one of the clergy or laity; nor for
   a reader, nor for a singer, nor for a deaconess, for they are the
   ministers to the deacons.

    Sec. IV.--Certain Prayers and Laws.

      Concerning the Blessing of Water and Oil--The Constitution of Matthias.

   XXIX. [3706] Concerning the water and the oil, I Matthias make a
   constitution. Let the bishop bless the water, or the oil. But if he be
   not there, let the presbyter bless it, the deacon standing by. But if
   the bishop be present, let the presbyter and deacon stand by, and let
   him say thus: O Lord of hosts, the God of powers, the creator of the
   waters, and the supplier of oil, who art compassionate, and a lover of
   mankind, who hast given water for drink and for cleansing, and oil to
   give man a cheerful and joyful countenance; [3707] do Thou now also
   sanctify this water and this oil through Thy Christ, in the name of him
   or her that has offered them, and grant them a power to restore health,
   to drive away diseases, to banish demons, and to disperse all snares
   through Christ our hope, with whom glory, honour, and worship be to
   Thee, and to the Holy Ghost, for ever. Amen.

      The Same Apostle's Constitution Concerning First-Fruits and Tithes.

   XXX. I [3708] the same make a constitution in regard to first-fruits
   and tithes. Let all first-fruits be brought to the bishop, and to the
   presbyters, and to the deacons, [3709] for their maintenance; but let
   all the tithe be for the maintenance of the rest of the clergy, and of
   the virgins and widows, and of those under the trial of poverty. For
   the first-fruits belong to the priests, and to those deacons that
   minister to them.

      The Same Apostle's Constitutions Concerning the Remaining Oblations.

   XXXI. I the same make a constitution in regard to remainders. Those
   eulogies which remain at the mysteries, let the deacons distribute them
   among the clergy, according to the mind of the bishop or the
   presbyters: to a bishop; four parts; to a presbyter, three [3710]
   parts; to a deacon, two [3711] parts; and to the rest of the
   sub-deacons, or readers, or singers, or deaconesses, one part. For this
   is good and acceptable in the sight of God, that every one be honoured
   according to his dignity; for the Church is the school, not of
   confusion, but of good order.

      Various Canons of Paul the Apostle Concerning Those that Offer Themselves
      to Be Baptized--Whom We are to Receive, and Whom to Reject.

   XXXII. I also, Paul, [3712] the least of the apostles, do make the
   following constitutions for you, the bishops, and presbyters, and
   deacons, concerning canons. Those that first come to the mystery of
   godliness, let them be brought to the bishop or to the presbyters by
   the deacons, and let them be examined as to the causes wherefore they
   come to the word of the Lord; and let those that bring them exactly
   inquire about their character, and give them their testimony. Let their
   manners and their life be inquired into, and whether they be slaves or
   freemen. And if any one be a slave, let him be asked who is his master.
   If he be slave to one of the faithful, let his master be asked if he
   can give him a good character. If he cannot, let him be rejected, until
   he show himself to be worthy to his master. But if he does give him a
   good character, let him be admitted. But if he be household slave to an
   heathen, let him be taught to please his master, that the word be not
   blasphemed. If, then, he have a wife, or a woman hath an husband, let
   them be taught to be content with each other; but if they be unmarried,
   let them learn not to commit fornication, but to enter into lawful
   marriage. But if his master be one of the faithful, and knows that he
   is guilty of fornication, and yet does not give him a wife, or to the
   woman an husband, let him be separated; but if anyone hath a demon, let
   him indeed be taught piety, but not received into communion before he
   be cleansed; yet if death be near, let him be received. If any one be a
   maintainer of harlots, let him either leave off to prostitute women, or
   else let him be rejected. If a harlot come, let her leave off whoredom,
   or else let her be rejected. If a maker of idols come, let him either
   leave off his employment, or let him be rejected. If one belonging to
   the theatre [3713] come, whether it be man or woman, or charioteer, or
   dueller, or racer, or player of prizes, or Olympic gamester, or one
   that plays on the pipe, on the lute, or on the harp at those games, or
   a dancing-master or an huckster, [3714] either let them leave off their
   employments, or let them be rejected. If a soldier come, let him be
   taught to "do no injustice, to accuse no man falsely, and to be content
   with his allotted wages:" [3715] if he submit to those rules, let him
   be received; but if he refuse them, let him be rejected. He that is
   guilty of sins not to be named, a sodomite, an effeminate person, a
   magician, an enchanter, an astrologer, a diviner, an user of magic
   verses, a juggler, a mountebank, one that makes amulets, a charmer, a
   soothsayer, a fortune-teller, an observer of palmistry; he that, when
   he meets you, observes defects in the eyes or feet of the birds or
   cats, or noises, or symbolical sounds: let these be proved for some
   time, for this sort of wickedness is hard to be washed away; and if
   they leave off those practices, let them be received; but if they will
   not agree to that, let them be rejected. Let a concubine, who is slave
   to an unbeliever, and confines herself to her master alone, be
   received; [3716] but if she be incontinent with others, let her be
   rejected. If one of the faithful hath a concubine, if she be a
   bond-servant, let him leave off that way, and marry in a legal manner:
   if she be a free woman, let him marry her in a lawful manner; if he
   does not, let him be rejected. Let him that follows the Gentile
   customs, or Jewish fables, either reform, or let him be rejected. If
   any one follows the sports of the theatre, their huntings, or
   horse-races, or combats, either let him leave them off, or let him be
   rejected. Let him who is to be a catechumen be a catechumen for three
   years; but if any one be diligent, and has a good-will to his business,
   let him be admitted: for it is not the length of time, but the course
   of life, that is judged. Let him that teaches, although he be one of
   the laity, yet, if he be skilful in the word and grave in his manners,
   teach; for "they shall be all taught of God." [3717] Let all the
   faithful, whether men or women, when they rise from sleep, before they
   go to work, when they have washed themselves, pray; but if any
   catechetic instruction be held, let the faithful person prefer the word
   of piety before his work. Let the faithful person, whether man or
   woman, treat servants kindly, as we have ordained in the foregoing
   books, and have taught in our epistles. [3718]

      Upon Which Days Servants are Not to Work.

   XXXIII. I Peter and Paul do make the following constitutions. Let the
   slaves work five days; but on the Sabbath-day and the Lord's day let
   them have leisure to go to church for instruction in piety. We have
   said that the Sabbath is on account of the creation, and the Lord's day
   of the resurrection. Let slaves rest from their work all the great
   week, and that which follows it--for the one in memory of the passion,
   and the other of the resurrection; and there is need they should be
   instructed who it is that suffered and rose again, and who it is
   permitted Him to suffer, and raised Him again. Let them have rest from
   their work on the Ascension, because it was the conclusion of the
   dispensation by Christ. Let them rest at Pentecost, because of the
   coming of the Holy Spirit, which was given to those that believed in
   Christ. Let them rest on the festival of His birth, because on it the
   unexpected favour was granted to men, that Jesus Christ, the Logos of
   God, should be born of the Virgin Mary, [3719] for the salvation of the
   world. [3720] Let them rest on the festival of Epiphany, because on it
   a manifestation took place of the divinity of Christ, for the Father
   bore testimony to Him at the baptism; and the Paraclete, in the form of
   a dove, pointed out to the bystanders Him to whom testimony was borne.
   Let them rest on the days of the apostles: for they were appointed your
   teachers to bring you to Christ, and made you worthy of the Spirit. Let
   them rest on the day of the first [3721] martyr Stephen, and of the
   other holy martyrs who preferred Christ to their own life.

      At What Hours, and Why, We are to Pray.

   XXXIV. Offer up your prayers in the morning, at the third hour, the
   sixth, the ninth, the evening, and at cock-crowing: in the morning,
   returning thanks that the Lord has sent you light, that He has brought
   you past the night, and brought on the day; at the third hour, because
   at that hour the Lord received the sentence of condemnation from
   Pilate; at the sixth, because at that hour He was crucified; [3722] at
   the ninth, because all things were in commotion at the crucifixion of
   the Lord, as trembling at the bold attempt of the impious Jews, and not
   bearing the injury offered to their Lord; in the evening, giving thanks
   that He has given you the night to rest from the daily labours; at
   cock-crowing, because that hour brings the good news of the coming on
   of the day for the operations proper for the light. But if it be not
   possible to go to the church on account of the unbelievers, thou, O
   bishop, shalt assemble them in a house, that a godly man may not enter
   into an assembly of the ungodly. For it is not the place that
   sanctifies the man, but the man the place. And if the ungodly possess
   the place, do thou avoid it, because it is profaned by them. For as
   holy priests sanctify a place, so do the profane ones defile it. If it
   be not possible to assemble either in the church or in a house, let
   every one by himself sing, and read, and pray, or two or three
   together. For "where two or three are gathered together in my name,
   there am I in the midst of them." [3723] Let not one of the faithful
   pray with a catechumen, no, not in the house: for it is not reasonable
   that he who is admitted should be polluted with one not admitted. Let
   not one of the godly pray with an heretic, no, not in the house. For
   "what fellowship hath light with darkness?" [3724] Let Christians,
   whether men or women, who have connections with slaves, either leave
   them off, or let them be rejected.

      The Constitution of James the Brother of Christ Concerning Evening Prayer.

   XXXV. I James, [3725] the brother of Christ according to the flesh, but
   His servant as the only begotten God, and one appointed bishop of
   Jerusalem by the Lord Himself, and the Apostles, do ordain thus: When
   it is evening, thou, O bishop, shall assemble the church; and after the
   repetition of the psalm at the lighting up the lights, the deacon shall
   bid prayers for the catechumens, the energumens, the illuminated, and
   the penitents, as we have formerly said. But after the dismission of
   these, the deacon shall say: So many as are of the faithful, let us
   pray to the Lord. And after the bidding prayer, which is formerly set
   down, he shall say:--

      The Bidding Prayer for the Evening.

   XXXVI. Save us, O God, and raise us up by Thy Christ. Let us stand up,
   and beg for the mercies of the Lord, and His compassions, for the angel
   of peace, for what things are good and profitable, for a Christian
   departure out of this life, an evening and a night of peace, and free
   from sin; and let us beg that the whole course of our life may be
   unblameable. Let us dedicate ourselves and one another to the living
   God through His Christ. And let the bishop add this prayer, and say:--

      The Thanksgiving for the Evening.

   XXXVII. O God, who art without beginning and without end, the Maker of
   the whole world by Christ, and the Provider for it, but before all
   [3726] His God and Father, the Lord [3727] of the Spirit, and the King
   of intelligible and sensible beings; who hast made the day for the
   works of light, and the night for the refreshment of our
   infirmity,--for "the day is Thine, the night also is Thine: Thou hast
   prepared the light and the sun," [3728] --do Thou now, O Lord, Thou
   lover of mankind, and Fountain of all good, mercifully accept of this
   our evening thanksgiving. Thou who hast brought us through the length
   of the day, and hast brought us to the beginnings of the night,
   preserve us by Thy Christ, afford us a peaceable evening, and a night
   free from sin, and vouchsafe us everlasting life by Thy Christ, through
   whom glory, honour, and worship be to Thee in [3729] the Holy Spirit
   for ever. Amen. And let the deacon say: Bow down for the laying on of
   hands. And let the bishop say: O God of our fathers, and Lord of mercy,
   who didst form man of Thy wisdom a rational creature, and beloved of
   God more than the other beings upon this earth, and didst give him
   authority to rule over the creatures upon the earth, and didst ordain
   by Thy will rulers and priests--the former for the security of life,
   the latter for a regular worship,--do Thou now also look down, O Lord
   Almighty, and cause Thy face to shine upon Thy people, who bow down the
   neck of their heart, and bless them by Christ; through whom Thou hast
   enlightened us with the light of knowledge, and hast revealed Thyself
   to us; with whom worthy adoration is due from every rational and holy
   nature to Thee, and to the Spirit, who is the Comforter, for ever.
   Amen. And let the deacon say: "Depart in peace." In like manner, in the
   morning, after the repetition of the morning psalm, and his dismission
   of the catechumens, the energumens, the candidates for baptism, and the
   penitents, and after the usual bidding of prayers, that we may not
   again repeat the same things, let the deacon add after the words, Save
   us, O God, and raise us up by Thy grace: Let us beg of the Lord His
   mercies and His compassions, that this morning and this day may be with
   peace and without sin, as also all the time of our sojourning; that He
   will grant us His angel of peace, a Christian departure out of this
   life, and that God will be merciful and gracious. Let us dedicate
   ourselves and one another to the living God through His Only-begotten.
   And let the bishop add this prayer, and say:--

      The Thanksgiving for the Morning.

   XXXVIII. O God, the God of spirits and of all flesh, who art beyond
   compare, and standest in need of nothing, who hast given the sun to
   have rule over the day, and the moon and the stars to have rule over
   the night, do Thou now also look down upon us with gracious eyes, and
   receive our morning thanksgivings, and have mercy upon us; for we have
   not "spread out our hands unto a strange God;" [3730] for there is not
   among us any new God, but Thou, the eternal God, who art without end,
   who hast given us our being through Christ, and given us our well-being
   through Him. Do Thou vouchsafe us also, through Him, eternal life; with
   whom glory, and honour, and worship be to Thee and to the Holy Spirit
   for ever. Amen. And let the deacon say: Bow down for the laying on of
   hands. And let the bishop add this prayer, saying:--

      The Imposition of Hands for the Morning.

   XXXIX. O God, who art faithful and true, who "hast mercy on thousands
   and ten thousands of them that love Thee," [3731] the lover of the
   humble, and the protector of the needy, of whom all things stand in
   need, for all things are subject to Thee; look down upon this Thy
   people, who bow down their heads to Thee, and bless them with spiritual
   blessing. "Keep them as the apple of an eye," [3732] preserve them in
   piety and righteousness, and vouchsafe them eternal life in Christ
   Jesus Thy beloved Son, with whom glory, honour, and worship be to Thee
   and to the Holy Spirit, now and always, and for ever and ever. Amen.
   And let the deacon say: "Depart in peace." And when the first-fruits
   are offered, the bishop gives thanks in this manner:--

      The Form of Prayer for the First-Fruits.

   XL. We give thanks to Thee, O Lord Almighty, the Creator of the whole
   world, and its Preserver, through Thy only begotten Son Jesus Christ
   our Lord, for the first-fruits which are offered to Thee, not in such a
   manner as we ought, but as we are able. For what man is there that can
   worthily give Thee thanks for those things Thou hast given them to
   partake of? The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, and of all
   the saints, who madest all things fruitful by Thy word, and didst
   command the earth to bring forth various fruits for our rejoicing and
   our food; who hast given to the duller and more sheepish sort of
   creatures juices--herbs to them that feed on herbs, and to some flesh,
   to others seeds, but to us corn, as advantageous and proper food, and
   many other things--some for our necessities, some for our health, and
   some for our pleasure. On all these accounts, therefore, art Thou
   worthy of exalted hymns of praise for Thy beneficence by Christ,
   through whom [3733] glory, honour, and worship be to Thee, in the Holy
   Spirit, for ever. Amen. Concerning those that are at rest in Christ:
   After the bidding prayer, that we may not repeat it again, the deacon
   shall add as follows:--

      The Bidding Prayer for Those Departed.

   XLI. Let us pray for our brethren that are at rest [3734] in Christ,
   that God, the lover of mankind, who has received his soul, may forgive
   him every sin, voluntary and involuntary, and may be merciful and
   gracious to him, and give him his lot in the land of the pious that are
   sent into the bosom of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, with all those
   that have pleased Him and done His will from the beginning of the
   world, whence all sorrow, grief, and lamentation are banished. Let us
   arise, let us dedicate ourselves and one another to the eternal God,
   through that Word which was in the beginning. And let the bishop say: O
   Thou who art by nature immortal, and hast no end of Thy being, from
   whom every creature, whether immortal or mortal, is derived; who didst
   make man a rational creature, the citizen of this world, in his
   constitution mortal, and didst add the promise of a resurrection; who
   didst not suffer Enoch and Elijah to taste of death: "the God of
   Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, who art the God of
   them, not as of dead, but as of living persons: for the souls of all
   men live with Thee, and the spirits of the righteous are in Thy hand,
   which no torment can touch;" [3735] for they are all sanctified under
   Thy hand: do Thou now also look upon this Thy servant, whom Thou hast
   selected and received into another state, and forgive him if
   voluntarily or involuntarily he has sinned, and afford him merciful
   angels, and place him in the bosom of the patriarchs, and prophets, and
   apostles, and of all those that have pleased Thee from the beginning of
   the world, where there is no grief, sorrow, nor lamentation; but the
   peaceable region of the godly, and the undisturbed land of the upright,
   and of those that therein see, the glory of Thy Christ; by whom [3736]
   glory, honour, and worship, thanksgiving, and adoration be to Thee, in
   the Holy Spirit, for ever. Amen. And let the deacon say: Bow down, and
   receive the blessing. And let the bishop give thanks for them, saying
   as follows: "O Lord, save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance,"
   [3737] which Thou hast purchased with the precious blood of Thy Christ.
   Feed them under Thy right hand, and cover them under Thy wings, and
   grant that they may "fight the good fight, and finish their course, and
   keep the faith" [3738] immutably, unblameably, and unreprovably,
   through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, with whom glory,
   honour, and worship be to Thee and to the Holy Spirit for ever. Amen.

      How and When We Ought to Celebrate the Memorials of the Faithful Departed,
      and that We Ought Then to Give Somewhat Out of Their Goods to the Poor.

   XLII. Let the third day of the departed be celebrated with psalms, and
   lessons, and prayers, on account of Him who arose within the space of
   three days; and let the ninth day be celebrated in remembrance of the
   living, and of the departed; and the fortieth [3739] day according to
   the ancient pattern: for so did the people lament Moses, and the
   anniversary day in memory of him. [3740] And let alms be given to the
   poor out of his goods for a memorial of him. [3741]

      That Memorials or Mandates Do Not at All Profit the Ungodly Who are Dead.

   XLIII. These things we say concerning the pious; for as to the ungodly,
   if thou givest all the world to the poor, thou wilt not benefit him at
   all. For to whom the Deity was an enemy while he was alive, it is
   certain it will be so also when he is departed; for there is no
   unrighteousness with Him. For "the Lord [3742] is righteous, and has
   loved righteousness." [3743] And, "Behold the man and his work." [3744]

      Concerning Drunkards.

   XLIV. Now, when you are invited to their memorials, do you feast with
   good order, and the fear of God, as disposed to intercede for those
   that are departed. For since you are the presbyters and deacons of
   Christ, you ought always to be sober, both among yourselves and among
   others, that so you may be able to warn the unruly. Now the Scripture
   says, "The men in power are passionate. But let them not drink wine,
   lest by drinking they forget wisdom, and are not able to judge aright."
   [3745] Wherefore [3746] both the presbyters and the deacons are those
   of authority in the Church next to God Almighty and His beloved Son.
   [3747] We say this, not they are not to drink at all, otherwise it
   would be to the reproach of what God has made for cheerfulness, but
   that they be not disordered with wine. For the Scripture does not say,
   Do not drink wine; but what says it? "Drink not wine to drunkenness;"
   and again, "Thorns spring up in the hand of the drunkard." [3748] Nor
   do we say this only to those of the clergy, but also to every lay
   Christian, upon whom the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is called. For
   to them also it is said, "Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath
   uneasiness? who hath babbling? who hath red eyes? who hath wounds
   without cause? Do not these things belong to those that tarry long at
   the wine, and that go to seek where drinking meetings are?" [3749]

      Concerning the Receiving Such as are Persecuted for Christ's Sake.

   XLV. Receive ye those that are persecuted [3750] on account of the
   faith, and who fly from city to city, [3751] as mindful of the words of
   the Lord. For, knowing that though "the spirit be willing, the flesh is
   weak," [3752] they fly away, and prefer the spoiling of their goods,
   that they may preserve the name of Christ in themselves without denying
   it. Supply them therefore with what they want, and thereby fulfil the
   commandment of the Lord.

    Sec. V.--All the Apostles Urge the Observance of the Order of the Church.

      That Every One Ought to Remain in that Rank Wherein He is Placed, But Not
      Snatch Such Offices to Himself Which are Not Entrusted to Him.

   XLVI. Now this we all in common do charge you, that every one remain in
   that rank which is appointed him, and do not transgress his proper
   bounds; for they are not ours, but God's. For says the Lord: "He that
   heareth you, heareth me; and he that heareth me, heareth Him that sent
   me." And, "He that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth
   me, despiseth Him that sent me." [3753] For if those things that are
   without life do observe good order, as the night, the day, the sun, the
   moon, the stars, the elements, the seasons, the months, the weeks, the
   days, and the hours, and are subservient to the uses appointed them,
   according to that which is said, "Thou hast set them a bound which they
   shall not pass;" [3754] and again, concerning the sea, "I have set
   bounds thereto, and have encompassed it with bars and gates; and I said
   to it, Hitherto shalt thou come, and thou shalt go no farther;" [3755]
   how much more ought ye not to venture to remove those things which we,
   according to God's will, have determined for you! But because many
   think this a small matter, and venture to confound the orders, and to
   remove the ordination which belongs to them severally, snatching to
   themselves dignities which were never given them, and allowing
   themselves to bestow that authority in a tyrannical manner which they
   have not themselves, and thereby provoke God to anger (as did the
   followers of Corah and King Uzziah, [3756] who, having no authority,
   usurped the high-priesthood without commission from God; and the former
   were burnt with fire, and the latter was struck with a leprosy in his
   forehead); and provoke Christ Jesus to anger, who has made this
   constitution; and also grieve the Holy Spirit, and make void His
   testimony: therefore, foreknowing the danger that hangs over those who
   do such things, and the neglect about the sacrifices and eucharistical
   offices which will arise from their being impiously offered by those
   who ought not to offer them; who think the honour of the
   high-priesthood, which is an imitation of the great High Priest Jesus
   Christ our King, to be a matter of sport; we have found it necessary to
   give you warning in this matter also. For some are already turned aside
   after their own vanity. We say that Moses the servant of God ("to whom
   God spake face to face, as if a man spake to his friend;" [3757] to
   whom He said, "I know thee above all men;" to whom He spake directly,
   and not by obscure methods, or dreams, or angels, or riddles),--this
   person, when he made constitutions and divine laws, distinguished what
   things were to be performed by the high priests, what by the priests,
   and what by the Levites; distributing to every one his proper and
   suitable office in the divine service. And those things which are
   allotted for the high priests to do, those might not be meddled with by
   the priests; and what things were allotted to the priests, the Levites
   might not meddle with; but every one observed those ministrations which
   were written down and appointed for them. And if any would meddle
   beyond the tradition, death was his punishment. And Saul's example does
   show this most plainly, who, thinking he might offer sacrifice without
   the prophet and high priest Samuel, [3758] drew upon himself a sin and
   a curse without remedy. Nor did even his having anointed him king
   discourage the prophet. But God showed the same by a more visible
   effect in the case of Uzziah, [3759] when He without delay exacted the
   punishment due to this transgression, and he that madly coveted after
   the high-priesthood was rejected from his kingdom also. As to those
   things that have happened amongst us, you yourselves are not ignorant
   of them. For ye know undoubtedly that those that are by us named
   bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, were made by prayer, and by the
   laying on of hands; and that by the difference of their names is showed
   the difference of their employments. For not every one that will is
   ordained, as the case was in that spurious and counterfeit priesthood
   of the calves under Jeroboam; [3760] but he only who is called of God.
   For if there were no rule or distinction of orders, it would suffice to
   perform all the offices under one name. But being taught by the Lord
   the series of things, we distributed the functions of the
   high-priesthood to the bishops, those of the priesthood to the
   presbyters, and the ministration under them both to the deacons; that
   the divine worship might be performed in purity. For it is not lawful
   for a deacon to offer the sacrifice, or to baptize, or to give either
   the greater or the lesser blessing. Nor may a presbyter perform
   ordination; for it is not agreeable to holiness to have this order
   perverted. For "God is not the God of confusion," [3761] that the
   subordinate persons should tyrannically assume to themselves the
   functions belonging to their superiors, forming a new scheme of laws to
   their own mischief, not knowing that "it is hard for them to kick
   against the pricks;" [3762] for such as these do not fight against us,
   or against the bishops, but against the universal Bishop and the High
   Priest of the Father, Jesus Christ our Lord. [3763] High priests,
   priests, and Levites were ordained by Moses, [3764] the most beloved of
   God. By our Saviour [3765] were we apostles, thirteen in number,
   ordained; and by the apostles I James, and I Clement, and others with
   us, were ordained, that we may not make the catalogue of all those
   bishops over again. And in common, presbyters, and deacons, and
   sub-deacons, and readers, were ordained by all of us. The great High
   Priest therefore, who is so by nature, is Christ the only begotten; not
   having snatched that honour to Himself, but having been appointed such
   by the Father; who being made man for our sake, and offering the
   spiritual sacrifice to His God and Father, before His suffering gave it
   us alone in charge to do this, although there were others with us who
   had believed in Him. But he that believes is not presently appointed a
   priest, or obtains the dignity of the high-priesthood. But after His
   ascension we offered, according to His constitution, the pure and
   unbloody sacrifice; and ordained bishops, and presbyters, and deacons,
   seven in number: one of which was Stephen, [3766] that blessed martyr,
   who was not inferior to us as to his pious disposition of mind towards
   God; who showed so great piety towards God, by his faith and love
   towards our Lord Jesus Christ, as to give his life for Him, and was
   stoned to death by the Jews, the murderers of the Lord. Yet still this
   so great and good a man, who was fervent in spirit, who saw Christ on
   the right hand of God, and the gates of heaven opened, does nowhere
   appear to have exercised functions which did not appertain to his
   office of a deacon, nor to have offered the sacrifices, nor to have
   laid hands upon any, but kept his order of a deacon unto the end. For
   so it became him, who was a martyr for Christ, to preserve good order.
   But if some do blame Philip [3767] our deacon, and Ananias [3768] our
   faithful brother, that the one did baptize the eunuch, and the other me
   Paul, these men do not understand what we say. For we have affirmed
   only that no one snatches the sacerdotal dignity to himself, but either
   receives it from God, as Melchisedec and Job, or from the high priest,
   as Aaron from Moses. Wherefore Philip and Ananias did not constitute
   themselves, but were appointed by Christ, the High Priest of that God
   to whom no being is to be compared.

     __________________________________________________________________

    The Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles. [3769]

   XLVII.1. Let a bishop be ordained by two or three bishops.

   2. A presbyter by one bishop, as also a deacon, and the rest of the
   clergy. [3770]

   3. If any bishop or presbyter, otherwise than our Lord has ordained
   concerning the sacrifice, offer other things at the altar of God, as
   honey, milk, or strong beer instead of wine, any necessaries, or birds,
   or animals, or pulse, otherwise than is ordained, let him be deprived;
   excepting grains of new corn, or ears of wheat, or bunches of grapes in
   their season. [3771]

   4. For it is not lawful to offer anything besides these at the altar,
   and oil for the holy lamp, and incense in the time of the divine
   oblation.

   5. But let all other fruits be sent to the house of the bishop, as
   first-fruits to him and to the presbyters, but not to the altar. Now it
   is plain that the bishop and presbyters are to divide them to the
   deacons and to the rest of the clergy.

   6. Let not a bishop, a priest, or a deacon [3772] cast off his own wife
   under pretence of piety; but if he does cast her off, let him be
   suspended. If he go on in it, let him be deprived.

   7. Let not a bishop, a priest, or deacon undertake the cares of this
   world; but if he do, let him be deprived. [3773]

   8. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon shall celebrate the holiday
   of the passover before the vernal equinox with the Jews, let him be
   deprived. [3774]

   9. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or any one of the catalogue
   of the priesthood, when the oblation is over, does not communicate, let
   him give his reason; and if it be just, let him be forgiven; but if he
   does not do it, let him be suspended, as becoming the cause of damage
   to the people, and occasioning a suspicion against him that offered, as
   of one that did not rightly offer. [3775]

   10. All those of the faithful that enter into the holy church of God,
   and hear the sacred Scriptures, but do not stay during prayer and the
   holy communion, must be suspended, as causing disorder in the church.

   11. If any one, even in the house, prays with a person excommunicate,
   let him also be suspended.

   12. If any clergyman prays with one deprived as with a clergyman, let
   himself also be deprived.

   13. If any clergyman or layman who is suspended, or ought not to be
   received, [3776] goes away, and is received in another city without
   commendatory letters, let both those who received him and he that was
   received be suspended. But if he be already suspended, let his
   suspension be lengthened, as lying to and deceiving the Church of God.

   14. A bishop ought not to leave his own parish and leap to another,
   although the multitude should compel him, unless there be some good
   reason forcing him to do this, as that he can contribute much greater
   profit to the people of the new parish by the word of piety; but this
   is not to be settled by himself, but by the judgment of many bishops,
   and very great supplication.

   15. If any presbyter or deacon, or any one of the catalogue of the
   clergy, leaves his own parish and goes to another, and, entirely
   removing himself, continues in that other parish without the consent of
   his own bishop, him we command no longer to go on in his ministry,
   especially in case his bishop calls upon him to return, and he does not
   obey, but continues in his disorder. However, let him communicate there
   as a layman.

   16. But if the bishop with whom they are undervalues the deprivation
   decreed against them, and receives them as clergymen, let him be
   suspended as a teacher of disorder.

   17. He who has been twice married after his baptism, or has had a
   concubine, cannot be made a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or indeed
   any one of the sacerdotal catalogue. [3777]

   18. He who has taken a widow, or a divorced woman, or an harlot, or a
   servant, or one belonging to the theatre, cannot be either a bishop,
   priest, or deacon, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue.

   19. He who has married two sisters, or his brother's or sister's
   daughter, cannot be a clergyman.

   20. Let a clergyman who becomes a surety be deprived.

   21. Let an eunuch, if he be such by the injury of men, or his virilia
   were taken away in the persecution, or he was born such, and yet is
   worthy of episcopacy, be made a bishop.

   22. Let not him who has disabled himself be made a clergyman; for he is
   a self-murderer, and an enemy to the creation of God. [3778]

   23. If any one who is of the clergy disables himself, let him be
   deprived, for he is a murderer of himself.

   24. Let a layman who disables himself be separated for three years, for
   he lays a snare for his own life. [3779]

   25. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who is taken in fornication,
   or perjury, or stealing, be deprived, but not suspended; for the
   Scripture says: "Thou shall not avenge twice for the same crime by
   affliction." [3780]

   26. In like manner also as to the rest of the clergy.

   27. Of those who come into the clergy unmarried, we permit only the
   readers and singers, if they have a mind, to marry afterward. [3781]

   28. We command that a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who strikes the
   faithful that offend, or the unbelievers who do wickedly, and thinks to
   terrify them by such means, be deprived, for our Lord has nowhere
   taught us such things. On the contrary, "when Himself was stricken, He
   did not strike again; when He was reviled, He reviled not again; when
   He suffered, He threatened not." [3782]

   29. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who is deprived justly for
   manifest crimes, does venture to meddle with that ministration which
   was once entrusted to him, let the same person be entirely cut off from
   the Church.

   30. If any bishop obtains that dignity by money, or even a presbyter or
   deacon, let him and the person that ordained him be deprived; and let
   him be entirely cut off from communion, as Simon Magus was by me Peter.
   [3783]

   31. If any bishop makes use of the rulers of this world, and by their
   means obtains to be a bishop of a church, let him be deprived and
   suspended, and all that communicate with him.

   32. If any presbyter despises his own bishop, and assembles separately,
   and fixes another altar, when he has nothing to condemn in his bishop
   either as to piety or righteousness, let him be deprived as an
   ambitious person; for he is a tyrant, and the rest of the clergy,
   whoever join themselves to him. And let the laity be suspended. But let
   these things be done after one, and a second, or even a third
   admonition from the bishop. [3784]

   33. If any presbyter or deacon be put under suspension by his bishop,
   it is not lawful for any other to receive him, but for him only who put
   him under suspension, unless it happens that he who put him under
   suspension die.

   34. Do not ye receive any stranger, whether bishop, or presbyter, or
   deacon, without commendatory letters; and when such are offered, let
   them be examined. And if they be preachers of piety, let them be
   received; but if not, supply their wants, but do not receive them to
   communion: for many things are done by surprise.

   35. The bishops of every country ought to know who is the chief among
   them, and to esteem him as their head, and not to do any great thing
   without his consent; but every one to manage only the affairs that
   belong to his own parish, and the places subject to it. But let him not
   do anything without the consent of all; for it is by this means there
   will be unanimity, and God will be glorified by Christ, in the Holy
   Spirit.

   36. A bishop must not venture to ordain out of his own bounds for
   cities or countries that are not subject to him. But if he be convicted
   of having done so without the consent of such as governed those cities
   or countries, let him be deprived, both the bishop himself and those
   whom he has ordained.

   37. If any bishop that is ordained does not undertake his office, nor
   take care of the people committed to him, let him be suspended until he
   do undertake it; and in the like manner a presbyter and a deacon. But
   if he goes, and is not received, not because of the want of his own
   consent, but because of the ill temper of the people, let him continue
   bishop; but let the clergy of that city be suspended, because they have
   not taught that disobedient people better.

   38. Let a synod of bishops be held twice in the year, and let them ask
   one another the doctrines of piety; and let them determine the
   ecclesiastical disputes that happen--once in the fourth week of
   Pentecost, and again on the twelfth of the month Hyperberetæus.

   39. Let the bishop have the care of ecclesiastical revenues, and
   administer them as in the presence of God. But it is not lawful for him
   to appropriate any part of them to himself, or to give the things of
   God to his own kindred. But if they be poor, let him support them as
   poor; but let him not, under such pretences, alienate the revenues of
   the Church.

   40. Let not the presbyters and deacons do anything without the consent
   of the bishop, for it is he who is entrusted with the people of the
   Lord, and will be required to give an account of their souls. Let the
   proper goods of the bishop, if he has any, and those belonging to the
   Lord, be openly distinguished, that he may have power when he dies to
   leave his own goods as he pleases, and to whom he pleases; that, under
   pretence of the ecclesiastical revenues, the bishop's own may not come
   short, who sometimes has a wife and children, or kinsfolk, or servants.
   For this is just before God and men, that neither the Church suffer any
   loss by the not knowing which revenues are the bishop's own, nor his
   kindred, under pretence of the Church, be undone, or his relations fall
   into lawsuits, and so his death be liable to reproach. [3785]

   41. We command that the bishop have power over the goods of the Church;
   for if he be entrusted with the precious souls of men, much more ought
   he to give directions about goods, that they all be distributed to
   those in want, according to his authority, by the presbyters and
   deacons, and be used for their support with the fear of God, and with
   all reverence. He is also to partake of those things he wants, if he
   does want them, for his necessary occasions, and those of the brethren
   who live with him, that they may not by any means be in straits: for
   the law of God appointed that those who waited at the altar should be
   maintained by the altar; since not so much as a soldier does at any
   time bear arms against the enemies at his own charges.

   42. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who indulges himself in dice
   or drinking, either leave off those practices, or let him be deprived.
   [3786]

   43. If a sub-deacon, a reader, or a singer does the like, either let
   him leave off, or let him be suspended; and so for one of the laity.

   44. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who requires usury of those
   he lends to, either leave off to do so, or let him be deprived.

   45. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who only prays with heretics,
   be suspended; but if he also permit them to perform any part of the
   office of a clergyman, let him be deprived. [3787]

   46. We command that a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon who receives the
   baptism, or the sacrifice of heretics, be deprived: "For what agreement
   is there between Christ and Belial? or what part hath a believer with
   an infidel?" [3788]

   47. If a bishop or presbyter rebaptizes him who has had true baptism,
   or does not baptize him who is polluted by the ungodly, let him be
   deprived, as ridiculing the cross and the death of the Lord, and not
   distinguishing between real priests and counterfeit ones.

   48. If a layman divorces his own wife, and takes another, or one
   divorced by another, let him be suspended. [3789]

   49. If any bishop or presbyter does not baptize according to the Lord's
   constitution, into the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but into
   three beings without beginning, or into three Sons, or three
   Comforters, let him be deprived. [3790]

   50. If any bishop or presbyter does not perform the three immersions of
   the one admission, but one immersion, which is given into the death of
   Christ, let him be deprived; for the Lord did not say, "Baptize into my
   death," but, "Go ye and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them
   into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Do
   ye, therefore, O bishops, baptize thrice into one Father, and Son, and
   Holy Ghost, according to the will of Christ, and our constitution by
   the Spirit. [3791]

   51. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or indeed any one of the
   sacerdotal catalogue, abstains from marriage, flesh, and wine, not for
   his own exercise, but because he abominates these things, forgetting
   that "all things were very good," [3792] and that "God made man male
   and female," [3793] and blasphemously abuses the creation, either let
   him reform, or let him be deprived, and be cast out of the Church; and
   the same for one of the laity. [3794]

   52. If any bishop or presbyter does not receive him that returns from
   his sin, but rejects him, let him be deprived; because he grieves
   Christ, who says, "There is joy in heaven over one sinner that
   repenteth." [3795]

   53. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon does not on festival days
   partake of flesh or wine, let him be deprived, as "having a seared
   conscience," [3796] and becoming a cause of scandal to many.

   54. If any one of the clergy be taken eating in a tavern, let him be
   suspended, excepting when he is forced to bait at an inn upon the road.
   [3797]

   55. If any one of the clergy abuses his bishop unjustly, let him be
   deprived; for says the Scripture, "Thou shall not speak evil of the
   ruler of thy people." [3798]

   56. If any one of the clergy abuses a presbyter or a deacon, let him be
   separated.

   57. If any one of the clergy mocks at a lame, a deaf, or a blind man,
   or at one maimed in his feet, let him be suspended; and the like for
   the laity.

   58. Let a bishop or presbyter who takes no care of the clergy or
   people, and does not instruct them in piety, be separated; and if he
   continues in his negligence, let him be deprived. [3799]

   59. If any bishop or presbyter, when any one of the clergy is in want,
   does not supply his necessity, let him be suspended; and if he
   continues in it, let him be deprived, as having killed his brother.
   [3800]

   60. If any one publicly reads in the Church the spurious books of the
   ungodly, as if they were holy, to the destruction of the people and of
   the clergy, let him be deprived. [3801]

   61. If there be an accusation against a Christian for fornication, or
   adultery, or any other forbidden action, and he be convicted, let him
   not be promoted into the clergy.

   62. If any one of the clergy for fear of men, as of a Jew, or a
   Gentile, or an heretic, shall deny the name of Christ, let him be
   suspended; but if he deny the name of a clergyman, let him be deprived;
   but when he repents, let him be received as one of the laity. [3802]

   63. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or indeed any one of the
   sacerdotal catalogue, eats flesh with the blood of its life, or that
   which is torn by beasts, or which died of itself, let him be deprived;
   for this the law itself has forbidden. [3803] But if he be one of the
   laity, let him be suspended. [3804]

   64. If any one of the clergy be found to fast on the Lord's day, or on
   the Sabbath-day, excepting one only, let him be deprived; but if he be
   one of the laity, let him be suspended. [3805]

   65. If any one, either of the clergy or laity, enters into a synagogue
   of the Jews or heretics to pray, let him be deprived and suspended.
   [3806]

   66. If any one of the clergy strikes one in a quarrel, and kills him by
   that one stroke, let him be deprived, on account of his rashness; but
   if he be one of the laity, let him be suspended. [3807]

   67. If any one has offered violence to a virgin not betrothed, and
   keeps her, let him be suspended. But it is not lawful for him to take
   another to wife; but he must retain her whom he has chosen, although
   she be poor. [3808]

   68. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, receives a second
   ordination from any one, let him be deprived, and the person who
   ordained him, unless he can show that his former ordination was from
   the heretics; for those that are either baptized or ordained by such as
   these, can be neither Christians nor clergymen. [3809]

   69. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or reader, or singer, does
   not fast the fast of forty days, or the fourth day of the week, and the
   day of the Preparation, let him be deprived, except he be hindered by
   weakness of body. But if he be one of the laity, let him be suspended.
   [3810]

   70. If any bishop, or any other of the clergy, fasts with the Jews, or
   keeps the festivals with them, or accepts of the presents from their
   festivals, as unleavened bread or some such thing, let him be deprived;
   but if he be one of the laity, let him be suspended. [3811]

   71. If any Christian carries oil into an heathen temple, or into a
   synagogue of the Jews, or lights up lamps in their festivals, let him
   be suspended.

   72. If any one, either of the clergy or laity, takes away from the holy
   Church an honeycomb, or oil, let him be suspended, and let him add the
   fifth part to that which he took away. [3812]

   73. A vessel of silver, or gold, or linen, which is sanctified, let no
   one appropriate to his own use, for it is unjust; but if any one be
   caught, let him be punished with suspension. [3813]

   74. If a bishop be accused of any crime by credible and faithful
   persons, it is necessary that he be cited by the bishops; and if he
   comes and makes his apology, and yet is convicted, let his punishment
   be determined. But if, when he is cited, he does not obey, let him be
   cited a second time, by two bishops sent to him. But if even then he
   despises them, and will not come, let the synod pass what sentence they
   please against him, that he may not appear to gain advantage by
   avoiding their judgment. [3814]

   75. Do not ye receive an heretic in a testimony against a bishop; nor a
   Christian if he be single. For the law says, "In the mouth of two or
   three witnesses every word shall be established." [3815]

   76. A bishop must not gratify his brother, or his son, or any other
   kinsman, with the episcopal dignity, or ordain whom he pleases; for it
   is not just to make heirs to episcopacy, and to gratify human
   affections in divine matters. For we must not put the Church of God
   under the laws of inheritance; but if any one shall do so, let his
   ordination be invalid, and let him be punished with suspension. [3816]

   77. If any one be maimed in an eye, or lame of his leg, but is worthy
   of the episcopal dignity, let him be made a bishop; for it is not a
   blemish of the body that can defile him, but the pollution of the soul.
   [3817]

   78. But if he be deaf and blind, let him not be made a bishop; not as
   being a defiled person, but that the ecclesiastical affairs may not be
   hindered.

   79. If any one hath a demon, let him not be made one of the clergy.
   Nay, let him not pray with the faithful; but when he is cleansed, let
   him be received; and if he be worthy, let him be ordained. [3818]

   80. It is not right to ordain him bishop presently who is just come in
   from the Gentiles, and baptized; or from a wicked mode of life: for it
   is unjust that he who has not yet afforded any trial of himself should
   be a teacher of others, unless it anywhere happens by divine grace.
   [3819]

   81. We have said that a bishop ought not to let himself into public
   administrations, but to attend on all opportunities upon the necessary
   affairs of the Church. [3820] Either therefore let him agree not to do
   so, or let him be deprived. For, "no one can serve two masters," [3821]
   according to the Lord's admonition. [3822]

   82. We do not permit servants to be ordained into the clergy without
   their masters' consent; for this would grieve those that owned them.
   For such a practice would occasion the subversion of families. But if
   at any time a servant appears worthy to be ordained into an high
   office, such as our Onesimus appeared to be, and if his master allows
   of it, and gives him his freedom, and dismisses him from his house, let
   him be ordained. [3823]

   83. Let a bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, who goes to the army, and
   desires to retain both the Roman government and the sacerdotal
   administration, be deprived. For "the things of Cæsar belong to Cæsar,
   and the things of God to God." [3824]

   84. Whosoever shall abuse the king [3825] or the governor unjustly, let
   him suffer punishment; and if he be a clergyman, let him be deprived;
   but if he be a layman, let him be suspended.

   85. Let the following books be esteemed venerable and holy by you, both
   of the clergy and laity. Of the Old Covenant: the five books of
   Moses--Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy; one of
   Joshua the son of Nun, one of the Judges, one of Ruth, four of the
   Kings, two of the Chronicles, two of Ezra, one of Esther, one of
   Judith, three of the Maccabees, one of Job, one hundred and fifty
   psalms; three books of Solomon--Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of
   Songs; sixteen prophets. And besides these, take care that your young
   persons learn the Wisdom of the very learned Sirach. But our sacred
   books, that is, those of the New Covenant, are these: the four Gospels
   of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the fourteen Epistles of Paul; two
   Epistles of Peter, three of John, one of James, one of Jude; two
   Epistles of Clement; and the Constitutions dedicated to you the bishops
   by me Clement, in eight books; which it is not fit to publish before
   all, because of the mysteries contained in them; and the Acts of us the
   Apostles. [3826]

   Let these canonical rules be established by us for you, O ye bishops;
   and if you continue to observe them, ye shall be saved, and shall have
   peace; but if you be disobedient, you shall be punished, and have
   everlasting war one with another, and undergo a penalty suitable to
   your disobedience.

   Now, God who alone is unbegotten, and the Maker of the whole world,
   unite you all through His peace, in the Holy Spirit; perfect you unto
   every good work, immoveable, unblameable, and unreprovable; and
   vouchsafe to you eternal life with us, through the mediation of His
   beloved Son Jesus Christ our God and Saviour; with whom glory be to
   Thee, the God over all, and the Father, in the Holy Spirit the
   Comforter, now and always, and for ever and ever. Amen.

   The end of the Constitutions of the Holy Apostles by Clement, which are
   the Catholic doctrine.

   [3784] [Canons 32-41 also agree with those of Antioch; see note on
   Canon 9. Some of the regulations have, however, an earlier date:
   whether they existed in this form before that time, is open to

   [3785] [This canon is divided by most editors of the Greek text;
   forming, in their enumeration, Canons 38 and 39.--R.]

   [3786] [Hefele and others regard Canons 42-44 as among the most ancient
   of this collection, and of unknown origin.--R.]

   [3787] [The substance of this canon is very ancient, Hefele thinks; but
   Drey derives it from Canons 9, 33, 34, of the Synod of Laodicea, about
   a.d. 363.--R.]

   [3789] [Very ancient, of unknown origin; repeated in canons of Elvira
   and Arles.--R.]

   [3790] From Apostolic Constitutions, vi. 11, 26.--R]

   [3791] [This canon, the last of those in the collection of Dionysius,
   is regarded as among the most recent. Of unknown origin.--R.] At the
   end of this canon, in the collection of John of Antioch, the following
   words are added: "Let him that is baptized be taught that the Father
   was not crucified, nor endured to be born of man, nor indeed that the
   Holy Spirit became man, or even endured suffering, for He was not made
   flesh; but the only begotten Son ransomed the world from the wrath
   which lay upon it: for He became man through His love of man, having
   fashioned a body for Himself from a virgin. For Wisdom built a house
   for herself as a Creator; but He willingly endured the cross, and
   rescued the world from the wrath that lies on it, namely, those who are
   baptized into the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
   But let those who do not thus baptize be suspended, as being ignorant
   of the mystery of piety." The same collection gives the following as
   Canon 51: "He who says that the Father suffered is more impious than
   the Jews, nailing along with Christ the Father also. He who denies that
   the only begotten Son was made flesh for us, and endured the cross,
   fights with God, and is an enemy of the saints. He that names the Holy
   Spirit Father or Son, is ignorant and foolish; for the Son is Creator
   along with the Father, and has the same throne, and is Lawgiver along
   with Him, and Judge, and the cause of the resurrection; and the Holy
   Spirit is the same in substance: for the Godhead has three Persons, the
   same in substance. For in our day Simon the magician gave forth his
   doctrines, drawing the speechless, delusive, unstable, and wicked
   spirit to himself, and babbling that there is one God with three names,
   and sometimes erasing the passion and birth of Christ. Do you, then,
   most beloved ones, baptize into one Father, and Son, and the Holy
   Spirit as third, according to the will of the Lord, and our
   constitution made in the spirit."

    Elucidations.

      I.

   (The Bidding Prayer, etc., [298]p. 485.)

    The Pauline Norm. [3827]

   1. Supplications.

   2. Prayers, Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs.

   3. Intercessions.

   4. General Thanksgiving. The Kiss of Peace.

   5. Anaphora. [3828]

   The Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread:

   And when He had given thanks, He brake it,

   And said, Take, eat: this is my Body, which is broken for you:

   This do in remembrance of Me.

   After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped,

   Saying, This cup is the New Testament in my Blood:

   This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me.

   For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do show the
   Lord's death till He come.

   6. Our Father, etc. [3829]

   7. Communion.

   Let us note also that the Apostle had "delivered" unto the Corinthians
   (1 Cor. xi. 23), as doubtless to others (1 Cor. vii. 17), certain
   institutions which he ordained in all the churches, and for departing
   from which he censures the Corinthians in this place (ver. 17 compared
   with ver. 2) in certain particulars. In chap. xiv. at ver. 40, he
   refers to these ordinances as a ta'xis, in the performance of which
   they were to proceed (kosmi'os) with due order, becomingly; not with
   mere decency, but with a beautiful decorum of service.

   Finally, let me suggest that there are fragments of the Apostle's
   (para'doseis) instructions everywhere scattered through his Epistles,
   such as the minute canon [3830] concerning the veiling of women in acts
   of worship, insisting upon it with a length of argument which in one of
   the Apostolic Fathers would be considered childish. He also insisted
   that his ta'xis is from the Lord.

   Fragments of the primitive hymns are also scattered through the
   Apostles' writings, as, e.g.,--


   'Egeirai ho katheu'don,

   kai` ana'sta ek ton nekron

   kai` epiphau'sei soi o Christo's. [3831]

   Of such passages the formula (dio` le'gei) "It saith" seems to be a
   frequent index.

   May we not conclude also that the sublime prayer and doxology of Eph.
   iii. 14-21 is a quotation from the Apostle's own eucharistic ta'xis for
   the whole state of Christ's Church militant?

   Might not the same be more constantly used in our days as an
   intercession for the whole flock of the one Shepherd?

      II.

   (Fulfil His constitution, [299]p. 489.)

   The Pauline Norm being borne in mind, we shall best comprehend this
   Clementine liturgy, as to its primitive claims, by taking the testimony
   of Justin, writing in Rome to the Antonines a. d.160. Referring to the
   Apology in our first volume, we observe that the order kept up in his
   day was this:--

   Now, a century later, we may suppose the original of this Clementine to
   have taken a fuller shape; of which still later this Clementine is the
   product. [3832]

   Bear in mind that the early Roman use was (Greek) borrowed wholly from
   the East; [3833] and, comparing the testimony of Justin with the
   Pauline Norm, may we not suppose that this norm in Rome was augmented
   by the Eastern uses, and so preserves a true name in that of the first
   Bishop of Rome, who accepted it from Jerusalem or Antioch?

      III.

   (That He may show this bread, etc., [300]p. 489.)

   From a recent essay by Dr. Williams, the erudite bishop of Connecticut,
   I am permitted to cite, as follows:--


   Compare the original texts thus:--

   Clementine. [3834]

   Irenæus. [3835]


   opos apophene toon arton touton soma tou Christou sou kai` to`
   pote'rion touton aima tou Christou sou ina hoi metalabontes, k.t.l.

   hopos apophene te`n thusi'an tau'ten, kai` to`n a'rton soma tou
   Christou, kai` to` pote'rion to` aima tou Christou ina hoi
   metalabo'ntes, k.t.l.


   Bishop Williams then proceeds to inquire:--

   "How is this striking agreement to be explained? Does Irenæus quote
   from the Clementine, or the Clementine from him? Or is it not much more
   likely that they are independent witnesses to primitive uses, going
   back to the period of the persecutions, and extending far beyond the
   limits of Syria or Palestine'?" [3836]

   I shall recur to these passages in the elucidations to Early Liturgies
   (infra): but here I beg the reader to consult Pfaff, to whom we owe the
   discovery of the fragment cited from Irenæus; also Grabe, in the same
   volume of Pfaff, whom I have already introduced to the reader. [3837]

      Postscript.

   The American editor had been promised the aid of his beloved friend the
   Rev. Dr. Hobart in the elucidation of the liturgies; but a sudden and
   almost fatal prostration of his health has deprived the reader of the
   admirable comments with which he would have enriched these pages, had
   Providence permitted.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3827] 1 Tim. II. 1. Compare (poieisthai) the Greek here with that of
   the LXX. in Ex. xxix. 36, 38, 39, 41; also Ex. x. 25, and so throughout
   the Old Testament. Note also Eph. v. 19 and Col. iii. 16; and the kiss,
   1 Cor. xvi. 20.

   [3828] 1 Cor. xi. 23. To me there is great significance in the fact
   that the Apostle received this as an original Gospel from the Lord
   Himself. Truly (2 Cor. xi. 5) he was not "a whit behind," even that
   chief Apostle who reclined in the bosom of the Great High Priest and
   adorable Lamb of God as He instituted the feast.

   [3829] Matt. vi. 9. For this we have the important testimony of Gregory
   the Great, as preserved to his day: that the Apostles (SS. Peter and
   Paul must have been primarily in his mind, of course) delivered no
   other "custom" to the churches (i.e., as essential) than the words of
   Institution and the Lord's Prayer. He says:--"Orationem Dominicam, mox
   post precem, dicimus, quia mos Apostolorum erat, ad ipsam solummodo
   orationem oblationis hostiam consecrare."--Epist. ad Joann. Episc.
   Syrac., lib. ix. Ep. xii., Opp., tom. id. p. 958, ed. Migne. Now, for
   the sense of post precem in the above, we have Justin Martyr for a
   primitive witness of Roman usage. He speaks of the words of Institution
   expressly (vol. i. cap. lxvi. [301]p. 185) as "the Prayer of the Logos"
   (di' euches Logou), in the use of which he makes the essential act of
   the Oblation to consist. Liturgic fulness may or may not require more,
   but the essentials are thus simple. So far, the Roman Missal to this
   day sustains the words of Gregory. It is overloaded with ceremonial,
   but does not include the noble features on which the Greeks lay so
   great stress: i.e., the conjoint Oblation and Invocation. See 1 Pet.
   ii. 5.

                               AN ANCIENT HOMILY,

      COMMONLY STYLED

THE SECOND EPISTLE OF CLEMENT.


     __________________________________________________________________

  Introductory Notice

      to the Homily Known as

  the Second Epistle of Clement.

   It is gratifying that our series is marked by tokens of critical
   progress, and not less cheering tokens of scientific research. The
   clearing-up of much that has perplexed us about Hermas; the Bryennios
   discovery; and, not least, the completion of this fragment, which has
   long been a scandal to patristic inquiry,--are surely such tokens. They
   enrich the reader with definite ideas on many collateral subjects. May
   they not stimulate American scholarship and American affluence to fresh
   enterprises of the same character for the advancement of learning, and
   the glory of the world's Redeemer and Illuminator?

   The very early date to which this homily is now assigned makes its
   slightest allusions to the New-Testament canon of very great
   importance. I have ventured to indicate a few such, even where they may
   be mere allusions, not textual quotations: as, e.g., on p. 517, at
   notes 20 and 22, slight indications of a reference to the Second
   Epistle of St. Peter and to the Apocalypse. [3838]

   I shall have occasion to refer to this work in the elucidation of the
   Liturgies which are to follow. If it be, as Bishop Lightfoot supposes,
   a homily of the second century, it may lend important retrospective aid
   to the student of these volumes in other particulars; but, having
   entrusted this interesting relic to the editorial care of a most
   competent scholar, I shall not presume to anticipate his judgment in
   any matter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3838] If this reference to 2 Pet. iii. 9 be probable, it is one of the
   earliest testimonies to the genuine character of that Epistle. The true
   Clement has two references to the same (pp. [306]8 and [307]11, vol.
   i., this series), and Justin also (vol. i. [308]p. 240) is credited
   with a similar reference to 2 Peter and the Apocalypse. See Lardner,
   Credib., vol. ii. p. 123 et seq.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Introductory Notice by Professor M. B. Riddle, D.D.

      section 1.--text.

   In this volume, pp. [309]372-376, will be found a brief account of the
   Codex discovered by Bryennios, now Metropolitan of Nicomedia. It
   remains in the library of the Jerusalem Monastery of the Holy Sepulchre
   at Constantinople. While the publication of the Greek text of the
   Teaching awakened unusual interest, the recovery of that document has
   not been the only valuable result of this important discovery. The
   Codex, as was speedily known, contains the only complete copy of the
   Greek text of the two Epistles of Clement. The lacunæ previously
   existing in the genuine Epistle were not extensive; but, as now
   appears, the Alexandrian manuscript contains only three-fifths of the
   second Epistle. The entire Greek text of both Epistles was given to the
   public by Bryennios [3839] in 1875.

   This at once led to a revision of some recent editions, notably those
   of Hilgenfeld, [3840] and of Gebhardt and Harnack. [3841] Many
   monographs soon appeared. But the discovery of a new (Syriac) source
   for the text in 1876, while not affecting the general problem, gave to
   patristic scholars more abundant critical material. Bishop Lightfoot's
   Appendix [3842] contains the most convenient and accessible collation
   of this material, as well as the most clear statements on all points
   affected by the two discoveries. The Syriac manuscript, containing a
   version of the two Epistles of Clement, was purchased by the Cambridge
   University Library in 1876, from the collection of "the late Oriental
   scholar M. Jules Mohl of Paris" (Lightfoot). It embraces the entire New
   Testament, except the Apocalypse, in the Harkleian recension of the
   Philoxenian (or later) Syriac version; but the scribe has inserted the
   two Epistles of Clement (entire) between the Catholic and Pauline
   Epistles. The value of the manuscript for New-Testament criticism is
   great, and the phenomena it presents interesting, as bearing on the
   discussion of the New-Testament canon; but the paucity of sources for
   the text of the Clementine Epistles gives special importance to the
   discovery of a version of these writings so soon after the recovery of
   the entire Greek text. A discussion of the textual questions is
   forbidden by the limits of this Introductory Notice, but a few points
   may be stated:--

   1. A comparison of the three authorities (the Alexandrian, the
   Constantinopolitan, and the Syriac), in the parts they in common
   contain, shows that the first is most trustworthy, and that the Syriac
   is usually more correct than the Constantinopolitan.

   2. Hence, in the recovered portions, the authority of the Syriac is
   very valuable in correcting the obvious blunders of the Greek copy.
   This should teach caution in accepting the text of the Teaching, where
   the same Greek manuscript is our only authority.

   3. The genuine Epistle of Clement, which stands next in age to the
   canonical books of the New Testament, now stands next in accuracy of
   text also. Doubt in regard to textual questions decreases as the
   critical material increases.

      section 2.--place and date of composition; author.

   The recovery of the entire text of the Second Epistle settles the
   question as to the purpose of the work. As was previously surmised, it
   is a homily (comp. chaps. xvii., xix., xx.); moreover, it was "read" by
   the author at public worship after the Scripture lesson (see Chap.
   xix). But as to place, date, and author, there is still diversity of
   opinion. The three questions are closely related. The view of Bishop
   Lightfoot seems, on the whole, most tenable. He regards the homily as
   of Corinthian origin, delivered, in all probability, between a. d. 120
   and 140, but the work of an unknown author, who seems to have been one
   of the presbyters of the church,--possibly the bishop. The allusions to
   the athletic games are in favour of Corinth. On this theory the title
   is thus accounted for: The genuine Epistle of Clement was addressed to
   the Corinthians, and read in the church of that city from time to time.
   This homily was probably read in the same manner, and at length united
   in a manuscript copy with the other. Each was "to the Corinthians:"
   hence it was gradually inferred that both were Epistles of Clement. Of
   this succession or movement Lightfoot finds some indications in the
   manuscript authorities.

   The internal evidence of an early date has been increased by the
   discovery of the concluding portion, but there is nothing to determine
   the exact time of composition. The distinction made in Chap. xiv.
   between the Old and New Testaments, as well as the use of the Gospel of
   the Egyptians (at the close of chap. xii.), taken in connection with
   the unmistakeable citations of New-Testament passages as of Divine
   authority, point to the first half of the second century as the
   probable period. The absence of all direct opposition to Gnosticism
   points to an origin within the same limits. All these considerations
   make against the view of Hilgenfeld, who attributes the homily to
   Clement of Alexandria, thus assigning it to the latter half of the
   second century.

   In regard to the author, nothing further is learned from the newly
   recovered portion, except the fact that he was a preacher. Even this
   does not determine his ecclesiastical position, since at that early
   date much freedom of utterance was permitted in Christian assemblies.
   It is, however, very probable that the author was a presbyter; and it
   is not improbable that he was the chief presbyter, or local bishop.

   The homily is still attributed to a person named Clement, but there are
   three theories as to what Clement. (1) Bryennios stands almost alone in
   claiming that the document is the work of Clemens Romanus. The internal
   evidence against this view was quite sufficient before the full text of
   the two Epistles was known; now it is to be regarded as abundantly
   conclusive. Even the English version of the two writings will suggest
   to the intelligent reader the points of difference. (2) As intimated
   above, Hilgenfeld regards Clement of Alexandria as the author; but this
   places the homily too late. Moreover, the writings of the Alexandrian
   Father stand immensely above this feeble, commonplace, and chaotic
   production. Even the citation from the Gospel of the Egyptians, common
   to both, [3843] is differently used by the two authors; Clement of
   Alexandria opposing the interpretation favoured in this homily, as well
   as objecting to the authority of that apocryphal Gospel. Hilgenfeld's
   argument from the word philosophein in chap. xix., is invalidated by
   the improbability of that reading; see note in loco. (3) The most
   plausible view, as Bishop Lightfoot admits, is that of Harnack. He
   assigns the homily to a third Clement, referred to, as he supposes, in
   the Shepherd of Hermas, [3844] and living somewhat later than Clement
   of Rome. In favour of this may be urged: some similarity to the
   Shepherd of Hermas, the probability that at the date of the later
   writing Clement of Rome was not living, and the easy explanation it
   affords of the traditional title. But, while a third Clement may have
   lived at Rome, we have no evidence other than the doubtful hint in the
   Shepherd. The allusion in that work seems far more appropriate to the
   well-known Clement of Rome. The argument from the later date of the
   Shepherd proves very little; not only is the date uncertain, but the
   visions are placed quite early. The editor of this series, while
   accepting a. d. 160 as the probable date of the Shepherd, regards it as
   a compilation, introducing "Hermas and Clement to identify the times
   which are idealized in his allegory." [3845] The view of Bishop
   Lightfoot, therefore, seems to be the safest.

      section 3.--character and contents.

   The style of the homily is poor. It abounds in connectives, which link
   unconnected ideas; its thought is feeble, its theology peculiar though
   not false, its arrangement confused. While it furnishes some historical
   data for practical theology, it is, in homiletical method and matter,
   in sharp contrast with the Apostolic writings and with the homilies of
   Origen. Though referring to Scripture, it has none of the virtues of
   the expository discourse; though hortatory in tone, it has little of
   the unity and directness of better sermons of that class. Its chief
   excellence is its brevity.

   It is difficult to make an analysis of the contents. The theme is the
   duty of fulfilling the commands of Christ.

   (1) This obedience is the true confession of Christ, answering to the
   greatness of His salvation; mainly in chaps. i.-iv.

   (2) Thus the Christian shows his opposition to the world; chaps.
   v.-viii.

   (3) This obedience will be rewarded in the future world; chaps.
   ix.-xvii.

   (4) The conclusion: the preacher's confession (xviii.), justification
   of his exhortation (xix.); concluding word of consolation, with
   doxology (xx.). But the treatment is not strictly logical, nor are the
   parts clearly distinguished.

   The theology shows no traces of heresy, nor does it sharply oppose any
   false doctrinal views. It lacks the dogmatic precision of a later age,
   but emphasizes rigid views of the relation of the sexes. "Repentance
   and good works seem to be the main articles of its creed. Of
   regeneration there seems to be no definite idea: to be called is the
   same as to be saved. The Church is pre-existent; the kingdom of God is
   in the future; no worth is left to this world or to the life in it. The
   principal argument urged in favour of standing firm in faith is the
   good issue of it in the next life" (C. J. H. Ropes).

   The hints given in regard to public worship agree with the famous
   description of Justin Martyr, [3846] and there are indications that the
   early freedom of exhortation had not yet disappeared. Bishop Lightfoot
   aptly concludes his dissertation with these words: "the homily itself,
   as a literary work, is almost worthless. As the earliest example of its
   kind, however, and as the product of an important age of which we
   possess only the scantiest remains, it has the highest value. Nor will
   its intellectual poverty blind us to its true grandeur, as an example
   of the lofty moral earnestness and the triumphant faith which subdued a
   reluctant world, and laid it prostrate at the foot of the cross."
   [3847]

      section 4.--the version in this volume.

   Greater unity would have been secured by a new translation of the
   entire work. Since, however, this was not possible, the aim of the
   editor has been to give the reader, as far as practicable, the benefit
   of the light shed upon the whole by the recently discovered
   authorities. The portion already translated in the Edinburgh volume has
   been supplied with critical annotations, and a few exegetical points
   have been treated. The recent editions of the Greek text have, of
   course, been consulted. The newly recovered portion has been
   re-translated. Bishop Lightfoot's version is so excellent that the
   temptation to use it was very great. It has, of course, influenced the
   editor in many places. But the following version differs from it mainly
   in two respects: (1) An effort has been made to preserve the verbal
   correspondences between the language of the homily and that of the New
   Testament: hence the English word used in the Revised Version as an
   equivalent of a Greek term is given here as a similar equivalent. (2)
   The view of the Greek tenses indicated in Lightfoot's renderings does
   not always accord with that of the editor.

   It may be added, that Professor C. J. H. Ropes of Bangor, Me., kindly
   sent, for use in the preparation of the Epistle for this volume, his
   manuscript translation and notes. These have been very helpful, and are
   entitled to this acknowledgment. It will be found that the American
   translation is less paraphrastic than the Edinburgh. The new portions,
   both text and notes, have been printed without brackets when they are
   the work of the editor. The rare additions of the general editor are
   always bracketed, that the reader may readily recognise to whom the
   literary responsibility in each case properly belongs.


   The following is the Edinburgh Introductory Notice:--


   The first certain reference which is made by any early writer to this
   so-called Epistle of Clement is found in these words of Eusebius (Hist.
   Eccl., iii. 38): "We must know that there is also a second Epistle of
   Clement. But we do not regard it as being equally notable with the
   former, since we know of none of the ancients that have made use of
   it." Several critics in modern times have endeavoured to vindicate the
   authenticity of this Epistle. But it is now generally regarded as one
   of the many writings which have been falsely ascribed to Clement.
   Besides the want of external evidence, indicated even by Eusebius in
   the above extract, the diversity of style clearly points to a different
   writer from that of the first Epistle. A commonly accepted opinion
   among critics at the present day is, that this is not an Epistle at
   all, but a fragment of one of the many homilies falsely ascribed to
   Clement. There can be no doubt, however, that in the catalogue of
   writings contained in the Alexandrian ms. it is both styled an Epistle,
   and, as well as the other which accompanies it, is attributed to
   Clement. As the ms. is certainly not later than the fifth century, the
   opinion referred to must by that time have taken firm root in the
   Church; but in the face of internal evidence, and in want of all
   earlier testimony, such a fact goes but a small way to establish its
   authenticity.

  The Homily. [3848]

      Chap. i.--we ought to think highly of christ.

   Brethren, it is fitting that you should think of Jesus Christ as of
   God,--as the Judge of the living and the dead. And it does not become
   us [3849] to think lightly [3850] of our salvation; for if we think
   little [3851] of Him, we shall also hope but to obtain little from Him.
   And those of us [3852] who hear carelessly of these things, as if they
   were of small importance, commit sin, not knowing whence we have been
   called, and by whom, and to what place, and how much Jesus Christ
   submitted to suffer for our sakes. What return, then, shall we make to
   Him? or what fruit that shall be worthy of that which He has given to
   us? For, [3853] indeed, how great are the benefits [3854] which we owe
   to Him! He has graciously given us light; as a Father, He has called us
   sons; He has saved us when we were ready to perish. What praise, then,
   shall we give to Him, or what return shall we make for the things which
   we have received? [3855] We were deficient [3856] in understanding,
   worshipping stones and wood, and gold, and silver, and brass, the works
   of men's hand; [3857] and our whole life was nothing else than death.
   Involved in blindness, and with such darkness [3858] before our eyes,
   we have received sight, and through His will have laid aside that cloud
   by which we were enveloped. For He had compassion on us, and mercifully
   saved us, observing the many errors in which we were entangled, as well
   as the destruction to which we were exposed, [3859] and that we had
   [3860] no hope of salvation except it came to us from Him. For He
   called us when we were not, [3861] and willed that out of nothing we
   should attain a real existence. [3862]

      Chap. ii.--the church, formerly barren, is now fruitful.

   "Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that
   travailest not; for she that is desolate hath many more children than
   she that hath an husband." [3863] In that He said, "Rejoice, thou
   barren that bearest not," He referred to us, for our Church was barren
   before that children were given to her. But when He said, "Cry out,
   thou that travailest not," He means this, that we should sincerely
   offer up our prayers to God, and should not, like women in travail,
   show signs of weakness. [3864] And in that He said, "For she that is
   desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband," He
   means that [3865] our people seemed to be outcast from God, but now,
   through believing, have become more numerous than those who are
   reckoned to possess God. [3866] And another Scripture saith, "I came
   not to call the righteous, but sinners." [3867] This means that those
   who are perishing must be saved. For it is indeed a great and admirable
   thing to establish, not the things which are standing, but these that
   are falling. Thus also did Christ desire [3868] to save the things
   which were perishing, [3869] and has saved many by coming and calling
   us when hastening to destruction. [3870]

      Chap. iii.--the duty of confessing christ.

   Since, then, He has displayed so great mercy towards us, and especially
   in this respect, that we who are living should not offer sacrifices to
   gods that are dead, or pay them worship, but should attain through Him
   to the knowledge of the true Father, [3871] whereby shall we show that
   we do indeed know Him, [3872] but by not denying Him through whom this
   knowledge has been attained? For He Himself declares, [3873] "Whosoever
   shall confess Me before men, him will I confess before My Father."
   [3874] This, then, is our reward if we shall confess Him by whom we
   have been saved. But in what way shall we confess Him? By doing what He
   says, and not transgressing His commandments, and by honouring Him not
   with our lips only, but with all our heart and all our mind. [3875] For
   he says [3876] in Isaiah, "This people honoureth Me with their lips,
   but their heart is far from Me." [3877]

      Chap. iv.--true confession of christ.

   Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us. For He
   saith, "Not every one that saith to Me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved, but
   he that worketh righteousness." [3878] Wherefore, brethren, let us
   confess Him by [3879] our works, by loving one another, by not
   committing adultery, or speaking evil of one another, or cherishing
   envy; but being continent, compassionate, and good. We ought also to
   sympathize with one another, and not be avaricious. By such [3880]
   works let us confess Him, [3881] and not by those that are of an
   opposite kind. And it is not fitting that we should fear men, but
   rather God. For this reason, if we should do such wicked things, the
   Lord hath said, "Even though ye were gathered together to Me [3882] in
   My very bosom, yet if ye were not to keep My commandments, I would cast
   you off, and say unto you, Depart from Me; I know you not whence ye
   are, ye workers of iniquity." [3883]

      Chap. v.--this world should be despised.

   Wherefore, brethren, leaving willingly our sojourn in this present
   world, let us do the will of Him that called us, and not fear to depart
   out of this world. For the Lord saith, "Ye shall be as lambs in the
   midst of wolves." [3884] And Peter answered and said unto Him, [3885]
   "What, then, if the wolves shall tear in pieces the lambs?" Jesus said
   unto Peter, "The lambs have no cause after they are dead to fear [3886]
   the wolves; and in like manner, fear not ye them that kill you, and can
   do nothing more unto you; but fear Him who, after you are dead, has
   power over both soul and body to cast them into hell-fire." [3887] And
   consider, [3888] brethren, that the sojourning in the flesh in this
   world is but brief and transient, but the promise of Christ is great
   and wonderful, even the rest of the kingdom to come, and of life
   everlasting. [3889] By what course of conduct, then, shall we attain
   these things, but by leading a holy and righteous life, and by deeming
   these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not fixing our desires
   upon them? For if we desire to possess them, we fall away from the path
   of righteousness. [3890]

      Chap. vi.--the present and future worlds are enemies to each other.

   Now the Lord declares, "No servant can serve two masters." [3891] If we
   desire, then, to Serve both God and mammon, it will be unprofitable for
   us. "For what will it profit if a man gain the whole world, and lose
   his own soul?" [3892] This world and the next are two enemies. The one
   urges to [3893] adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit; the other
   bids farewell to these things. We cannot therefore be the friends of
   both; and it behoves us, by renouncing the one, to make sure [3894] of
   the other. Let us reckon [3895] that it is better to hate the things
   present, since they are trifling, and transient, and corruptible; and
   to love those which are to come, as being good and incorruptible. For
   if we do the will of Christ, we shall find rest; otherwise, nothing
   shall deliver us from eternal punishment, if we disobey His
   commandments. For thus also saith the Scripture in Ezekiel, "If Noah,
   Job, and Daniel should rise up, they should not deliver their children
   in captivity." [3896] Now, if men so eminently righteous [3897] are not
   able by their righteousness to deliver their children, how can we hope
   to [3898] enter into the royal residence [3899] of God unless we keep
   our baptism holy and undefiled? Or who shall be our advocate, unless we
   be found possessed of works of holiness and righteousness? [3900]

      Chap. vii.--we must strive in order to be crowned.

   Wherefore, then, my brethren, let us struggle [3901] with all
   earnestness, knowing that the contest is in our case close at hand, and
   that many undertake long voyages to strive for a corruptible reward;
   [3902] yet all are not crowned, but those only that have laboured hard
   and striven gloriously. Let us therefore so strive, that we may all be
   crowned. Let us run the straight [3903] course, even the race that is
   incorruptible; and let us in great numbers set out [3904] for it, and
   strive that we may be crowned. And should we not all be able to obtain
   the crown, let us at least come near to it. We must remember [3905]
   that he who strives in the corruptible contest, if he be found acting
   unfairly, [3906] is taken away and scourged, and cast forth from the
   lists. What then think ye? If one does anything unseemly in the
   incorruptible contest, what shall he have to bear? For of those who do
   not preserve the seal [3907] unbroken, the Scripture saith, [3908]
   "Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and
   they shall be a spectacle to all flesh." [3909]

      Chap. viii.--the necessity of repentance while we are on earth.

   As long, therefore, as we are upon earth, let us practice repentance,
   for we are as clay in the hand of the artificer. For as the potter, if
   he make a vessel, and it be distorted or broken in his hands, fashions
   it over again; but if he have before this cast it into the furnace of
   fire, can no longer find any help for it: so let us also, while we are
   in this world, repent with our whole heart of the evil deeds we have
   done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord, while we have yet
   an opportunity of repentance. For after we have gone out of the world,
   no further power of confessing or repenting will there belong to us.
   Wherefore, brethren, by doing the will of the Father, and keeping the
   flesh holy, and observing the commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain
   eternal life. For the Lord saith in the Gospel, "If ye have not kept
   that which was small, who will commit to you the great? For I say unto
   you, that he that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also
   in much." [3910] This, then, is what He means: "Keep the flesh holy and
   the seal undefiled, that ye [3911] may receive eternal life." [3912]

      Chap. ix.--we shall be judged in the flesh.

   And let no one of you say that this very flesh shall not be judged, nor
   rise again. Consider ye [3913] in what state ye were saved, in what ye
   received sight, [3914] if not while ye were in this flesh. We must
   therefore preserve the flesh as the temple of God. For as ye were
   called in the flesh, ye shall also come to be judged in the flesh. As
   Christ [3915] the Lord who saved us, though He was first a Spirit,
   [3916] became flesh, and thus called us, so shall we also receive the
   reward in this flesh. Let us therefore love one another, that we may
   all attain to the kingdom of God. While we have an opportunity of being
   healed, let us yield ourselves to God that healeth us, and give to Him
   a recompense. Of what sort? Repentance out of a sincere heart; for He
   knows all things beforehand, and is acquainted with what is in our
   hearts. Let us therefore give Him praise, [3917] not with the mouth
   only, but also with the heart, that He may accept us as sons. For the
   Lord has said, "Those are My brethren who do the will of My Father."
   [3918]

      Chap. x.--vice is to be forsaken, and virtue followed.

   Wherefore, my brethren, let us do the will of the Father who called us,
   that we may live; and let us earnestly [3919] follow after virtue, but
   forsake every wicked tendency [3920] which would lead into
   transgression; and flee from ungodliness, lest evils overtake us. For
   if we are diligent in doing good, peace will follow us. On this
   account, such men cannot find it, i.e., peace, as are [3921] influenced
   by human terrors, and prefer rather present enjoyment to the promise
   which shall afterwards be fulfilled. For they know not what torment
   present enjoyment incurs, or what felicity is involved in the future
   promise. And if, indeed, they themselves only did such things, it would
   be the more tolerable; but now they persist in imbuing innocent souls
   with their pernicious doctrines, [3922] not knowing that they shall
   receive a double condemnation, both they and those that hear them.

      Chap. xi.--we ought to serve god, trusting in his promises.

   Let us therefore serve God with a pure heart, and we shall be
   righteous; but if we do not serve Him, because we believe not the
   promise of God, we shall be miserable. For the prophetic word also
   declares, "Wretched are those of a double mind, and who doubt in their
   heart, who say, All these things have we heard even in the times of our
   fathers; but though we have waited day by day, we have seen none of
   them accomplished. Ye fools! compare yourselves to a tree; take, for
   instance, the vine. First of all it sheds its leaves, then the bud
   appears; after that the sour grape, and then the fully-ripened fruit.
   So, likewise, my people have borne disturbances and afflictions, but
   afterwards shall they receive their good things." [3923] Wherefore, my
   brethren, let us not be of a double mind, but let us hope and endure,
   that we also may obtain the reward. For He is faithful who has promised
   that He will bestow on every one a reward according to his works. If,
   therefore, we shall do righteousness in the sight of God, we shall
   enter into His kingdom, and shall receive the promises, "which ear hath
   not heard, nor eye seen, neither have entered into the heart of man."
   [3924]

      Chap. xii.--we are constantly to look for the kingdom of god.

   Let us expect, therefore, hour by hour, the kingdom of God in love and
   righteousness, since we know not the day of the appearing of God. For
   the Lord Himself, being asked by one when His kingdom would come,
   replied, "When two shall be one, and that which is without as that
   which is within, and the male with the female, neither male nor
   female." [3925] Now, two are one when we speak the truth one to
   another, and there is unfeignedly one soul in two bodies. And "that
   which is without as that which is within" meaneth this: He calls the
   soul "that which is within," and the body "that which is without." As,
   then, thy body is visible to sight, so also let thy soul be manifest by
   good works. And "the male with the female, neither male nor female,"
   this [3926] ...


    [The newly recovered portion follows: ] [3927] --


   ... meaneth, [3928] that a brother seeing a sister should think nothing
   [3929] about her as of a female, nor she [3930] think anything about
   him as of a male. If ye do these things, saith He, [3931] the kingdom
   of my Father shall come.

      Chap. xiii.--disobedience causeth god's name to be blasphemed. [3932]

   Therefore, brethren, [3933] let us now at length repent; let us be
   sober unto what is good; for we are full of much folly and wickedness.
   Let us blot out from us our former sins, and repenting from the soul
   let us be saved; and let us not become [3934] men-pleasers, nor let us
   desire to please only one another, [3935] but also the men that are
   without, by our righteousness, that the Name [3936] be not blasphemed
   on account of us. [3937] For the Lord also saith "Continually [3938] My
   name is blasphemed among all the Gentiles," [3939] and again, "Woe
   [3940] to him on account of whom My name is blasphemed." Wherein is it
   blasphemed? In your not doing what I desire. [3941] For the Gentiles,
   when they hear from our mouth the oracles of God, [3942] marvel at them
   as beautiful and great; afterwards, when they have learned that our
   works are not worthy of the words we speak, they then turn themselves
   to blasphemy, saying that it is some fable and delusion. For when they
   hear from us that God saith, [3943] "There is no thank unto you, if ye
   love them that love you; but there is thank unto you, if ye love your
   enemies and them that hate you;" [3944] when they hear these things,
   they marvel at the excellency of the goodness; but when they see that
   we not only do not love them that hate us, but not even them that love
   us, they laugh us to scorn, and the Name is blasphemed.

      Chap. xiv.--the living church is the body of christ.

   Wherefore, [3945] brethren, if we do the will of God our father, we
   shall be of the first Church, that is, spiritual, that hath been
   created before the sun and moon; [3946] but if we do not the will of
   the Lord, we shall be of the scripture that saith, "My house was made a
   den of robbers." [3947] So then let us choose to be of the Church of
   life, [3948] that we may be saved. I do not, however, suppose ye are
   ignorant that the living Church is the body of Christ; [3949] for the
   scripture saith, "God made man, male and female." [3950] the male is
   Christ, the female is the Church. And the Books [3951] and the Apostles
   plainly declare [3952] that the Church is not of the present, but from
   the beginning. [3953] For she was spiritual, as our Jesus also was, but
   was manifested in the last days that He [3954] might save us. Now the
   Church, being spiritual, was manifested in the flesh of Christ, thus
   signifying to us that, if any of us keep [3955] her in the flesh and do
   not corrupt her, he shall receive her again [3956] in the Holy Spirit:
   for this flesh is the copy of the spirit. No one then who corrupts the
   copy, shall partake of the original. [3957] This then is what He
   meaneth, "Keep the flesh, [3958] that ye may partake of the spirit."
   But if we say that the flesh is the church and the spirit Christ,
   [3959] then he that hath shamefully used the flesh hath shamefully used
   the Church. Such a one then shall not partake of the spirit, which is
   Christ. Such life and incorruption this flesh [3960] can partake of,
   when the Holy Spirit is joined to it. No one can utter or speak "what
   the lord hath prepared" for his elect. [3961]

      Chap. xv.--faith and love the proper return to god.

   Now I do not think I have given you any light counsel concerning
   self-control, [3962] which if any one do he will not repent of it, but
   will save both himself and me who counselled him. For it is no light
   reward to turn again a wandering and perishing soul that it may be
   saved. [3963] For this is the recompense [3964] we have to return to
   God who created us, if he that speaketh and heareth both speaketh and
   heareth with faith and love. Let us therefore abide in the things which
   we believed, righteous and holy, that with boldness we may ask of God
   who saith, "While thou art yet speaking, I will say, Lo, I am here."
   [3965] For this saying is the sign of a great promise; for the Lord
   saith of Himself that He is more ready to give than he that asketh to
   ask. [3966] [3967] Being therefore partakers of so great kindness, let
   us not be envious of one another [3968] in the obtaining of so many
   good things. For as great as is the pleasure which these sayings have
   for them that have done them, so great is the condemnation they have
   for them that have been disobedient.

      Chap. xvi.--the excellence of almsgiving.

   Wherefore, brethren, having received no small occasion [3969] for
   repentance, while we have the opportunity, [3970] [3971] let us turn
   unto God that called us, while we still have Him as One that receiveth
   us. For if we renounce [3972] these enjoyments and conquer our soul in
   not doing these its evil desires, we shall partake of the mercy of
   Jesus. But ye know that the day of judgment even now "cometh as a
   burning oven," [3973] [3974] and some "of the heavens shall melt," and
   all the earth shall be as lead melting on the fire, [3975] [3976] and
   then the hidden and open works of men shall appear. Almsgiving
   therefore is a good thing, as repentance from sin; fasting is better
   than prayer, but almsgiving than both; [3977] [3978] "but love covereth
   a multitude of sins." [3979] [3980] But prayer out of a good conscience
   delivereth from death. Blessed is every one that is found full of
   these; for alms-giving lighteneth the burden of sin. [3981] [3982]

      Chap. xvii.--the danger of impenitence.

   Let us therefore repent from the whole heart, that no one of us perish
   by the way. For if we have commandments that we should also practice
   this, [3983] to draw away men from idols and instruct them, how much
   more ought a soul already knowing God not to perish! Let us therefore
   assist one another that we may also lead up those weak as to what is
   good, [3984] in order that all may be saved; and let us convert and
   admonish one another. [3985] [3986] And let us not think to give heed
   and believe now only, while we are admonished by the presbyters, but
   also when we have returned home, [3987] [3988] remembering the
   commandments [3989] of the Lord; and let us not be dragged away by
   worldly lusts, but coming [3990] more frequently let us attempt to make
   advances in the commandments of the Lord, that all being of the same
   mind [3991] we may be gathered together unto life. For the Lord said,
   "I come to gather together all the nations, tribes, and tongues."
   [3992] This He speaketh of the day of His appearing, when He shall come
   and redeem us, each one according to his works. [3993] And the
   unbelievers "shall see His glory," and strength; and they shall think
   it strange when they see the sovereignty [3994] of the world in Jesus,
   saying, Woe unto us, Thou wast He, [3995] and we did not know and did
   not believe, and we did not obey the presbyters when they declared unto
   us concerning our salvation. And "their worm dieth not, and their fire
   is not quenched, and they shall be for a spectacle unto all flesh."
   [3996] He speaketh of that day of judgment, when they shall see those
   among us [3997] that have been ungodly and acted deceitfully with the
   commandments of Jesus Christ. But the righteous who have done well and
   endured torments and hated the enjoyments of the soul, when they shall
   behold those that have gone astray and denied Jesus through their words
   or through their works, how that they are punished with grievous
   torments in unquenchable fire, shall be giving glory to God, saying,
   There will be hope for him that hath served God with his whole heart.

      Chap. xviii.--the preacher confesseth his own sinfulness.

   Let us also become of the number of them that give thanks, that have
   served God, and not of the ungodly that are judged. For I myself also,
   being an utter sinner, [3998] [3999] and not yet escaped from
   temptation, but still being in the midst of the engines [4000] of the
   devil, give diligence to follow after righteousness, that I may have
   strength to come even near it, [4001] fearing the judgment to come.

      Chap. xix.--he justifieth his exhortation.

   Wherefore, brethren and sisters, [4002] after the God of truth hath
   been heard, [4003] I read to you an entreaty [4004] that ye may give
   heed to the things that are written, in order that ye may save both
   yourselves and him that readeth among you. For as a reward I ask of you
   that ye repent with the whole heart, thus giving to yourselves
   salvation and life. For by doing this we shall set a goal [4005] for
   all the young who are minded to labour [4006] on behalf of piety and
   the goodness of God. And let us not, unwise ones that we are, be
   affronted and sore displeased, whenever some one admonisheth and
   turneth us from iniquity unto righteousness. For sometimes while we are
   practising evil things we do not perceive it on account of the
   double-mindedness and unbelief that is in our breasts, and we are
   "darkened in our understanding" [4007] by our vain lusts. Let us then
   practice righteousness that we may be saved unto the end. Blessed are
   they that obey these ordinances. Even if for a little time they suffer
   evil in the world, [4008] they shall enjoy the immortal fruit of the
   resurrection. Let not then the godly man be grieved, if he be wretched
   in the times that now are; a blessed time waits for him. He, living
   again above with the fathers, shall be joyful for an eternity without
   grief.

      Chap. xx.--concluding word of consolation. doxology.

   But neither let it trouble your understanding, that we see the
   unrighteous having riches and the servants of God straitened. Let us
   therefore, brethren and sisters, be believing: we are striving in the
   contest [4009] of the living God, we are exercised by the present life,
   in order that we may be crowned by that to come. No one of the
   righteous received fruit speedily, but awaiteth it. For if God gave
   shortly the recompense of the righteous, straightway we would be
   exercising ourselves in business, not in godliness; for we would seem
   to be righteous, while pursuing not what is godly but what is gainful.
   And on this account Divine judgment surprised a spirit that was not
   righteous, and loaded it with chains. [4010]

   To the only God invisible, [4011] the Father of truth, who sent forth
   to us the Saviour and Prince of incorruption, [4012] through whom also
   He manifested to us the truth and the heavenly life, to Him be the
   glory for ever and ever. Amen. [4013]

   the reading found in A and C, and now accepted by many editors
   (thomen); but Lightfoot adheres to the'omen (so S), and holds the
   former reading to be a corruption.--R.]

   [3904] Or, "set sail."

   [3905] Literally, "know."

   [3906] Literally "if he be found corrupting."

   [3907] Baptism is probably meant. [See Eph. i. 13 and Acts xix. 6.]

   [3908] [Or, "He saith;" "unbroken" is not necessary.--R.]

   [3909] Isa. lxvi. 24.

   [3910] Comp. Luke xvi. 10-12.

   [3911] ms. has "we," which is corrected by all editors as above. [The
   newly discovered authorities have the second person; most recent
   editors, however, adopt the first person, as lectio difficilior. So
   Lightfoot; but Hilgenfeld restores apola'bete in his second
   edition.--R.]

   [3912] Some have thought this a quotation from an unknown apocryphal
   book, but it seems rather an explanation of the preceding words.

   [3913] [Editors differ as to the punctuation. Lightfoot: "Understand
   ye. In what were ye saved? In what did ye recover your sight? if ye
   were not in the flesh." Hilgenfeld puts a comma after gnote (understand
   ye), and a period after eso'thete (saved).--R.]

   [3914] Literally, "looked up." [Both senses of anable'pein occur in New
   Testament.--R.]

   [3915] The ms. has heis, "one," which Wake follows, but it seems
   clearly a mistake for hos. [Lightfoot reads ei, with a Syriac fragment;
   both C and S have heis--R.]

   [3916] [C has here the curious reading lo'gos instead of pneuma, but
   all editors retain the latter.--R.]

   [3917] [A reads "eternal," and C, S, "praise;" Lightfoot and others
   combine the two, "eternal praise,"--R.]

   [3918] Matt. xii. 50.

   [3919] Literally, "rather."

   [3920] Literally, "malice, as it were, the precursor of our sins." Some
   deem the text corrupt.

   [3921] Literally, according to the ms., "it is not possible that a man
   should find it who are"--the passage being evidently corrupt. [The
   evidence of C and S does not clear up the difficulty here, the reading
   of these authorities being substantially that of A. Lightfoot renders:
   "For for this cause is a man unable to attain happiness, seeing that
   they call in the fears of men," etc. Hilgenfeld (2d ed.) assumes here a
   considerable gap in all the authorities, and inserts two paragraphs,
   cited in other authors as from Clement. The first and longer passage is
   from John of Damascus, and it may be accounted for as a loose citation
   from chap. xx. in the recovered portion of this Epistle. The other is
   from pseudo-Justin (Questions to the Orthodox, 74) This was formerly
   assigned by both Hilgenfeld and Lightfoot (against Harnack) to the
   First Epistle of Clement, lviii., in that portion wanting in A. But the
   recovered chapters (lviii.-lxiii.) contain, according to C and S, no
   such passage. Lightfoot thinks the reference in pseudo-Justin is to
   chap. xvi. of this homily, and that the mention of the Sibyl in the
   same author is not necessarily part of the citation from Clement. Comp.
   Lightfoot, pp. 308, 447, 448, 458, 459, and Hilgenfeld, 2d ed., pp.
   xlviii., 77.--R.]

   [3922] [Lightfoot, more literally, "but now they continue teaching evil
   to innocent souls."--R.]

   [3923] The same words occur in Clement's first epistle, chap. xxiii.

   [3924] 1 Cor. ii. 9.

   [3925] These words are quoted (Clem. Alex., Strom., iii. 9, 13) from
   the Gospel according to the Egyptians, no longer extant.

   [3926] Thus ends the ms., but what followed will be found in Clem.
   Alex. as just cited.

   [3927] For details respecting the version here given, see Introductory
   Notice, [311]pp. 514, 515.

   [3928] Or, more correctly, both here and above, "by this He meaneth."

   [3929] All editors read oude`n phrone, but C has phronei which is
   ungrammatical. In this clause, after hina we would expect meden; but as
   Lightfoot suggests, oude`n may be combined as a substantive idea with
   theluko'n; comp. the use of ou with participles.

   [3930] For mede' (so C) Gebhardt would substitute med' hede, while S
   supplies in full, quum soror videbit fratrem, an obvious
   interpretament.

   [3931] This seems to be an explanation of the saying above referred to,
   and not a citation; similar cases occur in the homily.

   [3932] The headings to the chapters have been supplied by the editor,
   but in so rambling a discourse they are in some cases necessarily
   unsatisfactory.

   [3933] Hilgenfeld reads mou instead of houn; so S apparently. The
   chapters are usually introduced with houn (nine times) or oste (five
   times).

   [3934] gino'metha; Lightfoot, "be found."

   [3935] Literally, "ourselves," heautois; but the reciprocal sense is
   common in Hellenistic Greek, and is here required by the context.

   [3936] Comp. Acts v. 41, where the correct text omits au`tou. The
   Revised Version properly capitalizes "Name" in that passage.

   [3937] C here, and in many other cases, reads humas; comparison of mss.
   shows that it is a correction of the scribe.

   [3938] Lightfoot renders dia` panto's, "every way;" but the temporal
   sense is common in Hellenistic Greek, and here required by the Hebrew.

   [3939] Isa. lii. 5, with pasin inserted.

   [3940] Lightfoot reads, kai pa'lin Ouai', following the Syriac. C has
   kai Dio'. There is difficulty in identifying this second quotation:
   comp. Ezek. xxxvi. 20-23. Lightfoot thinks it probable that the
   preacher used two different forms of Isa. lii. 5.

   [3941] This sentence is not part of the citation, but an explanation,
   the words being used as if spoken by God. The Syriac text seeks to
   avoid this difficulty by reading, "by our not doing what we say."

   [3942] Here ta` lo'gia tou Theou is used of the Scriptures, and with
   distinct reference to the New Testament; see next note.

   [3943] In view of the connection, this must mean "God in His oracles;"
   a significant testimony to the early belief in the inspiration of the
   Gospels.

   [3944] Luke vi. 27, 32, freely combined; comp. Matt. v. 44, 46. The use
   of cha'ris uemin shows that the quotation is from the former Gospel.

   [3945] oste, as at the beginning of chs. vii., x.

   [3946] Comp. Ps. lxxii. (LXX. lxxi.) 5, 17.

   [3947] Jer. vii. 11. Comp. Matt. xii. 13; Mark xi. 17; Luke xix. 46.

   [3948] Harnack says, "The Jewish synagogue is the church of death."
   Lightfoot, more correctly, accepts a contrast "between mere external
   membership in the visible body and spiritual communion in the celestial
   counterpart."

   [3949] Comp. Eph. i. 23 and many similar passages.

   [3950] Gen. i. 27; comp. Eph. v. 31-33.

   [3951] The reference is here is probably to the Old-Testament "books,"
   while the term "Apostles" may mean the New Testament in whole or part.
   The more direct reference probably is to Genesis and Ephesians.

   [3952] Lightfoot inserts in brackets legousin, delon, rendering as
   above. Hilgenfield suggests phasin oidate, "Ye know that the books,
   etc., say that." Byrennios joins this sentence to the preceding, taking
   the whole as dependent on agnoein. Ropes renders accordingly, making a
   parenthesis from "for the Scripture" to "the Church." In any case a
   verb of saying must be supplied, as in the Syriac.

   [3953] anothen has a local and a temporal sense; the latter is
   obviously preferable here.

   [3954] "Jesus" is the subject of the latter part of the sentence.

   [3955] "Keep her pure;" comp. chap. viii. Lightfoot renders terein,
   "guard," here and elsewhere.

   [3956] The verb corresponds with that rendered "partake" in what
   follows.

   [3957] "Copy," antitupos, antitupon. Comp. Heb. ix. 24; 1 Pet. iii. 21.
   Our use of "antitype" is different. The antithesis here is authentikon,
   the original, or archetype. This mystical interpretation has a Platonic
   basis.

   [3958] Comp. the close of chap. viii.

   [3959] Lightfoot calls attention to the confusion of metaphors; but
   there is also evidence of that false exegesis which made "flesh" and
   "spirit" equivalent to "body" and "soul,"--an error which always leads
   to further mistakes.

   [3960] Here the word "flesh" is used in an ambiguous sense.

   [3961] 1 Cor. ii. 9.

   [3962] peri` enkratei'as, "temperance" in the wide New-Testament sense.
   Lightfoot, "continence;" in these days the prominent danger was from
   libidinous sins.

   [3963] Comp. Jas. v. 19, 20, with which our passage has many verbal
   correspondences.

   [3964] "A favorite word with our author, especially in this
   connection."--Lightfoot.

   [3965] Isa. lviii. 9, LXX.

   [3966]

   [3967] ei's to` dido'nai tou ai'tountos; the sense of the elliptical
   construction is obviously as above.

   [3968] heautois. Here again in the reciprocal sense; comp. chap. xiii.

   [3969] aphormen labo'ntes, as in Rom. vii. 8, 11.

   [3970]

   [3971] kairo`n echontes, "seeing that we have time" (Lightfoot). But
   "opportunity" is more exact.

   [3972] apotaxo'metha, "bid farewell to;" comp. chap. vi.

   [3973]

   [3974] Comp. Mal. iv. 1.

   [3975]

   [3976] Comp. Isa. xxxiv. 4, which resembles the former clause, and 2
   Pet. iii. 7, 10, where the same figures occur. The text seems to be
   corrupt: tines ("some") is sustained by both the Greek and the Syriac,
   but this limitation is so peculiar as to awaken suspicion; still, the
   notion of several heavens might have been in the author's mind.

   [3977]

   [3978] Comp. Tobit xii. 8, 9; but the position given to almsgiving
   seems to be contradicted by the next sentence. Lightfoot seems to
   suspect a corruption of text here also, but in the early Church there
   was often an undue emphasis placed upon almsgiving.

   [3979]

   [3980] 1 Pet. iv. 8. Comp. Prov. x. 12; Jas. v. 20.

   [3981]

   [3982] Literally, "becometh a lightener (kou'phisma) of sin;" comp.
   Ecclus. iii. 30.

   [3983] Lightfoot, with Syriac, reads hina kai` touto pra'ssomen. Comits
   hina, and reads pra'ssomen, "If we have commandments and practise
   this."

   [3984] Here Lightfoot thinks a verb has probably fallen out of the
   text.

   [3985] Bryennios thus connects: "in order that all may be saved, and
   may convert," etc.

   [3986]

   [3987] "This clearly shows that the work before us is a sermon
   delivered in church" (Lightfoot). The preacher is himself one of "the
   presbyters;" comp. chap. xix. It is possible, but cannot be proven,
   that he was the head of the presbyters, the parochial bishop.

   [3988]

   [3989] entalma'ton, not the technical word for the commandments of the
   Decalogue (entolai).

   [3990] Syriac, "praying," which Lightfoot thinks may be correct; but
   prosercho'menoi might very easily be mistaken for proseucho'menoi. The
   former means coming in worship: comp. Heb. x. 1, 22.

   [3991] 2 Cor. xiii. 11; Phil. ii. 2.

   [3992] Isa. lxvi. 18. But "tribes" is inserted; comp. Dan. iii. 7. The
   phrase "shall see His glory" is from the passage in Isaiah, The
   language seems to be put into the mouth of Christ by the preacher.

   [3993] This implies various degrees of reward among these redeemed.

   [3994] to` basi'leion; not exactly "the kingdom," rather "the kingly
   rule." en to 'Iesou is rightly explained by Lightfoot, "in the hands,
   in the power, of Jesus;" xenisthesontai is rendered above "shall think
   it strange," as in 1 Pet. iv. 4, 12.

   [3995] "He" is properly supplied as frequently in the Gospels. There
   seems to be a reminiscence of John viii. 24 and similar passages.

   [3996] Isa. lxvi. 24; comp. chap. vii. above.

   [3997] C reads humin, as often, for hemin, Syriac, accepted by all
   editors.

   [3998]

   [3999] panthamartolo's; occurring only here; but a similar word,
   parthama'rtetos, occurs in the Teaching, v. 2, Apostolical
   Constitutions, vii. 18, and Barnabas, xx.

   [4000] tois orga'nois; comp. Ignat., Rom., iv., Ante-Nicene Fathers, i.
   [312]p. 75, where the word is rendered "instruments," and applied to
   the teeth of the wild beasts in the amphitheatre. Here Lightfoot
   renders "engines," regarding the metaphor as military.

   [4001] The phrase kan hengus auetes implies a doubt of attaining the
   aim, in accord with the tone of humility which obtains in this chapter.

   [4002] Comp. the opening sentence of Barnabas, "Sons and daughters,"
   Ante-Nicene Fathers, i. [313]p. 137; see also chap. xx.

   [4003] If any doubt remained as to the character of this writing, it
   would be removed by this sentence. The passage is elliptical, meta`
   to`n theo`n tes alnthei'as, but there is no doubt as to the meaning.
   The Scripture was read, and listening to it was regarded as hearing the
   voice of God, whose words of truth were read. Then followed the sermon
   or exhortation; comp. Justin, First Apology, chap. lxvii. (vol. i.
   [314]p. 186). That lessons from some at least of the New Testament were
   included at the date of this homily, seems quite certain; comp. the
   references to the New Testament in chaps. ii., iii., iv., and
   elsewhere. It is here implied that this homily was written and "read."

   [4004] The word enteuzis, here used, means intercession, or
   supplication, to God (comp. 1 Tim. ii. 1, iv. 5) in early Christian
   literature: but the classical sense is "entreaty:" so in the opening
   sentence of Justin, First Apology (vol. i. p. 163, where it is rendered
   "petition").

   [4005] Lightfoot, with Syriac and most editors, reads skopo'n; but C
   has ko'pon, so Bryennios.

   [4006] C had originally philosophein (accepted by Hilgenfeld), but was
   corrected to philoponein. The latter is confirmed by the Syriac, and
   now generally accepted, though Hilgenfeld uses the other reading to
   support his view that Clement of Alexandria was the author.

   [4007] Eph. iv. 18.

   [4008] C inserts tou'to; so Bryennios, Hilgenfeld, and others.
   Lightfoot omits, with Syriac. The punctuation above given is that of
   Bryennios and Lightfoot. Hilgenfeld joins this clause with what
   precedes.

   [4009] peiran athloumen; the construction is classical, and the figure
   common in all Greek literature.

   [4010] The verbs here are aorists, and have been rendered by the
   English past tense; the present participle (me` on di'kaion) describing
   the character of the "spirit" must, according to English usage, conform
   to the main verbs. Lightfoot says, "The aorist here has its common
   gnomic sense;" and he therefore interprets the passage as a general
   statement: "Sordid motives bring their own punishment in a judicial
   blindness." But this gnomic sense of the aorist is not common. C reads
   desmo's, which yields this sense: "and a chain weighed upon him."
   Hilgenfeld refers the passage to those Christians who suffered
   persecution for other causes than those of righteousness. Harnack
   thinks the author has in mind Satan, as the prince of avarice, and
   regards him as already loaded with chains. If the aorist is taken in
   its usual sense, this is the preferable explanation; but the meaning is
   obscure.

   [4011] 1 Tim. i. 17.

   [4012] Acts iii. 15, v. 31; comp. Heb. ii. 10.

   [4013] The doxology is interesting, as indicating the early custom of
   thus closing a homily. The practice, fitting in itself, naturally
   followed the examples in the Epistles.

  Nicene Council

The Nicene Creed.

      The Creed

   As set forth at Nicoea, [4014] a.d. 325.

   We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things,
   visible and invisible:

   And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father,
   only begotten, that is, of the substance of the Father;

   God of God; Light of light; very God of very God; begotten, not made;
   being of one substance with the Father,

   By whom all things were made, both things in heaven and things in
   earth:

   Who for us men and for our salvation came down, and was incarnate, and
   was made man:

   He suffered, and rose again the third day:

   And ascended into heaven:

   And shall come again to judge the quick and the dead.

   And in the Holy Ghost, etc. [4015]

      The Ratification.

   And those who say There was a time when He was not, or that Before He
   was begotten He was not, or that He was made out of nothing; or who say
   that The Son of God is of any other substance, or that He is changeable
   or unstable,--these the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes.

      Addenda,

   As Authorized at Constantinople, a.d. 381.

   (a) Of heaven and earth.

   (b) Begotten of the Father before all worlds.

   (c) By the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary.

   (d) Was crucified also for us, under Pontius Pilate,

   (e) And was buried.

   (f) Sitteth on the right hand of the Father,

   (g) Whose kingdom shall have no end.

   (h) The Lord, the Giver of life,

   Who proceedeth from the Father; [4016]

   Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified;

   Who spake by the prophets:

   In one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.

   We acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins.

   We look for the resurrection of the dead,

   And the life of the world to come. Amen.


   This Nicæno-Constantinopolitan Creed was solemnly ratified by the
   Council of Ephesus (a.d. 431) with the decree [4017] that "No one
   [4018] shall be permitted to introduce, write, or compose any other
   faith, [4019] besides that which was defined by the holy Fathers
   assembled in the city of Nice, with the presence of the Holy Ghost."

     __________________________________________________________________

   [4014] It was the old Creed of Jerusalem slightly amended, and made the
   liturgic symbol of Christendom, and the exponent of Catholic orthodoxy.
   Compare the Creed of Cæsarea, Burbidge, p. 334. But see this whole
   subject admirably illustrated for popular study by Burbidge, Liturgies
   and Offices of the Church, p. 330, etc., London, Bells, 1885.

   [4015] Here the k.t.l. is to be understood, as in the liturgies where a
   known form is begun and left imperfect. The clauses (see Cyril of
   Jerusalem, Catechet., lect. xviii.) are found in the Creed of
   Jerusalem, thus: "In one baptism of repentance for the remission of
   sins, and in one Holy Catholic Church; and in the resurrection of the
   flesh; and in eternal life."

   [4016] The addition of the Filioque, in the West, is theologically
   true, but of no authority here. See Pearson, On the Creed.

   [4017] Canon vii.

   [4018] No one. This re-affirms the action of Nicæa itself, and forbids
   the imposition of anything novel as a creed by any authority whatever.
   Nothing, therefore, which has not been set forth by Nicene authority
   (or by the supplementing and co-equal councils of the whole Church,
   from the same primitive sources) can be a creed, strictly speaking. It
   may be an orthodox confession, like the Quicunque Vult, but cannot be
   imposed in terms of communion, any more than the Te Deum

   [4019] Any other faith. The composition and setting north of another
   faith, as terms of communion, by Pius IV., bishop of Rome, a.d. 1564,
   and its acceptance, with additional dogmas, at the opening of the
   Vatican Council (so-called), a.d. 1869, brought the whole Papal
   communion under this anathema of Ephesus.

                                Early Liturgies.

     __________________________________________________________________


Introductory Notice

        to

the Early Liturgies.

   It is in curious contrast with the work of Brett and others like-minded
   that we have in these Edinburgh translations a reflection from the
   minds of divines who are unused to liturgies, and who have no interest
   in their elucidation. For the mere reader this is not an advantage; but
   the student who goes to the originals will find that it affords at
   times no inconsiderable help. These translations are "inartificially
   drawn," as the lawyers say. They are so much Greek and Latin rendered
   grammatically by competent scholars, who have no theories to sustain,
   and who are equally devoid of technique and of a disposition to exhibit
   it for the support of preconceptions. Not infrequently one gets a new
   view of certain stereotyped expressions from the way in which they are
   here handled. The liturgiologist finds his researches freshened by
   etymologies he had hardly thought of, here literally rendered. Of
   course, these are mere specimens, and no one can use them for argument,
   except by comparison with the Greek, or the Latin of Renaudot, or the
   originals in Syriac or Coptic; but they will prove very useful in many
   ways. The whole science is in its infancy; and we have no specimen of a
   primitive liturgy unless it be the Clementine, so called. The specimens
   here given are like cloth of gold (Ps. xlv. 13), moth-eaten and
   patched, and spangled over with tinsel; and the true artist has only
   the one object in view,--to restore it, that is, to the king's
   daughter, as it was aforetime.

   The following is the announcement of the Messrs. Clark in the Edinburgh
   edition: "The Liturgy of St. James has been translated by William
   Macdonald, M.A.; that of the Evangelist Mark by George Ross Merry,
   B.A.; and that of the Holy Apostles by Dr. Donaldson."

   It will be observed that the translations are given in the Edinburgh
   series with hardly a line of comment, and with no editorial helps to
   the reader whatever. These have been scantily supplied, here and there,
   where the case seemed to require some elucidation; and in a few
   instances I have ventured to reduce a word or two in the rendering to
   liturgical phraseology.

   The interest which has recently been awakened in liturgiology, and
   which exists among the learned so generally, will justify me in stating
   somewhat at large the considerations which are prerequisites to an
   intelligent study of these compilations. I shall not depart from my
   rule, nor formulate my personal convictions; but I must indicate
   sources of information not mentioned by the Edinburgh editors, only
   remarking, that, while they have cited the learned and excellent Dr.
   Neale, with others who advance untenable claims in some instances, I
   shall refer to writers of a more moderate school, such as have taken a
   less narrow and more historic view of the whole matter. By claiming too
   much, and by reading their own ideas back into the ancient exemplars,
   many good and learned men have overdone their argument, and confused
   scriptural simplicity with the artificial systems of post-Nicene ages.
   Earnest and worthy of respect as they are, I must therefore prefer a
   class of writers who breathe the spirit of the ante-Nicene Fathers as
   better elucidating the primitive epoch and its principles, alike in
   doctrine and worship.

   Hippolytus, in a few terse sentences, has pointed out the epoch of
   David, in its vast import, as the dawning of Christianity itself.
   [4020] [4021] More elaborately, a recent writer of great erudition has
   expounded the same historic fact, and given us the pivot of Hebrew
   history on which turns the whole system of that "goodly fellowship of
   prophets" who heralded the Sun of righteousness as successive
   constellations rise before the day. The learned Dean Payne-Smith, more
   minutely than Hippolytus, identifies Samuel, the master of David, as
   the great instrument of God in shaping the institutions of Moses to be
   a prelude to the Advent; in other words, transforming a local and
   tribal religion into that of Catholicity. The value of the Dean's
   condensed and luminous elaboration of this cardinal truth can hardly be
   overstated.

   But, to go behind even the Dean's stand-point, we shall better
   comprehend the era of which, under God, Samuel was the author, by
   noting the immense importance of that specific Mosaic ordinance which
   not only made it possible, but which proves that an all-wise prolepsis
   governed the whole law of Moses. We generally conceive of the Mosaic
   system as one of unlimited hecatombs and burnt-offerings. On the
   contrary, it was a system restricting and limiting the unsystematized
   primeval institution of sacrifice, which had done its work by passing
   into the universal religions and rituals of Gentilism. [4022] When the
   seminal idea of expiation, atonement, and the blood of innocence as a
   propitiation for guilt, was communicated to all the families of the
   earth, the Mosaic institutions limited sacrifices for the faithful, and
   localized them with marvellous significance. Previously the faithful
   everywhere had imitated the sacrifices of their fathers, Noah and
   Abraham, who reared their altars everywhere, as Job also did,--wherever
   they dwelt or sojourned. Now mark the first step towards a more
   spiritual worship, based, nevertheless, on the fundamental principle of
   sacrifice. Moses ordains as follows:--


   1. "When ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your
   God giveth you,...then there shall be a place which the Lord your God
   shall choose to cause His name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring
   all that I command you, your burnt-offerings," etc. [4023]

   2. "Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in
   every place that thou seest; but in the place which the Lord shall
   choose in one of the tribes, there thou shalt offer thy
   burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee."
   [4024]

   3. "If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put His name
   there, be too far from thee" [i.e., for frequent sacrifices; observe,
   nevertheless, the law as to the sanctity of blood in thy common use of
   meats, and forbear to sacrifice, till the opportunity comes], "only thy
   holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto
   the place which the Lord shall choose; and thou shalt offer thy
   burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the Lord
   thy God." [4025]

   4. "Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord
   thy God, in the place which He shall choose." [4026]

   5. "Thou mayest not sacrifice The Passover within any of thy
   gates;...but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place
   His name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover."


   Note, further, that all this provision and prevision was part of the
   great Messianic system, which reached its crisis in the time of David,
   as prophetic of "the Son of David."

   It was the office of Samuel to take the Mosaic ordinances just there,
   and to shape them for the advent of the Lamb of God, for His sacrifice
   upon Calvary, and for the setting-up of His universal kingdom.

   The Institutions of Samuel, therefore, were in essence institutions for
   the Gospel-day, and they were completed by the anointing of David as
   king, and by his prophetic mission to provide the Psalter (of which
   more, by and by); then the Ark came out of curtains, and the Lord chose
   and appointed the place of which Moses had spoken,--none other than the
   spot where Abraham had rehearsed in type the Sacrifice and Resurrection
   of Christ, according as it was written: [4027] "Jehovah-Jireh...in the
   mount of the Lord it shall be seen." Thus, all sacrifice acceptable to
   God was shown to have reference to the Paschal Lamb, who on that mount
   of the Lord should be sacrificed, and rise again, as was accomplished
   in a figure aforetime. [4028]

   And next, the Psalmist commemorates the putting away of the migratory
   Tabernacle, and the rest of the Ark of the Covenant in the place
   designed for the grand accomplishment of redemption ("the sure mercies
   of David"), as follows: [4029] --

   "He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of
   Ephraim: but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which He loved.
   And He built His sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which He
   hath established for ever."

   Thus, localized sacrifice was made to designate the spot where the one
   propitiatory sacrifice should be offered, "for the sins of the whole
   world;" and that spot in turn interpreted the great canon of
   redemption, [4030] --


   "Without shedding of blood is no remission:"

   and all this, being accomplished in the Messiah, passed away for ever.
   The veil of the Temple was rent when Jesus cried, "It is finished."

   And now let us note the "Institutions of Samuel." The localizing of the
   Temple-worship made way for the clearer revelation of spiritual
   sacrifices: the Temple itself was to be supplied with an expository
   liturgy. Moreover, a liturgical system, revolving about the central
   worship of the Temple, was to be brought to every man's door by the
   establishment of the synagogue for the villages of Israel. [4031] The
   synagogue-worship became, therefore, the education and preparation of
   the faithful for the simple and spiritual worship of the new law. This
   our Lord Himself expounded in the grand Catholicity of His words to the
   outcast Samaritans:--


   "The hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at
   Jerusalem, worship the Father....But the hour cometh, and now is, when
   the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth,"
   [4032] etc.

   We have seen that the hour promised by Malachi was supposed by the
   Ante-Nicene Fathers to be here intended: "My name shall be great among
   the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto My name,
   and a pure offering." [4033]

   The student of this series must have observed that the primitive
   writers were universally impressed with these principles, [4034] and
   they are essential to the study of the liturgies here introduced into
   the series by the Edinburgh editors. For other purposes, expounding the
   prophetic system, on a text of St. Peter, Dean Payne-Smith has
   incidentally elucidated these ideas so fully, and with such
   originality, that I leave the student to consult his pages, [4035] with
   only the following important hints to those who may fail to see them:--

   1. We find the prophet Samuel instituting "Schools of the Prophets,"
   out of which grew the synagogue system supplying the Rabbinical
   education to Israel, and furnishing chiefs to the synagogues. See Acts
   iii. 24; and compare 1 Sam. x. 5, xix. 20, and 1 Chron. ix. 22. [4036]

   2. We find the institution of choral worship and the chanting of
   hymns--e.g., of Moses and Miriam, and Hannah (Samuel's mother)--in full
   operation under Samuel.

   3. We find David at this juncture inspired, as "the sweet singer of
   Israel," to supply the Psalter, which in divers arrangements has
   continued among Christians to be the marrow of public worship "in every
   place," and throughout the world.

   4. The reading of the law and the prophets was now set in order; and
   not only was the Temple supplied with teachers, but also the villages
   in every tribe. [4037]

   5. Thus the Christian Church was provided with a system of worship from
   the hour of its institution, [4038] the synaxis succeeding the
   synagogue; the "ministration of the word" being enriched by Gospels and
   Epistles, by psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and by "the prayers"
   (based upon the Shemone esre) [4039] which now began to be composed and
   multiplied in the churches. Touching "free prayer" as exemplified in
   the first ages, see St. Cyprian's Epistles more especially: [4040] "Let
   us pray for the lapsed," etc.

   6. It is most significant, that, as St. Paul was not present at the
   institution of the Lord's Supper, he was, nevertheless, "not behind the
   chiefest of the Apostles," even in this. He also "received" the whole
   knowledge of the institution, and became, in so far, the author of an
   original Gospel in his details of Christ's great oblation of Himself.
   Hereupon, he adds the sacrificial expositions [4041] of the Epistle to
   the Hebrews, and "delivered the ordinances" to every church [4042]
   (kata` ta'xin), providing for order and decorum in divine offices.

   This he seems to have done as "Liturge" and "Hierurge," or evangelical
   priest, [4043] "ministering in sacrifice [4044] the Gospel of God,"
   etc.

   Compare, then, with the Scriptures, Justin Martyr's account of the
   early worship of Christians; and after consulting the (so-called)
   "Clementine Liturgy," [4045] the student will be qualified to form an
   enlightened judgment upon the primitive and the interpolated elements
   of the following liturgies. For we must bear in mind that they are
   reflected from mss., not one of which has any claim to represent the
   Ante-Nicene period. To purify them, therefore, by Scripture, and the
   truly primitive testimonies of this series, is a task yet remaining to
   be accomplished, and one which may well invoke the most conscientious
   and patient labours of the most learned in the land.

   Here follows the Edinburgh Introductory Notice:--


   The word Liturgy has a special meaning as applied to the following
   documents. It denotes the service used in the celebration of the
   Eucharist.

   Various liturgies have come down to us from antiquity; and their age,
   authorship, and genuineness have been matter of keen discussion. In our
   own country two writers on this subject stand specially prominent: the
   Rev. William Palmer, M.A., who in his Origines Liturgicæ [4046] gave a
   dissertation on Primitive Liturgies; and the Rev. J. Mason Neale, who
   devoted a large portion of his life to liturgies, edited four of them
   in his Tetralogia Liturgica, [4047] five of them in his Liturgies of
   St. Mark, St. James, St. Clement, St. Chrysostom, and St. Basil, [4048]
   and discussed them in a masterly manner in several works, but
   especially in his General Introduction to a History of the Holy Eastern
   Church [4049]

   Ancient liturgies are generally divided into four families,--the
   Liturgy of the Jerusalem Church, [4050] adopted throughout the East;
   the Alexandrian, [4051] used in Egypt and the neighbouring countries;
   and the Roman and Gallican Liturgies. To these Neale has added a fifth,
   the Liturgy of Persia or Edessa.

   There is also a liturgy not included in any of these families--the
   Clementine. It seems never to have been used in any public service. It
   forms part of the eighth book of the Apostolical Constitutions. [4052]

   The age ascribed to these documents depends very much on the
   temperament and inclination of the inquirer. Those who have great
   reverence for them think that they must have had an apostolic origin,
   that they contain the apostolic form, first handed down by tradition,
   and then committed to writing, but they allow that there is a certain
   amount of interpolation and addition of a date later than the Nicene
   Council. Such words as "consubstantial" and "mother of God" bear
   indisputable witness to this. Others think that there is no real
   historical proof of their early existence at all,--that they all belong
   to a late date, and bear evident marks of having been written long
   after the age of the apostles. [4053]

   There can scarcely be a doubt that they were not committed to writing
   till a comparatively late day. Those who think that their origin was
   apostolic allow this. "The period," says Palmer, [4054] "when liturgies
   were first committed to writing is uncertain, and has been the subject
   of some controversy. Le Brun contends that no liturgy was written till
   the fifth century; but his arguments seem quite insufficient to prove
   this, and he is accordingly opposed by Muratori and other eminent
   ritualists. It seems certain, on the other hand, that the liturgy of
   the Apostolical Constitutions was written at the end of the third or
   beginning of the fourth century; and there is no reason to deny that
   others may have been written about the same time, or not long after."

   Neale [4055] sums up the results of his study in the following words:
   "I shall content myself therefore with assuming, (1) that these
   liturgies, though not composed by the Apostles whose names they bear,
   were the legitimate development of their unwritten tradition respecting
   the Christian Sacrifice; the words, probably, in the most important
   parts, the general tenor in all portions, descending unchanged from the
   apostolic authors. (2) That the Liturgy of St. James is of earlier
   date, as to its main fabric, than a.d. 200; that the Clementine Office
   is at least not later than 260; that the Liturgy of St. Mark is nearly
   coeval with that of St. James; while those of St. Basil and St.
   Chrysostom are to be referred respectively to the saints by whom they
   purport to be composed. In all these cases, several manifest insertions
   and additions do not alter the truth of the general statement."

   1. The Roman Liturgy. The first writer who is supposed to allude to a
   Roman Liturgy is Innocentius, in the beginning of the fifth century;
   but it may well be doubted whether his words refer to any liturgy now
   extant. [4056] Some have attributed the authorship of the Roman Liturgy
   to Leo the Great, who was made bishop of Rome in a.d. 451; some to
   Gelasius, who was made bishop of Rome in a.d. 492; and some to Gregory
   the First, who was made bishop of Rome in a.d. 590. Such being the
   opinions of those who have given most study to the subject, we have not
   deemed it necessary to translate it, though Probst, in his Liturgie der
   drei ersten christlichen Jahrhunderte, [4057] probably out of affection
   for his own Church, has given it a place beside the Clementine and
   those of St. James and St. Mark.

   2. The Gallican has still less claim to antiquity. In fact, Daniel
   marks it among the spurious. [4058] Mabillon tries to prove that three
   ecclesiastics had a share in the authorship of this liturgy: Musæus,
   presbyter of Marseilles, who died after the middle of the fifth
   century; Sidonius, bishop of Auvergne, who died a.d. 494; and Hilary,
   bishop of Poictiers, who died a.d. 366. [4059] Palmer strives to show
   with great ingenuity that it is not improbable that the Gallican
   Liturgy may have been originally derived from St. John; but his
   arguments are merely conjectures.

   3. The Liturgy of St. James, the Liturgy of the Church of Jerusalem.
   Asseman, Zaccaria, Dr. Brett, Palmer, Trollope, and Neale, think that
   the main structure of this liturgy is the work of St. James, while they
   admit that it contains some evident interpolations. Leo Allatius, Bona,
   Bellarmine, Baronius, and some others, think that the whole is the
   genuine production of the apostle. Cave, Fabricius, Dupin, Le Nourry,
   Basnage, Tillemont, and many others, think that it is entirely
   destitute of any claim to an apostolic origin, and that it belongs to a
   much later age. [4060]

   "From the Liturgy of St. James," says Neale, "are derived, on the one
   hand, the forty Syro-Jacobite offices: on the other, the Cæsarean
   office, or Liturgy of St. Basil, with its offshoots; that of St.
   Chrysostom, and the Armeno-Gregorian." [4061]

   There are only two manuscripts of the Greek Liturgy of St. James,--one
   of the tenth, the other of the twelfth century,--with fragments of a
   third. [4062] The first edition appeared at Rome in 1526. In more
   recent times it has been edited by Rev. W. Trollope, M.A., [4063] Neale
   in the two works mentioned above, and Daniel in his Codex Liturgicus
   Bishop Rattray edited the Anaphora, [4064] and attempted to separate
   the original from the interpolations, "though," says Neale, "the
   supposed restoration is unsatisfactory enough." Bunsen, in his Analecta
   Ante-Nicæna, [4065] has tried to restore the Anaphora to the state in
   which it may have been in the fourth century, "as far as was
   possible--quantum fieri potuit "

   4. The Liturgy of St. Mark, the liturgy of the church of Alexandria.
   The same difference of opinion exists in regard to the age and
   genuineness of this liturgy as we found existing in regard to that of
   St. James, and the same scholars occupy the same relative position.

   The offshoots from St. Mark's Liturgy are St. Basil, St. Cyril, and St.
   Gregory, and the Ethiopic Canon or Liturgy of All Apostles. In regard
   to the Liturgy of St. Cyril, Neale says that it is "to all intents and
   purposes the same as that of St. Mark; and it seems highly probable
   that the Liturgy of St. Mark came, as we have it now, from the hands of
   St. Cyril, or, to use the expression of Abu'lberkat, that Cyril
   perfected' it." [4066]

   There is only one manuscript of the Liturgy of St. Mark, probably
   belonging to the twelfth century. The first edition appeared at Paris
   in 1583. The liturgy is given in Renaudot's Liturgiarum Orientalium
   Collectio, tom. i. pp. 120-148, [4067] in Neale's two works, and in
   Daniel's Codex Liturgicus

   5. The Liturgy of the Apostles Adæus and Maris. This liturgy has been
   brought prominently forward by Neale, who says: "It is generally passed
   over as of very inferior importance, and Renaudot alone seems to have
   been prepared to acknowledge in some degree its great antiquity."
   [4068] He thinks that it is "one of the earliest, and perhaps the very
   earliest, of the many formularies of the Christian Sacrifice." [4069]
   It is one of the three Nestorian liturgies, the other two being that of
   Nestorius and that of Theodore the interpreter.

   A Latin translation of it is given in Renaudot's Collectio, [4070]
   which is reprinted in Daniel's Codex Liturgicus It is from this version
   that our translation is made. Several prayers and hymns are indicated
   only by the initial words, and the rubrical directions are probably of
   a much later date than the text.

   The Liturgies are divided into two parts,--the part before "Lift we up
   our hearts," and the part after this. The first is termed the
   Proanaphoral Part, the second the Anaphora.

   Trollope describes what he conceives to be the form of worship in the
   early Church, thus: [4071] "The service of this day divided itself into
   two parts; at the latter of which, called in the Eastern churches
   Liturgia mystica, and in the Western Missa fidelium, none but perfect
   and approved Christians were allowed to be present. To the Missa
   Catechumenorum, or that part of the service which preceded the prayers
   peculiar to communicants only, not only believers, but Gentiles, were
   admitted, in the hope that some might possibly become converts to the
   faith. After the Psalms and Lessons with which the service commenced,
   as on ordinary occasions, a section from the Acts of the Apostles or
   the Epistles was read; after which the deacon or presbyter read the
   Gospel. Then followed an exhortation from one or more of the
   presbyters; and the bishop or president delivered a Homily or Sermon,
   explanatory, it should seem, of the Scripture which had been read, and
   exciting the people to an imitation of the virtues therein exemplified.
   When the preacher had concluded his discourse with a doxology in praise
   of the Holy Trinity, a deacon made proclamation for all infidels and
   non-communicants to withdraw; then came the dismissal of the several
   classes of catechumens, energumens, competents, and penitents, after
   the prayers for each respectively, as on ordinary days; and the Missa
   fidelium commenced. This office consisted of two parts, essentially
   distinct: viz., of prayers for the faithful, and for mankind in
   general, introductory to the Oblation; and the Anaphora or Oblation
   itself. The introductory part varied considerably in the formularies of
   different churches; but in the Anaphora all the existing liturgies so
   closely agree, in substance at least, if not in words, that they can
   only be reasonably referred to the same common origin. [4072] Their
   arrangement, indeed, is not always the same; but the following
   essential points belong, without exception, to them all:--1. The Kiss
   of Peace; 2. The form beginning, Lift up your hearts; 3. The Hymn,
   Therefore with angels, etc.; 4. Commemoration of the words of
   Institution; 5. The Oblation; 6. Prayer of Consecration; 7. Prayers for
   the Church on Earth; 8. Prayers for the Dead; 9. The Lord's Prayer; 10.
   Breaking of the Bread; 11. Communion."

   Neale gives a more minute account of the different parts of the
   service. He divides the Proanaphoral portion into parts in the
   following manner: [4073] --


   "Liturgy (or Missa) of the Catechumens.

   I.

   The Preparatory Prayers.


   II.

   The Initial Hymn or Introit.


   III.

   The Little Entrance.


   IV.

   The Trisagion.


   V.

   The Lections.


   VI.

   The Prayers after the Gospel, and expulsion of the Catechumen.




   "Liturgy (or Missa) of the Faithful.

   I.

   The Prayers for the Faithful.


   II.

   The Great Entrance.


   III.

   The Offertory.


   IV.

   The Kiss of Peace.


   V.

   The Creed."

   The Anaphora he divides into four parts in the following manner: [4074]
   --

   "The great Eucharistic Prayer.

   I.

   The Preface.


   II.

   The Prayer of the Triumphal Hymn.


   III.

   The Triumphal Hymn.


   IV.

   "The Consecration.

   VI.

   VII.

   Words of Institution of the Wine.


   VIII.

   Oblation of the Body and Blood.


   IX.

   Introductory Prayer for the Descent of the Holy Ghost.


   X.

   Prayer for the Sanctification of Elements.




   "The great Intercessory Prayer.

   XI.

   General Intercession for Quick and Dead.


   XII.

   Prayer before the Lord's Prayer.


   XIII.

   The Lord's Prayer.


   XIV.

   The Embolismus.




   "The Communion.

   XV.

   The Prayer of Inclination.


   XVI.

   The Holy Things for Holy Persons.


   XVII.

   The Fraction.


   XVII.

   The Confession.


   XIX.

   The Communion.


   XX.

   The Antidoron: and Prayers of Thanksgiving."

   The whole subject is discussed by Mr. Neale with extraordinary
   minuteness, fulness of detail, and perfect mastery of his subject; and
   to his work we refer those who wish to prosecute the study of the
   subject. [4075]


      General Note by the American Editor.

   I Have found a few less noted works most useful in my own studies,
   which began with Palmer's Origines on their first publication, followed
   up by Brett, and then by Renaudot. The publications of Drs. Neale and
   Littledale are sufficiently referred to elsewhere; and I purposely omit
   the mention of many purely Anglican authorities, as well as costly
   works from other European sources.

   1. Freeman's Principles of Divine Service, etc. [4076] A work of
   incomparable utility to those who would comprehend the Jewish ritual
   and its preparations for Christian worship.

   2. Badger's Nestorians and their Rituals [4077]

   3. Warren's Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church; [4078] replete
   with information hitherto inaccessible.

   4. Scudamore's Notitia Eucharistica; [4079] Anglican, but full of
   general information.

   5. Trevor's Catholic Doctrine of Sacrifice, etc.; [4080] a candid and
   learned study of this subject, and free from fanatical or visionary
   conceptions.

   6. Hammond's Liturgies, etc., [4081] elsewhere spoken of.

   7. Burbidge, Liturgies and Offices, [4082] of which I have only lately
   discovered the value.

   8. Field's Apostolic Liturgy and the Ep. to the Hebrews; [4083] open to
   some objections, but full of valuable and suggestive information.

   9. Pfaffius, Christ. Math. His invaluable Dissertatio de Oblatione,
   etc. [4084] A high Lutheran authority of great learning.

   10. Marriott's Testimony of the Catacombs; [4085] learned and
   instructive.

EARLY LITURGIES. [4086]

  The Divine Liturgy of James the Holy Apostle and Brother of the Lord.

      i.

   The Priest. [4087]

   I O Sovereign Lord our God, contemn me not, defiled with a multitude of
   sins: for, behold, I have come to this Thy divine and heavenly mystery,
   not as being worthy; but looking only to Thy goodness, I direct my
   voice to Thee: God be merciful to me, a sinner; I have sinned against
   Heaven, and before Thee, and am unworthy to come into the presence of
   this Thy holy and spiritual table, upon which Thy only-begotten Son,
   and our Lord Jesus Christ, is mystically set forth as a sacrifice for
   me, a sinner, and stained with every spot. Wherefore I present to Thee
   this supplication and thanksgiving, that Thy Spirit the Comforter may
   be sent down upon me, strengthening and fitting me for this service;
   and count me worthy to make known without condemnation the word,
   delivered from Thee by me to the people, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with
   whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, and good, and
   quickening, and consubstantial [4088] Spirit, now and ever, and to all
   eternity. Amen.

   Prayer of the standing beside the altar.

   II Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, the
   triune light of the Godhead, which is unity subsisting in trinity,
   divided, yet indivisible: for the Trinity is the one God Almighty,
   whose glory the heavens declare, and the earth His dominion, and the
   sea His might, and every sentient and intellectual creature at all
   times proclaims His majesty: for all glory becomes Him, and honour and
   might, greatness and magnificence, now and ever, and to all eternity.
   Amen.

   Prayer of the incense at the beginning. [4089]

   III Sovereign Lord Jesus Christ, O Word of God, who didst freely offer
   Thyself a blameless sacrifice upon the cross to God even the Father,
   the coal of double nature, that didst touch the lips of the prophet
   with the tongs, and didst take away his sins, touch also the hearts of
   us sinners, and purify us from every stain, and present us holy beside
   Thy holy altar, that we may offer Thee a sacrifice of praise: and
   accept from us, Thy unprofitable servants, this incense as an odour of
   a sweet smell, and make fragrant the evil odour of our soul and body,
   and purify us with the sanctifying power of Thy all-holy Spirit: for
   Thou alone art holy, who sanctifiest, and art communicated to the
   faithful; and glory becomes Thee, with Thy eternal Father, and Thy
   all-holy, and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all
   eternity. Amen.

   Prayer of the commencement.

   IV O beneficent King eternal, and Creator of the universe, receive Thy
   Church, coming unto Thee through Thy Christ: fulfil to each what is
   profitable; lead all to perfection, and make us perfectly worthy of the
   grace of Thy sanctification, gathering us together within Thy holy
   Church, which Thou hast purchased by the precious blood of Thy
   only-begotten Son, and our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, with whom
   Thou art blessed and glorified, together with Thy all-holy, and good,
   and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.

   The Deacon.

   V Let us again pray to the Lord.

   The Priest, prayer of the incense at the entrance of the congregation.

   God, who didst accept the gifts of Abel, the sacrifice of Noah and of
   Abram, the incense of Aaron and of Zacharias, accept also from the hand
   of us sinners this incense for an odour of a sweet smell, and for
   remission of our sins, and those of all Thy people; for blessed art
   Thou, and glory becomes Thee, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
   Spirit, now and ever.

   The Deacon.

   Sir, pronounce the blessing. [4090]

   The Priest prays.

   Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, who through exceeding goodness and love
   not to be restrained wast crucified, and didst not refuse to be pierced
   by the spear and nails; who didst provide this mysterious and awful
   service as an everlasting memorial for us perpetually: bless Thy
   ministry in Christ the God, and bless our entrance, and fully complete
   the presentation of this our service by Thy unutterable compassion, now
   and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.

   The responsive prayer from the Deacon.

   VI. The Lord bless us, and make us worthy seraphically to offer gifts,
   and to sing the oft-sung hymn of the divine Trisagion, by the fulness
   and exceeding abundance of all the perfection of holiness, now and
   ever.

   Then the Deacon begins to sing in the entrance. [4091]

   Thou who art the only-begotten Son and Word of God, immortal; who didst
   submit for our salvation to become flesh of the holy God-mother, [4092]
   and ever-virgin Mary; who didst immutably become man and wast
   crucified, O Christ our God, and didst by Thy death tread death
   underfoot; who art one of the Holy Trinity glorified together with the
   Father and the Holy Spirit, save us.

   The Priest says this prayer from the gates to the altar.

   VII God Almighty, Lord great in glory, who hast given to us an entrance
   into the Holy of Holies, through the sojourning among men of Thy
   only-begotten Son, our Lord, and God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, we
   supplicate and invoke Thy goodness, since we are fearful and trembling
   when about to stand at Thy holy altar; send forth upon us, O God, Thy
   good grace, and sanctify our souls, and bodies, and spirits, and turn
   our thoughts to piety, in order that with a pure conscience we may
   bring unto Thee gifts, offerings, and fruits for the remission of our
   transgressions, and for the propitiation of all Thy people, by the
   grace and mercies and loving-kindness of Thy only-begotten Son, with
   whom Thou art blessed to all eternity. Amen.

   After the approach to the altar, the Priest says:--

   VIII. Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Priest.

   The Lord bless us all, and sanctify us for the entrance and celebration
   of the divine and pure mysteries, giving rest to the blessed souls
   among the good and just, by His grace and loving-kindness, now and
   ever, and to all eternity. Amen.

   Then the Deacon says the bidding prayer. [4093]

   IX. In peace let us beseech the Lord.

   For the peace that is from above, and for God's love to man, and for
   the salvation of our souls, let us beseech the Lord.

   For the peace of the whole world, for the unity of all the holy
   churches of God, let us beseech the Lord.

   For the remission of our sins, and forgiveness of our transgressions,
   and for our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath, danger, and
   distress, and from the uprising of our enemies, let us beseech the
   Lord.

   Then the Singers sing the Trisagion Hymn.

   Holy God, holy mighty, holy immortal, have mercy upon us.

   Then the Priest prays, bowing.

   X. O compassionate and merciful, long-suffering, and very gracious and
   true God, look from Thy prepared dwelling-place, and hear us Thy
   suppliants, and deliver us from every temptation of the devil and of
   man; withhold not Thy aid from us, nor bring on us chastisements too
   heavy for our strength: for we are unable to overcome what is opposed
   to us; but Thou art able, Lord, to save us from everything that is
   against us. Save us, O God, from the difficulties of this world,
   according to Thy goodness, in order that, having drawn nigh with a pure
   conscience to Thy holy altar, we may send up to Thee without
   condemnation the blessed hymn Trisagion, together with the heavenly
   powers, and that, having performed the service, well pleasing to Thee
   and divine, we may be counted worthy of eternal life.

   (Aloud.)

   Because Thou art holy, Lord our God, and dwellest and abidest in holy
   places, we send up the praise and the hymn Trisagion to Thee, the
   Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and to all
   eternity.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   XI. Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Singers.

   Alleluia.

   Then there are read in order [4094] the holy oracles of the Old
   Testament, and of the prophets; and the incarnation of the Son of God
   is set forth, and His sufferings and resurrection from the dead, His
   ascension into heaven, and His second appearing with glory; and this
   takes place daily in the holy and divine service. [4095]

   After the reading and instruction the Deacon says:--

   XII. Let us all say, Lord, be merciful. [4096]

   Lord Almighty, the God of our fathers;

   We beseech Thee, hear us.

   For the peace which is from above, and for the salvation of our souls;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For the peace of the whole world, and the unity of all the holy
   churches of God;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For the salvation and help of all the Christ-loving people;

   We beseech Thee, hear us.

   For our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath, danger, distress, from
   captivity, bitter death, and from our iniquities;

   We beseech Thee, hear us.

   For the people standing round, and waiting for the rich and plenteous
   mercy that is from Thee;

   We beseech Thee, be merciful and gracious.

   Save Thy people, O Lord, and bless Thine inheritance.

   Visit Thy world in mercy and compassion.

   Exalt the horn of Christians by the power of the precious and
   quickening cross.

   We beseech Thee, most merciful Lord, hear us praying to Thee, and have
   mercy upon us.

   The People (thrice).

   Lord, have mercy upon us.

   The Deacon.

   XIII. For the remission of our sins, and forgiveness of our
   transgressions, and for our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath,
   danger, and distress, let us beseech the Lord.

   Let us all entreat from the Lord, that we may pass the whole day,
   perfect, holy, peaceful, and without sin.

   Let us entreat from the Lord a messenger of peace, a faithful guide, a
   guardian of our souls and bodies.

   Let us entreat from the Lord forgiveness and remission of our sins and
   transgressions.

   Let us entreat from the Lord the things which are good and proper for
   our souls, and peace for the world.

   Let us entreat from the Lord, that we may spend the remaining period of
   our life in peace and health.

   Let us entreat that the close of our lives may be Christian, without
   pain and without shame, and a good plea at the dread and awful
   judgment-seat of Christ.

   The Priest.

   XIV. For Thou art the gospel and the light, Saviour and keeper of our
   souls and bodies, God, and Thy only-begotten Son, and Thy all-holy
   Spirit, now and ever.

   The People.

   Amen. [4097]

   The Priest

   God, who hast taught us Thy divine and saving oracles, enlighten the
   souls of us sinners for the comprehension of the things which have been
   before spoken, so that we may not only be seen to be hearers of
   spiritual things, but also doers of good deeds, striving after
   guileless faith, blameless life, and pure conversation.

   (Aloud.)

   In Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy
   all-holy, good, and quickening Spirit, now and always, and for ever.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   XV. Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to Thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Let us bow our heads to the Lord.

   The People.

   To Thee, Lord.

   The Priest prays, saying:--

   O Sovereign giver of life, and provider of good things, who didst give
   to mankind the blessed hope of eternal life, our Lord Jesus Christ,
   count us worthy in holiness, and perfect this Thy divine service to the
   enjoyment of future blessedness.

   (Aloud.)

   So that, guarded by Thy power at all times, and led into the light of
   truth, we may send up the praise and the thanksgiving to Thee, the
   Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, now and ever.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Deacon.

   XVI. Let none remain of the catechumens, none of the unbaptized, none
   of those who are unable to join with us in prayer. Look at one another.
   [4098] The door.

   All erect: [4099] let us again pray to the Lord.

      II [4100]

   The Priest says the prayer of incense.

   Sovereign Almighty, King of Glory, who knowest all things before their
   creation, manifest Thyself to us calling upon Thee at this holy hour,
   and redeem us from the shame of our transgressions; cleanse our mind
   and our thoughts from impure desires, from worldly deceit, from all
   influence of the devil; and accept from the hands of us sinners this
   incense, as Thou didst accept the offering of Abel, and Noah, and
   Aaron, and Samuel, and of all Thy saints, guarding us from everything
   evil, and preserving us for continually pleasing, and worshipping, and
   glorifying Thee, the Father, and Thy only-begotten Son, and Thy
   all-holy Spirit, now and always, and for ever.

   And the Readers begin the Cherubic Hymn.

   Let all mortal flesh be silent, and stand with fear and trembling, and
   meditate nothing earthly within itself:--

   For the King of kings and Lord of lords, Christ our God, comes forward
   to be sacrificed, and to be given for food to the faithful; and the
   bands of angels go before Him with every power and dominion, the
   many-eyed cherubim, and the six-winged seraphim, covering their faces,
   and crying aloud the hymn, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

   The Priest, bringing in the holy gifts, [4101] says this prayer:--

   XVII. O God, our God, who didst send forth the heavenly bread, the food
   of the whole world, our Lord Jesus Christ, to be a Saviour, and
   Redeemer, and Benefactor, blessing and sanctifying us, do Thou Thyself
   bless this offering, and graciously receive it to Thy altar above the
   skies:

   Remember in Thy goodness and love those who have brought it, and those
   for whom they have brought it, and preserve us without condemnation in
   the service of Thy divine mysteries: for hollowed and glorified is Thy
   all-honoured and great name, Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, now and
   ever, and to all eternity.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The Deacon.

   Sir, pronounce the blessing.

   The Priest.

   Blessed be God, who blesseth and sanctifieth us all at the presentation
   of the divine and pure mysteries, and giveth rest to the blessed souls
   among the holy and just, now and always, and to all eternity.

   The Deacon.

   XVIII Let us attend in wisdom.

   The Priest begins.

   I believe in one God, Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and
   in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God: and the rest of the Creed.

   Then he prays, bowing his neck.

   XIX. God and Sovereign of all, make us, who are unworthy, worthy of
   this hour, lover of mankind; that being pure from all deceit and all
   hypocrisy, we may be united with one another by the bond of peace and
   love, being confirmed by the sanctification of Thy divine knowledge
   through Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
   with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, and good, and
   quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.

   The Deacon.

   XX. Let us stand well, let us stand reverently, let us stand in the
   fear of God, and with compunction of heart. In peace let us pray to the
   Lord.

   The Priest.

   For God of peace, mercy, love, compassion, and loving-kindness art
   Thou, and Thine only-begotten Son, and Thine all-holy Spirit, now and
   ever.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Let us salute one another with an holy kiss. [4102] Let us bow our
   heads to the Lord.

   The Priest bows, saying this prayer:--

   XXI. Only Lord and merciful God, on those who are bowing their necks
   before Thy holy altar, and seeking the spiritual gifts that come from
   Thee, send forth Thy good grace; and bless us all with every spiritual
   blessing, that cannot be taken from us, Thou, who dwellest on high, and
   hast regard unto things that are lowly.

   (Aloud.)

   For worthy of praise and worship and most glorious is Thy all-holy
   name, Father and Son and Holy Spirit, now and always, and to all
   eternity.

   The Deacon.

   Sir, pronounce the blessing.

   The Priest.

   The Lord will bless us, and minister with us all by His grace and
   loving-kindness.

   And again.

   The Lord will bless us, and make us worthy to stand at His holy altar,
   at all times, now and always, and for ever.

   And again.

   Blessed be God, who blesseth and sanctifieth us all in our attendance
   upon, and service of, His pure mysteries, now and always, and for ever.

   The Deacon makes the Universal Litany.

   XXII In peace let us pray to the Lord.

   The People.

   O Lord, have mercy.

   The Deacon.

   Save us, have mercy upon us, pity and keep us, O God, by Thy grace.

   For the peace that is from above, and the loving-kindness of God, and
   the salvation of our souls;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For the peace of the whole world, and the unity of all the holy
   churches of God;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For those who bear fruit, and labour honourably in the holy churches of
   God; for those who remember the poor, the widows and the orphans, the
   strangers and needy ones; and for those who have requested us to
   mention them in our prayers;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For those who are in old age and infirmity, for the sick and suffering,
   and those who are troubled by unclean spirits, for their speedy cure
   from God and their salvation;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For those who are passing their days in virginity, and celibacy, and
   discipline, and for those in holy matrimony; and for the holy fathers
   and brethren agonizing in mountains, [4103] and dens, and caves of the
   earth;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For Christians sailing, travelling, living among strangers, and for our
   brethren in captivity, in exile, in prison, and in bitter slavery,
   their peaceful return;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For the remission of our sins, and forgiveness of our transgressions,
   and for our deliverance from all tribulation, wrath, danger, and
   constraint, and uprising against us of enemies;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For favourable weather, peaceful showers, beneficent dews, abundance of
   fruits, the perfect close of a good season, and for the crown of the
   year;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For our fathers and brethren present, and praying with us in this holy
   hour, and at every season, their zeal, labour, and earnestness;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For every Christian soul in tribulation and distress, and needing the
   mercy and succour of God; for the return of the erring, the health of
   the sick, the deliverance of the captives, the rest of the fathers and
   brethren that have fallen asleep aforetime;

   Let us beseech the Lord.

   For the hearing and acceptance of our prayer before God, and the
   sending down on us His rich mercies and compassion.

   Let us beseech the Lord. [4104]

   And for the offered, precious, heavenly, unutterable, pure, glorious,
   dread, awful, divine gifts, and the salvation of the priest who stands
   by and offers them;

   Let us offer supplication to God the Lord.

   The People.

   O Lord, have mercy.

   (Thrice.)

   Then the Priest makes the sign of the cross on the gifts, [4105] and,
   standing, speaks separately thus:--

   XXIII Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will among
   men, etc.

   (Thrice.)

   Lord, Thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise.

   (Thrice.)

   Let my mouth be filled with Thy praise, O Lord, that I may tell of Thy
   glory, of Thy majesty, all the day.

   (Thrice.)

   Of the Father. Amen. And of the Son. Amen. And of the Holy Spirit.
   Amen. Now and always, and to all eternity. Amen.

   And bowing to this side and to that, [4106] he says:

   XXIV. Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.

   And they answer, bowing:--

   The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
   overshadow thee. [4107] [4108]

   Then the Priest, at great length:--

   O Sovereign Lord, who hast visited us in compassion and mercies, and
   hast freely given to us, Thy humble and sinful and unworthy servants,
   boldness to stand at Thy holy altar, and to offer to Thee this dread
   and bloodless sacrifice for our sins, and for the errors of the people,
   look upon me Thy unprofitable servant, and blot out my transgressions
   for Thy compassion's sake; and purify my lips and heart from all
   pollution of flesh and spirit; and remove from me every shameful and
   foolish thought, and fit me by the power of Thy all-holy Spirit for
   this service; and receive me graciously by Thy goodness as I draw nigh
   to Thy altar.

   And be pleased, O Lord, that these gifts brought by our hands may be
   acceptable, stooping to my weakness; and cast me not away from Thy
   presence, and abhor not my unworthiness; but pity me according to Thy
   great mercy, and according to the multitude of Thy mercies pass by my
   transgressions, that, having come before Thy glory without
   condemnation, I may be counted worthy of the protection of Thy
   only-begotten Son, and of the illumination of Thy all-holy Spirit, that
   I may not be as a slave of sin cast out, but as Thy servant may find
   grace and mercy and forgiveness of sins before Thee, both in the world
   that now is and in that which is to come.

   I beseech Thee, Almighty Sovereign, all-powerful Lord, hear my prayer;
   for Thou art He who workest all in all, and we all seek in all things
   the help and succour that come from Thee and Thy only-begotten Son, and
   the good and quickening and consubstantial Spirit, now and ever.

   XXV. O God, who through Thy great and unspeakable love didst send forth
   Thy only-begotten Son into the world, in order that He might turn back
   the lost sheep, turn not away us sinners, laying hold of Thee by this
   dread and bloodless sacrifice; for we trust not in our own
   righteousness, but in Thy good mercy, by which Thou purchasest our
   race.

   We entreat and beseech Thy goodness that it may not be for condemnation
   to Thy people that this mystery for salvation has been administered by
   us, but for remission of sins, for renewal of souls and bodies, for the
   well-pleasing of Thee, God and Father, in the mercy and love of Thy
   only-begotten Son, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy
   all-holy and good and quickening Spirit, now and always, and for ever.
   [4109]

   XXVI. O Lord God, who didst create us, and bring us into life, who hast
   shown to us ways to salvation, who hast granted to us a revelation of
   heavenly mysteries, and hast appointed us to this ministry in the power
   of Thy all-holy Spirit, grant, O Sovereign, that we may become servants
   of Thy new testament, ministers of Thy pure mysteries, and receive us
   as we draw near to Thy holy altar, according to the greatness of Thy
   mercy, that we may become worthy of offering to Thee gifts and
   sacrifices for our transgressions and for those of the people; and
   grant to us, O Lord, with all fear and a pure conscience to offer to
   Thee this spiritual and bloodless sacrifice, and graciously receiving
   it unto Thy holy and spiritual altar above the skies for an odour of a
   sweet spiritual smell, send down in answer on us the grace of Thy
   all-holy Spirit.

   And, O God, look upon us, and have regard to this our reasonable
   service, and accept it, as Thou didst accept the gifts of Abel, the
   sacrifices of Noah, the priestly offices of Moses and Aaron, the
   peace-offerings of Samuel, the repentance of David, the incense of
   Zacharias. As Thou didst accept from the hand of Thy apostles this true
   service, so accept also in Thy goodness from the hands of us sinners
   these offered gifts; and grant that our offering may be acceptable,
   sanctified by the Holy Spirit, as a propitiation [4110] for our
   transgressions and the errors of the people; and for the rest of the
   souls [4111] that have fallen asleep aforetime; that we also, Thy
   humble, sinful, and unworthy servants, being counted worthy without
   guile to serve Thy holy altar, may receive the reward of faithful and
   wise stewards, and may find grace and mercy in the terrible day of Thy
   just and good retribution.

   Prayer of the veil. [4112]

   XXVII. We thank Thee, O Lord our God, that Thou hast given us boldness
   for the entrance of Thy holy places, which Thou hast renewed to us as a
   new and living way through the veil of the flesh [4113] of Thy Christ.
   We therefore, being counted worthy to enter into the place of the
   tabernacle of Thy glory, and to be within the veil, and to behold the
   Holy of Holies, cast ourselves down before Thy goodness:

   Lord, have mercy on us: since we are full of fear and trembling, when
   about to stand at Thy holy altar, and to offer this dread and bloodless
   sacrifice for our own sins and for the errors of the people: [4114]
   send forth, O God, Thy good grace, and sanctify our souls, and bodies,
   and spirits; and turn our thoughts to holiness, that with a pure
   conscience we may bring to Thee a peace-offering, the sacrifice of
   praise:

   (Aloud.)

   By the mercy and loving-kindness of Thy only-begotten Son, with whom
   Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, and good, and quickening
   Spirit, now and always:

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The Deacon.

   Let us stand reverently, let us stand in the fear of God, and with
   contrition: let us attend to the holy communion service, to offer peace
   to God.

   The People.

   The offering of peace, the sacrifice of praise.

   The Priest [A veil is now withdrawn from the oblation of bread and
   wine.]

   And, uncovering the veils that darkly invest in symbol [4115] this
   sacred ceremonial, do Thou reveal it clearly to us: fill our
   intellectual vision with absolute light, and having purified our
   poverty from every pollution of flesh and spirit, make it worthy of
   this dread and awful approach: for Thou art an all-merciful and
   gracious God, and we send up the praise and the thanksgiving to Thee,
   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now, and always, and for ever.

      III.

      The Anaphora.

   Then he says aloud:--

   XXVIII. The love of the Lord and Father, the grace of the Lord and Son,
   and the fellowship and the gift of the Holy Spirit, be with us all.

   The People.

   And with thy spirit.

   The Priest.

   Let us lift up our minds and our hearts. [4116]

   The People.

   It is becoming and right.

   Then the Priest prays.

   Verily it is becoming and right, proper and due to praise Thee, to sing
   of Thee, to bless Thee, to worship Thee, to glorify Thee, to give Thee
   thanks, Maker of every creature visible and invisible, the treasure of
   eternal good things, the fountain of life and immortality, God and Lord
   of all:

   Whom the heavens of heavens praise, and all the host of them; the sun,
   and the moon, and all the choir of the stars; earth, sea, and all that
   is in them; Jerusalem, the heavenly assembly, and church of the
   first-born that are written in heaven; spirits of just men and of
   prophets; souls of martyrs and of apostles; angels, archangels,
   thrones, dominions, principalities, and authorities, and dread powers;
   and the many-eyed cherubim, and the six-winged seraphim, which cover
   their faces with two wings, their feet with two, and with two they fly,
   crying one to another with unresting lips, with unceasing praises:

   (Aloud.)

   With loud voice singing the victorious hymn of Thy majestic glory,
   crying aloud, praising, shouting, and saying:--

   The People.

   Holy, holy, holy, O Lord of Sabaoth, the heaven and the earth are full
   of Thy glory. Hosanna in the highest; blessed is He that cometh in the
   name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest. [4117]

   The Priest, making the sign of the cross [4118] on the gifts, says:--

   XXIX. Holy art Thou, King of eternity, and Lord and giver of all
   holiness; holy also Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by
   whom Thou hast made all things; holy also Thy Holy Spirit, which
   searches all things, even Thy deep things, O God: holy art Thou,
   almighty, all-powerful, good, dread, merciful, most compassionate to
   Thy creatures; who didst make man from earth after Thine own image and
   likeness; who didst give him the joy of paradise; and when he
   transgressed Thy commandment, and fell away, didst not disregard nor
   desert him, O Good One, but didst chasten him as at merciful father,
   call him by the law, instruct him by the prophets; and afterwards didst
   send forth Thine only-begotten Son Himself, our Lord Jesus Christ, into
   the world, that He by His coming might renew and restore Thy image;

   Who, having descended from heaven, and become flesh of the Holy Spirit
   and Virgin Godmother [4119] Mary, and having sojourned among men,
   fulfilled the dispensation for the salvation of our race; and being
   about to endure His voluntary and life-giving death by the cross, He
   the sinless for us the sinners, in the night in which He was betrayed,
   nay, rather delivered Himself up for the life and salvation of the
   world,

   Then the Priest holds the bread in his hand, and says:--

   XXX. Having taken the bread in His holy and pure and blameless and
   immortal hands, lifting up His eyes to heaven, and showing it to Thee,
   His God and Father, He gave thanks, and hallowed, and brake, and gave
   it to us, [4120] His disciples and apostles, saying:--

   The Deacons say: [4121]

   For the remission of sins and life everlasting.

   Then he says aloud:--

   Take, eat: this is my body, broken for you, and given for remission of
   sins.

   The People.

   Amen.

   Then he takes the cup, and says:--

   In like manner, after supper, He took the cup, and having mixed wine
   and water, lifting up His eyes to heaven, and presenting it to Thee,
   His God and Father, He gave thanks, and hollowed and blessed it, and
   filled it with the Holy Spirit, and gave it to us His disciples,
   saying, Drink ye all of it; this is my blood of the new testament shed
   for you and many, and distributed for the remission of sins.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   This do in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this bread, and
   drink this cup, ye do show forth the Lord's death, and confess His
   resurrection, till He come.

   The Deacons say:--

   We believe and confess:

   The People.

   We show forth Thy death, O Lord, and confess Thy resurrection.

   The Priest (Oblation).

   XXXI. Remembering, therefore, His life-giving sufferings, His saving
   cross, His death and His burial, and resurrection from the dead on the
   third day, and His ascension into heaven, and sitting at the right hand
   of Thee, our God and Father, and His second glorious and awful
   appearing, when He shall come with glory to judge the quick and the
   dead, and render to every one according to His works; even we, sinful
   men, offer unto Thee, O Lord, this dread and bloodless sacrifice,
   praying that Thou wilt not deal with us after our sins, nor reward us
   according to our iniquities;

   But that Thou, according to Thy mercy and Thy unspeakable
   loving-kindness, passing by and blotting out the handwriting against us
   Thy suppliants, wilt grant to us Thy heavenly and eternal gifts (which
   eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and which have not entered
   into the heart of man [4122] ) that thou hast prepared, O God, for
   those who love Thee; and reject not, O loving Lord, the people for my
   sake, or for my sin's sake:

   Then he says, thrice:--

   For Thy people and Thy Church supplicate Thee.

   The People.

   Have mercy on us, O Lord our God, Father Almighty.

   Again the Priest says (Invocation):--

   XXXII. Have mercy upon us, O God Almighty.

   Have mercy upon us, O God our Saviour.

   Have mercy upon us, O God, according to Thy great mercy, and send forth
   on us, and on these offered gifts, Thy all-holy Spirit.

   Then, bowing his neck, he says:--

   The sovereign and quickening Spirit, that sits upon the throne with
   Thee, our God and Father, and with Thy only-begotten Son, reigning with
   Thee; the consubstantial [4123] and co-eternal; that spoke in the law
   and in the prophets, and in Thy New Testament; that descended in the
   form of a dove on our Lord Jesus Christ at the river Jordan, and abode
   on Him; that descended on Thy apostles in the form of tongues of fire
   in the upper room of the holy and glorious Zion on the day of
   Pentecost: this Thine all-holy Spirit, send down, O Lord, upon us, and
   upon these offered holy gifts;

   And rising up, he says aloud:--

   That coming, by His holy and good and glorious appearing, He may
   sanctify this bread, and make it the holy body of Thy Christ. [4124]

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   And this cup the precious blood of Thy Christ.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest by himself standing.

   XXXIII. That they may be to all that partake of them for remission of
   sins, and for life everlasting, for the sanctification of souls and of
   bodies, for bearing the fruit of good works, for the stablishing of Thy
   Holy Catholic Church, which Thou hast founded on the Rock of Faith,
   [4125] that the gates of hell may not prevail against it; delivering it
   from all heresy and scandals, and from those who work iniquity, keeping
   it till the fulness of the time.

   And having bowed, he says:--

   XXXIV. We present them to Thee also, O Lord, for the holy places, which
   Thou hast glorified by the divine appearing of Thy Christ, and by the
   visitation of Thy all-holy Spirit; especially for the glorious Zion,
   the mother of all the churches; [4126] and for Thy Holy, Catholic, and
   Apostolic Church throughout the world: even now, O Lord, bestow upon
   her the rich gifts of Thy all-holy Spirit.

   Remember also, O Lord, our holy fathers and brethren in it, and the
   bishops in all the world, who rightly divide the word of Thy truth.

   Remember also, O Lord, every city and country, and those of the true
   faith dwelling in them, their peace and security.

   Remember, O Lord, Christians sailing, travelling, sojourning in strange
   lands; our fathers and brethren, who are in bonds, prison, captivity,
   and exile; who are in mines, and under torture, and in bitter slavery.
   Remember, O Lord, the sick and afflicted, and those troubled by unclean
   spirits, their speedy healing from Thee, O God, and their salvation.

   Remember, O Lord, every Christian soul in affliction and distress,
   needing Thy mercy and succour, O God; and the return of the erring.

   Remember, O Lord, our fathers and brethren, toiling hard, and
   ministering unto us, for Thy holy name's sake.

   Remember all, O Lord, for good: have mercy on all, O Lord, be
   reconciled to us all: give peace to the multitudes of Thy people: put
   away scandals: bring wars to an end: make the uprising of heresies to
   cease: grant Thy peace and Thy love to us, O God our Saviour, the hope
   of all the ends of the earth.

   Remember, O Lord, favourable weather, peaceful showers, beneficent
   dews, abundance of fruits, and to crown the year with Thy goodness; for
   the eyes of all wait on Thee, and Thou givest their food in due season:
   thou openest Thy hand, and fillest every living thing with gladness.

   Remember, O Lord, those who bear fruit, and labour honourably in the
   holy [4127] of Thy Church; and those who forget not the poor, the
   widows, the orphans, the strangers, and the needy; and all who have
   desired us to remember them in our prayers.

   Moreover, O Lord, be pleased to remember those who have brought these
   offerings this day to Thy holy altar, and for what each one has brought
   them or with what mind, and those persons who have just now been
   mentioned to Thee.

   Remember, O Lord, according to the multitude of Thy mercy and
   compassion, me also, Thy humble and unprofitable servant; and the
   deacons who surround Thy holy altar, and graciously give them a
   blameless life, keep their ministry undefiled, and purchase for them a
   good degree, that we may find mercy and grace, with all the saints that
   have been well pleasing to Thee since the world began, to generation
   and generation--grandsires, sires, patriarchs, prophets, apostles,
   martyrs, confessors, teachers, saints, and every just spirit made
   perfect in the faith of Thy Christ.

   XXXV. [4128] Hail, Mary, highly favoured: the Lord is with Thee;
   blessed art thou among women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb, for
   thou didst bear the Saviour of our souls. [4129]

   The Deacons.

   XXXVI. Remember us, O Lord God.

   The Priest, bowing, says:--

   Remember, O Lord God, the spirits and all flesh, of whom we have made
   mention, and of whom we have not made mention, who are of the true
   faith, from righteous Abel unto this day: unto them do Thou give rest
   there in the land of the living, in Thy kingdom, in the joy of
   paradise, in the bosom of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, our holy
   fathers; whence pain, and grief, and lamentation have fled: there the
   light of Thy countenance looks upon them, and enlightens them for ever.
   [4130]

   Make the end of our lives Christian, acceptable, blameless, and
   peaceful, O Lord, gathering us together, O Lord, under the feet of
   Thine elect, when Thou wilt, and as Thou wilt; only without shame and
   transgressions, through Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and
   Saviour Jesus Christ: for He is the only sinless one who hath appeared
   on the earth.

   The Deacon.

   And let us pray:--

   For the peace and establishing of the whole world, and of the holy
   churches of God, and for the purposes for which each one made his
   offering, or according to the desire he has: and for the people
   standing round, and for all men, and all women:

   The People.

   And for all men and all women. (Amen.)

   The Priest says aloud:--

   Wherefore, both to them and to us, do Thou in Thy goodness and love:

   The People.

   Forgive, remit, pardon, O God, our transgressions, voluntary and
   involuntary: in deed and in word: in knowledge and in ignorance: by
   night and by day: in thought and intent: in Thy goodness and love,
   forgive us them all.

   The Priest.

   Through the grace and compassion and love of Thy only-begotten Son,
   with whom Thou art blessed and glorified, together with the all-holy,
   and good, and quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   XXXVII. Peace be to all:

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Again, and continually, in peace let us pray to the Lord.

   For the gifts to the Lord God presented and sanctified, precious,
   heavenly, unspeakable, pure, glorious, dread, awful, divine;

   Let us pray.

   That the Lord our God, having graciously received them to His altar
   that is holy and above the heavens, rational and spiritual, for the
   odour of a sweet spiritual savour, may send down in answer upon us the
   divine grace and the gift of the all-holy Spirit;

   Let us pray.

   Having prayed for the unity of the faith, and the communion of His
   all-holy and adorable Spirit;

   Let us commend ourselves and one another, and our whole life, to Christ
   our God:

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest prays.

   XXXVIII. God and Father of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
   the glorious Lord, the blessed essence, the bounteous goodness, the God
   and Sovereign of all, who art blessed to all eternity, who sittest upon
   the cherubim, and art glorified by the seraphim, before whom stand
   thousand thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand hosts of angels
   and archangels: Thou hast accepted the gifts, offerings, and fruits
   brought unto Thee as an odour of a sweet spiritual smell, and hast been
   pleased to sanctify them, and make them perfect, O good One, by the
   grace of Thy Christ, and by the presence of Thy all-holy Spirit.

   Sanctify also, O Lord, our souls, and bodies, and spirits, and touch
   our understandings, and search our consciences, and cast out from us
   every evil imagination, every impure feeling, every base desire, every
   unbecoming thought, all envy, and vanity, and hypocrisy, all lying, all
   deceit, every worldly affection, all covetousness, all vainglory, all
   indifference, all vice, all passion, all anger, all malice, all
   blasphemy, every motion of the flesh and spirit that is not in
   accordance with Thy holy will:

    (Aloud.)

   And count us worthy, O loving Lord, with boldness, without
   condemnation, in a pure heart, with a contrite spirit, with unshamed
   face, with sanctified lips, to dare to call upon Thee, the holy God,
   Father in heaven, and to say,

   The People.

   Our Father, which art in heaven: hollowed be Thy name; and so on to the
   doxology.

   The Priest, bowing, says (the Embolism [4131] ):--

   And lead us not into temptation, Lord, Lord of Hosts, who knowest our
   frailty, but deliver us from the evil one and his works, and from all
   his malice and craftiness, for the sake of Thy holy name, which has
   been placed upon our humility:

   (Aloud.)

   For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, Father, Son, and
   Holy Spirit, now and for ever.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   XXXIX. Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Let us bow our heads to the Lord.

   The People.

   To Thee, O Lord.

   The Priest prays, speaking thus:--

   To Thee, O Lord, we Thy servants have bowed our heads before Thy holy
   altar, waiting for the rich mercies that are from Thee.

   Send forth upon us, O Lord, Thy plenteous grace and Thy blessing; and
   sanctify our souls, bodies, and spirits, that we may become worthy
   communicants and partakers of Thy holy mysteries, to the forgiveness of
   sins and life everlasting:

   (Aloud.)

   For adorable and glorified art Thou, our God, and Thy only-begotten
   Son, and Thy all-holy Spirit, now and ever.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest says aloud:--

   And the grace and the mercies of the holy and consubstantial, and
   uncreated, and adorable Trinity, shall be with us all. [4132]

   The People.

   And with thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   In the fear of God, let us attend.

   The Priest says secretly:-- [4133]

   O holy Lord, that abidest in holy places, sanctify us by the word of
   Thy grace, and by the visitation of Thy all-holy Spirit: for Thou, O
   Lord, hast said, Ye will be holy, for I am holy. O Lord our God,
   incomprehensible Word of God, one in substance with the Father and the
   Holy Spirit, co-eternal and indivisible, accept the pure hymn, in Thy
   holy and bloodless sacrifices; with the cherubim, and seraphim, and
   from me, a sinful man, crying and saying:--

   He takes up the gifts and saith aloud:--

   XL. The holy things unto holy.

   The People.

   One only is holy, one Lord Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the
   Father, to whom be glory to all eternity.

   The Deacon.

   XLI. For the remission of our sins, and the propitiation of our souls,
   and for every soul in tribulation and distress, needing the mercy and
   succour of God, and for the return of the erring, the healing of the
   sick, the deliverance of the captives, the rest of our fathers and
   brethren who have fallen asleep aforetime;

   Let us all say fervently, Lord, have mercy:

   The People (twelve times).

   Lord, have mercy. [4134]

   Then the Priest breaks the bread, and holds the half in his right hand,
   and the half in his left, and dips that in his right hand in the
   chalice, saying:--

   The union of the all-holy body and precious blood of our Lord and God
   and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

   Then he makes the sign of the cross on that in his left hand: then with
   that which has been signed the other half: then forthwith he begins to
   divide, and before all to give to each chalice a single piece,
   saying:--

   It has been made one, and sanctified, and perfected, in the name of the
   Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever.

   And when he makes the sign of the cross on the bread, he says:--

   Behold the Lamb of God, the Son of the Father, that taketh away the sin
   of the world, sacrificed for the life and salvation of the world.

   And when he gives a single piece to each chalice he says:--

   A holy portion of Christ, full of grace and truth, of the Father, and
   of the Holy Spirit, to whom be the glory and the power to all eternity.

   Then he begins to divide, and to say:--

   XLII. The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want. In green pastures, and
   so on. [4135]

   Then,

   I will bless the Lord at all times, and so on. [4136]

   Then,

   I will extol Thee, my God, O King, and so on. [4137]

   Then,

   O praise the Lord, all ye nations, and so on. [4138]

   The Deacon.

   Sir, pronounce the blessing.

   The Priest.

   The Lord will bless us, and keep us without condemnation for the
   communion of His pure gifts, now and always, and for ever.

   And when they have filled, [4139] the Deacon says:--

   Sir, pronounce the blessing.

   The Priest says:--

   The Lord will bless us, and make us worthy with the pure touchings of
   our fingers to take the live coal, and place it upon the mouths of the
   faithful for the purification and renewal of their souls and bodies,
   now and always.

   Then,

   O taste and see that the Lord is good; who is parted and not divided;
   distributed to the faithful and not expended; for the remission of
   sins, and the life everlasting; now and always, and for ever.

   The Deacon.

   In the peace of Christ, let us sing:

   The Singers.

   O taste and see that the Lord is good.

   The Priest says the prayer before the communion.

   O Lord our God, the heavenly bread, the life of the universe, I have
   sinned against Heaven, and before Thee, and am not worthy to partake of
   Thy pure mysteries; but as a merciful God, make me worthy by Thy grace,
   without condemnation to partake of Thy holy body and precious blood,
   for the remission of sins, and life everlasting. [4140]

   XLIII. Then he distributes to the clergy; and when the deacons take the
   disks [4141] and the chalices for distribution to the people, the
   Deacon, who takes the first disk, says:--

   Sir, pronounce the blessing.

   The Priest replies:--

   Glory to God who has sanctified and is sanctifying us all.

   The Deacon says:--

   Be Thou exalted, O God, over the heavens, and Thy glory over all the
   earth, and Thy kingdom endureth to all eternity. [4142]

   And when the Deacon is about to put it on the side-table [4143] the
   Priest says:--

   Blessed be the name of the Lord our God for ever.

   The Deacon.

   In the fear of God, and in faith and love, draw nigh.

   The People.

   Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord. [4144]

   And again, when he sets down the disk upon the side-table, he says:--

   Sir, pronounce the blessing.

   The Priest.

   Save Thy people, O God, and bless Thine inheritance.

   The Priest again. [4145]

   Glory to our God, who has sanctified us all.

   And when he has put the chalice back on the holy table, the Priest
   says:--

   Blessed be the name of the Lord to all eternity.

   The Deacons and the People say:--

   Fill our mouths with Thy praise, O Lord, and fill our lips with joy,
   that we may sing of Thy glory, of Thy greatness all the day.

   And again:--

   We render thanks to Thee, Christ our God, that Thou hast made us worthy
   to partake of Thy body and blood, for the remission of sins, and for
   life everlasting. Do Thou, in Thy goodness and love, keep us, we pray
   Thee, without condemnation.

   The prayer of incense at the last entrance.

   XLIV. We render thanks to Thee, the Saviour and God of all, for all the
   good things Thou hast given us, and for the participation of Thy holy
   and pure mysteries, and we offer to Thee this incense, praying: Keep us
   under the shadow of Thy wings, and count us worthy till our last breath
   to partake of Thy holy rites for the sanctification of our souls and
   bodies, for the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven: for Thou, O God,
   art our sanctification, and we send up praise and thanksgiving to Thee,
   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

   The Deacon begins in the entrance.

   Glory to Thee, glory to Thee, glory to Thee, O Christ the King,
   only-begotten Word of the Father, that Thou hast counted us, Thy sinful
   and unworthy servants, worthy to enjoy thy pure mysteries for the
   remission of sins, and for life everlasting: glory to Thee. [4146]

   And when he has made the entrance, the Deacon begins to speak thus:--

   XLV. Again and again, and at all times, in peace, let us beseech the
   Lord.

   That the participation of His Holy rites may be to us for the turning
   away from every wicked thing, for our support on the journey to life
   everlasting, for the communion and gift of the Holy Spirit;

   Let us pray.

   The Priest prays.

   Commemorating our all-holy, pure, most glorious, blessed Lady, the
   God-Mother and Ever-Virgin Mary, [4147] and all the saints that have
   been well-pleasing to Thee since the world began, let us devote
   ourselves, and one another, and our whole life, to Christ our God:

   The People.

   To Thee, O Lord.

   The Priest.

   XLVI. O God, who through Thy great and unspeakable love didst
   condescend to the weakness of Thy servants, and hast counted us worthy
   to partake of this heavenly table, condemn not us sinners for the
   participation of Thy pure mysteries; but keep us, O good One, in the
   sanctification of Thy Holy Spirit, that being made holy, we may find
   part and inheritance with all Thy saints that have been well-pleasing
   to Thee since the world began, in the light of Thy countenance, through
   the mercy of Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus
   Christ, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy, and
   good, and quickening Spirit: for blessed and glorified is Thy
   all-precious and glorious name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and
   ever, and to all eternity.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   XLVII. Let us bow our heads to the Lord.

   The Priest.

   O God, great and marvellous, look upon Thy servants, for we have bowed
   our heads to Thee. Stretch forth Thy hand, strong and full of
   blessings, and bless Thy people. Keep Thine inheritance, that always
   and at all times we may glorify Thee, our only living and true God, the
   holy and consubstantial [4148] Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
   now and ever, and to all eternity.

    (Aloud.)

   For unto Thee is becoming and is due praise from us all, and honour,
   and adoration, and thanksgiving, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and
   ever.

   The Deacon.

   XLVIII. In the peace of Christ let us sing:

   And again he says:--

   In the peace of Christ let us go on:

   The People.

   In the name of the Lord. Sir, pronounce the blessing. [4149]

   Dismission prayer, spoken by the Deacon.

   Going on from glory to glory, we praise Thee, the Saviour of our souls.
   Glory to Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit now and ever, and to all
   eternity. We praise Thee, the Saviour of our souls.

   The Priest says a prayer from the altar to the sacristy.

   XLIX. Going on from strength to strength, and having fulfilled all the
   divine service in Thy temple, even now we beseech Thee, O Lord our God,
   make us worthy of perfect loving-kindness; make straight our path: root
   us in Thy fear, and make us worthy of the heavenly kingdom, in Christ
   Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed, together with Thy all-holy,
   and good, and quickening Spirit, now and always, and for ever.

   The Deacon.

   L. Again and again, and at all times, in peace let us beseech the Lord.

   Prayer said in the sacristy after the dismissal.

   Thou hast given unto us, O Lord, sanctification in the communion of the
   all-holy body and precious blood of Thy only-begotten Son, our Lord
   Jesus Christ; give unto us also the grace of Thy good Spirit, and keep
   us blameless in the faith, lead us unto perfect adoption and
   redemption, and to the coming joys of eternity; for Thou art our
   sanctification and light, O God, and Thy only-begotten Son, and Thy
   all-holy Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity. Amen.

   The Deacon.

   In the peace of Christ let us keep watch.

   The Priest.

   Blessed is God, who blesseth and sanctifieth through the communion of
   the holy, and quickening, and pure mysteries, now and ever, and to all
   eternity. Amen.

   Then the prayer of propitiation.

   O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, Lamb and Shepherd, who
   takest away the sin of the world, who didst freely forgive their debt
   to the two debtors, and gavest remission of her sins to the woman that
   was a sinner, who gavest healing to the paralytic, with the remission
   of his sins; forgive, remit, pardon, O God, our offences, voluntary and
   involuntary, in knowledge and in ignorance, by transgression and by
   disobedience, which Thy all-holy Spirit knows better than Thy servants
   do:

   And if men, carnal and dwelling in this world, have in aught erred from
   Thy commandments, either moved by the devil, whether in word or in
   deed, or if they have come under a curse, or by reason of some special
   vow, I entreat and beseech Thy unspeakable loving-kindness, that they
   may be set free from their word, and released from the oath and the
   special vow, according to Thy goodness.

   Verily, O Sovereign Lord, hear my supplication on behalf of Thy
   servants, and do Thou pass by all their errors, remembering them no
   more; forgive them every transgression, voluntary and involuntary;
   deliver them from everlasting punishment: for Thou art He that hast
   commanded us, saying, Whatsoever things ye bind upon earth, shall be
   bound in heaven; and whatsoever things ye loose upon earth, shall be
   loosed in heaven: for, thou art our God, a God able to pity, and to
   save and to forgive sins; and glory is due unto Thee, with the eternal
   Father, and the quickening Spirit, now and ever, and to all eternity.
   Amen.

  The Divine Liturgy of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark, [4150] The
  Disciple of the Holy Peter. [4151]

   The Priest.

   I. Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Pray.

   The People.

   Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy.

   The Priest prays secretly: [4152] [4153]

   We give Thee thanks, yea, more than thanks, O Lord our God, the Father
   of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, for all Thy goodness at
   all times and in all places, because Thou hast shielded, rescued,
   helped, and guided us all the days of our lives, and brought us unto
   this hour, permitting us again to stand before Thee in Thy holy place,
   that we may implore forgiveness of our sins and propitiation to all Thy
   people. We pray and beseech Thee, merciful God, to grant in Thy
   goodness that we may spend this holy day [4154] and all the time of our
   lives without sin, in fulness of joy, health, safety, holiness, and
   reverence of Thee. But all envy, all fear, all temptation, all the
   influence of Satan, all the snares of wicked men, do Thou, O Lord,
   drive away from us, and from Thy Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.
   Bestow upon us, O Lord, what is good and meet. Whatever sin we commit
   in thought, word, or deed, do Thou in Thy goodness and mercy be pleased
   to pardon. Leave us not, O Lord, while we hope in Thee; nor lead us
   into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one and from his works,
   through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son.

   (In a loud voice.)

   Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, in Thy most
   holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now, henceforth, and for evermore.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   II. Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Pray for the king. [4155]

   The People.

   Lord, have mercy; [4156] Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy.

   The Priest prays.

   O God, Sovereign Lord, the Father of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus
   Christ, we pray and beseech Thee to grant that our king may enjoy
   peace, and be just and brave. Subdue under him, O God, all his
   adversaries and enemies. Gird on thy shield and armour, and rise to his
   aid. Give him the victory, O God, that his heart may be set on peace
   and the praise of Thy holy name, that we too [4157] in his peaceful
   reign [4158] may spend a calm and tranquil life in all reverence and
   godly fear, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten
   Son:

   (In a loud voice.)

   Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with Thy most
   holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now, henceforth, and for evermore.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   III. Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Pray for the papas [4159] and the bishop.

   The People.

   Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy.

   The Priest.

   O Sovereign and Almighty God, the Father of our Lord, God, and Saviour
   Jesus Christ, we pray and beseech Thee to defend in Thy good mercy our
   most holy and blessed high priest our Father in God D, and our most
   reverend Bishop D. Preserve them for us through many years in peace,
   while they according to Thy holy and blessed will fulfil the sacred
   priesthood committed to their care, and dispense aright the word of
   truth; with all the orthodox bishops, elders, deacons, sub-deacons,
   readers, singers, and laity, with the entire body of the Holy and only
   Catholic Church. Graciously bestow upon them peace, health, and
   salvation. The prayers they offer up for us, and we for them, do Thou,
   O Lord, receive at Thy holy, heavenly, and reasonable altar. But all
   the enemies of Thy Holy Church put Thou speedily under their feet,
   through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son:

   (Aloud.)

   Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with Thy
   all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now, henceforth, and for
   evermore.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   IV. Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Stand [4160] and pray.

   The People.

   Lord have mercy (thrice).

   The Priest offers up the prayer of entrance, [4161] and for incense.

   The Priest.

   O Sovereign Lord our God, who hast chosen the lamp of the twelve
   apostles with its twelve lights, and hast sent them forth to proclaim
   throughout the whole world and teach the Gospel of Thy kingdom, and to
   heal sickness and every weakness among the people, and hast breathed
   upon their faces and said unto them, Receive the Holy Spirit the
   Comforter: whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
   whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained: Breathe also Thy Holy
   Spirit upon us Thy servants, who, standing around, are about to enter
   on Thy holy service, [4162] upon the bishops, elders, deacons, readers,
   singers, and laity, with the entire body of the Holy Catholic and
   Apostolic Church.

   From the curse and execration, from condemnation, imprisonment, and
   banishment, and from the portion of the adversary;

   O Lord, deliver us.

   Purify our lives and cleanse our hearts from all pollution and from all
   wickedness, that with pure heart and conscience we may offer to Thee
   this incense for a sweet-smelling savour, and for the remission of our
   sins and the sins of all Thy people, through the grace, mercy, and love
   of Thine only-begotten Son:

   (Aloud.)

   Through whom and with whom be the glory and the power to Thee, with Thy
   all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now, henceforth, and for
   evermore.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Deacon.

   V. Stand.

   They sing:--

   Only-begotten Son and Word, [4163] etc.

   The Gospel is carried in, and the Deacon says:--

   Let us pray.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Let us pray.

   The People.

   Lord, have mercy.

   The Priest says the prayer of the Trisagion.

   O Sovereign Lord Christ Jesus, the co-eternal Word of the eternal
   Father, who wast made in all things like as we are, but without sin,
   for the salvation of our race; who hast sent forth Thy holy disciples
   and apostles to proclaim and teach the Gospel of Thy kingdom, and to
   heal all disease, all sickness among Thy people, be pleased now, O
   Lord, to send forth Thy light and Thy truth. Enlighten the eyes of our
   minds, that we may understand Thy divine oracles. Fit us to become
   hearers, and not only hearers, but doers of Thy word, that we, becoming
   fruitful, and yielding good fruit from thirty to an hundred fold, may
   be deemed worthy of the kingdom of heaven.

   (Aloud.)

   Let Thy mercy speedily overtake us, O Lord. For Thou art the bringer of
   good tidings, the Saviour and Guardian of our souls and bodies; and we
   offer glory, thanks, and the Trisagion to Thee, the Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost, now, henceforth, and for evermore.

   The People.

   Amen. Holy God, holy mighty, holy immortal. Holy, holy, holy, [4164]
   etc.

   VI. After the Trisagion the Priest makes the sign of the cross over the
   people, and says:--

   Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   Then follow the Let us attend; [4165] The Apostle and Prologue of the
   Hallelujah. [4166] The Deacons, after a prescribed form, say:--

   Lord, bless us. [4167]

   The Priest says:--

   May the Lord [4168] in His mercy bless and help us, now, henceforth,
   and for evermore.

   The Priest, before the Gospel is read, offers incense, [4169] and
   says:--

   Accept at Thy holy, heavenly, and reasonable altar, O Lord, the incense
   we offer in presence of Thy sacred glory. Send down upon us in return
   the grace of Thy Holy Spirit, for Thou art blessed, and let Thy glory
   encircle us.

   VII. The Deacon, when he is about to read the Gospel, says:--

   Lord, bless us.

   The Priest.

   May the Lord, who is the blessed God, bless and strengthen us, and make
   us hearers of His holy Gospel, now, henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.

   The Deacon.

   Stand and let us hear the holy Gospel.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   VIII. The Deacon reads the Gospel, and the Priest says the prayer of
   the Collect. [4170]

   Look down in mercy and compassion, O Lord, and heal the sick among Thy
   people.

   May all our brethren who have gone or who are about to go abroad,
   safely reach their destination in due season.

   Send down the gracious rain upon the thirsty lands, and make the rivers
   [4171] flow in full stream, according to Thy grace.

   The fruits of the land do Thou, O Lord, fill with seed and make ripe
   for the harvest.

   In peace, courage, justice, and tranquillity preserve the kingdom of
   Thy servant, whom Thou hast deemed worthy to reign over this land.

   From evil days, from famine and pestilence, from the assault of
   barbarians, defend, O Lord, this Christ-loving city, lowly and worthy
   of Thy compassion, as Thou didst spare Nineveh of old.

   For Thou art full of mercy and compassion, and rememberest not the
   iniquities of men against them.

   Thou hast said through Thy prophet Isaiah,--I will defend this city, to
   save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.

   Wherefore we pray and beseech Thee to defend in Thy good mercy this
   city, for the sake of the martyr and evangelist Mark, who has shown us
   the way of salvation through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine
   only-begotten Son.

   (Aloud.)

   Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with Thy
   all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.

   The Deacon.

   IX. Begin.

   Then they say the verse. [4172] The Deacon says--The three. [4173]

   The Priest.

   O Sovereign and Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
   pray and beseech Thee to fill our hearts with the peace of heaven, and
   to bestow moreover the peace of this life. Preserve for us through many
   years our most holy and blessed Papas D, [4174] and our most pious
   Bishop D, while they, according to Thy holy and blessed will,
   peacefully fulfil the holy priesthood committed to their care, and
   dispense aright the word of truth, with all the orthodox bishops,
   elders, deacons, sub-deacons, [4175] readers, singers, with the entire
   body of the holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. Bless our meetings, O
   Lord. Grant that we may hold them without let or hindrance, according
   to Thy holy will. Be pleased to give to us, and Thy servants after us
   for ever, houses of praise and prayer. Rise, O Lord, and let Thine
   enemies be scattered. Let all who hate Thy holy name be put to flight.
   Bless Thy faithful and orthodox people. Multiply them by thousands and
   tens of thousands. Let no deadly sin prevail against them, or against
   Thy holy people, through the grace, mercy, and love of Thine
   only-begotten Son.

   (Aloud.)

   Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with Thy
   all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Deacon.

   Take care that none of the catechumens [4176] --

  II.

   Then they sing the Cherubic hymn. [4177]

   X. The Priest offers incense at the entrance, [4178] and prays:--

   O Lord our God, who lackest nothing, accept this incense offered by an
   unworthy hand, and deem us all worthy of Thy blessing, for Thou art our
   sanctification, and we ascribe glory to Thee.

   The holy things are carried to the altar, and the Priest prays thus:--

   O holy, highest, awe-inspiring God, who dwellest among the saints,
   sanctify us, and deem us worthy of Thy reverend priesthood. Bring us to
   Thy precious altar with a good conscience, and cleanse our hearts from
   all pollution. Drive away from us all unholy thoughts, and sanctify our
   souls and minds. Grant that, with reverence of Thee, we may perform the
   service of our holy fathers, and propitiate Thy presence through all
   time; for Thou art He who blesseth and sanctifieth all things, and to
   Thee we ascribe glory and thanks.

   The Deacon.

   XI. Salute one another.

   The Priest says the prayer of salutation.

   O Sovereign and Almighty Lord, look down from heaven on Thy Church, on
   all Thy people, and on all Thy flock. Save us all, Thy unworthy
   servants, the sheep of Thy fold. Give us Thy peace, Thy help, and Thy
   love, and send to us the gift of Thy Holy Spirit, that with a pure
   heart and a good conscience we may salute one another with an holy
   kiss, without hypocrisy, and with no hostile purpose, but guileless and
   pure in one spirit, in the bond of peace and love, one body and one
   spirit, in one faith, even as we have been called in one hope of our
   calling, that we may all meet in the divine and boundless love, in
   Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom Thou art blessed.

   Then the Priest offers the incense, and says:--

   The incense is offered to Thy name. Let it ascend, we implore Thee,
   from the hands of Thy poor and sinful servants to Thy heavenly altar
   for a sweet-smelling savour, and the propitiation of all Thy people.
   For all glory, honour, adoration, and thanks are due unto Thee, the
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now, henceforth, and for evermore. Amen.

   After the Salutation, [4179] the Deacon in a loud voice says:--

   XII. Stand and make the offering duly. [4180]

   The Priest, making the sign of the cross over the disks and chalices,
   says in a loud voice (the Nicene Creed):--

   I believe in one God, etc.

   The Deacon.

   Stand for prayer.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The Deacon.

   Pray for those who present the offering.

   The Priest says the prayer of the Oblation. [4181]

   O Sovereign Lord, Christ Jesus the Word, who art equal in power with
   the Father and the Holy Spirit, the great high priest; the bread that
   came down from heaven, and saved our souls from ruin; who gavest
   Thyself, a spotless Lamb, for the life of the world....

   We pray and beseech Thee, O Lord, in Thy mercy, to let Thy presence
   rest upon this bread and these chalices [4182] on the all-holy table,
   while angels, archangels, and Thy holy priests stand round and minister
   for Thy glory and the renewing of our souls, through the grace, mercy,
   and love of Thine only-begotten Son, through whom and with whom be
   glory and power to Thee.

   And when the People say,

   And from the Holy Spirit was He made flesh;

   The Priest makes the sign of the cross, [4183] and says:--

   And was crucified for us.

   The Priest makes the sign of the cross again, [4184] and says:--

   And to the Holy Spirit.

  III.

   XIII. [4185] In like manner also, as after the Creed, [4186] he makes
   the sign of the cross upon the People, and says aloud:--

   The Lord be with all.

   The People.

   And with thy spirit.

   The Priest.

   Let us lift up our hearts.

   The People.

   We lift them up to the Lord.

   The Priest.

   Let us give thanks to the Lord.

   The People.

   It is meet and right. [4187]

   The Priest begins the Anaphoral prayer.

   O Lord God, Sovereign and Almighty Father, truly it is meet and right,
   holy and becoming, and good for our souls, to praise, bless, and thank
   Thee; to make open confession to Thee by day and night with voice,
   lips, and heart without ceasing;

   To Thee who hast made the heaven, and all that is therein; the earth,
   and all that is therein; The sea, fountains, rivers, lakes, and all
   that is therein;

   To Thee who, after Thine own image and likeness, hast made man, upon
   whom Thou didst also bestow the joys of Paradise;

   And when he trespassed against Thee, Thou didst neither neglect nor
   forsake him, good Lord,

   But didst recall him by Thy law, instruct him by Thy prophets, restore
   and renew him by this awful, life-giving, and heavenly mystery.

   And all this Thou hast done by Thy Wisdom and the Light of truth, Thine
   only-begotten Son, our Lord, God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, Through
   whom, thanking Thee with Him and the Holy Spirit,

   We offer this reasonable and bloodless sacrifice, which all nations,
   from the rising to the setting of the sun, from the north and the
   south, present to Thee, O Lord; for great is Thy name among all
   peoples, and in all places are incense, sacrifice, and oblation offered
   to Thy holy name. [4188]

   XIV. We pray and beseech Thee, O lover of men, O good Lord, [4189]
   remember in Thy good mercy the Holy and only Catholic and Apostolic
   Church throughout the whole world, and all Thy people, and all the
   sheep of this fold. [4190] Vouchsafe to the hearts of all of us the
   peace of heaven, but grant us also the peace of this life.

   Guide and direct in all peace the king, [4191] army, magistrates,
   councils, [4192] peoples, and neighbourhoods, and all our outgoings and
   incomings.

   O King of Peace, grant us Thy peace in unity and love. May we be Thine,
   O Lord; for we know no other God but Thee, and name no other name but
   Thine. Give life unto the souls of all of us, and let no deadly sin
   prevail against us, or against all Thy people.

   Look down in mercy and compassion, O Lord, and heal the sick among Thy
   people. Deliver them and us, O Lord, from sickness and disease, and
   drive away the spirit of weakness.

   Raise up those who have been long afflicted, and heal those who are
   vexed with unclean spirits.

   Have mercy on all who are in prison, or in mines, or on trial, or
   condemned, or in exile, or crushed by cruel bondage or tribute. Deliver
   them, O Lord, for Thou art our God, who settest the captives free; who
   raisest up the downtrodden; who givest hope to the hopeless, and help
   to the helpless; who liftest up the fallen; who givest refuge to the
   shipwrecked, and vengeance to the oppressed.

   Pity, relieve, and restore every Christian soul that is afflicted or
   wandering.

   But do Thou, O Lord, the physician of our souls and bodies, the
   guardian of all flesh, look down, and by Thy saving power heal all the
   diseases of soul and body.

   Guide and prosper our brethren who have gone or who are about to go
   abroad. Whether they travel by land, or river, or lake, by public road,
   or in whatever way journeying, bring them everywhere to a safe and
   tranquil haven. Be pleased to be with them by land and sea, and restore
   them in health and joy to joyful and healthful homes.

   Ever defend, O Lord, our journey through this life from trouble and
   storm.

   Send down rich and copious showers on the dry and thirsty lands.

   Gladden and revive the face of the earth, that it may spring forth and
   rejoice in the raindrops.

   Make the waters of the river flow in full stream.

   Gladden and revive the face of the earth with the swelling waters.

   Fill all the channels of the streams, and multiply the fruits of the
   earth.

   Bless, O Lord, the fruits of the earth, and keep them safe and
   unharmed. Fill them with seed, and make them ripe for the harvest.

   Bless even now, O Lord, Thy yearly crown of blessing for the sake of
   the poor of Thy people, the widow, the orphan, and the stranger, and
   for the sake of all of us who have our hope in Thee and call upon Thy
   holy name; for the eyes of all are upon Thee, and Thou givest them
   bread in due season.

   O Thou who givest food to all flesh, fill our hearts with joy and
   gladness, that at all times, having all sufficiency, we may abound to
   every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   O King of kings and Lord of lords, defend the kingdom of Thy servant,
   our orthodox and Christ-loving sovereign, [4193] whom Thou hast deemed
   worthy to reign over this land in peace, courage, and justice.

   Subdue under him, O Lord, every enemy and adversary, whether at home or
   abroad. Gird on Thy shield and armour, and rise to his aid. Draw Thy
   sword, and help him to fight against them that persecute him. Shield
   him in the day of battle, and grant that the fruit of his loins may sit
   upon his throne.

   Be kind to him, O Lord, for the sake of Thy Holy and Apostolic Church,
   and all Thy Christ-loving people, that we too in his peaceful reign may
   live a calm and tranquil life, in all reverence and godliness.

   O Lord our God, give peace to the souls of our fathers and brethren who
   have fallen asleep in Jesus, remembering our forefathers of old, our
   fathers, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, confessors, bishops,
   and the souls of all the holy and just men who have died in the Lord.

   Especially remember those whose memory we this day celebrate, and our
   holy father Mark, [4194] the apostle and evangelist, who has shown us
   the way of salvation. [4195]

   The Deacon.

   Lord, bless us.

   The Priest.

   The Lord will bless thee in His grace, now, henceforth, and for
   evermore.

   The Deacon reads the record of the dead. [4196]

   The Priest bows and prays.

   XV. Give peace, O Sovereign Lord our God, to the souls of all who dwell
   in the tabernacles of Thy saints. Graciously bestow upon them in Thy
   kingdom Thy promised blessing, which eye hath not seen, and ear hath
   not heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man what Thou, O God,
   hast prepared for those who love Thy holy name. Give peace to their
   souls, and deem them worthy of the kingdom of heaven. [4197]

   Grant that we may end our lives as Christians, acceptable unto Thee and
   without sin, and be pleased to give us part and lot with all Thy
   saints.

   Accept, O God, by Thy ministering archangels at Thy holy, heavenly, and
   reasonable altar in the spacious heavens, the thank-offerings of those
   who offer sacrifice and oblation, and of those who desire to offer much
   or little, in secret or openly, but have it not to give.

   Accept the thank-offerings of those who have presented them this day,
   as Thou didst accept the gifts of Thy righteous Abel:

   The Priest offers incense, and says: [4198] --

   As Thou didst accept the sacrifice of our father Abraham, the incense
   of Zacharias, the alms of Cornelius, and the widow's two mites, accept
   also the thank-offerings of these, and give them for the things of time
   the things of eternity, and for the things of earth the things of
   heaven. Defend, O Lord, our most holy and blessed Papas [4199] D, whom
   Thou hast fore-ordained to rule over Thy Holy Catholic and Apostolic
   Church, and our most pious Bishop D, that they through many years of
   peace may, according to Thy holy and blessed will, fulfil the sacred
   priesthood committed to their care, and dispense aright the word of
   truth.

   Remember the orthodox bishops everywhere, the elders, deacons,
   sub-deacons, readers, singers, monks, [4200] virgins, widows, and
   laity.

   Remember, O Lord, the holy city [4201] of our God, Jesus Christ; and
   the imperial city; [4202] and this city of ours, and all cities and all
   lands, and the peace and safety of those who dwell therein in the
   orthodox faith of Christ.

   Be mindful, O Lord, of the return of the back-sliding, and of every
   Christian soul that is afflicted and oppressed, and in need of Thy
   divine mercy and help.

   Be mindful, O Lord, of our brethren in captivity. Grant that they may
   find mercy and compassion with those who have led them captive.

   Be mindful also of us, O Lord, Thy sinful and unworthy servants, and
   blot out our sins in Thy goodness and mercy.

   Be mindful also of me, Thy lowly, sinful, and unworthy servant, and in
   Thy mercy blot out my sins. Be with us, O Lord, who minister unto Thy
   holy name.

   Bless our meetings, O Lord.

   Utterly uproot idolatry from the world. [4203]

   Crush under our feet Satan, and all his wicked influence.

   Humble now, as at all times, the enemies of Thy Church.

   Lay bare their pride.

   Speedily show them their weakness.

   Bring to naught the wicked plots they contrive against us.

   Arise, O Lord, and let Thine enemies be scattered, and let all who hate
   Thy holy name be put to flight.

   Do Thou bless a thousand times ten thousand Thy faithful and orthodox
   people while they do Thy holy will.

   The Deacon.

   Let those who are seated stand.

   The Priest says the following prayer:--

   Deliver the captive; rescue the distressed feed the hungry; comfort the
   faint-hearted, convert the erring; enlighten the darkened; raise the
   fallen; confirm the wavering; heal the sick; and guide them all, good
   Lord, into the way of salvation, and into Thy sacred fold. Deliver us
   from our iniquities; protect and defend us at all times.

   The Deacon.

   Turn to the east.

   The Priest bows and prays.

   For Thou art far above all principality, and power, and might, and
   dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in
   that which is to come. Round Thee stand ten thousand times ten
   thousand, and thousands of thousands of holy angels and hosts of
   archangels; and Thy two most honoured creatures, the many-eyed cherubim
   and the six-winged seraphim. With twain they cover their faces, and
   with twain they cover their feet, and with twain they do fly; and they
   cry one to another for ever with the voice of praise, and glorify Thee,
   O Lord, singing aloud the triumphal and thrice-holy [4204] hymn to Thy
   great glory:--

   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of Thy
   glory.

   (Aloud.)

   Thou dost ever sanctify all men; but with all who glorify Thee, receive
   also, O Sovereign Lord, our sanctification, who with them celebrate Thy
   praise, and say:--

   The People.

   Holy, holy, holy Lord.

   The Priest makes the sign of the cross over the sacred mysteries.

   XVI. For truly heaven and earth are full of Thy glory, through the
   manifestation of our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Fill, O
   God, this sacrifice with Thy blessing, through the inspiration of Thy
   all-holy Spirit. For the Lord Himself, our God and universal King,
   Christ Jesus, reclining at meat the same night on which He delivered
   Himself up for our sins and died in the flesh for all, took bread in
   His holy, pure, and immaculate hands, and lifting His eyes to His
   Father, our God, and the God of all, gave thanks; and when He had
   blessed, hallowed, and broken the bread, gave it to His holy and
   blessed disciples and apostles, saying:--

   (Aloud.)

   Take, eat.

   The Deacon.

   Pray earnestly.

   The Priest (aloud).

   For this is my body, which is broken for you, and divided for the
   remission of sins.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest prays.

   After the same manner also, when He had supped, He took the cup of wine
   mingled with water, and lifting His eyes to Thee, His Father, our God,
   and the God of all, gave thanks; and when He had blessed and filled it
   with the Holy Spirit, gave it to His holy and blessed disciples and
   apostles, saying:--

   (Aloud.)

   Drink ye all of it.

   The Deacon.

   Pray earnestly again.

   The Priest (aloud).

   For this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for you and for
   many, and distributed among you for the remission of sins.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest prays thus:--

   This do ye in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this bread and
   drink this cup, ye do show forth my death and acknowledge my
   resurrection and ascension until I come. O Sovereign and Almighty Lord,
   King of heaven, while we show forth [4205] the death of Thine
   only-begotten Son, our Lord, God, and Saviour Jesus Christ, and
   acknowledge His blessed resurrection from the dead on the third day, we
   do also openly declare His ascension into heaven, and His sitting on
   the right hand of Thee, God and Father, and await His second terrible
   and dreadful coming, in which He will come to judge righteously the
   quick and the dead, and to render to each man according to his works.

   XVII. O Lord our God, we have placed before Thee what is Thine from
   Thine own mercies. We pray and beseech Thee, O good and merciful God,
   to send down from Thy holy heaven, from the mansion Thou hast prepared,
   and from Thine infinite bosom, the Paraclete Himself, [4206] holy,
   powerful, and life-giving, the Spirit of truth, who spoke in the law,
   the apostles, and prophets; who is everywhere present, and filleth all
   things, freely working sanctification in whom He will with Thy good
   pleasure; one in His nature; manifold in His working; the fountain of
   divine blessing; of like substance [4207] with Thee, and proceeding
   from Thee; sitting with Thee on the throne of Thy kingdom, and with
   Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ.
   Send down upon us also and upon this bread and upon these chalices Thy
   Holy Spirit, that by His all-powerful and divine influence He may
   sanctify and consecrate them, and make this bread the body. [4208]

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest (aloud).

   And this cup the blood of the new testament, of the very Lord, and God,
   and Saviour, and universal King Christ Jesus.

   The Deacon.

   Deacons, come down.

   The Priest (aloud).

   That to all of us who partake thereof they may tend unto faith,
   sobriety, healing, temperance, sanctification, the renewal of soul,
   body, and spirit, participation in the blessedness of eternal life and
   immortality, the glory of Thy most holy name, and the remission of
   sins, that Thy most holy, precious, and glorious name may be praised
   and glorified in this as in all things.

   The People.

   As it was and is.

   The Priest.

   XVIII. Peace be to all.

   The Deacon.

   Pray.

   The Priest prays in secret.

   O God of light, Father of life, Author of grace, Creator of worlds,
   Founder of knowledge, Giver of wisdom, Treasure of holiness, Teacher of
   pure prayers, Benefactor of our souls, who givest to the faint-hearted
   who put their trust in Thee those things into which the angels desire
   to look: O Sovereign Lord, who hast brought us up from the depths of
   darkness to light, who hast given us life from death, who hast
   graciously bestowed upon us freedom from slavery, who hast scattered
   the darkness of sin within us, through the presence of Thine
   only-begotten Son, do Thou now also, through the visitation of Thy
   all-holy Spirit, enlighten the eyes of our understanding, that we may
   partake without fear of condemnation of this heavenly and immortal
   food, and sanctify us wholly in soul, body, and spirit, that with Thy
   holy disciples and apostles we may say this prayer to Thee: Our Father
   who art in heaven, etc.

   (Aloud.)

   And grant, O Sovereign Lord, in Thy mercy, that we with freedom of
   speech, without fear of condemnation, with pure heart and enlightened
   soul, with face that is not ashamed, and with hollowed lips, may
   venture to call upon Thee, the holy God who art in heaven, as our
   Father, and say:--

   The People.

   Our Father who art in heaven, etc.

   The Priest prays: [4209] --

   Verily, Lord, Lord, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
   evil; for Thy abundant mercy showeth that we through our great
   infirmity are unable to resist it. Grant that we may find a way whereby
   we may be able to withstand temptation; for Thou hast given us power to
   tread upon serpents, and scorpions, and all the power of the enemy.

   (Aloud.)

   For Thine is the kingdom and power.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   XIX. Peace be to all.

   The Deacon.

   Bow your heads to Jesus. [4210]

   The People.

   Thou, Lord.

   The Priest prays.

   O Sovereign and Almighty Lord, [4211] who sittest upon the cherubim,
   and art glorified by the seraphim; who hast made the heaven out of
   waters, and adorned it with choirs of stars; who hast placed an
   unbodied host of angels in the highest heavens to sing Thy praise for
   ever; before Thee have we bowed our souls and bodies in token of our
   bondage. We beseech Thee to repel the dark assaults of sin from our
   understanding, and to gladden our minds with the divine radiance of Thy
   Holy Spirit, that, filled with the knowledge of Thee, we may worthily
   partake of the mercies set before us, the pure body and precious blood
   of Thine only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour Jesus Christ.
   Pardon all our sins in Thy abundant and unsearchable goodness, through
   the grace, mercy, and love of Thine only-begotten Son: [4212]

   (Aloud.)

   Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with the
   all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.

   The Priest.

   XX. Peace be to all.

   The Deacon.

   With the fear of God.

   The Priest prays.

   O holy, highest, awe-inspiring God, who dwellest among the saints,
   sanctify us by the word of Thy grace and by the inspiration of Thy
   all-holy Spirit; for Thou hast said, O Lord our God, Be ye holy; for I
   am holy. O Word of God, past finding out, consubstantial [4213] and
   co-eternal with the Father and the Holy Spirit, and sharer of their
   sovereignty, accept the pure song which cherubim and seraphim, and the
   unworthy lips of Thy sinful and unworthy servant, sing aloud.

   The People.

   Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy.

   The Priest (aloud).

   Holy things for the holy. [4214]

   The People.

   One Father holy, one Son holy, one Spirit holy, in the unity of the
   Holy Spirit. Amen. [4215]

   The Deacon.

   For salvation and help.

   The Priest makes the sign of the cross upon the people, and saith in a
   loud voice:--

   The Lord be with all.

   The Priest breaks the bread, and saith:--

   Praise ye God.

   The Priest divides it among those present, and saith:--

   The Lord will bless and help you through His great mercy.

   The Priest says:--

   Command.

   The Clergy say:--

   The Holy Spirit commands and sanctifies.

   The Priest.

   Lo, they are sanctified and consecrated.

   The Clergy.

   One holy [4216] Father, etc. (thrice).

   The Priest says:--

   The Lord be with all.

   The Clergy.

   And with thy spirit.

   The Priest says:--

   The Lord Himself hath blessed it.

   The Priest partakes, and prays.

   According to Thy loving-kindness, [4217] etc.

   Or,

   As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, [4218] etc.

   When he gives the bread to the clergy, he says:--

   The holy body.

   And when he gives the chalice, he says:--

   The precious blood of our Lord, and God, and Saviour.

  IV.

   After the service is completed, the Deacon says:--

   XXI. Stand for prayer. [4219]

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The Deacon.

   Pray.

   The Priest says the prayer of thanksgiving.

   O Sovereign Lord our God, we thank Thee that we have partaken of Thy
   holy, pure, immortal, and heavenly mysteries, which Thou hast given for
   our good, and for the sanctification and salvation of our souls and
   bodies. We pray and beseech Thee, O Lord, to grant in Thy good mercy,
   that by partaking of the holy body and precious blood of Thine
   only-begotten Son, we may have faith that is not ashamed, love that is
   unfeigned, fulness of holiness, power to eschew evil and keep Thy
   commandments, provision for eternal life, and an acceptable defence
   before the awful tribunal of Thy Christ:

   In a loud voice.

   Through whom and with whom be glory and power to Thee, with Thy
   all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit.

   The Priest then turns to the people, and says:--

   XXII. O mightiest King, co-eternal with the Father, who by Thy might
   hast vanquished hell and trodden death under foot, who hast bound the
   strong man, and by Thy miraculous power and the enlightening radiance
   of Thy unspeakable Godhead hast raised Adam from the tomb, send forth
   Thy invisible right hand, which is full of blessing, and bless us all.

   Pity us, O Lord, and strengthen us by Thy divine power.

   Take away from us the sinful and wicked influence of carnal desire.

   Let the light shine into our souls, and dispel the surrounding darkness
   of sin.

   Unite us to the all-blessed assembly that is well-pleasing unto Thee;
   for through Thee and with Thee, all praise, honour, power, adoration,
   and thanksgiving are due unto the Father and the Holy Spirit, now,
   henceforth, and for evermore.

   The Deacon.

   Depart in peace:

   The People.

   In the name of the Lord.

   The Priest (aloud).

   XXIII. The love of God the Father; the grace of the Son, our Lord Jesus
   Christ; the communion and gift of the All-holy Spirit, be with us all,
   now, henceforth, and for evermore.

   The People.

   Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.

   The Priest prays in the sacristy, and says:--

   O Lord, Thou hast given us sanctification by partaking of the all-holy
   body and precious blood of Thine only-begotten Son; give us the grace
   and gift of the All-holy Spirit. Enable us to lead blameless lives; and
   guide us unto the perfect redemption, and adoption, and the everlasting
   joys of the world to come. For Thou art our sanctification, and we
   ascribe glory unto Thee, the Father, and the Son, and the All-holy
   Spirit, now, henceforth, and for evermore.

   The People.

   Amen.

   The Priest.

   Peace be to all.

   The People.

   And to thy spirit.

   The Priest dismisses them, and says:--

   May God bless, who blesseth and sanctifieth, who defendeth and
   preserveth us all through the partaking of His holy mysteries; and who
   is blessed for ever. Amen.

  The Liturgy of the Blessed Apostles.

      Composed by St. adæus and St. Maris, Teachers of the Easterns. [4220]

   I. [4221] First: Glory to God in the highest, etc. Our Father which art
   in heaven.

   Prayer.

   Strengthen, O our Lord and God, our weakness through Thy mercy, that we
   may administer the holy mystery which has been given for the renovation
   and salvation of our degraded nature, through the mercies of Thy
   beloved Son the Lord of all.

   On common days.

   Adored, glorified, lauded, celebrated, exalted, and blessed in heaven
   and on earth, be the adorable and glorious name of Thine ever-glorious
   Trinity, O Lord of all.

   On common days they sing the Psalm (xv.), Lord, who shall dwell in Thy
   tabernacle? entire with its canon, [4222] of the mystery of the
   sacraments.

   (Aloud.)

   Who shall shout with joy? etc.

   Prayer.

   II. Before the resplendent throne of Thy majesty, O Lord, and the
   exalted and sublime throne of Thy glory, and on the awful seat of the
   strength of Thy love and the propiatory altar which Thy will hath
   established, in the region of Thy pasture, [4223] with thousands of
   cherubim praising Thee, and ten thousands of seraphim sanctifying Thee,
   we draw near, adore, thank, and glorify Thee always, O Lord of all.

   On commemorations and Fridays.

   Thy name, great and holy, illustrious and blessed, the blessed and
   incomprehensible name of Thy glorious Trinity, and Thy kindness to our
   race, we ought at all times to bless, adore, and glorify, O Lord of
   all.

   Responsory [4224] at the chancel, as above.

   Who commanded, etc.

   To the priest, etc.

   Prayer.

   How breathes in us, O our Lord and God, the sweet fragrance of the
   sweetness of Thy love; illumined are our souls, through the knowledge
   of Thy truth: may we be rendered worthy of receiving the manifestation
   of Thy beloved from Thy holy heavens: there shall we render thanks unto
   Thee, and, in the meantime, glorify Thee without ceasing in Thy Church,
   crowned and filled with every aid and blessing, because Thou art Lord
   and Father, Creator of all.

   III. Prayer of Incense.

   We shall repeat the hymn to Thy glorious Trinity, O Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost.

   On fast-days.

   And on account, etc.

   At the commemoration of saints.

   Thou, O Lord, art truly the raiser up of our bodies: Thou art the good
   Saviour of our souls, and the secure preserver of our life; and we
   ought to thank Thee continually, to adore and glorify Thee, O Lord of
   all.

   At the lessons. [4225]

   Holy art Thou, worthy of praise, mighty, immortal, who dwellest in the
   holies, and Thy will resteth in them: have regard unto us, O Lord; be
   merciful unto us, and pity us, as Thou art our helper in all
   circumstances, O Lord of all.

   IV. At the apostle. [4226]

   Enlighten, O our Lord and God, the movements of our meditations to hear
   and understand the sweet listenings to Thy life-giving and divine
   commands; and grant unto us through Thy grace and mercy to gather from
   them the assurance of love, and hope, and salvation suitable to soul
   and body, and we shall sing to Thee everlasting glory without ceasing
   and always, O Lord of all.

   On fast-days.

   To Thee, the wise governor, etc.

   V. Descending, he shall salute the Gospel, saying this prayer before
   the altar.

   Thee, the renowned seed of Thy Father, and the image of the person of
   Thy Father, who wast revealed in the body of our humanity, and didst
   arise to us in the light of Thy annunciation, Thee we thank, adore,
   etc.

   And after the proclamation: [4227] --

   Thee, O Lord God Almighty, we beseech and entreat, perfect with us Thy
   grace, and pour out through our hands Thy gift, the pity and compassion
   of Thy divinity. May they be to us for the propitiation of the offences
   of Thy people, and for the forgiveness of the sins of the entire flock
   of Thy pasture, through Thy grace and tender mercies, O good friend of
   men, O Lord of all.

   VI. The Deacons say:--

   Bow your heads.

   The Priest says this secret prayer in the sanctuary: [4228] --

   O Lord God Omnipotent, Thine is the Holy Catholic Church, inasmuch as
   Thou, through the great passion of Thy Christ, didst buy the sheep of
   Thy pasture; and from the grace of the Holy Spirit, who is indeed of
   one nature with Thy glorious divinity, are granted the degrees of the
   true priestly ordination; and through Thy clemency Thou didst
   vouchsafe, O Lord, to make our weakness spiritual members in the great
   body of Thy Holy Church, that we might administer spiritual aid to
   faithful souls. Now, O Lord, perfect Thy grace with us, and pour out
   Thy gift through our hands: and may Thy tender mercies and the clemency
   of Thy divinity be upon us, and upon the people whom Thou hast chosen
   for Thyself.

   (Aloud.)

   And grant unto us, O Lord, through Thy clemency, that we may all
   together, and equally every day of our life, please Thy divinity, and
   be rendered worthy of the aid of Thy grace to offer Thee praise,
   honour, thanksgiving, and adoration at all times, O Lord.

   VII. And the Deacons ascend to the altar, and say:--

   He who has not received baptism, etc. [4229]

   And the Priest begins the responsory of the mysteries, [4230] and the
   Sacristan and Deacon place the disk and the chalice upon the altar. The
   Priest crosses his hands, and says: [4231] --

   We offer praise to Thy glorious Trinity at all times and for ever.

   And proceeds:--

   May Christ, who was offered for our salvation, and commanded us to
   commemorate His death and His resurrection, Himself receive this
   sacrifice from the hands of our weakness, through His grace and mercies
   for ever. Amen.

   And proceeds:--

   Laid are the renowned holy and life-giving mysteries upon the altar of
   the mighty Lord, even until His advent, for ever. Amen.

   Praise, etc.

   Thy memory, etc.

   Our Father, etc.

   The apostles of the Father, etc.

   Upon the holy altar, etc.

   They who have slept, etc.

   Matthew Mark, Luke, etc. [4232]

      THE CREED. [4233]

   VIII. The Priest draws near to celebrate, and thrice bows before the
   altar, the middle of which he kisses, then the right and the left horn
   of the altar; and bows to the Gospel side, and says:--

   Bless, O Lord, etc.

   Pray for me, my fathers, brethren, and masters, that God may grant unto
   me the capability and power to perform this service to which I have
   drawn near, and that this oblation may be accepted from the hands of my
   weakness, for myself, for you, and for the whole body of the Holy
   Catholic Church, through His grace and mercies for ever. Amen.

   And they respond:--

   May Christ listen to thy prayers, and be pleased with thy sacrifice,
   receive thy oblation, and honour thy priesthood, and grant unto us,
   through thy mediation, [4234] the pardon of our offences, and the
   forgiveness of our sins, through His grace and mercies for ever.

   Presently he bows at the other side, uttering the same words; and they
   respond in the same manner: then he bows to the altar, and says:--

   God, Lord of all, be with us through His grace and mercies for ever.
   Amen.

   And bowing towards the Deacon, who is on the left (Epistle side), he
   says:--

   God, the Lord of all, confirm thy words, and secure to thee peace, and
   accept this oblation from my hands for me, for thee, for the whole body
   of the Holy Catholic Church, and for the entire world, through His
   grace and mercies for ever.

   He kneels at the altar, and says in secret:--

   IX. O our Lord and God, look not on the multitude of our sins, and let
   not Thy dignity be turned away on account of the heinousness of our
   iniquities; but through Thine unspeakable grace sanctify this sacrifice
   of Thine, and grant through it power and capability, so that Thou
   mayest forget our many sins, and be merciful when Thou shalt appear at
   the end of time, in the man whom Thou hast assumed from among us, and
   we may find before Thee grace and mercy, and be rendered worthy to
   praise Thee with spiritual [4235] assemblies.

   He rises, and says this prayer in secret:--

   We thank Thee, O our Lord and God, for the abundant riches of Thy grace
   to us:

   And he proceeds:--

   Us who were sinful and degraded, on account of the multitude of Thy
   clemency, Thou hast made worthy to celebrate the holy mysteries of the
   body and blood of Thy Christ. We beg aid from Thee for the
   strengthening of our souls, that in perfect love and true faith we may
   administer Thy gift to us.

   Canon.

    And we shall ascribe to Thee praise, glory, thanksgiving, and
   adoration, now, always, and for ever and ever.

   He signs himself with the sign of the cross, and they respond:--

   Amen.

   X. And he proceeds:--

   Peace be with you:

   They respond:--

   With thee and with thy spirit.

   And they give the (kiss of) peace to each other, and say:--

   For all: [4236]

   The Deacon says:--

   Let us thank, entreat, and beseech.

   The Priest says this prayer in secret:--

   O Lord, mighty God, help my weakness through Thy clemency and the aid
   of Thy grace; and make me worthy of offering before Thee this oblation,
   as for the common aid of all, and to the praise of Thy Trinity, O
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

   Another prayer. [4237]

   O our Lord and God, restrain our thoughts, that they wander not amid
   the vanities of this world. O Lord our God, grant that I may be united
   to the affection of Thy love, unworthy though I be. Glory be to Thee, O
   Christ.

   Ascend into the chamber of Thy renowned light, O Lord; sow in me the
   good seed of humility; and under the wings of Thy grace hide me through
   Thy mercy. If Thou wert to mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
   Because there is mercy with Thee.

   [The Priest says the following prayer in secret: [4238] --

   O mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, beseech for me the only-begotten
   Son, who was born of thee, to forgive me my offences and my sins, and
   to accept from my feeble and sinful hands this sacrifice which my
   weakness offers upon this altar, through thy intercession for me, O
   holy mother.]

   XI. When the Deacon shall say, With watchfulness and care, etc.,
   immediately the Priest rises up and uncovers the sacraments, taking
   away the veil with which they were covered: he blesses the incense, and
   says a canon with a loud voice:--

   The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and
   the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with us all, now, etc. [4239]

   He signs the sacraments, and they respond:--

   Amen.

   The Priest proceeds:--

   Lift up your minds:

   They respond:--

   They are towards Thee, O God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, O glorious
   King.

   The Priest.

   The oblation is offered to God, the Lord of all.

   They respond:--

   It is meet and right.

   The Deacon.

   Peace be with you.

   The Priest puts on the incense, and says this prayer:--

   O Lord, Lord, grant me an open countenance before Thee, that with the
   confidence which is from Thee we may fulfil this awful and divine
   sacrifice with consciences free from all iniquity and bitterness. Sow
   in us, O Lord, affection, peace, and concord towards each other, and
   toward every one.

   And standing, he says in secret: [4240] --

   Worthy of glory from every mouth, and of thanksgiving from all tongues,
   and of adoration and exaltation from all creatures, is the adorable and
   glorious name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who created the world
   through His grace, and its inhabitants through His clemency, who saved
   men through His mercy, and showed great favour towards mortals. Thy
   majesty, O Lord, thousands of thousands of heavenly spirits, and ten
   thousand myriads of holy angels, hosts of spirits, ministers of fire
   and spirit, bless and adore; with the holy cherubim and the spiritual
   seraphim they sanctify and celebrate Thy name, crying and praising,
   without ceasing crying unto each other.

   They say with a loud voice:--

   Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty; full are the heavens and the earth
   of His glory.

   The Priest in secret:--

   Holy, holy, holy art Thou, O Lord God Almighty; the heavens and the
   earth are full of His glory and the nature of His essence, as they are
   glorious with the honour of His splendour; as it is written, The heaven
   and the earth are full of me, saith the mighty Lord.

   Holy art Thou, O God our Father, truly the only one, of whom the whole
   family in heaven and earth is named. Holy art Thou, Eternal Son,
   through whom all things were made. Holy art Thou, Holy, Eternal Spirit,
   through whom all things are sanctified.

   Woe to me, woe to me, who have been astonied, because I am a man of
   polluted lips, and dwell among a people of polluted lips, and my eyes
   have seen the King, the mighty Lord. How terrible to-day is this place!
   For this is none other than the house of God and the gate of heaven;
   because Thou hast been seen eye to eye, O Lord.

   Now, I pray, may Thy grace be with us, O Lord; purge away our
   impurities, and sanctify our lips; unite the voices of our
   insignificance with the sanctification of seraphim and archangels.
   Glory be to Thy tender mercies, because Thou hast associated the
   earthly with the heavenly. [4241]

   And he proceeds, saying in secret this prayer, in a bowing posture:--

   XII. And with those heavenly powers we give Thee thanks, even we, Thine
   insignificant, pithless, and feeble servants; because Thou hast granted
   unto us Thy great grace which cannot be repaid. For indeed Thou didst
   take upon Thee our human nature, that Thou mightest bestow life on us
   through Thy divinity; Thou didst exalt our low condition; Thou didst
   raise our ruined state; Thou didst rouse up our mortality; Thou didst
   wash away our sins; Thou didst blot out the guilt of our sins; Thou
   didst enlighten our intelligence, and Thou didst condemn our enemy, O
   Lord our God; and Thou didst cause the insignificance of our pithless
   nature to triumph.

   Here follow the words of institution, [4242] after which:--

   Through the tender mercies of Thy grace poured out, O clement One,
   pardon our offences and sins; blot out my offences in the judgment. And
   on account of all Thy aids and Thy favours to us, we shall ascribe unto
   Thee praise, [4243] honour, thanksgiving, and adoration, now, always,
   and for ever and ever.

   The Priest signs the sacraments. The response is made.

   Amen.

   The Deacon.

   In your minds. Pray for peace with us.

   The Priest says this prayer [4244] bowing, and in a low voice:--

   O Lord God Almighty, accept this oblation for the whole Holy Catholic
   Church, and for all the pious and righteous fathers who have been
   pleasing to Thee, and for all the prophets and apostles, and for all
   the martyrs and confessors, and for all that mourn, that are in
   straits, and are sick, and for all that are under difficulties and
   trials, and for all the weak and the oppressed, and for all the dead
   that have gone from amongst us; then for all that ask a prayer from our
   weakness, and for me, a degraded and feeble sinner. O Lord our God,
   according to Thy mercies and the multitude of Thy favours, look upon
   Thy people, and on me, a feeble man, not according to my sins and my
   follies, but that they may become worthy of the forgiveness of their
   sins through this holy body, which they receive with faith, through the
   grace of Thy mercy for ever and ever. Amen.

   The Priest says this prayer of inclination in secret:--

   XIII. Do Thou, O Lord, through Thy many and ineffable mercies, make the
   memorial good and acceptable with that of [4245] all the pious and
   righteous fathers who have been pleading before Thee in the
   commemoration of the body and blood of Thy Christ, which we offer to
   Thee upon Thy pure and holy altar, as Thou hast taught us; and grant
   unto us Thy rest all the days of this life.

   He proceeds with the Great Oblation:--

   O Lord our God, bestow on us Thy rest and peace all the days of this
   life, that all the inhabitants of the earth may know Thee, that Thou
   art the only true God the Father, and Thou didst send our Lord Jesus
   Christ, Thy Son and Thy beloved; and He Himself our Lord and God came
   and taught us all purity and holiness. Make remembrance of prophets,
   apostles, martyrs, confessors, bishops, doctors, priests, deacons, and
   all the sons of the Holy Catholic Church who have been signed with the
   sign of life, of holy baptism. We also, O Lord:

   He proceeds:--

   We, Thy degraded, weak, and feeble servants who are congregated in Thy
   name, and now stand before Thee, and have received with joy the form
   which is from Thee, praising, glorifying, and exalting, commemorate and
   celebrate this great, awful, holy, and divine mystery of the passion,
   death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

   And may Thy Holy Spirit come, O Lord, [4246] and rest upon this
   oblation of Thy servants which they offer, and bless and sanctify it;
   and may it be unto us, O Lord, for the propitiation of our offences and
   the forgiveness of our sins, and for a grand hope of resurrection from
   the dead, and for a new life in the kingdom of the heavens, with all
   who have been pleasing before Him. And on account of the whole of Thy
   wonderful dispensation towards us, we shall render thanks unto Thee,
   and glorify Thee without ceasing in Thy Church, redeemed by the
   precious blood of Thy Christ, with open mouths and joyful countenances:

   Canon.

   Ascribing praise, [4247] honour, thanksgiving, and adoration to Thy
   holy, loving, and life-giving name, now, always, and for ever.

   The Priest signs the mysteries with the cross, and they respond:--

   Amen.

   The Priest bows himself and kisses the altar, first in the middle, then
   at the two sides right and left, and says this prayer: [4248] --

   Have mercy upon me, O God, down to the words, and sinners shall be
   converted unto Thee: and unto Thee lift I up mine eyes, [4249] down to
   have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us. Also stretch forth Thy
   hand, and let Thy right hand save me, O Lord; may Thy mercies remain
   upon me, O Lord, for ever, and despise not the works of Thy hands.
   [4250]

   Then he says this prayer:--

   XIV. O Christ, peace of those in heaven and great rest of those below,
   [4251] grant that Thy rest and peace may dwell in the four parts of the
   world, [4252] but especially in Thy Holy Catholic Church; grant that
   the priesthood with the government may have peace; cause wars to cease
   from the ends of the earth, and scatter the nations that delight in
   wars, [4253] that we may enjoy the blessing of living in tranquillity
   and peace, in all temperance and fear of God. Spare the offences and
   sins of the dead, through Thy grace and mercies for ever.

   And to those who are around the altar he says:--

   Bless, O Lord. Bless, O Lord.

   And he puts on the incense with which he fumes himself, and says:--

   Sweeten, O Lord our God, the unpleasing savour [4254] of our souls
   through the sweetness of Thy love, and through it cleanse me from the
   stains of my sin, and forgive me my offences and sins, whether known or
   unknown to me.

   A second time he takes the incense with both hands, and censes the
   mysteries; presently he says:--

   The clemency of Thy grace, O our Lord and God, gives us access to these
   renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries, unworthy though we
   be.

   The Priest repeats these words once and again, and at each interval
   unites his hands over his breast in the form of a cross. He kisses the
   altar in the middle, and receives with both hands the upper oblation;
   and looking up, says:--

   Praise be to Thy holy name, O Lord Jesus Christ, and adoration to Thy
   majesty, always and for ever. Amen.

   For He is the living and life-giving bread which cometh down from
   heaven, and giveth life to the whole world, of which they who eat die
   not; and they who receive it are saved by it, and do not see
   corruption, and live through it for ever; and Thou art the antidote of
   our mortality, [4255] and the resurrection of our entire frame. [4256]

   XV. [4257] * * *

   XVI. Praise to Thy holy name, O Lord. (As above.)

   The Priest kisses the host [4258] in the form of a cross; in such a
   way, however, that his lips do not touch it, but appear to kiss it; and
   he says:--

   Glory to Thee, O Lord; glory to Thee, O Lord, on account of Thine
   unspeakable gift to us, for ever.

   Then he draws nigh to the fraction of the host, [4259] which he
   accomplishes with both his hands, saying:--

   We draw nigh, O Lord, with true faith, and break with thanksgiving and
   sign through Thy mercy the body and blood of our Life-giver, Jesus
   Christ, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

   And, naming the Trinity, he breaks the host, [4260] which he holds in
   his hands, into two parts: and the one which is in his left hand he
   lays down on the disk; with the other, which he holds in his right
   hand, he signs the chalice, saying:--

   The precious blood is signed with the holy body of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost for
   ever.

   And they respond:--

   Amen.

   Then he dips it even to the middle in the chalice, and signs with it
   the body which is in the paten, saying:--

   The holy body is signed with the propitiatory blood of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
   Ghost for ever.

   And they respond:--

   Amen.

   And he unites the two parts, the one with the other, saying:--

   Divided, sanctified, completed, perfected, united, and commingled have
   been these renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries, the one
   with the other, in the adorable and glorious name of Thy glorious
   Trinity, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, that they may be to us, O Lord,
   for the propitiation of our offences and the forgiveness of our sins;
   also for the grand hope of a resurrection from the dead, and of a new
   life in the kingdom of the heavens, for us and for the Holy Church of
   Christ our Lord, here and in every place whatsoever, now and always,
   and for ever.

   XVII. In the meantime he signs the host [4261] with his right thumb in
   the form of a cross from the lower part to the upper, and from the
   right to the left, and thus forms a slight fissure in it where it has
   been dipped in the blood. He puts a part of it into the chalice in the
   form of a cross: the lower part is placed towards the priest, the upper
   towards the chalice, so that the place of the fissure looks to the
   chalice. He bows, and rising, says:--

   Glory be to Thee, O Lord Jesus Christ, who hast made me, unworthy
   though I be, through Thy grace, a minister and mediator of Thy renowed,
   holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries: through the grace of Thy
   mercy, make me worthy of the pardon of my offences and the forgiveness
   of my sins.

   He signs himself with the sign of the cross an his forehead, and does
   the same to those standing round him. [4262]

   The Deacons approach, and he signs each one of them on the forehead,
   saying:--

   Christ accept thy ministry: Christ cause thy face to shine: Christ save
   thy life: Christ make thy youth to grow.

   And they respond:--

   Christ accept thy oblation.

   XVIII. All return to their own place; and the Priest, after bowing,
   rises and says, in the tone of the Gospel:--

   The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God the Father, and
   the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with us all.

   The Priest signs himself, and lifts up his hand over his head, so that
   it should be in the air, and the people be partakers in the singing:--

   The Deacon says:--

   We all with fear, etc.

   And at these words:--

   He hath given to us His mysteries:

   The Priest begins to break [4263] the body, and says:--

   Be merciful, O Lord, through Thy clemency to the sins and follies of
   Thy servants, and sanctify our lips through Thy grace, that they may
   give the fruits of glory and praise to Thy divinity, with all Thy
   saints in Thy kingdom.

   And, raising his voice, he says:--

   And make us worthy, O Lord our God, to stand before Thee continually
   without stain, with pure heart, with open countenance, and with the
   confidence which is from Thee, mercifully granted to us: and let us all
   with one accord invoke Thee, and say thus: Our Father, etc.

   The People say:--

   Our Father, etc.

   The Priest. [4264]

   O Lord God Almighty, O Lord and our good God, who art full of mercy, we
   beg Thee, O Lord our God, and beseech the clemency of Thy goodness;
   lead us not into temptation, but deliver and save us from the evil one
   and his hosts; because Thine is the kingdom, the power, the strength,
   the might, and the dominion in heaven and on earth, now and always.

   He signs himself, and they respond:--

   Amen.

   XIX. And he proceeds:--

   Peace be with you.

   They respond:--

   With thee and with thy spirit.

   He proceeds:--

   It is becoming that the holy things should be to the holy in
   perfection.

   And they say:--

   One holy Father: one holy Son: one Holy Ghost. Glory be to the Father,
   and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.

   The Deacon.

   Praise ye.

   And they say the responsory. And when the Deacon comes to carry the
   chalice, he says:--

   Let us pray for peace with us.

   The Priest says:--

   The grace of the Holy Ghost be with thee, with us, and with those who
   receive Him. And he gives the chalice to the Deacon.

   The Deacon says:--

   Bless, O Lord.

   The Priest.

   The gift of the grace of our Life-giver and Lord Jesus Christ be
   completed, in mercies, with all.

   And he signs the people with the cross. In the meantime the
   responsories are said.

    Brethren, receive the body of the Son, cries the Church, and drink ye
   His chalice with faith in the house of His kingdom.

   On feast-days.

   Strengthen, O Lord, etc.

   On the Lord's day.

   O Lord Jesus Christ, etc.

   Daily.

   The mysteries which we have received, etc.

   The responsories being ended, the Deacon says:--

   All therefore, etc.


   And they respond:--

   Glory be to Himself on account of His ineffable gift.

   The Deacon.

   Let us pray for peace with us.

   The Priest at the middle of the altar says this prayer: [4265] --

   XX. It is meet, O Lord, just and right in all days, times, and hours,
   to thank, adore, and praise the awful name of Thy majesty, because Thou
   hast through Thy grace, O Lord, made us, mortal men possessing a frail
   nature, worthy to sanctify Thy name with the heavenly [4266] beings,
   and to become partakers of the mysteries of Thy gift, and to be
   delighted with the sweetness of Thy oracles. And voices of glory and
   thanksgiving we ever offer up to Thy sublime divinity, O Lord.

   Another.

   Christ, our God, Lord, King, Saviour, and Life-giver, through His grace
   has made us worthy to receive His body and His precious and
   all-sanctifying blood. May He grant unto us that we may be pleasing
   unto Him in our words, works, thoughts, and deeds, so that that pledge
   which we have received may be to us for the pardon of our offences, the
   forgiveness of our sins, and the grand hope of a resurrection from the
   dead, and a new and true life in the kingdom of the heavens, with all
   who have been pleasing before Him, through His grace and His mercies
   for ever.

   On ordinary days.

   Praise, O Lord, honour, blessing, and thanksgiving we ought to ascribe
   to Thy glorious Trinity for the gift of Thy holy mysteries, which Thou
   hast given to us for the propitiation of our offences, O Lord of all.

   Another.

   Blessed be Thy adorable honour, from Thy glorious place, O Christ, the
   propitiator of our offences and our sins, and who takest away our
   follies through Thy renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries.
   Christ the hope of our nature always and for ever. Amen.

   Obsignation or final benediction.

   May our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom we have ministered, and whom we have
   seen and honoured in His renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine
   mysteries, Himself render us worthy of the splendid glory of His
   kingdom, and of gladness with His holy angels, and for confidence
   before Him, that we may stand at His right hand.

   And on our entire congregation may His mercies and compassion be
   continually poured out, now and always, and ever.

   On the Lord's day and on feast-days.

   May He Himself who blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the
   heavens, through Jesus Christ our Lord, and prepared us for His
   kingdom, and called us to the desirable good things which neither cease
   nor perish, as He promised to us in His life-giving Gospel, and said to
   the blessed congregation of His disciples--Verily, verily I say unto
   you, that every one who eateth my body and drinketh my blood, abideth
   in me, and I in him, and I will raise him up at the last day; and he
   cometh not to judgment, but I will make him pass from death to eternal
   life:

   May He Himself now bless this congregation, and maintain our position,
   and render glorious our people who have come and rejoiced in receiving
   His renowned, holy, life-giving, and divine mysteries; and may ye be
   sealed and guarded by the holy sign of the Lord's cross from all evils,
   secret and open, now and always.

   or Nestorius. In that which the Patriarch Joseph wrote at Rome, 1697,
   that entire passage is remodelled according to the Chaldean missal
   published at Rome, as in the mass, a translation of which was edited by
   Alexius Menesius. Since there were no other codices at hand, in this
   place it seemed good to place asterisks to indicate the defects.

     __________________________________________________________________

    ELUCIDATIONS.

      I.

   (Disciple of the holy Peter, [352]p. 551.)

   The early use of the originals of this liturgy in the Alexandrian
   patriarchate accounts for its bearing the name of St. Mark,--"sister's
   son to Barnabas," as St. Paul calls him. [4267] That he was St. Peter's
   pupil may be inferred from that Apostle's language, [4268] --"Marcus,
   my son." See Clement's testimony concerning him (with Eusebius) in vol.
   ii. [353]pp. 579, 580, this series. That he founded the "Evangelical
   See," though resting on great historic authority, [4269] seems to be
   doubted in our times by some.

    II.

   (Our holy father Mark, [354]p. 556.)

   While St. Mark could not have written this, it may, of course, have
   been added at a very early date. [4270] This most touching prayer bears
   marks of great antiquity, the reference to our "Christ-loving
   sovereign" comporting better with the early enthusiasm inspired by
   Constantine's conversion than with the disappointments incurred under
   his Arianizing or apostate successors. Now, this commemoration of St.
   Mark would of itself attach his name to the liturgy.

   But here is the place to note the principles of these primitive prayers
   for saints departed. (1) They could only be offered in behalf of the
   holy dead who had fallen asleep in full communion with Christ and His
   Church; (2) They were not prayers for their deliverance out of one
   place into another; (3) They recognised the repose (not yet the
   triumph) of the faithful departed as incomplete, and hence (4) invoked
   for them a blessed consummation of peace and joy in the resurrection.

   Now, all this is fatal to the Roman dogmas and usages, because (1) they
   thus include St. Mark and the Blessed Virgin in these commemorations;
   while Rome teaches, not only that these great saints went immediately
   to the excellent glory, and there have reigned with Christ ever since
   they died, but (2) that on this very ground, and that of their
   supererogatory merits, the Pontiff holds a purse [4271] of their
   excessive righteousness to dispense to meaner Christians.

   St. Augustine speaks of his dear Nebridius as in Abraham's bosom,
   [4272] but finds comfort in commemorating him and Monica his mother,
   "because it is so comfortable." This is his idea, in a word: "Et credo
   jam feceris quod te rogo, sed (Ps. cxix. 108) voluntaria oris mei,
   approba, Domine."

    III.

   (Holy things for the holy, [355]p. 559.)

   Bingham [4273] has so fully elucidated this by quotations from
   Chrysostom (Hom. vii.) and others, that one might think it useless to
   attach to it any other meaning than that which Chrysostom understands
   in it; viz., "Holy things for holy persons." It occurs just before the
   communicating of the faithful, and has nothing whatever to do with the
   "elevation of the host,"--a Western ceremony of the fourteenth century.
   [4274] Yet, in an otherwise (generally) useful manual of liturgies, an
   attempt is made to give it this meaning; and the preceding prayer of
   "Intense Adoration," addressed to the Great High Priest in the heavens,
   is debased to eke out the weak idea. Nothing could be more averse to
   the primitive principle of worship; [4275] but it is sufficient to note
   the fact that the "elevation of the host" revolutionized the
   eucharistic worship of the West as soon as it was established. (1) It
   abolished the Eucharist practically as the synaxis, or communion of the
   faithful, and made it only a sacrifice for them in their behalf; (2)
   not to be eaten and received, but to be gazed at; (3) not for all the
   faithful at all times, excluding even catechumens from beholding it,
   but to be displayed to all eyes in pompous ceremonials, carried through
   the streets, and dispensed only in half-communion, once a year, to the
   individual communicant. All these ancient liturgies, corrupted as they
   are in all the mss. we possess, are yet liturgies for communicating the
   faithful, in their turns, [4276] one and all; and, so far, they are
   true to the Scriptures and the precepts of Christ and His Apostles. But
   well does the pious Hirscher exclaim, with reference to the Mass, as he
   was obliged to celebrate it in his own gorgeous cathedral at Freiburg
   in the Breisgau: "What would an Apostle think we were doing, should he
   enter during our ceremonies?" Also, "I know all that can be said in
   their favour. I know just as well that by them the spirit is turned
   apart from internal godliness, and borne away; and that, with such
   appeals to sense, withdrawal from things of sense becomes
   impossible....God is a Spirit: He looks to be adored in spirit and in
   truth, and all ceremonial which dulls the adoration [4277] of the
   spirit is odious to God. To glorify self, as His minister, before the
   King of kings, before the majesty of the Creator, before His Christ,
   naked and crucified,--is it not an absurdity, a ceremony of
   contradictions? The people no longer comprehend the ceremonial...to see
   them satisfied by mere corporal attendance, is it not deplorable? They
   do not understand Latin. Is it not melancholy that they take no real
   part in the touching offices of the Holy Week? Is not a deplorable
   indifference the result; in France, for example? Nay, at Rome also?"
   [4278]

   His remonstrances were vain; he was cruelly censured, yet he died in
   the Papal communion. Dear Hirscher! The venerable man kissed me when I
   parted from him in 1851, [4279] and gave me his blessing with a
   primitive spirit of Christian charity. I gratefully quote him here.

   In Germany a passing stranger often sees the pious peasantry at Mass,
   singing with all their hearts their beautiful German hymns. It
   misleads, however. They are not attending to the Mass, but consoling
   themselves by spiritual songs, while it goes on without their
   assistance. The bell rings: they adore the host, but that is all their
   relation to the worship of the Christian liturgies. Hirscher loved
   their hymns, but bewailed the utter loss of their liturgic communion,
   once common to the faithful. [4280]

    IV.

   (Teachers of the Easterns, etc., [356]p. 561.)

   The apostle Thaddeus is called Addai in Syriac. Maris is said to have
   been one of the seventy disciples, but his name is not on the list
   ascribed to Hippolytus. He was the first bishop of the people now
   called "Nestorians," but whom Dr. Badger [4281] prefers to call "the
   Christians of Assyria."

   We have this liturgy in another form in Dr. Badger's important work,
   Nestorians and their Rituals. He selects that called "the Liturgy of
   Nestorius" from three which are in use among the Assyrians, but
   criticises the translation of Renaudot as not entirely faultless. It is
   selected by Dr. Badger because of its reputed Nestorianism; while
   Hammond gives us what is here translated, in Renaudot's Latin. [4282]
   We must bear in mind, that, since the Ephesine Council (a.d. 431),
   these Christians have been separated from the communion of Eastern
   orthodoxy.

   The Malabar Liturgy should be carefully compared with this by the
   student. A convenient translation of it is to be found in Neale and
   Littledale. A most important fact, by the way, is noted in their
   translation; [4283] viz., that in this Malabar "the invocation of the
   Holy Ghost, contrary to the use of every other Oriental liturgy,
   preceded the words of institution;" that is to say, in the work of the
   Portuguese revisers, a work from which Dr. Neale and his colleague feel
   justified in making "a considerable alteration" as to the order of the
   prayers.

   The words of institution are found in the Malabar, and suggest that
   they belong not less to this Liturgy of the Assyrians, though, ex summa
   verecundia, [4284] they are omitted from the transcript, as the Lord's
   Prayer is omitted in the Clementine.

   The normal form of this corrupted liturgy is credited with extreme
   antiquity by Dr. Neale. To his learned and cogent reasoning on the
   subject the student should by all means refer. [4285]

    V.

   (For all the prophets and confessors, [357]p. 565.)

   These commemorations of the dead, it will be noted, are in behalf of
   the most glorious apostles and saints, and for martyrs who go straight
   to glory. Obviously, as Usher has said, [4286] for whatever purpose,
   then, the departed were commemorated, it was not to change their estate
   before the resurrection, much less to relieve them from purgatorial
   penalties. This comes out in the "Liturgy of St. Chrysostom" (so
   called), where it is said: "We offer to Thee this reasonable service
   for those who have fallen asleep in faith,...patriarchs, apostles,
   evangelists, martyrs,...and every just one made perfect in the faith:
   especially our all-holy, undefiled, most blessed Lady, Theotokos and
   ever-virgin Mary," etc. But she, they tell us, was assumed into glory,
   like Christ Himself, and reigns with Him as "Queen of Angels," etc. See
   Elucidation II. p. 569.

    VI.

   (The propitiatory blood, etc., [358]p. 566.)

   The peril of confounding the early use of this idea of propitiation
   with the mediæval theory, which is quite another, is well pointed out
   and enforced by Burbidge. [4287] The primitive writers and the ancient
   liturgies "do not regard the Eucharist as being itself a propitiatory
   offering," but it is the perpetual pleading of the blood of
   propitiation once offered. Thus St. Chrysostom: "We do not offer
   another sacrifice, but always the same." So far, his words might be
   quoted to favour the Middle-Age doctrine; but he guards himself, and
   adds: [4288] "or, rather, we make a memorial of the sacrifice."

   The rhetoric of the liturgies and of the Fathers was unhappily made
   into the logic of the Schoolmen, and hence the stupendous system of
   propitiatory Masses, with Masses for the dead, and that traffic in
   Masses which so fearfully defiles the priesthood of Western Europe and
   the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in America. In vain does the pious
   Hirscher complain: [4289] "The rich, then, are the happy sinners in
   this respect: they can buy innumerable Masses, and establish them in
   perpetuity; their privileges have no limit, and their advantages over
   the poor extend through all eternity." His book was put into the Index
   (Acts xvi. 19, xix. 27), but it was never answered.

    VII.

   Let me now recur to Elucidation III. on [359]p. 507, to which I would
   here add the following from Bishop Williams, as there quoted:--

   "In both the Mozarabic and the Gallican Liturgies there was an
   invocation as well as an oblation. Irenæus [4290] says (and he, writing
   at Lyons, must have in mind the Gallican Liturgy), The bread which is
   of the earth, having received the invocation of God, is no longer
   common bread, but the Eucharist.' The word translated invocation' is
   epi'klesin; and it is worthy of notice that Basil and Cyril of
   Jerusalem use the same word in evidently the same technical sense
   (Harvey's Irenæus, vol. ii. pp. 205-207 and notes). In another passage
   Irenæus [4291] speaks even more distinctly: We offer to God the bread
   and the cup of blessing, giving thanks to Him for that He hath
   commanded the earth to bring forth these fruits for our nourishment;
   and, having finished the offering, we invoke the Holy Spirit that He
   may exhibit (or declare, apophe'ne) this sacrifice and bread the body
   of Christ, and the cup the blood of Christ, that they who shall receive
   these antitypes may obtain remission of sins and everlasting life'
   (Harvey's Irenæus, vol. ii. p. 502). This passage is a remarkable one.
   It proves beyond question, that, in the time of Irenæus (d. a.d. 202 or
   208), the Liturgy of Gaul contained an invocation of the Holy Ghost
   following the oblation of the bread and cup. Moreover, when we compare
   the words of Irenæus with those of the Clementine Liturgy, their
   agreement is too clear and precise to be explained as a mere
   chance-matter. The liturgy reads, Send down Thy Holy Spirit on this
   sacrifice, the witness of the sufferings of the Lord Jesus, that He may
   exhibit (apophe'ne) this bread, the body of Thy Christ, and this cup,
   the blood of Thy Christ, that they who shall receive,' [4292] etc.
   Irenæus says as above, using the same word (apophe'ne), a word which is
   found, it is believed, in no liturgy but the Clementine."

   Now I humbly suggest that Justin Martyr and Irenæus concur in giving us
   evidence that the Clementine Liturgy is substantially that which was
   used in Rome and Gaul in their times. The latter may have received it
   from Polycarp. The use of the Roman and the Greek churches was uniform
   in his day, as may be inferred from the intercourse of Polycarp and
   Victor. [4293]

     * Quindecemviri.: [8513]1
     * Sed neque mulier virtutem pudicitiæ caperet, si peccare non posset.
       Nam quis mutum animal pudicum esse dixerit, quod suscepto foe tu
       mari repugnat? Quod ideo facit, quia necesse est in dolorem atque
       in periculum veniat, si admiserit. Nulla igitur laus est, non
       facere quod facere non possis. Ideo autem pudicitia in homine
       laudatur, quia non naturalis est, sed voluntaria. Servanda igitur
       fides ab utroque alteri est: immo exemplo continentia: docenda
       uxor, ut se caste gerat. Iniquum est enim, ut id exigas, quod præ
       stare ipse non possis. Quæ iniquitas effecit profecto, ut essent
       adulteria, foe minis ægre ferentibus præ stare se fidem non
       exhibentibus mutuam charitatem. Denique nulla est tam perditi
       pudoris adultera, quæ non hanc causam vitiis suis præ tendat;
       injuriam se peccando non facere, sed referre. Quod optime
       Quintilianus expressit: Homo, inquit, neque alieni matrimonii
       abstinens, neque sui custos, quæ inter se natura. connexa sunt. Nam
       neque maritus circa corrumpendas aliorum conjuges occupatus potest
       vacare domesticæ sanctitati; et uxor, cum in tale incidit
       matrimonium, exemplo ipso concitara, out imitari se putat, out
       vindicari.: [8514]1

     * et Aristoteles sic fieri arbitrantur. Aiunt non tantum maribus
       inesse semen, verum etiam foeminis, et inde plerumque matribus
       similes procreari; sed earum semensanguinem esse purgatum, quod si
       recte cum virili mixture sit, utraque concreta et simul co-agulata
       informari: et primum quidem cor hominis effingi, quod in eo sit et
       vita omnis et sapientia; denique totum opus quadragesimo die
       consummari. Ex abortionibus hæ c fortasse collecta sunt. In avium
       tamen foetibus primurn oculos fingi dubium non est, quod in ovis sæ

     * Cautum est.: [8661]1
     * Cavendum igitur, ne occasionem vitiis nostra intemperantia demus:
       sed assuescant invicem mores duorum, et jugum paribus animis
       ferant. Nos ipsos in altero cogitemus. Nam fere in hoc justitiæ
       summa consistit, ut non facias alteri, quidquid ipse ab altero pati
       nolis. Hæc sunt quæ ad continentiam præ cipiuntur a Deo. Sed tamen
       ne quis divina præ cepta circumscribere se putet posse, adduntur
       ilia, ut omnis calumnia, et occasio fraudis removeatur, adulterum
       esse, qui a marito dimissam duxerit, et eum qui præ tercrimen
       adulterii uxorem dimiserit, ut alteram ducat; dissociari enim
       corpus et distrahi Deus noluit. Præ terea non tanturn adulterium
       esse vitandum, sed etiam cogitationem; ne quis aspiciat alienam, et
       animo concupiscat: adulteram enim fieri mentem, si vel imaginem
       voluptatis sibi ipsa depinxerit. Mens est enim profecto quæ peccat;
       quæ immoderata: libidinis fructum cogitatione complectitur; in hac
       crimen est, in hac omne delictum. Nam etsi corpus nulla sit lobe
       maculatum, non constat tamen pudicitiæ ratio, si animus incestus
       est; nec illibata castitas videri potest, ubi conscientiam
       cupiditas inquinavit. Nec verb aliquis existimet, difficile esse
       fræ nos imponere voluptati, eamque vagam et errantem castitatis
       pudicitiæ que limitibus includere, cum propositum sit hominibus
       etiam vincere, ac plurimi beatam atque incorruptam corporis
       integritatem retinuerint, multique sint, qui hoc coe lesti genere
       vitæ felicissime perfruantur. Quod quidem Deus non ira fieri præ
       cepit, tanquam astringat, quia generari homines oportet; sed
       tanquam sinat. Scit enim, quantam his affectibus imposuerit
       necessitatem. Si quis hoc, inquit, facere potuerit, habebit eximiam
       incomparabilemque mercedem. Quod continentiæ genus quasi fastigium
       est, omniumque consummatio virtutum. Ad quam si quis eniti atque
       eluctari potuerit, hunc servum dominus, hunc discipulum magister
       agnoscet; hic terrain triumphabit, hic erit consimilis Deo, qui
       virtutem Dei cepit. Hæc quidem difficilia videntur; sed de eo
       loquimur, cui calcatis omnibus terrenis, iter in coelum paratur.
       Nam quia virtus in Dei agnitione consistit, omnia gravia sunt, dum
       ignores; ubi cognoveris, facilia: per ipsas difficultates nobis
       exeundum est, qui ad summum bonum tendimus.: [8662]1

     * His obscoenitatibus animas, ad sanctitatem genitas, velut in coeni
       gurgite demersit, pudorem extinxit, pudicitiam profligavit. Idem
       etiam mares maribus admiscuit; et nefandos coitus contra naturam
       contraque institutum Dei machinatus est: sic imbuit homines, et
       armavit ad nefas omne. Quid enim potest esse sanctum iis, qui
       ætatem imbecillam et præsidio indigentem, libidini suæ depopulandam
       foedandamque substraverint? Non potest hæc res pro magnitudine
       sceleris enarrari. Nihil amplius istos appellare possum, quam
       implos et parricidas, quibus non sufficit sexus a Deo datus, nisi
       eliare suum profane ac petulanter illudant. Hæc tamen apud illos
       levia, et quasi honesta sunt. Quid dicam de iis, qui abominandam
       non libidinem, sod insaniam potius exercent! Piget dicere: sed quid
       his fore credamus, quos non piget facere? et tamen dicendum est,
       quia fit. De istis loquor, quorum teterrima libido et execrabilis
       furor ne capiti quidem parcit. Quibus hoc verbis, aut qua
       indignatione tantum nefas prosequar? Vincit officium linguæ
       sceleris magnitudo. Cum igitur libido hæc edat opera, et hæc
       facinora designer, armandi adversus earn virtute maxima sumus.
       Quisquis affectus illos frænare non potest, cohibeat eos intra præ
       scriptum legitimi tori, ut et illud, quod avide expetat,
       consequatur, et tamen in peccatum non incidat. Nam quid sibi
       homines perditi volunt? Nempe honesta opera voluptas sequitur: si
       ipsam per se appetunt, justa et legitima frui licet.: [8935]1

       alienis, quæ attingere non licet, veriun etiam publicis vulgatisque
       corporibus abstinendum, Deus præcepit; docetque nos, cum duo inter
       se corpora fuerint copulata, unum corpus efficere. Ita qui se coeno
       immerserit, coeno sit oblitus necesse est; et corpus quidem cito
       ablui potest: mens autem contagione impudici corporis inquinata non
       potest, nisi et longo tempore, et multis bonis operibus, ab ea quæ
       inhæ serit colluvione purgari. Oportet ergo sibi quemque proponere,
       duorum sexuum conjunctionem generandi causa datam esse viventibus,
       eamque legera his affectibus positam, ut successionera parent.
       Sicut autem dedit nobis oculos Deus, non ut spectemus,
       voluptatemque capiamus, sed ut videamus propter eos actus, qui
       pertinent ad vitæ necessitatem, ita genitalem corporis partem, quod
       nomen ipsum docet, nulla alia causa nisi efficiendæ sobolis
       accepimus. Huic divinæ legi summa devotione parendum est. Sint
       omnes, qui se discipulos Dei profitebuntur, ita morati et
       instituti, ut imperare sibi possint. Nam qui voluptatibus
       indulgent, qui libidini obsequuntur, ii animam suam corpori
       mancipant, ad mortemque condemnant: quia se corpori addixerunt, in
       quod habet mors potestatem. Unusquisque igitur, quantum potest,
       formet se ad verecundiam, pudorem colat, castitatem conscientia et
       mente tueatur; nec tantum legibus publicis pareat: sed sit supra

       copulatis, successiva soboles pareretur, ne omne genus viventium
       conditio mortalitatis extingueret. Sed plus roboris maribus
       attributum est, quo facilius ad patientiam jugi maritalis foeminæ
       cogerentur. Vir itaque nominatus est, quod major in eo vis est,
       quire in foemina; et hinc virtus nomen accepit. Item mulier (ut :

     * Si vita est optanda sapienti profecto nullam aliam ob causam vivere
       optaverim, quam ut aliquid efficiam quod vita dignum sit: [9434]1

     * Similitudines autem in corporibus filiorum sic fieri putant. Cum
       semina inter se permixta coalescunt, si virile superaverit, patri
       similem provenire, seu marem, seu foeminam; si muliebre præ
       valuerit, progeniem cujusque sexus ad imaginem respondere maternam.
       Id autem præ valet e duobus, quod fuerit uberius; alterum enim
       quodammodo amplectitur et includit: hinc plerumque fled, ut unius
       tantum lineamenta præ tendat. Si vero æqua fuerit ex pari semente
       permixtio, figuras quoque misceri, ut soboles illa communis aut
       neutrum referre videatur, quia totum ex altero non habet; aut
       utrumque, quia partem de singulis mutuata est. Nam in cor-poribus
       animalium videmus aut confundi parentum colores, ac fieri tertium
       neutri generantium simile; aut utriusque sic exprimi, ut
       discoloribus membris per omne corpus concors mixtura varietur.
       Dispares quoque naturæ hoc modo fieri putantur. Cum forte in læ vam
       uteri partem masculinæ stirpis semen inciderit, marem quidem gigni
       opinatio est; sed quia sit in foeminina parte conceptus, aliquid in
       se habere foemineum, supra quam decus virile patiatur; vel formam
       insignem, vel nimium candorem, vel corporis levitatem, vel artus
       delicatos, vel staturam brevem, vel vocem gracilem, vel animum
       imbecillum, vel ex his plura. Item, si partem in dextram semen
       foeminini sexus influxerit, foeminam quidem procreari; sed quoniam
       in masculina parte concepta sit, habere in se aliquid virilita-tis,
       ultra quam sexus; ratio permittat; aut valida membra, aut
       immoderatam Iongitudinem, aut fuscum colorem, aut hispidam faciem,

     * Venio nunc ad eam, quæ percipitur ex tactu, voluptatem: qui sensus
       est quidem totius corporis. Sed ego non de ornamentis, aut
       vestibus, sed de solâ libidine dicendum mihi puto; quæ maxime
       coercenda est, quia maxime nocet. Cure excogitasset Deus duorum
       sexuum rationero, attribuit iis, ut se invicem appeterent, et
       conjunctione gauderent. Itaque ardentissimam cupiditatem cunctorum
       animantium corporibus admiscuit, ut in hos affectus avidissime
       ruerent, eaque ratione propagari et multiplicari genera possent.
       Quæ cupiditas et appetentia in homine vehementior et acrior
       invenitur; vel quia hominum multitudinem voluit esse majorem, vel
       quoniam virtutem soli homini dedit, ut esset laus et gloria in
       coercendis voluptatibus, et abstinentia sui. Seit ergo adversarius
       ille noster, quanta sit vis hujus cupiditatis, quam quidam
       necessitatem dicere maluerunt; eamque a recto et bono, ad malum et
       pravum transfert. Illicita enim desideria immittit, ut aliena
       contaminent, quibus habere propria sine delicto licet. Objicit
       quippe oculis irritabiles formas, suggeritque fomenta, et vitiis
       pabulum subministrat: tum intimis visceribus stimulos omnes
       conturbat et commovet, et naturalem illum incitat atque inflammat
       ardorem, donee irretitum hominem implicatumque decipiat. Ac ne quis
       esset, qui poenarum metu abstineret alieno, lupanaria quoque
       constituit; et pudorem infelicium mulierum publicavit, ut ludibrio
