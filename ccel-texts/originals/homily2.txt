   "WELL -- What are ages and the lapse of time

   Match'd against truths, as lasting as sublime?

   Can length of years on God Himself exact?

   Or make that fiction, which was once a fact?

   No -- marble and recording brass decay,

   And, like the graver's memory, pass away;

   The works of man inherit, as is just,

   Their author's frailty, and return to dust;

   But Truth divine for ever stands secure,

   Its head is guarded as its base is sure;

   Fix'd in the rolling flood of endless years,

   The pillar of the eternal plan appears,

   The raving storm and dashing wave defies,

   Built by that Architect who built the skies."

   COWPER.

   I have poured out my soul before the Lord. 1 Sam. i. 15.

   HANNAH'S soul was fall of complaint and grief, which flowed over into
   her face and made it sorrowful. But when she had poured out her soul
   before the Lord, emptying out all its bitterness, the peace of God took
   the place of her soul-anguish, she went her way, and did eat, and her
   countenance was no more sad. What a glad exchange! How great the
   contrast! How much the better for herself, and for her home!

   Is your face darkened by the bitterness of your soul? Perhaps the enemy
   has been vexing you sorely; or there is an unrealized hope, an
   unfulfilled purpose. in your life; or, perchance, the Lord seems to
   have forgotten you. Poor sufferer, there is nothing for it but to pour
   out your soul before the Lord. Empty out its contents in confession and
   prayer. God knows it all; yet tell Him, as if He knew nothing. "Ye
   people, pour out your hearts before Him. God is a refuge for us." "In
   everything, by prayer and supplication make your requests known unto
   God."

   As we pour out our bitterness, God pours in his peace. Weeping goes out
   of one door whilst joy enters at another. We transmit the cup of tears
   to the Man of Sorrows, and He hands it back to us filled with the
   blessings of the new covenant. Some day you will come to the spot where
   you wept and prayed, bringing your offering of praise and thanksgiving.

   His mother made him a little coat. 1 Sam. ii. 19.

   WHAT happy work it was! Those nimble fingers flew along the seams,
   because love inspired them. All her woman's art and wit were put into
   the garment, her one idea and ambition being to make something which
   should be not only useful, but becoming. Not mothers only, but fathers,
   are always making little coats for their children, which they wear Iong
   years after a material fabric would have become worn out. How many men
   and women are wearing today the coats which their parents cut out and
   made for them long years ago!

   Habits are the vesture of the soul. The Apostle bade his converts put
   off the old man, "which is corrupt, according to the deceitful lusts,"
   and to put on the new man, "which after God is created in righteousness
   and true holiness"; to put off anger, wrath, and malice, whilst they
   put on mercy, humility, and meekness. What words could better establish
   the fact that habits are (as the name indicates) the clothing of the
   inner life! Where and how are habits formed? Not in the mid-passage of
   life, but at its dawn; not in great crises, but in daily circumstances;
   not in life's arena, but in the home, amid the surroundings of earliest
   childhood. Oh that the spotless robe of Christ's righteousness may ever
   be exhibited before those with whom we daily come in contact!

   By their behaviour to each other and to their children; by the ordering
   of the home-life; by their actions, more than by their words; by the
   way in which they speak, and spend their leisure hours, and pray -- men
   and women are making the little coats which, for better or worse, their
   children wear ever after, and perhaps pass down to after generations.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel,
   Samuel! 1 Sam. iii. 10.

   SEE the urgency of God! Four times He came, and stood, and called. Mark
   how He stands at the door to knock. At first He was content to call the
   lad once by name; but after three unsuccessful attempts to attract him
   to Himself, He uttered the name twice, with strong urgency in the
   appeal, Samuel! Samuel! This has been called God's double knock. There
   are seven or eight of these double knocks in Scripture: Simon, Simon;
   Saul, Saul; Abraham, Abraham.

   How may we be sure of a Divine call?

   We may know God's call when it grows in intensity. -- If an impression
   comes into your soul, and you are not quite sure of its origin, pray
   over it; above all, act on it so far as possible, follow in the
   direction in which it leads --and as you lift up your soul before God,
   it will wax or wane. If it wanes at all, abandon it. If it waxes follow
   it, though all hell attempt to stay you.

   We may test God's call by the assistance of godly friends. -- The aged
   Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child, and gave him good
   advice as to the manner in which he should respond to it. Our special
   gifts and the drift of our circumstances will also assuredly concur in
   one of God's calls.

   We may test God's call by its effect on us. -- Does it lead to
   self-denial? Does it induce us to leave the comfortable bed and step
   into the cold? Does it drive us forth to minister to others? Does it
   make us more unseIfish, loving, tender, modest, humble! Whatever is to
   the humbling of our pride, and the glory of God, may be truly deemed
   God's call. Be quick to respond, and fearlessly deliver the message the
   Lord has given you.

   Let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord. 1 Sam. iv. 3.

   ISRAEL had been defeated with great loss. Their only hope of being able
   to hold their own against the Philistines and the people of the land
   was in the protection and help vouchsafed to them by God. They knew
   this, and thought that they would be secured, if only the Ark of the
   covenant were on the field. They forgot that it was only the material
   symbol of a spiritual relationship; that it was useless unless that
   relationship was in living force; and that the bending forms of the
   cherubim, emblematic of the Divine protection, would not avail if their
   fellowship with the God of the cherubim had been ruptured by
   backsliding.

   There is a sense in which we are always sending for the Ark. The
   reliance on outward rites, such as Baptism and the Lord's Supper, on
   the part of those who are alienated from the life of God ; the
   maintenance of the forms of prayer and Scripture-reading, which no
   longer express the passionate love of the soul; the habit of
   churchgoing, which so many practise, not because they love God, but
   because they think that it will in some way secure his alliance in
   life's battle -- all these are forms in which we still fetch the Ark of
   the covenant, whilst our hearts are wrong with the God of the covenant.

   It should never be forgotten that nothing can afford to us protection
   and succour but vital union with Christ. We must hide in his secret
   place if we would abide under his shadow. We must dwell in the most
   holy place if we would be shadowed by the wings of the Shekinah. There
   must be nothing between us and God, if we are to walk together, and
   enjoy fellowship with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the Ark of the Lord.
   1 Sam. v. 3.

   THE idols of the heathen represent demons who are their accepted gods,
   just as the Ark was the symbol of the presence of Jehovah. In the one
   case there was a material representation of the demon; but in the case
   of the Ark there was only a throne, the Mercy Seat; and no attempt was
   made to represent the appearance of the God of Israel. When placed in
   the Holy of Holies, the Shekinah shone between the cherubim; this alone
   spoke of the Divine Spirit who filled the apparently vacant throne.
   When the effigy of the fish-god was confronted by the Sacred Ark, it
   was as though the demon spirit and the Divine Spirit had come into
   contact, with the inevitable result that the inferiority of the one
   ensured the crash of its effigy to the ground.

   What a lesson this must have been to the Philistines -- similar to that
   given Pharaoh in the plagues of Egypt, and with the same object of
   leading them to see the superior greatness of Jehovah! How great the
   encouragement to Israel -- to know that God could defend his
   superiority! And how striking the prognostication for the future, when
   all the Dagons of the world shall be broken before the symbol of Divine
   power and love!

   Bring the Ark of God into your life. Set it down in your heart, and
   forthwith the Dagons which have held sway for so long will one after
   another succumb. "The idols He will utterly abolish." Let Christ in --
   that is the one need of the soul; and let Him take full possession of
   you. Then He will do his own work. Darkness cannot abide light; nor the
   defilement of the Augean stable the turning in of the water of the
   river.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And the kine went along the highway, lowing as they went. 1 Sam. vi.
   12.

   THAT two milch kine which had never borne the yoke should move quietly
   along the high road, turning neither to the right nor to the left, and
   lowing for the calves they had left behind, clearly indicated that they
   were possessed and guided by some mysterious power, which we know to
   have been God's. And if He were able thus to overpower the instincts of
   their nature, and to compel them to do his will, may we not infer that
   all circumstances, and all men, however unwittingly, and against their
   natural instinct, are subserving the purposes of his will, and bearing
   on the Ark? The fish yields the tribute money; the colt of the ass
   waits where two ways meet to bear the Redeemer; the man with the
   waterpot leads to the upper room; the Roman soldiers enable Paul to
   fulfil the mission of his life, in preaching the Gospel without
   hindrance in the very heart of Rome.

   As we go forth into the world, let us believe that the movement of all
   things is towards the accomplishment of God's purpose. Herein is a
   fulfilment of the Psalmist's prediction about man, which can only be
   perfectly fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the second Adam -- that all things
   are under his feet, all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the
   field. Everything serves Christ, and those who serve Christ. In a true
   sense all things are ours; they minister to us, even as Christ to God.

   And against our natural inclinations let us always regard the claims of
   God as paramount; and dare to go his way, though our heart pines for
   those we leave behind. "He that loveth father or mother, son or
   daughter, more than Me, is not worthy of Me."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God. 1 Sam. vii 8.

   SAMUEL was famous for his prayers. They are repeatedly referred to in
   the brief record of his life. In the Psalms he is spoken of as the one
   "who called upon God's name." Indeed, he fought and won Israel's
   battles by his strong intercessions. Mary of Scots said that she
   dreaded the prayers of John Knox more than the battalions of the King
   of France. So his people were accustomed to think that if the prophet's
   hands were held out in importunate prayer, their foes must be
   restrained.

   In the Life of Mr. Reginald Radcliffe, one who contributes a
   reminiscence interjects a remark which deserves to be carefully
   pondered: -- "The great secret of the blessing which came from God to
   the awakening of whole districts, the quickening of Christians, and the
   salvation of multitudes, was prayer, continued, fervent, believing,
   expectant. There was never anything striking in the addresses; but
   through communion with the living Christ, the word came forth with
   living and life-giving power. Often would the forenoon be spent in
   continuous prayer." This may well convict some of us of the cause of
   our failure. We have expected the Lord to thunder and discomfort our
   Philistines, and with a great deliverance ; but we have ceased to cry
   unto the Lord.

   Ye that are the Lord's remembrancers, cease not to cry unto Him. If the
   judge avenged the unfortunate widow, shall not God avenge his own
   elect, who cry day and night? It is recorded of our Lord that He prayed
   early and late, and all night. He prayed when He was about to be
   transfigured; for his disciples; in the Garden of Gethsemane; and for
   his murderers. How much more do we need to "pray without ceasing"!
     __________________________________________________________________

   But the thing displeased Samuel.... And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. 1
   Sam. viii. 6.

   A LITTLE further down in the chapter we learn that Samuel rehearsed the
   words of the people unto the Lord. His prayer, to a large extent, was a
   rehearsal of all the strong and unkind things that the people had said
   to him; and in this way he passed them off his mind, and found relief.
   There is a suggestion of close communion with God in the expression,
   "He rehearsed them in the ears of the

   Lord." It had been the habit of his life to be on intimate terms with
   his God.

   Things do not always turn out as we had hoped, and we get displeased
   for our own sakes and God's. We had planned in one direction, but
   events have issued in another; and the results have threatened to
   become disastrous. There is but one resource. If we allow vexations to
   eat into our heart, they will corrode and injure it. We must rehearse
   them to God -- spreading the letter before Him, as Hezekiah did; making
   request like Paul; crying like Samuel.

   Surely it is the mistake of our life, that we carry our burdens instead
   of handing them over; that we worry instead of trusting; that we pray
   so little. The grass grows thick on the pathway to our oratory; the
   cobwebs hang across the doorway. The time we spend in prayer is perhaps
   better spent than in any other way. It was whilst Samuel prayed thus,
   that he saw the Divine programme for Israel:

   "And he who at the sixth hour sought

   The lone house-top to pray,

   There gained a sight beyond his thought --

   The dawn of Gentile day.

   Then reckon not, when perils lour,

   The time of prayer mis-spent;

   Nor meanest chance, nor place, nor hour,

   Without its heavenward bent."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Behold, there is in this city a man of God. 1 Sam. ix. 6.

   THERE is a street in London, near St. Paul's, which I never traverse
   without very peculiar feelings. It is Godliman Street. Evidently the
   name is a corruption of godly man. Did some saint of God once live
   here, whose life was so holy as to give a sweet savour to the very
   street in which he dwelt? Were the neighbours who knew him best, the
   most sure of his godliness? Would that our piety might leave its mark
   on our neighbourhoods, and the memory linger long after we have passed
   away!

   A generation or two ago in the Highlands, there were earnest and holy
   men who were known by the significant title of the men. No great
   religious gathering was deemed complete without them. Their prayers and
   exhortations were accompanied by an especial unction.

   In such manner Samuel's godliness was recognised far and wide. The
   fragrance of his character could not be concealed. And this gave men
   confidence in him. They said, "He is an honourable man; all that he
   saith cometh surely to pass." How much credit redounds to godliness,
   when it is combined with trustworthiness and high credit amongst our
   fellows!

   Let us seek to be God's men and women. Let us live not only soberly and
   righteously, but godly, in this present world. Let us remember that God
   hath set apart the godly for Himself. The godly are the godlike. They
   become so by cultivating the fellowship and friendship of God. Their
   faces become enlightened with his beauty; their words are weighty with
   his truth. After being for a little in their company, you detect the
   gravity, serenity, gentleness, beauty of holiness, which are the court
   manners of heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Thou shalt do as occasion serve thee. 1 Sam. x. 7.

   THIS is an example of how God demands of us the use of our sanctified
   common-sense. Samuel sketches to Saul the course of events during the
   next few days; showing how clearly our lives lie naked and open to the
   eyes of God, and how easily He can reveal them when necessary. But
   whilst the various incidents are told, the prophet does not feel it
   incumbent to tell this goodly young man how he should behave in any
   given instance. "When these signs are come upon thee, thou shalt do as
   occasion serve thee."

   We are reminded of a parallel in the life of Peter. The angel of God
   unbarred the prison-doors, and led him forth, because nothing short of
   Divine power would avail. He led the dazed Apostle through one street,
   because he was too bewildered to realize what had happened. But, as
   soon as the night-air had brought him to his senses, the angel left him
   "to consider the meitter" -- to use his own judgment. The result of
   which was, that he went to the house of Mary.

   One of the divinest of our faculties is the judgment, before which the
   reasons for and against a certain course of action must be adduced, but
   with which the ultimate decision lies. It is a tendency with some to
   depreciate the use of this wonderful power, by looking for signs and
   visions to point their path. This is a profound mistake. God will give
   these when there are complications in which the exercise of judgment
   might be at fault; but not where it is sufficient. Where no sign is
   given, carefully divest yourself of selfish considerations, weigh the
   pros and cons, ask for guidance, dare to act; and having acted in
   faith, never look back or doubt.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Come let us go to Gilgal, and renew the Kingdom there . 1 Sam. xi. 14.

   IT is good to have days and occasions for renewing the kingdom. Already
   Saul had been anointed king. It was a recognised matter that he should
   inaugurate the days of the kings, as distinguished from those of the
   judges. But his great victory at Jabesh-Gilead seems to have wrought
   the enthusiasm of the people to the highest pitch, and to have
   presented a great opportunity for renewing the kingdom. They went to
   Gilgal to do this, because there, on the first entrance into Canaan,
   Israel had rolled away the reproach of uncircumcision, which symbolised
   their lack of separation.

   Jesus is our King. The Father hath anointed Him, and set Him on his
   holy hill; and we have gladly assented to the appointment, and made Him
   King. But sometimes our sense of loyalty and devotion wanes. Insensibly
   we drift from our strenuous endeavour to act always as his devoted
   subjects. Therefore we need, from time to time, to renew the kingdom,
   and reverently make Him King before the Lord.

   Go over the old solemn form of dedication; turn to the yellow leaves of
   the diary; bring under his sceptre any new provinces of influence that
   have been acquired; tell Him how glad and thankful you are to live only
   for Him. Let this be done at Gilgal, the place of circumcision and
   separation, with the Jordan of death flowing behind, and the Land of
   Promise beckoning in front. There is a sense in which we can consecrate
   ourselves only once; but we can renew our vows often.

   "Blessings abound where'er He reigns;

   The prisoner leaps to burst his chains;

   The weary find eternal rest,

   And all the sons of want are blest"
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Lord will not forsake his people for his great Name's sake. 1 Sam.
   xii. 22.

   THE certainty of our salvation rests on the character of God. Moses,
   years before, had pleaded that God could not afford to destroy or
   forsake Israel, lest the Egyptians and others should have some ground
   for saying that He was not able to carry out his purpose, or that He
   was fickle and changeable. "What wilt Thou do for thy great Name?"
   Samuel uses the same argument. We also may avail ourselves of it for
   our great comfort.

   God knew what we should be -- how weak and frail and changeful --
   before He arrested us and brought us to Himself. Speaking after the
   manner of men, we might say He counted the cost. He computed whether
   his resources were sufficient to secure us from our foes, keep us from
   falling, and present us faultless before the presence of his glory with
   exceeding joy. He foreknew how much forbearance, pity, consolation, and
   tenderness, we should require. And yet it pleased Him to make us his
   people. He cannot, therefore, now run back from his purpose; otherwise
   it would seem that difficulties had arisen which either He had not
   anticipated, or was not so well able to combat as He had thought. What
   an absurd suggestion! In the former case there would be a slur on his
   omniscience; on the other, upon his omnipotence.

   "What if God should cast you into hell?" was asked of an old
   Scotchwoman.

   'Well," she answered, "If He do, all I can say is, He will lose mair
   than I will."

   The gracious promise given to Joshua may be appropriated by every
   trembling saint of God: "I will never leave thee nor forsake thee." To
   the poor and needy He says, "I the God of Israel will not forsake
   them."
     __________________________________________________________________

   I forced myself, therefore, and offered a burnt-offering. 1 Sam. xiii.
   12.

   THIS was wholly outside Saul's province. Samuel had engaged to arrive
   within the seven days: they had nearly expired, and still there were no
   signs of the prophet; and Saul, yielding to the promptings of his
   impetuous nature, took the matter into his own hand, and rashly assumed
   an office to which he had no right. He protested that he had been very
   unwilling to add the function of priest to that of king. But this was
   notoriously contrary to the truth. For some time he had chafed against
   Samuel's prerogative, and now sought to supersede the Divine order.

   It seemed but a small act, and, to superficial judgment, not enough to
   warrant the loss of his kingdom; but it was symptomatic of a great
   moral deficiency. He had not learned to obey the commandment of the
   Lord: how could he rule? He could not control the hasty suggestions of
   his own nature, in favour of the deliberate movement of the Divine
   order: how could he be God's chosen agent? He acted on the showings of
   expediency, rather than of faith: how could he be a man after God's own
   heart? The restlessness and haste which characterize the present age
   must not be allowed to affect our service for God; for thereby the
   progress of the Gospel will be hindered rather than helped.

   We must learn to wait for God. He may not come till the allotted time
   has almost passed; but He will come. He waits for the exact moment in
   which He can best succour you. Not till patience has been exercised,
   but before it has given out. In the meanwhile, be sure that your safety
   is secured; He will see to it that the Philistines shall not come down
   to overwhelm you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   His eyes were enlightened. 1 Sam. xiv. 27.

   THE Philistines were in full flight. The Israelites followed hard at
   their heels through the wood. It was there that the honey dropped in
   rich abundance on the ground, and there Jonathan tasted a little,
   dipping the end of his rod into it. It made all the difference to him,
   warding off the excessive exhaustion which paralysed the rest of the
   army.

   The Word of God is sweeter than the honeycomb. -- Luscious to the
   sanctified taste; enlightening to the dimming eyes; strength-giving to
   the weary. It drops in abundance to the ground, as though inviting the
   hand of the Christian warrior or wayfarer to take it freely. If there
   is no taste for the written Word, it may be assumed that the living
   Word has not been enthroned in the heart; for where He reigns supreme,
   there is a longing for the food which alone can fit us for the
   Christian life.

   Where we cannot take much, let us take some. -- There was not time for
   Jonathan to sit down and take his fill. He could only catch up some as
   he hastily passed through the forest-glade; but that little made all
   the difference to him. So, in the early morning, or at mid-day, if we
   cannot fill our hearts with Scripture, we may catch up a morsel, which
   will minister untold refreshment, and clear our spiritual vision.

   We specially need to do this when flushed with success. -- Too often,
   when we have had success in the battles of the Lord -- a good time in
   preaching or teaching -- we are apt to congratulate ourselves, and
   suppose that we can live on the emotions excited. But, probably, there
   is no time when we need more absolutely to turn to the Word of God. In
   victory, as in defeat, we must be fed and nourished.
     __________________________________________________________________

   To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
   1 Sam. xv. 22.

   THIS is a great principle, which is repeatedly enforced throughout the
   Bible. Men have always been apt to divorce religion and morality, and
   to suppose that a certain tribute of sacrifice to God will be
   sufficient compensation for notorious evil-doing. But in every age
   God's servants have protested against the notion, and have insisted, as
   Samuel did with Saul, that it were better to obey, although there
   should be no spoil from which to select victims for sacrifice. This was
   Christ's perpetual protest against the Pharisees.

   Let the Ritualist beware. -- There is a grave fear lest extreme
   attention to the outward rite may be accompanied by carelessness to the
   inward temper. Where the outward observance is the expression of the
   attitude of the soul, it is to be respected even by those of us who
   feel that excessive symbolism is hostile to the devout life; but where
   the rite takes the place of the soul's devotion, or condones a lax
   morality, it cannot be too sternly deprecated. Though all the Levitical
   rites should be observed without flaw, they could not compensate for
   the persistent neglect of the least item of the decalogue. "God is a
   Spirit; and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in
   truth."

   Let us all beware. -- We are apt to make sacrifices of time and money
   and energy for God, and to comfort ourselves with the reflection that
   such as we are may be excused if in small lapses of temper, or
   disposition, we come short of the Divine standard. No; it cannot pass
   muster. One sin mastered, one temptation resisted, one duty performed,
   is dearer to God than the most costly sacrifices that were ever piled
   upon the altar.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. 1 Sam.
   xvi. 13.

   WHAT may not a day bring forth! Here was a shepherd lad, summoned
   hastily from his sheep, and anointed king. But an even greater blessing
   came into his life that day, for he was mightily endued with the Holy
   Spirit. Without doubt, during his early years the Spirit of God had
   dwelt within him, moulding his character, inditing his songs; but,
   henceforth, the Spirit was to abide on him, as a Divine unction.

   Why should not this day witness a similar transformation for you; not
   in the change of earthly position, but in your reception of the "power
   from on high " through a renewed enduement? Why should not the Spirit
   of the Lord come mightily upon you from this holy hour, even as your
   eyes glance down this page? Though it is quite possible that you have
   been empowered once, there is no finality in God's bestowals; the
   apostles were filled and filled again (Acts ii. and iv.).

   The age of Pentecost in which we live is distinctly one of Divine
   anointing. It awaits all who will separate themselves to God, and
   receive it for his glory. The characteristic preposition of this age is
   on. If you have not received power, seek it; he that seeketh findeth;
   nay, receive it -- to ask is to get. If the Master, though begotten of
   the Holy Spirit, forebore to preach the Gospel, and bind up broken
   hearts, till He had been anointed as the Christ by the Spirit, who
   descended on Him at his baptism; how foolish it is for us, who were
   born in sin, to attempt similar work, apart from similar enduement! The
   promise to each child of God is: "Ye shall receive power after that the
   Holy Ghost is come upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto Me" (Acts
   i. 8).

   The armies of the living God. 1 Sam. xvii. 26, 36.

   THIS made all the difference between David and the rest of the camp. To
   Saul and his soldiers God was an absentee -- a name, but little else.
   They believed that He had done great things for his people in the past,
   and that at some future time, in the days of the Messiah, He might be
   expected to do great things again; but no one thought of Him as
   present. Keenly sensitive to the defiance of the Philistine, and
   grieved by the apathy of his people, David, on the other hand, felt
   that God was alive. He had lived alone with Him in the solitude of the
   hills, till God had become one of -the greatest and most real facts of
   his young existence; and as the lad went to and fro among the armed
   warriors, he was sublimely conscious of the presence of the living God
   amid the clang of the camp.

   This is what we need. To live so much with God, that when we come
   amongst men, whether in the bazaars of India or the market-place of an
   English town, we may be more aware of his over-shadowing presence than
   of the presence or absence of any one. Lo, God is here! This place is
   hallowed ground! But none can realize this by the act of the will. We
   can only find God everywhere when we carry Him everywhere. The miner
   sees by the candle he carries on his forehead.

   Each of us is opposed by difficulties, privations, and trials of
   different sorts. But the one answer to them all is faith's vision of
   the Living God. We can face the mightiest foe in his name. If our faith
   can but make Him a passage, along which He shall come, there is no
   Goliath He will not quell; no question He will not answer; no need He
   will not meet
     __________________________________________________________________

   David behaved himself wisely. 1 Sam. xviii. 5, 14, 15, 30.

   THERE must be some strong reason for the four-fold repetition of this
   phrase in so short a space. It is as though the Holy Ghost would lay
   very distinct stress on the Divine prudence and circumspection, which
   must characterise the man whose life is hid in God. Let us walk with
   God, abiding in Him, subjecting our thoughts and plans to his,
   communing about all things with Him, talking over our lives with Him,
   before we go out to live them in the presence of our fellows. Then we
   too shall have this gracious wisdom, which is more moral than
   intellectual -- the product of the grace of God rather than of human
   culture.

   Our life shall commend itself to men (5). -- David's was good in the
   sight of all the people, and more wonderful still, in the sight of
   Saul's servants, who might have been jealous. A life lived in God
   disarms jealousy and envy. He who, as a boy, did his Father's business
   increased in wisdom, and in favour with God and men.

   Our life shall rebuke and awe our foes (15). -- Saul stood in awe of
   him. When traps and snares are laid for us we shall be enabled to
   thread our way through them all, as Jesus did when they tried to
   entangle Him in his talk. We shall have a wisdom which all our foes
   together shall not be able to gainsay or resist.

   Our name will be precious (30). -- People loved to dwell on the name of
   David; it was much set by; they noticed and were impressed with the
   beauty and nobility of his character. We must always view our lives,
   amusements, and undertakings, in the light of the result which will
   accrue to Him whose name it is our privilege to bear.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan. 1 Sam. xix. 6.

   IT was a noble act of Jonathan. He might have withdrawn from his
   friendship with David when it threatened his relations with his father;
   but, instead, be stopped into the breach, and pleaded for his friend,
   endeavouring to eradicate the false ind ungenerous conceptions of which
   Saul had become possessed. It is an example we do well to study and
   copy. For his love's sake, as well as for his father's, he was
   extremely eager to effect a reconciliation between him to whom he owed
   allegiance of son and subject, and this fair shepherd-minstrel-warrior,
   who had so recently cast a sunny gleam upon his life.

   Men often misconceive of one another. Jealousy and envy distort
   behaviour and actions which are in themselves as beautiful as possible.
   Misrepresentation will blind us to the true excellences of one
   another's characters. Wrong constructions are often put on the most
   innocent incidents. We cannot help these things, they are part of the
   sad heritage of the Fall; but we may often take up the cause of a
   misunderstood man, and at the risk of losing our own reputation, and
   diverting to ourselves some of the odium which attaches to him, we may
   stand as his sponsors.

   Even if we dislike another, as Saul did David, let us give scope to the
   good Spirit to plead his cause at the bar of our hearts, as Jonathan
   did for his friend. Let us consider all the kind and loving things that
   may be said of him; let us put ourselves in his position; let us be
   willing to believe and hope all things. Let us plead for others, since
   this is a work in which Christ's followers most closely approximate to
   Him who ever liveth to intercede.

   Thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty. 1 Sam. xx. 18.

   JONATHAN and David had entered into a covenant, each loving the other
   as his own soul. Anxious to shield his friend from the wrath of his
   father, Jonathan discloses to David the plan by which he shall know how
   matters fared in the royal palace. David's vacant seat suggests a
   lesson for us.

   There are a good many empty seats in our houses. Those that occupied
   them can never do so again; they have gone never to return again, and
   we miss them sorely.

   Let us see to it that we do not leave our seats in the home circle
   needlessly vacant. Let not the mother be away at the dance, or even at
   the religious meeting, when she should be at home, joining in her
   children's evening prayers. Let the father be very sure that God has
   called him elsewhere, before he habitually vacates his place in the
   evening family circle. Let each of us avoid giving needless pain to
   those we love by leaving empty seats. But if God calls us away to his
   service, then for those who miss us, another Form shall glide in, and
   sit in the vacant chair; and they will become conscious that the Master
   is filling the gap, and beguiling the weary moments.

   Above all, let not your seat be empty in the house of God, at the
   ordinary service, or at the Lord's Table. We are too prone to allow a
   trifle to deter us from joining in the sacred feasts. At such times we
   are missed, our empty seat witnesses against us; there is a lack in the
   song and prayer, which cries out against us; there is a distinct loss
   to the power of the service, which is in proportion to the number of
   earnest souls present. Oh that there may be no empty seats at the
   marriage supper, vacated through our unfaithfulness!
     __________________________________________________________________

   There is none like that; give it me. 1 Sam. xxi. 9.

   WHAT David said of the sword of Goliath we may say of Holy Scripture --
   the sword of the Spirit -- "There is none like that."

   There is no book like the Bible for those convinced of sin. -- The Word
   of God assures the sinner of God's love in Christ, whilst it refuses to
   condone a single sin, or excuse one shortcoming. The Bible is as stern
   as conscience herself against sin, but as pitiful as the heart of God
   to the sinner. It, moreover, discloses the method by which the just God
   becomes the justifier of those who believe.

   There is no book like the Bible for the sorrowful. -- It tells of the
   Comforter; it reminds us that in all our sorrow God also is sad; it
   points to the perfect plan according to which God is working out our
   blessedness; it insists that all things are working together for good;
   it opens the vision of the blessed future, where all the griefs and
   tears of men shall be put away for ever.

   There is no book like the Bible for the dying. -- "Read to me," said
   Sir Walter Scott, on his dying bed, to his friend. "What shall l read?"
   "There is only one book for a dying man," was the answer; "read to me
   from the Bible." The Book which tells of the Lord, who died and rose
   again; of the mansions which He has gone to prepare; of the reunion of
   the saints; of the fountains of water of life -- is the only pillow on
   which the dying head can rest softly.

   In these days of debate and doubt there is no such evidence for the
   Divine authority of the Bible as that which accrues from its perpetual
   use, whether in our own life, or in the conviction of the ungodly.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Till I know what God will do for me. 1 Sam. xxii. 3.

   WE shall never get to the end of all that God will do for us, if only
   we perfectly give ourselves up to Him. David had a very imperfect
   vision of all that was in God's plan for him; he had an inkling, but
   that was all. And we have still less. Yet let us recapitulate some of
   the things which God will do for us.

   He waits to give us the spirit of Sonship: so that we may ever be
   conscious of his Fatherhood, and look up into his face in the garden of
   Gethsemane, and on the Mount of Transfiguration alike, calling Him
   Abba, Father.

   He longs to lead us to full consecration; to lead us into such close
   association with Jesus in his redeeming purpose, that we may become his
   willing bond-servants, with no other purpose and aim in life than his
   service and glory.

   He desires to deliver us from all known sin: that we may be blameless
   and harmless, his children without rebuke in this sinful world, who
   walk before Him in holiness and righteousness all our days.

   He wants to anoint us with the Holy Spirit: so that our ministry to men
   may have more of the savour of Christ; may plough deeper furrows in
   human hearts; may have more abiding results.

   He desires us to come into partnership with his Son -- here in his
   redemptive purpose, yonder in his throne. To this indeed He calls us.

   Who can know all that God waits to do, not here only, but yonder, when
   life has entered upon its eternal stage! "Now are we children of God;
   and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be" (1 John iii. 2,
   R.V.).
     __________________________________________________________________

   He said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 1 Sam. xxiii.
   9.

   DAVID was passing through one of the most awful experiences of his
   life, when his men spoke of -stoning him instead of taking up his
   cause. How many times in this chapter we are informed that David
   inquired of the Lord! Some three or four times the appeal for direction
   was renewed, as though he were fearful to stir one step by the light of
   his own unaided wisdom. In that changeful life of his, it must have
   been extremely difficult to set the Lord always before him, and await
   Divine direction. Many a time his circumstances might seem to demand
   immediate action rather than prayer; and the rude soldiery must have
   insisted on their voice being heard rather than a priest's; but David
   was not deterred by one or the other, and still held to his practice of
   consulting the Urim and Thummim stone, set in the ephod; which was
   probably a splendid diamond, flashing with God's distinct "Yes," or
   growing cloudy and dark with his definite "No."

   Let us inquire of the Lord. The answer will surely come, if we wait for
   it. If we are not sure of it, let us still wait, for it will come --
   not so early as to save us from using our faith, not so late as to
   permit us to be overwhelmed. Direction will come in the growing
   conviction of duty, in the drift of circumstances, in the advice of
   friends, in the perceptions of a sanctified judgment. None that wait on
   God can be ashamed. Whether our duty be to arise and pursue, to sit
   still, or to escape -- "the meek He will guide in judgment; the meek He
   will teach his way." He gives us a white stone in which a name is
   written, which only they know who receive.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And David's heart smote him. 1 Sam. xxiv. 5.

   IT is well to have a tender conscience, and to obey its least
   monitions, even when men and things militate against it. Here was an
   opportunity for David and his band to end their wanderings and
   hardships by one thrust of the spear; but though it was a very small
   thing that he had done, David was struck with remorse for having taken
   advantage of Saul's retirement in the precincts of the cave, where his
   men and he were hiding, and cut off a piece of his robe.

   It was a trifling matter, and yet it seemed dishonouring to God's
   anointed king; and as such it hurt David to have done it. We sometimes
   in conversation and criticism cut off a piece of a man's character, or
   influence for good, or standing in the esteem of others. Ought not our
   heart to smite us for such thoughtless conduct? Ought we not to make
   confession or reparation?

   Circumstances seemed to favour it. -- Of all the scores of caves in the
   neighbourhood, the king had happened to choose the very one, in the
   dark recesses of which David and his men were sheltering. What more
   natural than to obtain some token to convince the king how absolutely
   he had been in his young rival's power? But favouring circumstances do
   not justify an act which is not perfectly healthy and right.
   Opportunity does not make a wrong thing right.

   His men unanimously approved the act, nay, they wanted him to go
   further. Their standard was a very low one, not only in this case, but
   in others. How wonderful that David kept such a high ideal amid such
   comrades! We shall not be judged hereafter by the standard which
   obtained among our comrades.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This shall be no grief unto thee. 1 Sam. xxv. 31.

   THERE was an inimitable blending of woman's wit with worldly prudence
   in the words of the beautiful Abigail. Poor woman, she bad had a sorry
   life of it, mated to such a man as Nabal was! An ill-assorted pair
   certainly, though probably she had had no hand in bringing about the
   alliance. Like so many Eastern women, she was the creature of another's
   act and choice. But she succeeded in averting the blow which David was
   hasting to inflict, by asserting her belief that the time was not far
   distant when he would no longer be a fugitive from his foes, and by
   suggesting that when that happy time came it would be a relief to feel
   that he had not allowed himself to be carried to all lengths by his hot
   passion.

   It was very salutary advice. Let us always look at things from the
   view-point of the future, when our passion shall have subsided, when
   time shall have cooled us, and especially when we review the present
   from the verge of the other world -- how then?

   We can well afford to do this since God is with us, and our life is
   bound up with Him in the bundle of life. Abigail reminded David that
   God would do to

   him all the good of which He had spoken, and would sling out his
   enemies as from a sling. So God will do for us; not one good thing will
   fail of all that He hath promised; no weapon that is formed against us
   shall prosper. Within a little, Nabal was dead, and David's wrong
   righted. So shall the evil that now molests us pass away. God will deal
   with it. Let us leave it to Him: before Him mountains shall melt like
   wax; and we shall have nothing to regret.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Then said Saul, I have sinned. 1 Sam. xxvi. 21.

   THE Apostle makes a great distinction, and rightly, between the sorrow
   of the world and the sorrow of a godly repentance which needeth not to
   be repented of. Certainly Saul's confession of sin belonged to the
   former; whilst the cry of the latter comes out in Psalm li., extorted
   from David by the crimes of after years.

   The difference between the two may be briefly summarized in this, that
   the one counts sin a folly and regrets its consequences; whilst the
   other regards sin as a crime done against the most Holy God, and
   regrets the pain given to Him. "Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned,
   and done this evil in thy sight."

   Obviously Saul's confession was of the former description, "I have
   played the fool." He recognised the unkingliness of his behaviour, and
   the futility of his efforts against David. But he stayed there,
   stopping short of a faithful recognition of his position in the sight
   of God, as weighed in the balances of eternal justice.

   Many a time in Scripture do we meet with this confession. The Prodigal,
   Judas, Pharaoh, David, and Saul, uttered it; but in what differing
   tones, and with what differing motives! We need to winnow our words
   before God; not content with using the expressions of penitence, unless
   we are very sure that they bear the mint-mark of heaven, and deserve
   the master's Beatitude, "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be
   comforted."

   When sin is humbly confessed, the Saviour assures us: "Thy sins, which
   are many, are forgiven thee, go in peace." "lf we confess our sins, He
   is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness. "
     __________________________________________________________________

   And David said, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul. 1 Sam.
   xxvii. 1.

   WHAT a fit of despondency and unbelief was here! We can hardly believe
   that this is he who in so many psalms had boasted of the shepherd care
   of God, who had so often insisted on the safety of God's pavilion. It
   was a fainting fit, brought on by the bad air he had breathed amid the
   evil associations of Adullam's cave. Had not God promised to take care
   of him? Was not his future already guaranteed by the promises that he
   should succeed to the kingdom? But nothing availed to check his
   precipitate flight into the land of the Philistines.

   Bitterly he rued this mistake. The prevarication and deceit to which he
   was driven; the anguish of having to march with Achish against his own
   people; the sack and burning of Ziklag : these were the price he had to
   pay for his mistrust. Unbelief always brings many other bitter sorrows
   in its train, and leads the soul to cry,

   "How long, Lord? Wilt Thou forget me for ever?

   How long wilt Thou hide thy face from me?"

   Let us beware of losing heart, as David did. Look not at Saul, but at
   God, who is omnipotent; not at the winds and waves, but at Him who
   walks across the water; not at what may come, but at that which is --
   for the gIorious Lord is round about thee to deliver thee. He shall
   deliver thy soul from death, thine eyes from tears, and thy feet from
   falling. He that has helped will help. What He has done, He will do.
   God always works from less to more, never from more to less. Dost thou
   not hear -- hast thou not heard -- his voice saying, I will never leave
   thee, nor forsake thee? What, then, can man do unto thee? Every weapon
   used against thee shall go blunt on an invisible shield!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Because thou obeyest not the voice of the Lord, therefore . . . 1 Sam.
   xxviii. 18.

   THUS unforgiven sin comes back to a man. We cannot explain the
   mysteries that lie around this incident; but it is clear that in that
   supreme hour of Saul's fate, that early sin, which had never been
   confessed and put away, came surging back on the mind and heart of the
   terror-stricken monarch. "Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the
   Lord, and didst not execute his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore
   hath the Lord done this thing unto thee This day. Moreover the Lord
   will deliver Israel also with thee into the hands of the Philistines"
   (R.V.). But Saul did not realize that even then the gates of God's love
   stood open to him, if only he would pass through them by humble
   penitence and faith. If instead of applying to the witch, he had sought
   God's mercy, light would have burst on his darkened path, and he had
   never perished by his own hand on Mount Gilboa.

   In strong contrast with this, let us put the assurance of the new
   covenant: "Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." When God
   forgives, He blots out from the book of his remembrance. The sin is
   gone as a pebble in the ocean; as a cloud in the blue of a summer's
   sky.

   Saul's was a sin of omission. The question was not what evil he had
   done, but the good be had failed to do. Let us remember that we need
   pardon for the sad lapses and failures of our lives, equally as for the
   positive transgressions. And if such things are not forgiven, they will
   lie heavy on our consciences when the shadows of death begin to gather
   around us. The New Testament especially judges those who knew and did
   not do -- the slothful servant, the virgin without the oil, the priest
   that passed by on the other side.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What do these Hebrews here? 1 Sam. xxix. 3.

   IT was a very natural remark. The Philistines were going into battle
   with the Hebrew king and his troops, and it was very anomalous that a
   strong body of Hebrews should be forming part of the Philistine array.
   They had no business to be there. The annoyance of the chief captains
   and lords that surrounded Achish was natural enough. For long,
   probably, it had been smouldering; now it broke out into flame.

   It is very terrible when the children of the world have a higher sense
   of Christian propriety and fitness than Christians themselves, and say
   to one another, "What do these Hebrews here?" The word "Hebrew" means
   one that has passed over -- a separatist. The death of our Lord Jesus
   was intended to make all his followers separatists. Through Him they
   have passed from death unto life; they have been delivered out of the
   power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God's dear Son.
   The appeal of his cross to us all is, "Come out from among them, and be
   ye separate." Too often, however, that call is unheeded; and, for fear
   of man, we mingle with the ranks of the enemies of our Lord.

   If Christians attend the theatre; if Sunday-school teachers, elders or
   deacons of a church, are found participating in the pleasures of the
   ungodly; if the young Christian man is found loosely consorting with
   the card-players of the smoking-room of an ocean steamer -- may not the
   sneer go round, "What do these Hebrews here? " "What doest thou here,
   Elijah! " is the remonstrance of God. "What do these Hebrews here? "
   that of the world, which not unfrequently has a truer sense of
   propriety than God's professing followers.
     __________________________________________________________________

   David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. 1 Sam. xxx. 6.

   HIS God! Doubtless the chronicler heard him say repeatedly, as he was
   so fond of saying, "My God, my God. " "I will say unto God, my rock,
   why hast Thou forsaken me?" Though he had seriously compromised God's
   cause, by the failure of his faith, by consorting with Achish and the
   Philistines, by a tortuous and treacherous policy, yet God was still
   his God; and, in the supreme crisis which had overtaken him, he
   naturally betook himself to the covert of those loving wings.

   He encouraged himself. -- He would go back on promises of forgiveness
   and succour, which had so often cheered him in similar straits. He
   would recall his songs in former nights as black as this, and therefore
   would have hope. He would remember that he had been brought through
   worse trials; and surely He who had helped him against Goliath and Saul
   would not fail him against the Amalekites. Besides, he had probably
   left his dear ones in the protection of the encamping angel; and though
   his faith might be tried, it could not be entirely disappointed. In
   this way he encouraged himself. All around was tumult and fear; but in
   God peace and rest brooded, as swans on a tranquil lake. His men might
   speak of stoning him; his heart be greatly distressed for wives and
   children; his life be in jeopardy: but God was a very present help,
   "Why art thou cast down, and disquieted, my soul? Hope thou in God."

   In similar circumstances, let us have resort to similar sources of
   comfort; hide in God, and encourage ourselves in Him. It was in this
   spirit that John Knox, when about to face death, said to his wife,
   "Read to me where I first cast anchor."
     __________________________________________________________________

   All the valiant men . . . 1 Sam. xxxi. 11, 12.

   THIS was a noble and generous act. At the beginning of his reign, in
   the early dawn of youthful promise and prowess, when he was the darling
   of the nation, Saul had interposed to deliver their beleagured city.
   And now, as the awful tidings of his defeat and suicide spread like
   fire through the country, the men whom he had succoured remembered his
   first kingly act, and showed their appreciation for his kindness by
   doing a strong and chivalrous deed in rescuing his remains from
   dishonour. They could not help him, but they could save his honour.
   When David heard of this act, he sent messengers to the men of
   Jabesh-Gilead, thanking them for their chivalrous devotion to the
   memory of the fallen king, and promising to requite the kindness as one
   done to the entire nation, and to himself

   Are we careful enough of the honour and name of our dear Lord? He has
   done for us spiritually all that Saul did for Jabesh-Gilead, and more.
   He has delivered our soul from death, our eyes from tears, and our feet
   from falling. Let us be swift to maintain the honour of his name among
   those who are so apt at making it their scorn.

   It was well that these men did not wait for others to act. Had they
   done so, the body of Saul might have rotted piecemeal on the walls of
   the temple at Bethshan. If they had left this act of reparation for
   Abner, or Ish-bosheth, it would never have been done. There is no order
   of precedence, when a wrong has to be righted, or a friend vindicated.
   The man who is next must act. Let us strike into the fray, and count
   that our opportunity is warrant enough. He who can, may.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives. 2 Sam. i.
   23.

   IT was very lovely and pleasant of David to say so. He had no
   hesitation, of course, in saying this of his beloved Jonathan, every
   memory of whom was very pleasant, like a sweet strain of music, or the
   scent of the spring breeze; but he might have been excused for omitting
   Saul from the graceful and generous epithets he heaped on the kindred
   soul of his friend. But death had obliterated the sad, dark memories of
   recent days, and had transported the Psalmist across the dream of years
   to Saul as he was when he was first introduced to him. All that could
   be said in praise of the first Hebrew king was crowded into these
   glowing lines -- the courage, martial prowess, swiftness to aid those
   who required help, his pleasantness and courtesy in address.

   This is the love of God, which He breathes into the hearts of his
   children. They become perfect in love, as He is. "God commendeth his
   love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
   us." It is God-like for his children to love their enemies, bless those
   who curse them, and pray for all who despitefully use and persecute
   them. Is such love ours? Do we forbear from thinking evil? Do we look
   on the virtues more often than the failures of our friends? Do we cast
   the mantle of forgiveness over the injuries done to us, and dwell
   tenderly on the excellences of our foes? Such is the love which never
   fails, but endures when faith has turned to fruition, and hope has
   realized its dreams.

   We need most of all a baptism of love. A piece of clay will become
   fragrant if placed in contiguity to attar of roses. Let us lie where
   John did, on the bosom of incarnate love, till we begin to love as he.

   The men of Judah came, and there they annoited David king. 2 Sam. ii.
   4.

   THUS was David anointed a second time. Hitherto he had been the leader
   of a troop; now he became king of his own tribe: and his kingdom
   clustered around the ancient city of Hebron.

   Typically, we learn that our blessed Lord will be acknowledged King of
   his own people, the Jews, before He is accepted by the world at large.
   Now, his kingdom is in mystery -- it is in the Adullam stage. Men are
   gathering to Him from all quarters; but as yet the world does not
   recognise it in their political calculations. But ere long the Jews
   will recognise Him as King, and then we may begin to expect his
   enthronement over the populations of the globe. When they repent and
   are converted, times of repenting will come to all the world.

   Experimentally we are taught, that as each new department of our life
   unfolds, we should give Christ a fresh coronation. The attitude which
   we took up years ago, of complete consecration, must be applied
   perpetually to each fresh development of experience. Each new step
   should be characterised by a definite waiting on God, that there may be
   a fresh enduement of power, a recharging of the spirit with his might.
   Was He King in the cave, then be sure to acknowledge Him as such, now
   that you are called from obscurity into the glare of noon. Whenever God
   says, by the circumstances of your life, Go up; always kneel at the
   feet of Jesus, saying, "Lord, in the very little I found my joy and
   strength in serving Thee only; and now, amid the greater responsibility
   and publicity of my life, I desire to be thy earnest, simple-minded,
   whole-hearted follower."

   Have you anointed Jesus as your King? Do not fail. Remember how near of
   kin He is.

   David wared stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul wared weaker.
   2 Sam. iii. 1.

   THE war between the flesh and the Spirit is Iong, but the end is sure.
   As the Baptist said of Jesus, so must the flesh say of the Spirit, He
   must increase; I must decrease. Sometimes, in the long strain of the
   war, our spirit dies down. Will the bugle never cease to ring out its
   alarm? Will the assaults never come, to an end? When shall we be able
   to lay aside sword and breastplate, and to enter the land of rest? Oh
   to be able to say with the Apostle, "I have fought the good fight, I
   have finished my course, I have kept the faith"!

   Yet take heart. The assaults diminish in frequency and strength in
   proportion as they are faithfully resisted. Each time you resist
   successfully you will find it easier to resist. The strength of the
   vanquished foe enters the vanquisher.

   Moreover, ultimate victory is secured. " Whatsoever is born of God
   overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the
   world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that
   believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? " (1 John v. 4, 5). It makes a
   great difference to the soldier, when he belongs to an All-Victorious
   Legion, and serves under a Captain that never lost a fight. And there
   can be no doubt as to the issue in your heart or mine. "He must reign
   till He has put all enemies under his feet."

   At any moment we may look for the sudden collapse of a great portion of
   the confederacy of evil, which has so long menaced us; as when Abner
   suddenly came to Hebron to give in his adhesion to David. What a hugh
   piece of cliff fell that day into the sea! Expect the sudden collapse
   of evils which have long troubled you.

   As the Lord liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity. 2
   Sam. iv. 9.

   IT was the mid-day of David's life, and, looking back, he saw how good
   the Lord had been to him. Step by step God had brought him up out of a
   horrible pit, and from the miry clay, setting him upon a rock, and
   establishing his goings. What need was there, then, that men should
   interfere to hasten the unfolding of the Divine purposes? It had been
   his lifelong habit to wait. Whatever he needed he looked to God to
   supply. Whatever difficulties blocked his path, he looked to God to
   remove. Whatever men stood in his way, he looked to God to deal with
   them. Twice in the wilderness he refused to take Saul's life. He had
   executed the Amalekite because he claimed to have slain Saul on Gilboa.
   And, in pursuance of the same policy, he could have no complicity in
   the act of the murderers of Ishbosheth, even though they made his way
   clear to the throne of Israel.

   Let God redeem thee out of all thine adversities. Do not lose heart or
   hope. Do not put forth thy hand to snatch at any position or
   deliverance by an act which might afterwards cause thee shame or
   sorrow. "Trust in the Lord, and do good. Roll thy way upon the Lord.
   Trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass. Rest in the Lord, and
   wait patiently for Him " (Psa. xxxvii. 3-7, R.V.). He who turns
   glaciers to rivers that pass away, will remove all thy difficulties and
   perplexities. He shall cause thee to inherit the land. He will promote
   thee in due time, and give thee to see thy desire upon thine enemies.He
   who redeemed thy soul by his most precious blood cannot fail thee,
   however long He may tarry.Remember that He ever liveth, and loveth, and
   reigneth
     __________________________________________________________________

   And David took him more wives out of Jerusalem. 2 Sam. v. 13.

   THIS is terribly disappointing! According to the ideas of the
   surrounding nations, the greatness of a monarch was gauged by the
   extent of his harem. But the law of Moses put severe restraint on the
   multiplication of wives, "that his heart turn not away " (Deut. xvii.
   17). It seems as though the soul of David sank into sensual indulgence
   and luxuriance. It lost much of its early hardihood and strength in
   consequence; and at this period of his life those seeds were sown,
   which in after years brought forth such a plentiful and terrible
   harvest of anguish, murder, and impurity, in his family.

   Few of us realize how much our character owes to the stern discipline
   to which God subjects us. The only way to keep us healthy and vigorous
   is to send us many a nipping frost, many a keen northern blast. The
   bleak hillside breeds stronger natures than the warm sheltered valley.
   The difference between Anglo-Saxon and Negro is largely wrought by
   temperature and soil. The campaign, with its strain on every power of
   endurance, trains better soldiers than the barracks. As David was a
   stronger, better man, when hunted like a coney in the rocks of Engedi,
   so are we braced to a nobler life, when all things seem against us.

   Few of us can be trusted with unbroken happiness. God is compelled to
   withhold what the flesh craves. But where prosperity has shone on your
   path, be very careful not to abuse it. Consider it as indicating God's
   loving trust in you. He would rather convey his lesson in sunshine than
   in storm. But walk carefully and humbly, looking to Him constantly for
   daily grace, and never relaxing the girdle about the loin.

   They set the Ark of God upon a new cart. 2 Sam. vi. 3.

   THIS was their mistake. The Divine directions were explicit that the
   Ark of the living God must be carried on the shoulders of living men.
   There would have been no stumbling of oxen, no swaying of the Ark to
   falling, no need for Uzzah to reach out his hand, if only this simple
   direction had been obeyed. This breaking forth of God was to recall men
   to simple absolute obedience to the rules and regulations that had been
   so explicitly laid down in the Levitical code. It could not fall into
   disuse without grave loss to the entire people. Better that one life
   should be sacrificed for disobedience than that the whole nation should
   be impoverished for the relaxation of that ancient law.

   We are fond of bringing new carts to God. At every birthday we build
   the new cart of good resolution, and place thereon the Ark of God. We
   will be different, and on our fresh endeavours the Lord of Hosts shall
   ride; but we must drive, and if needs be, steady the Ark. Ah! it is not
   long before the oxen stumble, and Uzzah who drives is smitten to the
   dust of death.

   God wants, not new carts, but the living shoulders of consecrated men.
   We must live for Him, surrendering ourselves to his service; not
   driving, but being driven; not conducting, but being impelled; not
   imposing our thoughts on Him, but being willing to submit ourselves
   absolutely to Him. There is no need to fear God, if only we will obey
   Him, and in obedience discover the laws by which we may approach and
   serve Him. Then the power which otherwise flames forth to destroy will
   become the useful servant of our faith, and we shall be able to
   undertake great things for God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Do as Thou hast said. 2 Sam. vii. 25.

   THIS is the voice of a childlike faith.

   Note what led to these words. -- Nathan had just unfolded to the king
   all the purposes of God's heart towards him. That He would establish
   his throne, deliver him from his enemies, and set up his dynasty to
   succeed him -- this and much else. David's heart was full of joy and
   gladness -- he knew that God would not run back from his word; but he
   felt none the less the duty of claiming the fulfilments of these
   guarantees. So it is with all the promises of God; though they are Yea
   and Amen in Christ, it is requisite for us to put our hand on them;
   plead them before God; and claim their fulfilment with appropriating
   faith.

   Notice the attitude in which David uttered these words. -- "He sat
   before the Lord." Was not this the position of rest and trust? On
   another occasion, he lay all night upon the earth (xii. 16), in an
   agony of prayer, because not sure of God's purpose, and hoping to turn
   God by the extremity of his anguish. But there is a marvellous
   alteration in the tone of our prayer, so soon as we can base it on the
   declared purposes of God. We enter into his rest; we put ourselves in
   the current of his purposes; we sit before the Lord.

   Mark the blessedness of communion with God. -- It is as a man talks
   with his friend. We are not retired always to kneel when we pray, or to
   con over a certain form of words; we can sit and talk with God,
   catching up his words as they fall on our hearts, and reflecting them
   back on Him in praise, and prayer, and happy converse. All true prayer
   originates in the declarations of God's love, to each of which we
   answer, Do as Thou hast said.

   The silver and gold he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued. 2
   Sam. viii. 11.

   DAVID might not build the temple, but he was bent on making provision
   for it. Indeed, Solomon had never been able to do as he did, unless his
   father had gathered these stores of gold and silver. Thus other men
   labour, and we enter into their labours; but the accomplished building
   is credited by God to each. He does not forget David when Solomon's
   temple stands complete. The reward is proportioned to each man's
   service, according to his share.

   It is a glorious thing when we not only defeat our foes, but get spoils
   out of their overthrow which we can use for the service of God and man.
   It is as possible for us as for David. Out of our failures,
   temptations, mistakes, let us get the power of helping and directing
   others. In death Jesus won the keys of death and Hades, and the power
   to become a merciful and faithful High Priest; and now He ever liveth
   to make intercession for his people (Heb. vii. 25).

   But the main lesson of this chapter is the foreshadowing of God's
   purpose, that Gentiles should contribute to the building of his Temple.
   What was literally true in the case of the temple of Solomon, is
   spiritually true of the heavenly Temple, the Church. From every nation,
   and kindred, people and tongue, souls are being gathered, who form a
   spiritual house, a holy Temple in the Lord. The whole world is destined
   to contribute to that structure, which is being prepared secretly and
   mystically, but shall ere long be manifested in its full glory. It is
   very interesting to get this suggestion from the chronicles of a nation
   so exclusive and haughty as the Jews. "They shall come from the East
   and West . . . . "
     __________________________________________________________________

   Thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. 2 Sam. ix. 7.

   FOUR times in this chapter we are told of the lame man eating bread at
   the royal table. But what are these facts recorded and repeated for,
   save to accentuate the infinite blessings which come to us through the
   Divine love!

   Mephibosheth had done nothing to merit the royal favour. Not a word is
   said of his being well-

   favoured and attractive. So far from that, he was lame on both his
   feet, and probably a sickly invalid. In his own judgment he was
   worthless as a dead dog. His state was impoverished; no deed of prowess
   could win David's notice; he was almost entirely at the mercy of his
   servant, Ziba. In these respects there are many analogies to our own
   condition in the sight of God. We are lame indeed; and, so far as we
   are concerned, it is quite impossible that we should ever win the
   Divine regard, or sit at his table among his sons.

   But between David and Jonathan a covenant had been struck, which had
   provided for the children of the ill-fated Jonathan (1 Sam. xx. 14-16).
   It was because of this sacred obligation that Mephibosheth fared as he
   did. Look away, child of God, to the covenant struck between God and
   thy representative, the Son of his love. It is idle of thee to seek to
   propitiate the Divine favour, or earn a seat at his table; but if thou
   art willing to identify thyself with thy Lord, and to shelter thyself
   in Him by the living union of faith; if thou canst base thy plea on the
   Blood of the everlasting covenant -- then the provisions of that
   covenant between Father and Son shall be extended to thee: and because
   of God's love to Jesus thou shalt sit at the Divine table, and be
   regarded as one of the heirs of the great King.

   The Lord do that which seemeth Him good. 2 Sam. x. 12.

   ISRAEL was arrayed against overwhelming odds. To human sight it must
   have appeared very improbable that Joab would be able to hold his own.
   However, he made the best arrangements he could; exhorted his men to be
   of good courage and do their utmost; and then piously left the issue to
   the God of battles.

   There are times in all lives when the case seems desperate. How can we
   meet with ten thousand him who cometh against us with twenty thousand!
   Heart and flesh fail. What resource is there, then save in the flight
   of the lonely man to the only God? It is for God to act, since the help
   of man is vain.

   In your personal straits. -- When patience is exhausted; when the last
   handful is taken from the barrel; when complicated trials meet and hem
   you in; when the iron gate and the keepers before the door appear to
   render escape impossible -- then look up, God is marching with
   reinforcements to your aid.

   In your work and war for God in the world. -- We too often act and
   speak as if success were to be won by the forces that we may be able to
   bring into the field, whereas God asks us for nothing more than
   fidelity and the right disposition of such forces as we can command; He
   will do all the rest.

   In your outlook on the conflict between good and evil. -- It is quite
   true that there appears to be an infinite disparity between the one and
   the other. But there are other forces in the field than appear. There
   is another host of which God Himself is captain. When the enemy comes
   in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up the standard. "There
   is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven to
   thy help."

   David tarried still at Jerusalem. 2 Sam. xi. 1.

   AH! fatal dalliance in the arms of sensual ease! It led to David's
   undoing. It was the time of the year when kings generally went forth to
   the fight; and in earlier days David would never have thought of
   leaving to Joab or others the strain and stress of conflict when there
   were hard knocks to give and take. Indeed, on more. than one occasion
   his followers had remonstrated against his exposing the Light of Israel
   to the risks of the battlefield. But now he sends Joab and his mighty
   men to fight against Ammon, while he tarries securely at Jerusalem.In
   this fatal lethargy he betrays the deterioration of his soul. Already
   the walls were broken down, and entrance into the citadel was easy. We
   are not surprised to learn that as he sauntered lazily on his palace
   roof in the sultry afternoon he was swept away before the rush of
   sudden passion, and took the poor man's ewe lamb to satisfy the
   va-rant, hungry impulse which suddenly came to him.

   Beware of hours of ease! Rest is necessary; times of recruiting and
   renewal must come to us all; nature positively demands re-creation; but
   there must be no neglect of known duty, no handing over to others of
   what we might and could do ourselves, no tarrying behind the march of
   the troops when we should go forth with them to the battle. Watch and
   pray, that ye enter not into temptation. Be most on guard when not
   actively engaged against the enemy. One unlocked gate may admit the foe
   to the citadel of the life, and rob you of peace for all after-days.
   The luxury of the plains of Capua was more fatal to the soldiers of
   Hannibal than the passage of the Alps.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And David went to Rabboh, and fought against it, and took it. 2 Sam.
   xii. 29.

   VICTORY might seem to have been for ever forfeited after so great a
   fall. We could not have been surprised had we been told that from this
   time onward the course of David's conquests had stayed. And yet this
   thought would be a misconception of God's dealings with the penitent.
   Where there is true contrition, confession, and faith, He not only
   forgives, but restores; He not only restores to the enjoyment of his
   favour, but reinstates in opportunities of usefulness. So Jesus not
   only met the apostle who had denied Him, and put him back into the old
   position of happy fellowship, but gave him a commission to feed his
   sheep and lambs.

   We have sometimes met backsliders who have doubted the possibility of
   their forgiveness; or, if they have realized this, they have never
   dared to hope that they could ever be what they had been. And so long
   as faith refuses to believe in the perfect work of God's love, it must
   inevitably take a back seat. Let us seek for such an entire faith in
   God's forgiving and restoring love as to dare to believe that we are
   put again into the old place, and allowed to anticipate the same
   victories as aforetime. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
   just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
   unrighteousness" (1 John i. 9).

   Directly David said, "I have sinned," in the dash of a moment Nathan
   said, "The Lord hath put away thy sin"; and when Joab sent tidings that
   Rabbah was about to fall, David was permitted the honour of its final
   capture, though it had been associated so closely with Uriah's death.
   Where sin abounds grace superabounds, and reigns through righteousness.
   Dare to believe this.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth. 2
   Sam. xiii. 31.

   THROUGHOUT the incidents of this chapter, the soul of David touched the
   bottom of the sea of anguish and remorse. The circumstances narrated
   were in themselves sad enough; but there was a more bitter element in
   them for David, because he knew that they were the harvest of which his
   own sin was the seed. Here began to be fulfilled the sentence of God
   through Nathan, "The sword shall never depart from thine house."

   He had broken up the peace of another's home, and peace had quitted his
   home, never to return. He had defiled the purity of Uriah's wife, and
   the purity of his own daughter had been trampled under foot. He had
   smitten Uriah, and now Absalom had murdered Amnon. Through those awful
   hours when the entire fate of the whole of his family seemed trembling
   in the balance, he drank to the dregs the cup of bitterness. Oh, how
   true are the apostle's words: "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
   also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
   corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap
   life everlasting."

   Sin resembles the Australian weed, which when once it is sown in the
   waters will spread with such rapidity as to spoil their beauty, and
   choke their flow. We must distinguish between the penal and natural
   results. The penal were borne by Christ for us all, and are remitted
   for evermore; but the natural remain even to forgiven penitents, as
   they did to David. Still, God's grace may transmute them into
   blessings, and cause pearls to grow where before there had been gaping
   wounds. Ask God to take in hand the natural consequences of your sins,
   and make them means of grace and ennoblement.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Yet doth He devise means that his banished be not expelled from Him. 2
   Sam. xiv. 14.

   THE means that David devised were really inadequate. He allowed his
   heart to dictate to his royal sense of justice and rectitude, and
   permitted Absalom to return to his country and home without one word of
   confession, one symptom of penitence. The king was overmastered by the
   father; and the result was disastrous. It shook the respect of his
   people, undermined the foundations of just government, slackened the
   bands of every family in the land, and confirmed Absalom in his wilful
   and obstinate career. "What!" said he to himself, "does my father bid
   me come back without conditions? Does he demand no confession or
   reparation? Then he condones my sin."

   Lot parents be warned. If your children disobey, and violate the rules
   of your home, you have no right to treat them as you did before, until
   they have owned their sin. You must insist on penitence, confession,
   and reparation, though it take hours or days or even weeks of suffering
   and pleading to bring it about.

   Into what relief does David's mistake throw God's way of forgiveness
   and salvation! Had he acted as David, and as so many wish us to
   believe, He would have reinstated the human family in the Paradise of
   his love without waiting for the work of the Mediator, or the
   confession of the prodigal. By the arbitrary exercise of his sovereign
   will He might have wiped out the record of our sins %without our
   concurrence. But it would have been to the irreparable undoing of man.
   Hence it behoved Christ to suffer, by his blood making an atonement for
   our sins, and by his Spirit bringing us to penitence and confession.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here am I, let Him do to me as seemth good unto Him. 2 Sam. xv. 26.

   THERE is the patience of hope. We love to gird ourselves in the
   vehemence of our self-will, to go where we choose, to rule the lives of
   others; but as the years pass and our pride is humbled, the sinews of
   our strength slackened, and the radiance of early prospects overcast,
   we are willing to hand ourselves over to our Father, saying, "Behold,
   here am I; let Him do to me as seemeth good unto Him."

   It was thus that Isaac was passive in the hands of Abraham. It was thus
   that Jesus spoke to his Father, "I come to do thy will, my God." It was
   thus that the maiden who was blessed above women, answered the angel's
   message. It was thus that Paul, when urged not to go up to Jerusalem,
   avowed his willingness to live or die, as the Lord might choose.

   God is ever working upon us through circumstances; and, as in the
   present case, sometimes He overrules the plottings of wicked men to
   fulfil his Divine purpose. His will is sometimes brought to us in a cup
   which a Judas holds to our lips. How blessed to be able to say, as we
   go forth to meet our Father's will, Behold, here am I! and to look
   beyond the plottings and machinations of our enemies to One who loves
   us infinitely. Whatever He permits must be good. Good, if driven as an
   exile from our home; good, if exposed to the revilings of a Shimei;
   good, if the heart breaks in bitter tears. All must be good which the
   good Lord permits or appoints. Many were the afflictions of David, but
   out of them all he was delivered. When he had learnt the lesson, the
   rod was stayed. God did not take away his mercy from him. Thou too art
   in his hands, and He will certainly bring thee again, and show thee the
   city and his habitation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The king and all the people came weary, and refreshed themselves there.
   2 Sam. xvi. 14.

   A GREAT weariness falls often on our souls. We are wearied because of
   the greatness of our way, and inclined to say there is no hope. Memory
   tires us, perpetually casting up the record of past unfaithfulness and
   transgression. The bitter way of the natural consequences of sin is
   toilsome and difficult to the feet. We faint before the averted eve of
   former friends and the pitiless criticism of foes. Longings for a
   vanished past, for life and love, for purity and peace, grind heavily
   in the soul. Our King has known something of human weariness, though
   not from all the sources that cause it in his subjects.

   But amid the presence of our weariness the voice of God may be heard
   saying, "This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest, and
   this is the refreshing." There is rest for weary souls beneath the
   shadow of the cross, in the sight of which the burden rolls away. There
   is rest and refreshment as we sit in the banqueting house of Christ's
   manifested and realized affection. There is refreshment as we eat of
   his flesh and drink of his blood; as we yield our will to his; as we
   sit with Him in heavenly places. We assuredly find Him to be "a hiding
   place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water
   in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land" (Isa.
   xxxii. 2).

   There is no hill Difficulty without its arbour; no desert without its
   oasis; no sultry heat without its shadow of a great rock; no weariness
   without its pillow ; no intolerable sorrow without its solace; no
   weariness without its refreshment; no failure of man without a very
   present help in God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Arise, and pass quickly over the water. 2 Sam. xvii. 21.

   THE water of Jordan may serve as an illustration for our position. Our
   David has passed over the waters of death and in doing so has taken us
   with Him. There is a sense in which in the morning light of Easter Day
   all who believed passed over with Him, so that "by the morning light
   there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan."

   We all hold the doctrine of Substitution. Do we sufficiently realize
   that of Identification? Not only did Jesus die for us, but we died with
   and in Him. In Him, as the true Noah's Ark, the whole Church passed
   over the Jordan of death from the old world to the new. There are some
   who do not understand that in the purpose of God we are already
   standing on resurrection ground. Across the water we can hear the
   murmur of the world, and detect its corruption; but we are the
   inheritors of the world in which there is no death nor corruption nor
   the dominion of sin. When a man realizes this he no longer braces
   himself up to meet death, because he knows that in the person of Christ
   he has left it behind for ever.

   What is true, however, in God's purpose should be the aim and goal of
   our daily striving. To us there comes the unceasing call, "Arise, and
   go over Jordan." There is always a thither and a hither side for every
   experience and act. We may always do as the world does; this is to stay
   on the death side. We may always do as Christ does; this is to pass
   over to the risen and living side. Reckon that you have died, and
   mortify the deeds of your body. "And if Christ be in you, the body is
   dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness. "

   Wherefore wilt thou run? . . . Come what may, said he, I will run. 2
   Sam. xviii. 22, 23 (R.V.).

   MOAB did not love David, as Ahimaaz did, and could not understand what
   made the young man so eager to carry the tidings. Doubtless Ahimaaz and
   Cushi entirely misinterpreted the heart of David, and thought that he
   would be glad to hear that the rebellion was stamped out, and Absalom
   was dead. And it was because of the pleasure which he thought to give
   his king that the swift-footed son of Zadok pleaded for permission to
   run. What though there would be no reward, or that it would fall to the
   lot of Cushi, who had already started at Joab's command -- that
   mattered not, the love of David constrained him.

   How often that question of reward is thrown at the servants of God! It
   is one of the favourite taunts of the world; as Satan said of Job, that
   we do as we do because we are paid. "Doth Job serve God for nought?"
   And nothing so startles men as disinterested service. They cannot
   account for it; but it wins their respect. "Reward or no reward;
   recompense or none; smiles or tears, come what may, let me run." That
   is the spirit that becomes a Christian, and convinces the world. "The
   love, of Christ constraineth us."

   Ahimaaz outran Cushi. The one was a volunteer for love's dear sake; the
   other, a bond-servant, doing as he was told. Love lent wings to his
   feet, and speeding past his fellow bore him first into David's
   presence. So God's will is done in heaven: "The cherubim ran and
   returned like a flash of lighting." So God's will is done on earth:
   "They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran
   to bring his disciples word. And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All
   hail!"

   The King is near of kin to us. 2 Sam. xix. 42.

   THERE are two derivations for the word king: one from the word can --
   the king is the man that can do things; the other from the word kin --
   the king is closely related to us, of our kith and kin. In either case,
   there is a beautiful meaning, as touching our Lord and Saviour. He is
   King, because He has overcome our enemies, and can overcome. He is
   King, because He has taken on Himself our flesh and blood, and has for
   ever made us one with Himself. The King is our kinsman. Our kinsman is
   King.

   It is very comforting to know how really our Lord has identified
   Himself with us. The Gospels are full of the wonderful story. His
   kinship was manifested in --

   His Prayers. -- He bade us speak to God as our Father; in that
   marvellous possessive pronoun, not only Iinking us all to one another,
   but including Himself in our petitions, save when we ask for
   forgiveness.

   His Infirmities. -- "We have not a high priest who cannot be touched
   with the feeling of our infirmities." His hunger and thirst; his
   weariness and exhaustion; his suffering unto death -- all accentuate
   the closeness of the tie between us.

   His Temptation. -- "In all points tempted like as we are, yet without
   sin." The avenues through which the tempter could approach Him were
   those by which He assails us also. No temptation took Him, but such as
   is common to man. So to every lonely soldier of his He draws near,
   saying, "Be of good cheer; I have passed through it all. I am your
   brother in the fight; I feel for you with a quick sympathy; the glories
   of my throne do not alter my true-hearted love."

   The men of Judah clave unto their King. 2 Sam. xx. 2.

   WE are reminded of the exhortation of the good Barnabas, that with
   purpose of heart the converts of Antioch should cleave unto the Lord.
   This is the test of a true faith. We often come to the dividing of the
   paths. We stand on the watershed of the hills: that way leads back to
   Moab with its fascinations; this on to Canaan with its spiritual
   attractions. Orpah and Ruth must choose. Each is equally profuse in
   speeches and tears; but the ultimate test of love is whether they will
   stay or go. Which will cleave to the widowed Naomi? She is the truest
   lover; her fidelity will attest the fervour and strength of her
   affection. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, and returned to her people
   and her gods, while Ruth "clave unto her."

   We must cleave to Jesus, in spite of the derision of the multitude. We
   must be prepared to stand with Him when He stands alone, or goes forth
   alone to die. We must be willing to stem the mighty tide of the world
   which has left Him and pours past us. Though all forsake Him, yet we
   must cleave.

   We must cleave to Jesus, in spite of the rebellion of the flesh. Our
   whole nature may sometimes rise in insurrection, demanding some
   forbidden fruit. It is no child's play then for the lonely will to
   stand by itself in unshaken fidelity and loyalty; but it must.

   We must cleave to Jesus when He seems to rebuff us. Only those who can
   stand so sharp an ordeal, are exposed to it. But sometimes we are
   called to pass through it as Job, that angels may learn how Christ's
   lovers cling to Him, not for his gifts, but for Himself.

   Because he slew the Gibeonites. 2 Sam. xxi. 1.

   THE Gibeonites were under the protection of a special covenant, which
   had been entered into between them and Joshua. That covenant was the
   outcome of a ruse on their part. But since it had been most solemnly
   made by the leaders of Israel, it held good. The fact of their deceit
   and chicanery could not absolve Israel from the oath which had been
   passed for their safety. For centuries the provisions of this covenant
   had been observed, till Saul invaded them, and slew the Gibeonites.
   This was a grievous sin, which, according to the religious light of the
   time, seemed to demand blood; and David proposed to atone for blood by
   blood. Nothing but blood could atone for sin so black and dark.

   We are also protected by a covenant, into which the Father has entered
   with the Son, not for our worthiness or merit, but only because He
   would. The provisions of that covenant engage to take us to be his
   people, to remember our sins no more, and to make the Divine law the
   object of our love (Heb. viii.). And the argument is irresistible, that
   if man is so mindful of a covenant as to feel that its infraction is a
   sin which can only be expiated by blood-shedding, it is impossible to
   suppose that God will ever run back from his.

   my soul, thou mayest rest secure in this: here is an everlasting rock;
   this foundation shall suffice thee for evermore. Thou art in the Son of
   his love. Though thou art sinful and evil, yet thou art included in the
   covenant which is more lasting than that of day and night. Jesus has
   met its conditions on thy behalf, and has undertaken to secure thy
   obedience and holiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Thy gentleness hath made me great. 2 Sam. xxii. 36.

   THE triumph of God's gentle goodness will be our song for ever. In
   those far distant ages, when we look back on our earthly course, as a
   grown man on his boyhood, and when the words of this Psalm shall
   express our glad emotions, we shall recognise that the Hand which
   brought us thither was as gentle as our mother's; and that the things
   we craved, but faileth to receive, were withheld by his gentle
   goodness. Our history tells what gentleness will do.

   The Apostle besought the Corinthian converts by the gentleness of
   Christ (2 Cor. x. 1). Though there were abuses amongst them that seemed
   to call for stringent dealing, he felt that they could be best removed
   by the gentle love which he had learned from the heart of Christ. The
   wisdom which is from above is gentle as well as pure; and in dealing
   with the sin that chokes our growth, it is probable that gentleness
   will do more than severity. The gentleness of the nurse that cherishes
   her children; of the lover to her whom he cherishes above himself; of
   the infinite love which bears and endures to the uttermost -- is the
   furnace before which the foul ingredients of our hearts are driven
   never to return. We might brave the lion; we are vanquished by the
   Lamb. We could withstand the scathing look of scorn; but when the
   gentle Lord casts on us the look of ineffable tenderness, we go out to
   weep bitterly.

   That He has borne with us so lovingly; that He has filled our lives
   with mercy even when compelled to correct; that He has never altered in
   his tender behaviour towards us; that He has returned our rebuffs and
   slights with meekness and forbearance; that He has never wearied of us
   -- this is an everlasting tribute to the gentleness that makes great.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As the light of the morning when the sun riseth, a morning without
   clouds. 2 Sam. xxiii. 4.

   THE dealings of God with man are compared to morning light, and the
   sprouting of tender grass in the sunshine that follows rain. The one
   may refer to youth, and the other to age. In each there is sunlight: in
   the one case it is before the clouds have gathered; in the other after
   they have dispersed.

   Clouds. -- There are many different sorts: the cirrus, like platines in
   the sky; the cumulus, in heaps, like the summits of distant mountains;
   the strata, or long bars; the nimbus, heavy with shower. There is a
   counterpart for each in human life, without which we should miss much
   of those experiences of light and shade that so frequently reveal the
   nature of the light. We should not know God's comfort and very present
   help, if it were not for the clouds which are born in the marsh-lands
   of trouble. Who does not prefer the changeful beauty of an English
   spring to the unclouded blue of Italian skies?

   The Light of the Morning. -- The love of God steals over hearts as the
   dawn. He is the Rock; but his advent breaks gently as light. So God's
   love came to Lydia, whose heart opened as a flower its petals. This
   makes it difficult for some of us to decide the moment of our
   regeneration; only we know that, once darkness, we are now light in the
   Lord.

   Clear Shining after Rain. -- We all know something of cloud and rain.
   If we did not, our lives would be arid as a desert. Rain is necessary
   to fructify the seeds that lie buried in the soil but clear shining is
   needed too. Times of joy are needed equally as those of sorrow. The
   tender grass is the child of rain and sun. Hast thou had tears, thou
   shalt have smiles! Hast thou had clouds and rain, thou shalt have clear
   shining!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Neither will I offer burnt offerings . . . of that which doth cost me
   nothing. 2 Sam. xxiv. 24.

   GOD'S love to us cost Him something. He spared not his own Son, and
   that Son spared not his blood. But how little our love to Him costs us!
   Let us understand that where there is true, strong love to Jesus, it
   will cost us something. Love is the costliest of all undertakings.

   It will cost us Self-denial. Christ and self are perfectly
   incompatible; to have the one we must be prepared to surrender the
   other. The heart subtly schemes to hold both; but it does not deceive
   Christ. He knows in a moment when we have preferred to spare ourselves
   and to sacrifice Him, or to obey Him and sacrifice ourselves. We know
   it also. At first we may find it an effort to count all things but loss
   for Him; but as we go on doing it, and drink in the fresh air that
   breathes about the mountains of self-denial -- above all, as we see the
   smile of pleasure on his face -- our hearts leap with joy, and we love
   to give Him everything, not thinking of the cost, any more than Mary
   did when she broke the alabaster box of very precious ointment. After
   all, it is but fitting that we offer our bodies "a living sacrifice,
   holy, acceptable unto God."

   It will cost us Companionships. Those who knew us will pass us with
   averted faces. It will cost us hard-earned money; for we shall realize
   that we have no property in anything that we possess. It will cost us
   high repute amongst our fellows. But what shall we mind if we gain
   Christ? You cannot give up for Him without regaining everything you
   have renounced, but purified and transfigured. Did not the Lord say so?
   And did He not add a hundredfold, with persecution. Let us heartily
   respond, "Lord, Thou knowest all things: Thou knowest that I love Thee!
   "

   As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress. 1
   Kings i. 29.

   "IN my distress I called on the Lord, and cried to my God." Never let
   there be distress without its cry. He will hear your voice out of his
   temple, and your cry will come before Him even into his ears. He will
   answer, and set you in a large place. There is even a gain to be won
   from distress, because it brings out new phases of Christ's redemptive
   help.

   God redeemed David from the calumny of those who maligned him without
   cause. In so many of his psalms he refers to the unjust and cruel
   hatred which misrepresented him and his doings. But God, to whom he
   committed his cause, vindicated him, so that his righteousness shone as
   the light, and his judgment as the noonday. So He will do for you.
   Those who now lay all manner of unkind charges to your door, will be
   compelled to admit your innocence. Only leave your cause with God, and
   be still.

   God redeemed David from all the afflictions that shadowed his early
   days: from his wanderings in the wilderness; from his hairbreadth
   escapes in the eaves; from meeting his death on many a terrible
   battlefield. We hardly realize, just now, how much we owe to the Angel
   of God's redemption, who is ever beside us, environing us with careful
   love, so that no evil may approach us, or snare take our feet. Our
   pathway is thick with shares and dangers, as the pilgrims found it when
   journeying through the valley of the shadow; but there is a way out,
   and in the morning we shall marvel to see how we escaped.

   God redeemed David's life from destruction. This was the greatest
   miracle of all, when we consider the strong passions that slumbered
   within him, breaking out whenever he broke loose from God's grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   That the Lord may continue his word. 1 Kings ii. 4.

   HOW strongly David held to God's promise! It was deeply graven in his
   soul. How could he forget the word which guaranteed the succession of
   his race upon the throne of Israel! At the same time be distinctly
   recognised that the fulfilment was conditional. There was an if in it.
   It was only in so far as his children took heed to walk before God in
   truth that God was bound to place them on the throne of Israel;
   therefore he urged Solomon to keep the charge of the Lord, that the
   Lord might continue his word. We also must obey the threefold condition
   if we would enjoy a continuance of God's helpful care.

   1. Be thou strong. -- The strength which is in Jesus Christ waits to
   make us strong. In the Lion of the tribe of Judah there is the boldness
   which will not swerve in the face of the foe. Timid women and little
   children in the days of persecution have waxed valiant in the fight,
   and have not flinched from death, because Jesus was beside them.

   2. Keep the charge of the Lord thy God. -- He has committed to our care
   many a sacred deposit, in return for our deposit with Him (2 Tim. i.
   12, 14; R.V., marg.). They are his holy Gospel, the Rest Day, the
   doctrines of the Evangelical Faith, and the Inspired Word. Let us watch
   them until we see them weighed out in the temple as were the sacred
   vessels which Ezra committed to the priests for transport across the
   desert (Ezra viii. 33).

   3. Keep his statutes and commandments. -- We must obey with reverent
   care the one great law of love, which includes all the rest. Acting
   thus, we shall put ourselves in the way of enjoying a continuance of
   that favour which God has promised.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked. 1 Kings iii. 13.

   THE understanding heart was Solomon's supreme request, and it was given
   him before the morning light had broken over Jerusalem. But God did
   exceeding abundantly beyond what he asked or thought. Riches and
   honour, victory and long life, were thrown in as part of the Divine
   gift; as paper and string are given by the tradesmen with the goods we
   purchase. It seems as though our Lord's words were anticipated, "Seek
   first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things
   shall be added unto you."

   Put first things first. -- One of the most important lessons of life is
   to discern the relative value of the

   objects within our reach. The child will take the handful of glass
   beads, and leave the heap of diamonds in the rough. It is the terrible
   mistake of men that, perplexed by earth's cross-lights, they put evil
   for good and good for evil; they make earth rather than heaven their
   centre; time rather than eternity their measurement.

   Seek God and all things in Him. -- Things without God cannot satisfy
   the craving of the soul. To know God, and to be known by Him, is to
   possess all things. All that is lovely, strong, or right, in any human
   being was in the Creator before it entered the creature; having God,
   you possess all things in Him.

   Be more careful of what you are than what you have. -- A man's life
   consisteth not in the abundance of things that he possesseth; but in
   his purity, truth, tenderness, and the properties of his soul. The
   fruit of the Spirit must ever be manifest in the life of the believer
   -- "Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
   meekness, temperance."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Largeness of heart. 1 Kings iv. 29.

   WE must all admit that our soul is too narrow. It holds too little,
   knows too little, is deficient in willpower, and, above all, in
   capacity of love; and when we are called to run in the way of God's
   commandments, we break down in despair, and cry, "If I am to be a
   runner, Thou must first enlarge my heart."

   How little we know of the experience which Madame Guyon describes when
   she says: "This vastness or enlargedness, which is not bounded by
   anything, increases every day; so that my soul in partaking of the
   qualities of her Spouse seems also to partake of his immensity."

   "There is," remarks one of the old Puritans, "a straitness, slavery,
   and narrowness, in all sin; sin crumples up our souls; which, if they
   were freely spread abroad, would be as large and wide as the whole
   universe. No man is truly free; but be that hath his will enlarged to
   the extent of God's will, by loving whatsoever God loves, and nothing
   else, he enjoys boundless liberty, and a boundless sweetness." God's
   love embraces the universe. He "so loved the world that He gave his
   only-begotten Son." We who have partaken of the Divine nature must also
   love as He does.

   Thomas a Kempis says, finally: "He who desires glory in things outside
   of God, or to take pleasure in some private good, shall many ways be
   encumbered and straitened; but if heavenly grace enter in, and true
   charity, there will be no envy, neither narrowness of heart, neither
   will self-love busy itself, for Divine charity overcometh all things,
   and enlargeth all the powers of the soul." Give unto us, God, this
   largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore I
     __________________________________________________________________

   Now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side. 1 Kings v. 4.

   GOD is the Rest-Giver, When He surrounds us on every side with his
   protecting care, so that our life resembles one of the cities of the
   Netherlands in the great war -- inaccessible to the foe because
   surrounded by the waters of the sea, admitted through the sluice --
   then neither adversary nor evil occurrent can break in, and we are kept
   in perfect peace, our minds being stayed on God.

   "Hidden in the hollow of his blessed hand,

   Never foe can enter, never traitor stand.

   Have you experienced the rest which comes by putting God round about
   you, on every side -- like the light which burns brightly on a windy
   night because surrounded by its four panes of clear glass! Ah! what a
   contrast between the third and fourth verse: Wars on every side; Rest
   on every side. And yet the two are compatible, because the wars expend
   themselves on God, as the waves on the shingle; and there are far
   reaches of rest within, like orchards and meadows and pasture-lands
   beyond the reach of the devastating water.

   Out of such rest should come the best work. We are not surprised to
   find Solomon announcing his purpose to build a house unto the name of
   the Lord. Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, anointed Him. Out of
   quiet hearts arise the greatest resolves; just as from the seclusion of
   country hamlets have come the greatest warriors, statesmen, and
   patriots. Men think, foolishly, that the active, ever-moving souls are
   the strongest. It is not so, however. They expend themselves before the
   day of trial comes. Give me those who have the power to restrain
   themselves and wait; these are they that can act with the greatest
   momentum in the hour of crisis.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron heard. 1 Kings
   vi. 7.

   IN absolute silence, like the growth of a palm in the desert, that
   noble building arose in the symmetry of its fair proportions. But there
   was plenty of quarrying and hammering and chiselling before the
   materials were brought to the site.

   The absolute silence with which the Temple rose is a meet emblem of the
   progress of the Church, from its foundations laid in the Apostolate
   towards the top stone, which before very long will be laid upon the
   completed structure. Amid the rise and fall of dynasties and empires,
   the Church is being built. Soul after soul, as so many added bricks, is
   being quietly placed upon the walls. Some day the world will be amazed
   when it sees the New Jerusalem descend out of heaven from God. The
   mightiest works of God are the fruit of silence.

   You and I are now in the quarry, hewn, chipped, chiselled: or we are in
   the saw-pit, being sawn, planed, pierced by nails. Be of good cheer! It
   will not be long, the preparatory work will be over, and we shall
   become part of the eternal structure. Into heaven there can enter
   neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron. The trial will have done
   its work. Sorrow and crying will flee away. The apostle Paul, who knew
   more than any man what trial and pain meant, could confidently declare:
   "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be
   compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us." Then shall the
   city of God shine forth in completed beauty, her walls Salvation and
   her gates Praise; and the triumphant song of the redeemed shall ring
   forth: "Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto Him that
   sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb for ever and ever."

   In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them. 1 Kings vii. 46.

   THE Apostle tells us to obey from the heart that mould or form of
   doctrine to which we were delivered (Rom. vi. 17). What a mould is to
   the metal which is wrought into various forms of utensils, that the
   form of sound doctrine is to believers who desire to resemble Christ.
   When our hearts, melted in contrition and penitence, are poured into
   the teaching of the Apostles, to ponder it in memory, and to carry it
   out in life, they are, so to speak, cast into the pattern of Jesus
   Christ, which they wear for evermore. Thus we are conformed to the
   image of his Son.

   We differ as widely as the vessels named here. Some are lavers, and
   some bases; some shovels, and some basons. It matters little what shape
   we bear; so long as we are cleansed and meet for the Master's use. Each
   vessel in Solomon's temple filled its own niche. The machinery of the
   whole would have been hindered if one had been missing. Be content with
   the shape which the Great Designer hath intended for thee. Yield to it.
   Dare to pour thyself into the dark passages of the mould. Do not ask
   the intention of this or that. Obey from the heart, otherwise thou
   mayest have to be broken up, and put back again into the furnace to go
   through the process once more. This is the Plain of the Jordan for us,
   the place of death; but soon we shall be remitted to the Palace and
   Temple of God.

   There is no clue to the understanding of the mysteries of our mortal
   life, save the hypothesis, that we are being prepared for the position
   which has been prepared for us in the eternal world. "And we know that
   all things work together for good to them that love God."
     __________________________________________________________________

   That he maintain the cause of his servant, as every day shall require.
   1 Kings viii. 59 (R.V.).

   THE marginal (R. V.) reading is, "The thing of a day in its day." What
   rest would come into our lives, if we really believed that God
   maintained the cause of his servants! Men hate you, and say unkind or
   untrue things about you; on your part, though you are quite prepared to
   admit that you have made mistakes, yet you know that you desire above
   all things to act as God's servant should, that your motives are
   sincere, and your hands clean -- be of good courage then: God will
   maintain your cause, as every day may require.

   Or, you are beset by strong competition; and, in order to hold your
   own, you have been tempted to do what is not perfectly the best -- to
   spice your teaching with a little heterodoxy, puff your wares with
   misleading titles, to adulterate your goods. But there is no need to do
   this; if only you are faithful to God, He will maintain your cause, as
   every day may require.

   Or, you are tempted almost beyond endurance, and think that you must
   yield. The seductions are so insidious, the pitfalls so carefully
   concealed, the charm of evil so subtle. But, if you will only look away
   to God, you will find Him a very present help to maintain your cause.
   Oh, trust Him; for none of them that do so can be desolate. Daily
   strength for daily need; daily manna for daily hunger; daily
   maintenance for daily temptation. These are assured.

   As we stand on the hill-top in the morning and look across the valley
   of the coming day, its scenes are too closely veiled in heavy-hanging
   mists for us to specify all our requests. We can breathe the
   comprehensive petition, "Give us this day our daily bread." And God
   will suit his help to each requirement. As the moment arrives "the
   thing" will be there.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I have hallowed this house which thou hast built. 1 Kings ix. 3.

   MAN builds; God hallows. This co-operation between man and God pervades
   all life. Man performs the outward and mechanical; God the inward and
   spiritual. Paul plants, Apollos waters; but God gives the increase. We
   elaborate our sermons and addresses, building them up with careful,
   eager thought; but God must work in and through them for his own glory
   in the salvation and upbuilding of souls. We must be careful to do our
   part with reverence and godly fear, remembering that God must work in
   realms we cannot touch, and to issues we cannot reach, before our poor
   exertions can avail.

   May we not apply this especially to the education of a child's life?
   Many who read these lines are engaged in building structures which will
   outlive the Pyramids. The body is only the scaffolding, behind and
   through which the building of the soul is being upreared. The materials
   with which we build may be the gold, silver, and precious stones, of
   our example, precept, careful watching, and discipline; but God must
   come in to hallow. Our strenuous endeavour must be supplemented by the
   incoming of the Holy Spirit.

   God hallows by his indwelling. Holiness is the result of his putting
   his Name into a place, a day, a human soul; for his Name is his nature,
   Himself. Each day may be a building, reared between sunrise and sunset,
   with our activities; but it were vain to hope to realize our ideal
   unless the structure become a Temple filled with God. Build what you
   will; but never be satisfied unless God sets his eyes and heart upon
   your life, hallowing and sanctifying each day and act to Himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee. 1 Kings x. 9.

   THERE were two reasons why Solomon was on the throne. First, because of
   God's love to him; secondly, because of God's love to Israel. May we
   not address our Saviour with similar expressions of gladness as those
   which the queen addressed to a less than He?

   How well it is, now and again, to let ourselves go in exuberant
   adoration! Prayer is good, but it may revolve too largely about our own
   needs and desires: thanks are right, when we have received great
   benefits at his hands; but praise is best, because the heart forgets
   itself and earth and time, in enlarged conceptions of its adorable
   Lover and Saviour.

   We are reminded in this connection of a noble hymn by old John Ryland:
   --

   "Thou Son of God, and Son of Man,

   Beloved, adored Emmanuel,

   Who didst, before all time began,

   in glory with thy Father dwell:

   "We sing thy love, who didst in time,

   For us, humanity assume,

   To answer for the sinner's crime,

   To suffer in the sinner's room.

   "The ransomed Church thy glory sings,

   The hosts of heaven thy will obey;

   And, Lord of lords, and King of kings,

   We celebrate thy blessed away."

   We can never praise Him enough. Our furthest thoughts fall short of the
   reality. His wisdom and prosperity exceed his fame. No question He
   cannot answer; no desire He cannot gratify; no munificence He cannot
   excel. Happy are they who stand continually before Him. Let us see that
   this is our happy privilege; not content to pay Him a transient visit,
   returning to our own land, but communing with Him always of that wh)ich
   is in our heart.

   His wives turned away his heart. 1 Kings xi. 4.

   EVERY man is vulnerable at one point of his character. Strong
   everywhere else, and armour-plated, he is weak there; and our great
   enemy knows just where to strike home. It would have been useless to
   argue with Solomon for the claims of idols. He could at once, by his
   wisdom, have annihilated all infidel arguments, and have established
   the existence and unity of God. But, step by step, he was led by silken
   cords, a captive, to the worship of other gods. It is a solemn warning;
   and Nehemiah was perfectly justified when, in his contention with the
   Jews who had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab, he said,
   "Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin by these things! Yet among many
   nations there was no king like him who was beloved of his God. "

   Let young people beware where they let their hearts go forth in love.
   Whom we love we resemble; and in the marriage tie it is almost
   inevitable that seductions to the lower will overcome the drawings to
   the higher. When a Christian disobeys God's distinct command against
   intermarriage with the ungodly, he begins to sink to the level of his
   ungodly partner whom he had thought to raise to his own religious
   standing.

   Our associates determine the drift and current of our life. It is so
   easy to launch upon the current that flows past our feet; it seems
   impossible that the laughing, enticing water should ever carry us
   against sharp, splintering rocks, or over breaking cataracts. When we
   are compelled to associate with the ungodly, let us maintain a strict
   self-watch, and pray that the breath of the heavenward gale may more
   than counteract the tendency of the earthward current.

   The month which he had devised of his own heart. 1 Kings xii. 33.

   JEROBOAM acted on expediency. It did seem reasonable to argue that the
   constant going up to Jerusalem to worship might alienate the people
   from his throne, and awaken a desire for the old national unity; and
   without doubt a mere worldly wisdom extolled his setting-up of
   idol-gods at Bethel and Dan; but his policy in this respect led to the
   downfall of his kingdom. Had he trusted God's promise, made through the
   prophet Ahijah, the Divine purpose would have ensured the continuance
   of his rule; but the prompting of expediency resulted in ultimate
   disaster (ch. xiv).

   How prone we all are to devise out of our own hearts! We take counsel
   with ourselves, and do what seems prudent and far-seeing, with the
   inevitable result of being betrayed into courses of action that God
   cannot approve, and of which we have reason to repent bitterly. It is
   infinitely better to wait on God till He develop his plan, as He most
   certainly will, when the predestined hour strikes. He who trusts in his
   own heart, and takes his own way, is a fool. To run before God is to
   sink knee-deep into the swamp. We must make all things after the
   pattern shown us on the Mount, and take our time from God's almanack.
   What a contrast to the course of Jeroboam was that of the Son of man!
   He would do nothing of Himself. His eye was always on His Father's
   dial-plate, and thus He knew when his time was not yet fulfilled. He
   was always consulting the movement of his Father's will, and did only
   those things which He saw his Father doing. Similarly make God's will
   and way thy Pole-star. Oh to be able to say with our blessed Lord, "I
   seek not mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me "!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient, . . . but camest back. 1 Kings
   xiii. 21, 22 (R.V.).

   WE are inclined at first sight to pity this unknown prophet, and to
   justify his return; but as we look closer into the story, we not only
   discover the reason for the severe penalty that overtook him, but we
   are warned lest we make a similar mistake. When we have received a
   direct command fresh from the lips of Christ, we must act on it, and
   not be turned aside by a different suggestion, made to us through the
   lips of professing Christians. God does not vacillate or alter in the
   thing which proceeds from his mouth. When we know we are in the line of
   his purpose, we must not allow ourselves to be diverted by any appeal
   or threat, from whomsoever it may emanate. Deal with God at first-hand.

   The rule for determining the true worth of the advice which our friends
   proffer us, is to ask, first, whether it conflicts with our own
   deep-seated conviction of God's will; and, secondly, whether it tends
   to the ease and satisfaction of the flesh, as the old prophet's
   suggestion certainly did. Beware of any one who allures you with the
   bread and water that are to break your fast. That bait is likely enough
   to disturb the balance of your judgment. When a voice says spare
   thyself, be on the alert; it savours the things that be of man, not of
   those that be of God.

   Learn to deal with God at first-hand. Do not run hither and thither to
   human teachers, or to the Church. Be still before God, and what He says
   in the depths of thy soul, do. His Holy Spirit shall guide you into all
   truth; and when once his way has been revealed to thee, go straight on,
   listening to no other voice, however much it professes Divine
   inspiration.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. 1 Kings xiv. 5.

   HOW foolish! Jeroboam thought that the old prophet could penetrate the
   vail that hid the future, but not the disguise in which his wife wished
   to conceal herself. As we might have expected, the aged prophet's inner
   sight read her heart. From God no secrets are hid. Immediately on his
   accosting her by her name there came the dread announcement of
   inevitable disaster.

   We must not hesitate to unfold all the consequences of sin. As watchmen
   on the walls, we are bound to tell men of the certain fearful looking
   for of fiery indignation which shall devour the transgressors. None of
   us should flinch from declaring the whole counsel of God. We should
   specially insist on the guilt side of sin. Not only that it is a
   misfortune, a mistake, an error, a disease, a tyranny; but a crime. The
   sinner is a criminal, who has incurred the just wrath and anger of a
   holy God: for which he must suffer a due recompense.

   Oh for more tenderness that we may with tears warn men of their doom!
   We are so self-possessed, so stolid ; we need to ask that our eyes,
   like Jeremiah's, should be fountains of tears, that we might weep day
   and night. If the tidings are heavy, let us first feel their pressure
   on our own hearts; let us bend over the regions of despair and
   darkness, and hear the bitter weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth,
   and come back to warn our brethren, lest they also come to that place
   of torment. Though it was with fear and much trembling that Paul
   preached the Gospel, yet he did not shun to declare the whole counsel
   of God. And while we go to men with the good tidings of salvation, we
   must not withhold the heavy tidings from those who persist in unbelief
     __________________________________________________________________

   Asa did . . . right in the eyes of the Lord, as did David his father. 1
   Kings xv. 11.

   IT is a great thing to have such a testimony as this. We may do right
   in our own eyes; yet the eye of the Lord may detect evil which neither
   our associates nor we have seen. We may deceive ourselves, we may
   deceive others; but we cannot deceive God. In the home or business, in
   situation or factory, let us live as under the searching gaze of God.

   Asa's life was one of religious activity: he destroyed the idols of his
   father, and even deposed his queen-mother, "because she made an idol in
   a grove." It needs Divine courage so to live for God that at home or
   afield men shall take knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus.
   This is what the world is languishing for -- reality, consistency under
   all circumstances, and before all men.

   There are, however, two clouds overhanging this otherwise bright life.
   "The high places were not removed " (14). Though idols were destroyed,
   the groves in which they were erected remained. They were no snare to
   him; and he took care that during his life they should not ensnare
   others; but after his death, in the reign of Jehoshaphat his son, "the
   people offered and burnt incense" in them (xxii. 43). We must not only
   cleanse our way before the Lord, but remove any evil thing which may
   cause others to stumble.

   The other cloud is indicated in 2 Chron. xvi. 12: "He was diseased in
   his feet.. . . Yet in his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the
   physicians." Strange that in affliction he should not have turned to
   the Great Physician. The enemy of souls is ever on the watch. Pray that
   amid the pains of death you may not act unworthily.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ahab did more to provoke the Lord to anger than all the kings. 1 Kings
   xvi. 33.

   HIS sin was very aggravated, largely through the influence of Jezebel,
   his young and beautiful wife, who introduced the abominations of
   Phoenician idol-worship. This is why he is said to have exceeded his
   predecessors in wickedness. They broke the second commandment, and
   worshipped Jehovah under the form of a calf. Ahab and Jezebel broke the
   first, and chose other gods -- Baal, the sun, and Ashtoreth, the moon.
   The inveterate love for this idolatry was connected with licentious
   rites with which these deities were served. What wonder that the land
   became corrupt when the fountains of its religious life were polluted
   at the source?

   The connection between the indulgence of impurity and the declension of
   the spiritual life, is very close. As the apostle Paul tells its in
   Romans i., the men that refuse to retain God in their knowledge are
   given up to the working of passion; and as they yield to passion they
   lose the sweet, clear impression of the truth and nearness of the
   Christ. The first, second, and third thing to be said to young people
   on venturing out into the world, corrupt through many deceitful lusts,
   is, Be pure. Wear the white flower of a blameless life. If you cannot
   be faultless, be blameless. If you cannot realize all the good you
   know, at least refrain from all the evil. Keep your robes unspotted
   from the world. Then through purity of heart and obedience in life, you
   shall see God. As the living Christ enters the heart, He will drive
   before Him the brute forms of evil, overthrow the tables of the
   money-changers, and will sit to teach of God. Give yourself
   unreservedly into his keeping, that He may govern and control every
   avenue of your life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I have commanded the ravens . . . a widow women . . . there. 1 Kings
   xvii. 4, 9.

   WE must be where God desires. -- Elijah spoke of himself as always
   standing before the Lord God of Israel. He deemed himself as much a
   courtier in the royal palace as Gabriel (Luke i. 19). And he could as
   distinctly stand before God when hiding beside Cherith, or sheltering
   in the widow's house at Zarephath, as when he stood erect on Carmel, or
   listened to the voice of God at Horeb. Wherever you go, and whatever
   ministry you are called to undertake, glory in this, that you never go
   to any greater distance from God.

   If we are where God wants us to be, He will see to the supply of our
   need. It is as easy for Him to feed us by the ravens as by the widow
   woman. As long as God says, Stay here, or there, be sure that He is
   pledged to provide for you. Though you resemble a lonely sentinel in
   some distant post of missionary service, God will see to you. The
   ravens are not less amenable to his command than of old: and out of the
   stores of widow women He is as able to supply your need as He did
   Elijah's, at Zarephath.

   How often God teaches best in seclusion and solitude! It is by the
   murmuring brooks of nature that we have our deepest lessons. It is in
   the homes of the poor that we are fitted for our greatest tasks. It is
   beside couches where children suffer and die, that we receive those
   preparations of the heart which avail us when the bugle note summons us
   to some difficult post.

   God leads through death to life. -- It was needful that the child
   should die, that sin might be remembered and dealt with; but through
   Death's portal the trio entered a richer, fuller life. Fear not that
   gateway!
     __________________________________________________________________

   So Ahab went up to eat and drink. And Elijah went up to the top of
   Carmel. 1 Kings xviii. 42.

   SUCH differences obtain still. The children of this world and the
   children of light are manifest. What though the bodies of four hundred
   and fifty prophets lay slain in the gorge of the Kishon; or that by one
   great act Elijah had hewn down the upas tree, the deadly influence of
   which had corrupted Palestine; or that the long-expected rain was in
   the air -- yet Ahab must eat and drink. These are the things which the
   children of the world seek after. Watch and pray, lest you enter into
   this temptation. Let appetite be kept well in hand -- your servant, not
   your master; and see to it that you are capable of such profound and
   absorbing interest in the things of the Kingdom of God, as to count the
   gratification of physical desire unworthy to be compared with the high
   delights of service, prayer, and communion with the unseen.

   Though he must have been exhausted with the excitements and efforts of
   the day, Elijah must spend the evening hour with God. Though he knew
   that the rain was near, he felt that his prayers were a needful
   condition for its bestowment. Though any part of Carmel might have
   become his oratory, he sought the lonely solitudes of the summit with
   the outspread sea before him, that his soul might hold undisturbed
   vigil, and that he might see over the wide expanse of the ocean the
   first tokens of the coming answer. His attitude denoted his humility.
   His repeated injunction to the lad, his perseverance. His success
   approved his faith.

   Stand, suppliant soul, on the highest point of expectant hope; see the
   hurrying answer, which was being prepared from pools and lakes and
   seas, long ere thy prayer began. "Before they call, I will answer."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Behold, an angel touched him. 1 Kings xix. 5.

   IN all probability the angels often touch us when danger is near,
   threatening our health and life, or when foul fiends step up to us with
   hideous temptation. They find us out, especially when, like Elijah, we
   are alone and depressed; when nervous depression has crept about our
   hearts; when we seem to have failed in the conflict against evil, and
   long for death to end our long and weary strife. It was the lament of a
   holy soul on the verge of eternity, that he had made so little of the
   ministry of God's holy and tender angels.

   It was very gracious for God to deal thus with his servant. We might
   have expected rebuke or remonstrance, chiding or chastisement; but we
   would hardly have expected such loving, gentle treatment as this. Is
   this the man who defied Ahab and all his priests? He is as frail and
   impotent as any! Nay, but God looked beneath the surface depression,
   and detected the strong fountains of courage and devotion that lay
   beneath, only capable of being called again into intense manifestation.
   He knew his servant's frame, and recognised that he was dust. He knew
   how to distinguish between the passing overstrain of the body and the
   heroic temper of the spirit. So, he understands us in our fits of
   depression and despair.

   Whenever these angel-fingers touch you, whether directly or through the
   medium of loving mortal hands, you will always find the cake and the
   cruse of water. God never awakens to disappoint. It is an infinite
   pleasure to Him to awaken his loved ones to good things, which they had
   neither asked nor thought. Will not dying be something like this? The
   angel of life will touch us, and we shall awake to see what love has
   prepared.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. 1 Kings xx. 40.

   THIS was likely enough to happen on a battlefield. It would not be
   possible to hold your prisoner, and to busy yourself about other things
   at the same time. This man, in the prophet's parable, made a great
   mistake to concern himself about a number of trifles, when so serious a
   matter as his own life depended on giving all his attention to the
   custodianship of the prisoner entrusted to his care. But is it not thus
   that men miss the main end of life?

   Busy here and there, and life is gone. -- Many spend their days in mere
   trivialities. Like children they dig in the sand; like the butterfly,
   they flit from flower to flower. A round of visits, a few novels, a
   good many hours of light gaiety; vanity, fashion, and amusement --
   these fill their hours, the days flash by, and life is gone. They have
   nothing to show for it.

   Busy here and there, and the chance of saving others is gone. -- Lives
   touch lives, for the chief pur-pose that one should influence the
   other. But too often we deal only with superficialities, busying
   ourselves in the slightest interests, but not seeking the salvation of
   those with whom we associate. The dance, the game, the business
   relationship, monopolise our thought, and our friends are swept from us
   in the eddying whirl of life's battle, and are gone.

   Busy here and there, and the knowledge of God is gone. -- Remember how
   the birds caught away the seed of the Kingdom; and be sure that, in the
   same way, the cares and riches of this world, and the lusts of other
   things may enter in, and destroy the impression made on the heart. The
   ephemeral interests of life press hard on its real interests. Like
   boys, we squander in trifling the hours given to prepare for an
   examination on which all the future must turn.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And Ahab said to Elijah, hast thou found me, O mine enemy? 1 Kings xxi.
   20.

   AHAB got his garden of herbs, but he had Elijah withal, who stood at
   the gate like an incarnate conscience. Men may get the prize on which
   they have set their heart; but if they have obtained it wrongfully, the
   conscience of the wrong done will haunt them, and take away the
   pleasure on which they counted, and ultimately bring them like a quarry
   to the ground.

   We turn our best friends into enemies, as Ahab did Elijah. The cloud
   that lights Israel is darkness to Pharaoh; the angel that protects
   Jerusalem, slays the host of Sennacherib; the gentle love which anoints
   the Saviour, instigates in Judas a jealousy which ends in murder. The
   God who shows Himself merciful to the merciful is froward to the
   froward. The cause of the alteration is to be sought within ourselves.
   The sun that melts wax hardens clay, but the difference is in the clay.
   To the widow of Zarephath Elijah was an angel of light; whilst to Ahab
   he was an enemy. The difference lay in their hearts; the one being holy
   and loving, the other dark and turbid. What you are, determines whether
   Elijah will be your friend or your enemy.

   This word "sold thyself" is very awful. It underlies Goethe's tragedy
   of Faust, in which the soul sells itself to the devil for so many years
   of worldly pleasure. A few promises which are never kept; a mirage that
   is dissipated in thin air when we approach it; a bribe of gold or
   silver that burns the hands which receive it -- such are the price for
   which men sell themselves. "They sell themselves for nought." Truly the
   devil drives a hard bargain. When he gets the soul into his power, he
   laughs at his former promises, and pays as wages, death.
     __________________________________________________________________

   A certain man . . smote the king of Israel between the joints of the
   harness. 1 Kings xxii. 34.

   EVERY man we meet is clothed in armour; in other words, we all cover
   ourselves with plates on which to receive the thrust of accusation and
   reproach. "I only do as others." "I do not see any special harm in it."
   "My father did it before me." "I cannot help it." Such are some of the
   plates in the armour of the soul; and our work as Christian workers
   becomes abortive in so many instances, because we are content to
   belabour the plates, instead of striking home to the one place where
   the armour joints are. Successful soul-winning depends on discovering
   the vulnerable part of a man, and striking there. But all this demands
   a very special discernment of spirits, and anointing of the Holy Ghost.
   Only so can we detect where best to bring about conviction, and make
   men know their need of the Gospel of God's grace. The great need of the
   present day is a sharper and more searching analysis of sin. Men need
   to be shown how they are violating the laws of God. They assent
   generally to the Scriptural statements of what God requires, but fail
   to realize how greatly they have come short. You are almost sure to
   hit, if you begin to show the various ways in which respectably-living
   people are coming under the Divine sentence.

   But several conditions must be fulfilled. (1) Study well your own
   heart. (2) Be a deep student of the biographies of Scripture; because
   every type of human character is delineated in Holy Writ. (3) Open your
   heart to the Holy Ghost, through whom alone you can discern spirits. He
   is a discerner of the thoughts of the heart, and will teach you to cut
   to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit, and of the joints and
   marrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Thou man of God! 2 Kings i. 9, 11, 13.

   OH that thou and I might so live before God and men, that they should
   recognise us as men of God, as God's men! See how these ungodly
   captains at once recognised this, in the case of Elijah. They fretted
   and chafed against his holiness; but they were forced to admit it. They
   tried to impose their orders, or those of their king; but they realized
   that Elijah was the servant of Him whom they set at nought, so far as
   their own lives were concerned.

   If we are really men of God, we shall be the last to assume the title.
   Notice that Elijah puts an if before the title with which he was
   saluted: "If I be a man of God." Paul counted himself the least of all
   saints.

   We must be of God. -- All our goodness must originate in Him. We can no
   more boast of goodness than a chamber can boast of the light which
   irradiates each corner of its space. The faith that takes his grace, as
   well as the grace it takes, is his. We are absolutely his debtors; and
   happy are they who love to have it so, and lie always at the Beautiful
   Gate of God's heart, expecting to receive alms at his hand.

   We must be for God. -- This is the only cure for self-consciousness,
   for that perpetual obtrusion of the self-life which is our bane and
   curse. Ask that the Holy Spirit may fill you with so absorbing a
   passion for the glory of Jesus, that there may be no room to think of
   your own reputation or emolument.

   We must be in God, and God in us. -- This is possible, when we love
   perfectly. He that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.
   Oh, sea of light, may we lie spread out in thy translucent waves, as
   the sponges in southern sapphire seas, till every fibre of our being be
   permeated and infilled!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee. 2 Kings ii. 2, 4, 6.

   THRICE Elijah spoke thus to his friend and disciple, to test him.
   Perseverance, tenacity of purpose, a refusal to be content with
   anything short of the best, are indispensable conditions for the
   attainment of the highest possibilities of experience and service. And
   perpetually in our life's discipline these words come back on us, Tarry
   here! Not that God desires us to tarry, but because He desires each
   onward step to be the choice and act of our own will.

   Tarry here in Consecration. -- "You have given so much; is it not time
   that you refrained from further sacrifices? Ungird your loins, sit down
   and rest, forbear from this strenuous following after. Spare thyself;
   this shall not come to thee."

   Tarry here in the Life of Prayer. -- "It is waste time to spend so much
   time at the footstool of God. You have done more than most, desist from
   further intercession and supplication."

   Tarry here in the attainment of the likeness of Christ. -- "It will
   cost you so much, if all that is not Christ-like is to pass away from
   your life."

   Such voices are perpetually speaking to us all. And if we heed them, we
   are at once shut out of that crossing the Jordan, that rapturous
   intercourse with heaven, that reception of the double portion of the
   Spirit, which await those who have successfully stood the test. The law
   of the Christian life is always Advance; always leaving that which is
   behind; always reckoning that you have not attained; always following
   on to know the Lord, growing in grace and in the knowledge of the
   blessed Saviour, and saying to the Spirit of God, as Elisha to Elijah,
   I will not leave thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall
   be filled. 2 Kings iii. 17.

   THIS is God's way of fulfilling the desire of them that fear Him. We
   like to see the clouds blown forward through the sky, and hear the moan
   of the rising wind; in other words, we like to see God's gifts on their
   way, or to have the sensible emotion of receiving them. Sometimes we
   have symptoms and signs that fill us with rapture; at other times,
   these are lacking, and we surrender ourselves to despair. Yet when we
   see neither wind nor rain, God may be most mightily at work.

   It is so in Church work. -- How often we make our valleys full of
   ditches! Our machinery is complicated and perfect; we have spared
   neither pains nor care. Then we ardently desire the signs of a powerful
   revival, and break our hearts if they are not apparent; while, all the
   time, if we only knew it, the Divine blessing is welling up in the
   ditches, doing more than would be the case if our highest wishes were
   gratified.Here and there tears are failing silently, hearts are being
   cleansed, lives are becoming yielded to God.

   It is so in Christian experience. -- We expect to have our Pentecost as
   the early Church received hers. We desire to see wind and rain, and to
   know that God is baptizing us; but this is not granted. There is no
   footfall of hurrying clouds, no coronet of flame, no gift of tongues.
   But, deep down, the ditches are being filled up, yearnings are being
   satisfied, the capacity for God within us is being met, though it grows
   apace. God be praised that the success of his work is not gauged by
   outward signs!

   A well may be filled as completely by the percolation of water, a drop
   at a time, as by turning a river into it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And the oil stayed. 2 Kings iv. 6.

   WHAT a sorrowful confession! There was no reason why it should stay.
   There was as much oil as ever, and the power which had made so much
   could have gone on without limit or exhaustion. The only reason for the
   ceasing of the oil was in the failure of the vessels. The widow and her
   sons had secured only a limited number of vessels, and therefore there
   was only a limited supply of the precious oil.

   This is why so many of God's promises are unfulfilled in your
   experience. -- In former days you kept claiming their fulfilment;
   frequently you brought God's promises to Him and said, "Do as Thou hast
   said." Vessel after vessel of need was brought empty and taken away
   full. But of late years you have refrained, you have rested on your
   oars, you have ceased to bring the vessels of your need. Hence the
   dwindling supply.

   This is why your life is not so productive of blessing as it might be.
   -- You do not bring vessels enough. You think that God has wrought as
   much through you as He can or will. You do not expect Him to fill the
   latter years of your life as He did the former. You can trust Him for
   two sermons a week, but not for five or six.

   This is why the blessing of a revival stays in its course. -- As long
   as the missioner remains with us, we call look for the continuance of
   blessing. But after awhile we say, Let the services stop; they have run
   their course, and fulfilled their end. And forthwith the blessing stops
   in mid-flow. Let us go on pleading with the unsaved, and bringing the
   empty vessels of our poor effort for God to fill them up to the full
   measure of their capacity.

   Like unto the flesh of a little child. 2 Kings v. 14.

   IS there any fabric woven on the loom of time to be compared in perfect
   beauty to the flesh of a little child, on which, as yet, no scar or
   blemish can be traced? So sweet, so pure, so clean. It was a wonderful
   combination, that the strong muscles and make of the mighty man of war
   should blend with the flesh of a child. But this may be ours also, if
   we will let the hand of Jesus pass over our leprous-smitten souls. At
   this moment, if you let Hin, He will touch you and say, "Be clean," and
   immediately the leprosy will depart, and you will return to the days of
   your youth -- not forgiven only, but cleansed; not pardoned only, but
   clad in the beauty of the Lord your God, which He will put on you.

   We do not count a little child to be free from the taint of sin. It is
   conceived in sin, and inherits the evil tendencies of our fallen race.
   Its innocence of evil is not holiness. Jesus gives us more than
   innocence, He makes us pure and holy. But there are other childlike
   qualities which our Saviour gives. The humility of a little child, who
   is unconscious of itself, and who is not perpetually looking for
   admiration. The unselfishness of a little child, who seeks its
   companion to share its luxuries and games. The trust of a little child,
   which so naturally clings to a strong and loving heart, willing to
   follow anywhere, to believe in anything. The love of a little child,
   who responds to every endearment with sunny laughter and soft caresses.

   There is a great difference between childish and childlike. The former
   is put away, as we grow up into Christ: the latter we grow into, as we
   become more like our Lord. The oldest angels are the youngest: the
   ripest saints are the most childlike.

   Behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round
   about Elisha. 2 Kings vi. 17.

   SO it is with each of God's saints. We cannot see, because of the
   imperfection of mortal vision, the harnessed squadrons of fire and
   light; but the Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear
   Him, and delivereth them. If our eyes were opened, we should see the
   angel-hosts as an encircling fence of fire; but whether we see them or
   not, they are certainly there.

   God is between us and temptation. -- However strong the foe, God is
   stronger. However swift the descending blow, God is swifter to catch
   and ward off. However weak we are, through long habits of yielding, God
   is greater than our hearts, and can keep in perfect peace. "Trust ye in
   the Lord forever; for in the Lord Jehovah is the Rock of Ages."

   God is between us and the hate of man. -- Dare to believe that there is
   an invisible wall of protection between you and all that men devise
   against you. What though the heathen rage, and the people imagine a
   vain thing! No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper, and
   every tongue that shall rise in judgment shall be condemned.

   God is between you and the deluge of care. -- What thousands are beset
   with that dark spectre! They have no rest or peace either day or night,
   saying, "Where will the next rent, the next meal, come from? " How
   different the life of birds, and flowers, of children, of Jesus, and
   all holy souls. Oh, rest in the Lord, and put Him between you and black
   care.

   God is between you and the pursuit of your past. -- He is your reward;
   and as He intercepted the pursuit of Pharaoh, so He stands at Calvary
   between your past and you. The assayer of retribution is arrested by
   that Divine Victim -- what more can we ask!

   This day is a day of good tidings. 2 Kings vii. 9.

   IT was indeed. The enemy that bad so long hemmed them in had dispersed,
   leaving a great spoil behind. The famine which had driven the people to
   awful straits was at an end, and there was now plenty of everything. It
   was inhuman for these four lepers to be content with eating and
   drinking, and sharing out the spoil, when hard by a city was in agony.
   Common humanity bade them give information of what had happened.

   Let us take care lest some mischief befall us, if we withhold the
   blessed Gospel from a dying world. We know that Jesus has died and
   risen again, and that his unsearchable riches wait for appropriation.
   We have availed ourselves of the offer; but let us see to it that so
   far as we can, we are making known that the wine and milk may be
   obtained without money and without price.

   Mischief always overtakes a selfish policy; whereas those who dare to
   share with others what they have received, not only keep what they
   have, but find the fragments enough for many days afterwards.

   Let us tell men that the Saviour has overcome our foes, and has opened
   the kingdom of heaven to all who believe. Let us speak from a full
   heart of all that He has proved to be. Let us invite men to share with
   us the grace which hath neither shore nor bound.

   One ounce of testimony is worth a ton weight of argument, and
   overpowers all objection. The Lord, on whom the king leaned, derided
   the possibility of the prophet's prediction; and no doubt had plenty of
   adherents. But the leper's report swept all his words to the winds.
   They had known, tasted, and handled. Let us remember that we are called
   to be witnesses of what God hath done for us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And the Man of God wept. 2 Kings viii. 11.

   ELISHA foresaw all the evil that Hazael would inflict on Israel, and it
   moved him to tears. Though he was a strong man, able to move kingdoms
   by his message and prayer, yet he was of a tender and compassionate
   disposition. This was he who one moment upbraided the king of Israel
   for his crimes, and the next called for a minstrel to calm his
   perturbed spirit with strains of music. The men that can move others
   are themselves very susceptible and easily moved.

   The nearer we live to God, the more we deserve to be known as men and
   women of God, the more will our tears flow for the slain of the
   daughters of our people. Consider the ravages that drink, and impurity,
   and gambling, are making among our people; enumerate the homes that are
   desolate, the young life that is wrecked as it is leaving the harbour,
   the awful dishonour done to woman; and surely there must come times
   when tears well up for very humanity's sake, to say nothing of the pity
   which they acquire who look at things from God's standpoint.

   Jesus beheld the city and wept over it. Give us this day, Son of Man,
   thy compassion, thy love, thy tears, that we may speak of thy grace
   graciously, of thy love tenderly, and even of thy judgments with
   brimming, eyes.

   "A broken heart, a fount of tears:

   Ask, and it shall not be denied.'

   Wouldst thou avert such issues; begin with the cradled babes of your
   homes. Win them for God; teach them how to curb passion and subdue
   themselves. Tenderness and wisdom may arrest the making of Ben-hadads.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace? 2 Kings ix. 22.

   WE all want peace. Of every telegraph messenger, as he puts the
   buff-coloured envelope into our hands, we ask almost instinctively, Is
   it peace? If there is a rumour of war, a depression in trade, a bad
   harvest, a sudden calamity in our neighbourhood, we instantly consider
   the effect it may have on the tranquillity and prosperity of our life.

   By peace we too often mean the absence of the disagreeable, the
   unbroken routine of outward prosperity, the serene passage of the
   years: not always eager for anything deeper. And if other and
   profounder questions intrude themselves, we instantly stifle or evade
   them. Like Herod, we shut up the Baptist in the dungeon. Like the Roman
   general, we make a desert and call it peace. Men will flee from a
   Gospel ministry which pursues them into close quarters, and arouses
   unwelcome questions that break the peace.

   There cannot be true peace so long as we permit the infidelities and
   charms of some Jezebel of the soul-life to attract and affect us.
   Jezebel may stand for the painted world, with its wiles and snares, or
   for the flesh, or for some unholy association of the past life, like
   that which clung to Augustine. But there must be no quarter given to
   the unhallowed rival of our Lord. Whatever its charms, it must be flung
   out of the window before we can be at peace.

   "Then, and not till then, we shall see Thee as Thou art;

   Then, and not till then, in thy glory bear a part;

   Then, and not till then, Thou wilt satisfy each heart."

   If you are entirely surrendered to the Lord, "the peace of God, which
   passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in
   Christ Jesus."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel . 2
   Kings x. 31.

   JEHU was the Cromwell of his time. He swept away the symbols of
   idolatry with ruthless destruction. Nothing could withstand his
   iconoclastic enthusiasm. But he failed to keep his own heart, and
   therefore his dynasty lasted for but one generation. It is a deep
   lesson for us all.

   We may keep other people's vineyards, and neglect our own. We may give
   good advice to our friends, but into the very faults against which we
   warn them. We may pose as infallible guides, but fall into the
   crevasses and precipices from which we had carefully warned our
   companions. Jehu avenged the idolatries of Ahab, but he departed not
   from Jeroboam's calves.

   Before you rebuke another, be sure that you are free from the faults
   that you detect in him. When you hear of the failings of some erring
   brother, ask yourself whether you are perfectly free from them. And
   never attempt to cast out the mote from your neighbour's eye till you
   are sure that the beam has been taken from your own.

   Take heed to your heart. Its complexion colours all the issues of life.
   Do not be content to be strong against evil; be eagerly ambitious of
   good. It is easier to be vehement against the abominations of others
   than to judge and put away your own secret sins. But while we keep our
   heart with all diligence, we cannot afford to be independent of the
   keeping power of God. We must yield ourselves to Him, reserving
   nothing. The King must have all. The light of his face must fill every
   nook and corner of the soul. And every power that opposes itself to his
   dominion, must be dragged beyond the barriers and ruthlessly slain.
     __________________________________________________________________

   They made him king, and anointed him. 2 Kings xi. 12.

   THIS dexterous overthrow of Athaliah by the bringing of the youthful
   king, who had been hidden in the secret chambers of the Temple,
   accommodates itself so obviously to a reference to the inner life, that
   we must be pardoned for making it.

   Is not the spiritual condition of too many children of God represented
   by the condition of the Temple, during the early years of the life of
   Joash? The king was within its precincts, the rightful heir of the
   crown and defender of the worship of Jehovah: but, as a matter of fact,
   the crown was on the head of the usurper Athaliah, who was exercising a
   cruel and sanguinary tyranny. The king was limited to a chamber, and
   the majority of the priests, with all the people, had not even heard of
   his existence. So, unless we are reprobates, Jesus is within the
   spirit, which has been regenerated by the Holy Ghost; but in too many
   cases He is limited to a very small corner of our nature, and exercises
   but a limited power over our life.

   There needs to be an anointing, an enthroning, a determination that He
   shall exercise his power over the entire Temple of our Being; the
   spirit, which stands for the Holy of Holies; the soul, for the Holy
   Place ; the body, for the outer court.

   Holiness or Sanctification is Dot a quality or attribute which can be
   attributed to us apart from the indwelling of the Holy One. If we would
   be holy, we must be indwelt by Him who is holy. If we would have
   holiness, we must be infilled by the Holy One. But there must be no
   limiting of his power, no barrier to his control, no veiling or
   curtaining of his light. The veil, if such there be, must be rent in
   twain from the top to the bottom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of
   the Lord. 2 Kings xii. 4.

   THE margin suggests that the thought of giving for God's house would
   ascend in a man's heart, till it became the royal and predominant
   thought, swaying the whole man to obedience. It is a beautiful
   conception !

   For the reconstruction of the Temple there were two classes of revenue:
   the tribute money which each Israelite was bound to give, and the money
   which a man might feel prompted to give. Surely the latter was the more
   precious in the eye of God.

   Does it ever come into your heart to bring some money into the house of
   God? Perhaps the sug-gestion comes, but you put it away, and refuse to
   consider it. The thought begins to ascend in your heart, but you thrust
   it down and back, saying, Why should I part with what has cost me so
   much to get! Beware of stifling these generous promptings. To yield to
   them would bring untold blessing into heart and life. Besides, the
   money is only yours as a stewardship; and the thought to give it to God
   is only the Master's request for his own.

   The great mistake with us all is, that we do not hold all our property
   at God's disposal, seeking his directions for its administration; and
   that we forget how freely we have received that we may resemble our
   Father in heaven, and freely give. Too many, alas! are anxious to hoard
   up and keep for themselves that which God has given them, instead of
   counting themselves and all they have as purchased property, and using
   all things as his representatives and trustees. Let us make a complete
   surrender to our Lord, and from the heart sing,

   "Take my silver and my gold,

   Not a mite would I withhold.
     __________________________________________________________________

   He smote thrice and stayed. 2 Kings xiii. 18.

   A STRIKING spectacle. The dying prophet, with his thin hands on the
   muscular hands of the young king, as he shoots his arrow through the
   eastern window; the exhortation to smite the remaining arrows on the
   ground; the bitter chiding that the king had struck thrice only,
   instead of five or six times. What lessons are here! The Lord Jesus put
   his hands upon ours. Here is the reverse to the incident referred to.
   Ours are weak, his are strong; ours would miss the mark, his will
   direct the arrows, if only we will allow Him, with unerring precision.
   We shoot, but the Lord directs the arrow's flight to the heart of his
   foes.

   Our success is commensurate with our faith. If we strike but thrice, we
   conquer but thrice. If we strike seven times, we attain a perfect
   victory over the adversary. Is not this the cause of comparative
   failure in Gospel effort? Souls are not saved because we do not expect
   them to be saved. A few are saved, because we only believe for a few.
   It is one of the most radical laws in the universe of God, and one
   which our Lord repeatedly emphasized, that our faith determines the
   less or more in our own growth, and in the victories we win for Christ.
   Do not stay, soul-winner, but smite again and yet again in the secret
   of thy chamber, that thou mayest smite Satan, and compel him to
   acknowledge thy might.

   Let us not stay, though the energy of earlier days may be ebbing fast.
   The sanctified spirit waxes only stronger and more heroic, as Elisha's
   and Paul's did, amid the decay of mortal power. The Lord will say to
   us, as He did to Paul, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
   strength is made perfect in weakness."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Every man shall be put to death for his own sin. 2 Kings xiv. 6.

   SO ran the law of Moses. It forbade the imposition of punishment on the
   relatives of the wrong-doer, but it had no mercy on him. "The soul that
   sinneth, it shall die," was the succinct and conclusive verdict of the
   older law, in this reflecting the spirit and letter of one yet older,
   which ran, "The day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."

   First, we were dead in our sins. -- Eph. ii. 5 puts this beyond all
   doubt. In the sight of God, all who walk according to the course of
   this world, and obey the prince that now worketh in the children of
   this world, are dead in trespasses and sins. However much they may be
   alive as to their souls, they are dead as to their spirits, entirely
   destitute of the life of God.

   Second, we have died for our sins. -- 2 Cor. v. 14, 15 (R.V.)
   establishes this fact, and shows that in Jesus, we who believe in Him,
   are reckoned to have died in Him when He bore our sins in his own body
   on the tree. In God's estimate, his death is imputed to us; so that we
   are reckoned as having satisfied, in Jesus, the demands of a broken
   law. It has no more to ask.

   Third, we must die to our sin.-- Rom. vi. 11. Reckon that you have
   died, and whenever sin arises, to menace or allure you, point back to
   the grave, and argue that since you died in Christ, you have passed
   altogether beyond its jurisdiction, for you have yielded your members
   as weapons of righteousness unto God. And having been crucified with
   Christ, you now no longer live, but Christ liveth in you. Let it become
   your daily habit to place the grave of Jesus between yourself and all
   allurements of the world, the flesh, and the devil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 2 Kings
   xv. 9, 18, 24, 28.

   THIS chapter anticipates the final overthrow of the kingdom of the
   tribes. It describes the corruption and disorganization of the people
   which made them the easy prey of Assyria. One puppet-king after another
   was set upon the throne to fall after a brief space of rule, and four
   times over it is said that they followed in the steps of Jeroboam, "who
   made Israel to sin." The seed sown two hundred years before had at last
   come to maturity, issuing in the ruin of the nation. 'What a comment on
   the inspired words, "Sin, when it is finished, bridgeth forth death."

   Twelve times in the story of the kingdom of Israel we are told that
   Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, made Israel to sin. The institution of the
   calves on his part seemed to be a piece of political wisdom, but it was
   an infraction of the Divine law; and what is morally wrong can never be
   politically right. The house cannot stand unless the foundation can
   bear the test of the Divine plummet. The kingdom of Israel fell, to
   prove to all after-time that the disregard of God's law is a foundation
   of sand, which can never resist the test of time.

   Why is Jeroboam so frequently called "the son of Nebat"? Why should the
   father be for ever pilloried with the son, except that he was in some
   way responsible for, and implicated in, his sins? There was a time when
   perhaps Nebat might have restrained the growing boy, or led him to the
   true worship of God; or perhaps his parental influence and example were
   deadly in their effect. How important that parents should leave no
   stone unturned to promote the godliness of their children, bringing
   them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

   King Ahaz sent to Urijah the fashion of the alter and the pattern of
   it. 2 Kings xvi. 10.

   THE fashion of this world passeth away like a fleeting dream; or like
   the panorama of clouds that constitutes a pavilion of the setting sun,
   but which, whilst we gaze, tumbles into a mass of red ruin. And yet we
   are always so prone to imitate King Ahaz, and visit Damascus with the
   intention of procuring the latest design, and introducing it, even into
   the service of the sanctuary.

   Man naturally imitates. He must get the pattern of his work from above,
   or beneath; from God or the devil: hence, the repeated injunction to us
   all, to make all things after the pattern shown on the mount. lf we
   would be rid of the influence of worldly fashion, we must conform
   ourselves to the heavenly and divine. The pattern of the Body of Christ
   -- of the position of each individual believer among its members, and
   of the work which each should accomplish -- was fixed before the worlds
   were made. The best cure for worldliness is not unworldliness, but
   other-worldliness. The best way of resisting the trend of people around
   us is to cultivate the speech, thought, and behaviour of that celestial
   world to which we are bound by the most sacred ties, and whither we are
   travelling at every heart-throb.

   This introduction of the altar of a heathen shrine into the holy temple
   of Jerusalem, reminds us of the many rites in modern religious
   observances which have been borrowed from paganism, and warns us that
   the Church has no right to go to the world for its methods and
   principles. Let the world do as it may in its discussions about truth,
   its efforts to attract attention, and its organizations; our course is
   clear -- not to build altars after its fashion, nor model our life on
   its maxims.
     __________________________________________________________________

   These nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images. 2 Kings
   xvii. 41.

   IT was a curious mixture. These people had come from Babylon, Hamath,
   and Sepharvaim, and were settled in the land from which Israel was
   deported. In their desire to propitiate the God of the country, they
   added his worship to that of their own gods (ver. 32), though they did
   not really fear Him (ver. 34). There was an outward recognition of the
   God of Israel, which was worse than useless. Are you sure this is not a
   true description of your own position? You pay an outward deference to
   God by attending his house, and acknowledging his day, whilst you are
   really prostrating yourself before other shrines. The one originates in
   a superstitious fear, a desire to stand well with your fellows; but it
   is in the direction of the other that your heart really goes. You come
   as his people come, sit as his people sit, kneel as his people kneel;
   but your heart is far apart, and you only do as you do that you may
   follow your own evil ways with less fear of discovery.

   With all of us there is too much of this double worship; but let it be
   clearly understood that it is only apparent, not real. No man ever
   really serves two masters, or worships two gods. Whatever conflicts
   with God in heart or life is our chosen god. Whatever appears to share
   our heart with God really holds our heart. God will never be in
   competition with another. He must either be all or none.

   The soul that endeavours to divide its service between Jehovah on the
   first day, and its graven images all the other days of the week, might
   as well discontinue its religious observances, for they count for
   nothing: except to blind it to its true condition.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Now on whom dost thou trust? 2 Kings xviii. 20.

   IT was no small thing for Hezekiah to rebel against the proud king of
   Assyria. Hamath and Arpad, Samaria and Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivah,
   reduced to heaps of stones, were sufficient proofs of the might of his
   ruthless soldiers. How could Jerusalem hope to withstand? Rabshakeh
   could not comprehend the secret source of Hezekiah's confidence. It was
   of no use for him to turn to Egypt. Pharaoh was a bruised reed. And as
   for Jehovah! Was there any likelihood that He could do for Israel more,
   than the gods of the other nations had done for them? Not infrequently
   does the puzzled world ask the Church, "In whom dost thou trust? "

   Our life must to a large extent be a mystery, our peace pass
   understanding, and our motives be hidden. The sources of our supply,
   the ground of our confidence, the reasons for our actions, must evade
   the most searching scrutiny of those who stand outside the charmed
   circle of the face of God; as it is written, "Eye hath not seen, nor
   ear heard what God hath prepared."

   We all ought to have the secrets which the world cannot penetrate.
   Doubt your religion if it all lies on the surface, and if men are able
   to calculate to a nicety the considerations by which you are actuated.
   We must be prepared to be misunderstood and criticised, because our
   behaviour is determined by facts which the princes of this world know
   not. We do not look up to the hills, because we look beyond them to
   God; we do not trust in silver or gold, or human resource, because God
   is our confidence. We cannot but seem eccentric to this world, because
   we have found another centre, and are concentric with the Eternal
   Throne.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And Hezekiah spread it before the Lord. 2 Kings xix. 14.

   AMID the panic that reigned in Jerusalem, the king and the prophet
   alone kept level heads, for they alone had quiet, trustful hearts. We
   hardly realize the crisis unless we compare it with the march of
   200,000 Kurds or Turkish soldiers upon some peaceful Armenian
   community. Israel had no earthly allies. Her only reinforcements could
   reach her from heaven, and it was the care of these two saintly men to
   implicate their cause with that of the living God (ver. 4). This is the
   faith that overcomes the world, which realizes that God lives here and
   now in our home and life and circumstances. His cause is implicated in
   our deliverance; his name will be disgraced if we are overwhelmed, and
   honoured, if preserved. He is our Judge, Lawgiver, and King, and is
   therefore bound by the most solemn obligations to save us, or his name
   will be tarnished.

   When therefore letters come to you, anonymous or otherwise, full of
   bitter reproach; when unkind and malignant stories are set on foot with
   respect to you; when all hope from man has perished, then take your
   complaint -- the letter, the article, the speech, the rumour -- and lay
   it before God. Let your requests be made known unto Him. Tell Him how
   absolutely you trust. Then malice and fear will pass from your heart,
   whilst peace and love will take their place: and presently there will
   come a swift message of comfort, like that which Isaiah, the son of
   Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying on the behalf of God, "That which thou
   hast prayed to Me, I have heard."

   God knew the contents of the missive before you did; but He likes to
   read it again in the company of his child.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Let the shadow return backward ten degrees. 2 Kings xx. 10.

   IT is impossible for us to understand how this could be. The shadow of
   the declining day waxes ever longer, and only a miracle could change
   its appearance on the dial. It may suggest some significant thoughts
   about shadows that may still go back.

   The shadow of a wasted life. -- Of course, there is a sense in which
   the wasted years will never come again; they have passed beyond recall.
   But the shadow may go back on the dial of our life when we truly
   repent, and turn again to God, for He hath promised: "I will never
   leave thee, neither forsake thee." And "I will give back the years that
   the canker worm and caterpillar have eaten."

   The shadow of happier days. -- These seem to have gone. For long you
   have noticed the growing twilight, and it has seemed impossible ever
   again to have the lightsomeness and spring of one or two decades back.
   But be of good cheer, for when a man comes into that fellowship with
   God which sorrow and temptation teach, when with growing years he
   attains added grace, we are told that he shall return to the days of
   his youth.

   The shadow of early affection. -- Have you lost loved ones, so that
   your life is like a house the windows of which, one after another, have
   become shuttered and dark? But love is not forfeited for ever. Those
   who forsake all for Christ's sake shall get all back again in Him. His
   love comprehends all human love. The relationships of his kingdom
   surpass in tenderness and tenacity those of the warmest earthly ties.
   Thy brother shall rise again, and thou shalt hear him call thy name,
   and shalt sit with him in the Home of Life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And his mother's name was Hephzi-bah. 2 Kings xxi. 1.

   HEPHZI-BAH means, "My delight is in her" (Isa. Ixii. 4). How strange,
   supposing that her name was any indication of her character, that such
   a woman should have borne such a son; for "Manasseh did wickedly above
   all the Amorites did which were before him." A godly ancestry, however,
   does not guarantee a holy seed. Hezekiahs and Hephzi-bahs may be the
   parents of manassehs. That this may not be so: --

   Let us guard against the inconsistencies of our private life. -- The
   child of religious parents becomes habituated to their use of
   expressions in public which betoken the highest degree of holiness, and
   is therefore quicker to notice any inconsistency in temper or walk. Is
   there not a subtle temptation also for those who work much for God in
   public to feel that a certain laxity is permissible in the home? Will
   not late after-meetings at night compensate for indolence in the
   morning; and will not protracted services be the equivalent for private
   prayer? May not irritability to servants or children be accounted for
   by the overstrain of our great work? Hence, inconsistency and failure
   to realize our lofty aims, which are quickly noticed, beget distaste
   for our religion.

   Let us guard against absorption in public religious duty to the neglect
   of the home. -- Does it never happen that the children of religious
   parents are put to bed by nurses who are heedless of their prayers,
   because their mothers have undertaken a mission? Do not boys sometimes
   grow up without the correcting influence of the father's character,
   because he, good man, is so taken up with committees?

   Let us guard against an austerity of manner, which prevents us being
   the companions, play-fellows, and associates of our children.

   Thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace. 2 Kings xxii. 20.

   AS a matter of fact, Josiah's death was not a peaceful one. He
   persisted in going into conflict with Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt,
   against the latter's earnest remonstrance (see 2 Chron. xxxv. 20-22);
   and, in consequence of his hardihood, met his death. His servants
   carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo (ch. xxiii. 30). Is there,
   then, any real contradiction between the prophet's prediction and this
   sad event?

   Certainly not! The one tells us what God was prepared to do for his
   servant; the other what he brought on himself by his own folly. There
   are many instances of this change of purpose in the Word of God. One of
   them is known as "his breach of promise," or "altering of purpose "
   (Num. xiv. 34, marg.). He would have saved his people from the forty
   years' wandering in the wilderness, but they made Him to serve with
   their sins, and wearied Him with their iniquities. He would have
   gathered Jerusalem as a hen gathers her brood, but she would not.

   Let us beware lest, a promise being left us, we should seem to come
   short of it; lest there be in any of us an evil heart of unbelief in
   departing from the living God, and frustrating some blessed purpose of
   his heart. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into
   the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love
   Him "; but we may limit the Holy One of Israel, and so restrain Him by
   our unbelief as to stay the mighty works which are in his plan for us.
   He may desire for us a prosperous life and a peaceful death; but we may
   close our dying eyes amid disaster and defeat, because we wilfully
   chose our own way.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Like unto Josiah was there no king before him. 2 Kings xxiii. 25.

   THIS chapter is a marvellous record of cleansing and purging. We are
   led from one item to another of drastic reform. Nothing was spared that
   savoured of idolatry. Priests and altars, buildings and groves, came
   under the searching scrutiny of this true-hearted monarch; and, as the
   result, it was possible to keep such a Passover as had not been
   observed during the days of the judges or the kings (ver. 22).

   How much our enjoyment of the solemn feast depends upon our previous
   efforts to put away from our lives all that is inconsistent with the
   law of God. We hardly realize how insidiously evils creep in. Before we
   are aware, we have fallen beneath God's ideal, and adopted the customs
   of our neighbours, or of those with whom we come into daily contact.
   All such declension hinders our joy in keeping the Passover. It is
   needful, therefore, that there should be times when we turn to God with
   fresh devotion, and in the light of his holy truth pass the various
   departments of our life under review, testing everything by the Book of
   the Law. In Josiah's case, the sacred volume was recovered from long
   neglect; in our case it needs to be re-read in the light of higher
   resolves. This would be like a new discovery. Our ultimate rule must
   always be the will of God, appreciated with growing clearness, and used
   as a standard by which to judge the habits and tenets of our life. We
   read the Bible for purposes of a truer knowledge of God and his ways,
   and for spiritual quickening; but let us also use it more frequently as
   the bath of the spirit. Let us bathe in it. Let us revel in it as the
   grimy children of the slums in the laughing wavelets of river and sea.

   He carried out thence all the treasures of the House of the Lord. 2
   Kings xxiv. 13.

   AMONGST these deported treasures must have been much of the sacred
   furniture of the Temple, and the holy vessels; because, in the days of
   Belshazzar, find them brought out to grace the royal banquet.
   BeIshazzar drank wine from them with his lords, wives, and concubines,
   whilst they praised the gods of Babylon, who had given them victory
   over their foes. Amongst the rest was the golden candlestick, whose
   flame afterwards illuminated the inscription of doom, written by God's
   hand upon the palace wall. By the command of Cyrus these precious
   vessels were finally restored (Ezra v. 14), and carried back to
   Jerusalem, by a faithful band of priests (viii. 33).

   The whole story of the captivity is full of solemn lessons. -- The
   Church of God must make her choice between one of two courses: either
   she must keep from all entangling alliances, and from vieing for
   temporal power; or she must face the liability of being brought under
   the power with which she would fain assimilate. Israel wanted to be as
   the other nations around her, imitating their organization, and allying
   herself now with one, and then with another; in consequence she was
   swept into captivity to the very nation whose fashions she most
   affected (Isa. xxxviii.).

   Have we never tasted the bitters of captivity? -- Borne away from our
   happy early homes to live among strangers, set to repugnant tasks,
   removed from all that made life worth living, we have known the exile's
   lot. Alas! if it be so; yet, even in our captivity, where the Lord's
   song is silenced, and our harps hang from the willows, if we repent,
   and put away our sins, and turn again to the Lord, He will not only
   have mercy, but abundantly pardon, and bring us again that we may be as
   we were in times past.

   Every day a portion, all the days of his life 2 Kings xxv. 30 (R.V.).

   IS it to be supposed that the king of Babylon took more care of
   Jehoiachin than God will take of us? Jehoiachin had resisted his
   suzerain, and cost him a great expenditure of men and treasure; but
   nothing which had transpired in the past hindered this provision of a
   daily supply. Will God do less for you, his child? Would it not come as
   a relief if you were to be told that, from this moment till you die,
   you could always have a sufficient provision of all the necessaries of
   life? But if you are a child of God, that promise has already been
   made! Do not be anxious. but believe that God's word is at least as
   sure and as efficient as man's.

   The allowance was continual. -- It did not begin with plenty, and
   gradually dwindle to scraps. The supply was maintained year after year.
   Will God drop off your supplies, think you, because He forgets, or
   because his power is exhausted? You know that each supposition is alike
   untenable. What He has done, He will do. The storehouses of nature open
   to his key. His are the cattle on a thousand hills.

   Every day a portion. -- Jehoiachin had not the provisions of a year or
   a month put down at his door; but as each day broke he was sure of the
   day's portion. It may be that God is dealing thus with you. Only manna
   for the day: daily strength for daily need.

   All the days of his life. -- Jesus is with us "all the days"; and He is
   the Bread of God, in whom is every property necessary for life. All the
   days are included in God's care for us, of birth and death, of sunshine
   and shadow. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of
   your life, and you shall dwell in the House of the Lord for ever.

   Adam, Sheth, Enosh. 1 Chron. i. 1.

   THIS is an ancient graveyard. The names of past generations who were
   born and died, who loved and suffered, who stormed and fought through
   the world, are engraven on these solid slabs. But there is no
   inscription to record their worth or demerit. Just names, and nothing
   more.

   How strange to think that if Christ tarry, our names will be treated
   with the same apathy as these! So far as this world is concerned, we
   and all our generation shall pass away. As the flowers of the field, so
   we shall perish from the earth.

   But each of these lives fulfilled a necessary part in the progress of
   the race. Each was in turn father and son; each passed on the torch of
   life; each contributed something to the fabric of humanity rising like
   a coral island from unknown depths. The hill-tops would not be possible
   but for their lower courses which touch the valleys. We could not have
   the somebodies without an immense number of nobodies. The flowers of
   the race were prepared for by the slow progress of the plant through
   years of growth.

   But each was the object of the love of God. Each was included in the
   redemptive purpose of our Lord; each contributed some minute particle
   to his nature; ach is living yet somewhere; each will have to stand
   before the judgment-bar of God; each is predestined to live in the
   unknown world that lies on the other side. It is a stupendous thought
   to imagine the whole race, rooted in Adam, like one vast far-spreading
   tree. Ah, reader, be sure that thou art taken out of the first Adam,
   and grafted into the second -- the Lord Jesus; and abiding in him, see
   'that thou bring forth much fruit to his glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   These are the sons of Israel. 1 Chron. ii. 1.

   IT is noticeable how irrevocable the Divine sentence is on a human
   life. Of Er, the grave, impartial voice of Scripture says, he was
   "wicked in the sight of the Lord"; of Achan, he was the "troubler of
   Israel, and committed a trespass in the devoted thing." These sentences
   are recorded with such precision as to admit of no dispute, no appeal;
   and they sum up the life.

   But was there not much else in each of these men? Were there not tender
   or chivalrous moments? Did they never shine for a moment in some
   transfiguring ray? Was all their life dyed with these sad and sombre
   hues? Ah, it may have been so -- still the one thing that the Scripture
   tells of them is the sin in which all their life seemed to culminate
   and express itself. With unerring accuracy God can distinguish the one
   act or word by which the character is revealed. He may forgive it, but
   He holds it up as the epitome or summary of what the life was.

   Let us see how we live, walking before God with reverent fear, watching
   and praying, because any moment may give birth to a word or act which
   may characterise our life in all coming time. It must be remembered,
   however, that all these things emanate from the heart. The heart is
   deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; but the issues of
   life proceed thence: it therefore must be watched with all diligence
   and care. What a man thinks, that he is. The chance word or act is a
   true indication of the inner life. Therefore it is preserved for all
   after-time by the voice of God. See that your heart is perfect before
   God. There is forgiveness; but then is also the unerring verdict.
     __________________________________________________________________

   These were the sons of David. 1 Chron. iii. 1.

   BUT how different they were to the Son of David! Contrast any one of
   these with our blessed Lord, and what an infinite chasm lies between
   them! Solomon was the most reputable of them, but a greater than
   Solomon was born in Bethlehem, and cradled in a manger. Surely the
   least earnest must be struck with the difference in these sons and that
   Son. But in this difference, is there not the most conspicuous proof of
   his miraculous conception? Even though the story of his wondrous birth
   had never been preserved for us by the evangelists, we should have felt
   convinced that something like it must have happened, in virtue of which
   He should be the Man of men, the one absolutely flawless and perfect
   flower on the stem of humanity. With new emphasis we read the familiar
   words, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
   Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore that Holy thing which shall be
   born of thee shall be called the Son of GOD."

   We, too, who have been born once, need to be born again. To be born of
   a David does not ensure perfectness of heart and life. Though born of
   parents, who were after God's own heart and are passed into the skies,
   we need to be born again, or we may repeat the sins of an Ammon, an
   Adonijah, an Absalom. It is a serious question to ask whether, like
   David, we have called his greater Son our Lord. This is the true mark
   of the new birth. Those who are born of the Holy Ghost call Jesus Lord,
   and none other The recognition of the supreme lordship of Jesus is
   imperative for the peace and right ordering of the heart and life, So
   we pass to our true stature in Jesus.

   Because I bare him with sorrow. 1 Chron. iv. 9.

   THE products of sorrow have been the rarest gifts to mankind. The
   books, hymns, discoveries, deeds, to which men and women have been
   urged by sorrow, or which have been born into the world amid
   heart-rending soul-travail, are those which will never be allowed to
   die, because perennial sources of inspiration and comfort. It was thus
   with the child of whom we have this brief record. We might becomingly
   weave the four petitions of the prayer of Jabez into the supplications
   of each new morning hour.

   To be blessed indeed. -- Not the lower springs only, but the upper ones
   also; not life alone, but life more abundantly; not those blessings
   only which pertain to the body or worldly circumstance, but those
   spiritual ones of the heavenlies, that are the best donation man can
   receive or God bestow.

   A larger coast. -- There is a godly ambition which may be reverently
   cherished for wider influence over men, not for its own sake, but for
   the Master's. You may feel that you have fulfilled the measure of your
   present possibilities, but have unexhausted powers and talents. Tell
   God so, and ask for a wider extent of territory to bring under
   cultivation for Him.

   Thine hand with me. -- The father puts his hand on the boy's hand as he
   draws back the bowstring, strengthening the thin arms of youth. So will
   the mighty God of Jacob do for you.

   Keep me from evil. -- You cannot keep your heart door shut when a
   tumult of temptation or care assaults it from without; but God's peace
   and grace, like angel sentries, can avail you. Though tempted, you may
   be kept in the temptation and delivered from the evil. Thus your
   spirit, and the Holy Spirit shall be ungrieved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   They cried to God in the battle, and He was entreated of them. 1 Chron.
   v. 20.

   WHETHER they cried to God before they went into the battle we are not
   told; but probably they did, because we read that the war was of God,
   and it is hardly likely that they would have prayed to Him in the midst
   of the fight, when the foemen's blows fell like hail on their armour,
   if they had not prayed before they entered the bloody fray. Men often
   excuse themselves for neglecting their morning devotions by saying that
   they will surely look to God, as they may require his gracious help, in
   the midst of the day's temptations and needs; but, as a matter of fact,
   when once they are plunged into its war they forget to look up. You
   must direct your prayer in the morning, and look up whilst the early
   shadows lie long on the dewy grass, if you would keep looking off to
   Jesus, amid the din of the fight.

   It is very lovely to contract and preserve this habit of looking
   upward, and crying to God in the battle. When our feet are slipping,
   when the foe seems about to overmaster, when heart and flesh fail --
   how refreshing and strengthening to fling one eager look or cry to
   heaven, and say, "I am thine, save me." There can be no doubt as to the
   issue. God is always intreated of those who put their trust in Him.
   Sooner might a mother forget her sucking child than God be unmindful of
   one sigh, or tear, or upward glancing look from his own. Oh, child of
   God, put thou thy trust in God, and go through this tempestuous world
   as one who is confident of a Divine Ally. At any moment He will ride on
   the heavens to thy help. "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne
   of grace that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of
   need."

   Heman the singer. 1 Chron. vi. 33.

   THIS is a very brief record to put on a man's grave, but a very
   expressive one. To decipher that epitaph about Heman is to learn a good
   deal about him. From this clue we might almost construct his entire
   personality and character. And it would be well if it could be said of
   us that we had ministered with song before the tabernacle of the Lord.

   Would you be a singer -- not on Sundays only, but always; not with your
   voice only, but in your heart; not only when the sunshine pours into
   the open casement through the swaying boughs of honeysuckle, but when
   the shutters tell of bereavement and removal -- then remember these
   rules: -- (1st.) God must put the new song into your mouth; (2nd.) You
   must be fully consecrated to Him; for the song of the Lord only begins
   when the burnt-offering is complete. (3rd.) You must not go into a
   strange land, for it is impossible to sing the Lord's song there.

   Sing on, dear heart, sing on. There is nothing that scares off the
   devil so quickly as a hymn. Luther said, "Let us sing a hymn, and spite
   the devil." There is nothing that so well beguiles the pilgrim's step,
   and quickens his pace, when the miles are growing long and weary. There
   is nothing that brings so much of heaven into the heart. Singing makes
   every movement rhythmic, every service praise, every act thanksgiving.
   Sing when times are dark, you will make them bright; sing when the
   house of life is lonely, it will become peopled with unseen choristers;
   go down into the valley of shadow with a song, and you will find
   yourself singing the new song of Moses and the Lamb when you awake on
   the other side.
     __________________________________________________________________

   It went evil with his house. 1 Chron. vii. 23.

   IT is an old-world tale, and those tears have long since been wiped
   away. What led to the death of so many of the stalwart sons of Ephraim
   is not quite clear; but apparently they made a raid from the
   hill-fastnesses on the men of Gath to lift their cattle, and were
   repelled with great disaster. At any rate, they were slain by men of
   Gath, that were born in the land. They were part of the early nations
   of Canaan that should have been destroyed. This suggests a significant
   train of thought. We must beware of the tendencies and impulses which
   were born in us, which we have inherited.

   They are strong in all of us. Parents transmit to an awful extent their
   own passions. What a reason this is for carefully curbing them! I have
   known the children of drunkards, grown to middle-life, who have
   confessed that they have never spent a day without the conscious
   craving for alcohol. These are the men of Gath, born in the land, who
   will slay us unless we are on our guard.

   There will be irremediable sorrow if we yield to them. Many days of
   mourning will not avail to wipe out the sad and bitter memory of the
   disaster, when once they have wreaked their wild will on us. If
   permitted within, they will, like traitors, open the door to Satan
   without.

   But faith is the victory. He that believeth that Jesus is the Son of
   God; he in whom Jesus lives by the Holy Spirit; he who knows the
   Stronger than the strong man armed, shall be kept from falling, and
   preserved unto God's heavenly kingdom. "Walk in the Spirit, and ye
   shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against
   the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Esh-baal, . . . Merib-baal. 1 Chron. viii. 33, 34.

   BAAL was the idol-god of Zidon and of many surrounding nations. This
   idol, representing the sun in his productive force, was worshipped with
   impure and scandalous rites. The introduction of this name into the
   appellation of one of Saul's sons indicates the secret root of the
   declension and consequent misfortunes of that ill-fated monarch. In the
   earlier part of his reign he was perfect in his allegiance to Jehovah
   -- Jonathan means "Gift of Jehovah " -- but as the years went on, he
   became proud and seIfsufficient; he turned to Baal, the Spirit of the
   Lord departed from him, and an evil spirit rushed in to take His place,
   as wind rushes in to fill a vacuum.

   The name which Jonathan gave his son had another significance.
   Merib-baal is one who opposes Baal. It is as though he would indelibly
   stamp upon his child an undying hatred and opposition to that idolatry
   which was undoing his father's character and kingdom. In this choice of
   his child's name we also gather the deep-seated piety and devotion of
   that noble soul, whose heart was true to God amid the darkening shadows
   of his father's reign. It was this that probably drew David and him so
   closely in affinity.

   How absolutely necessary it is for the peace of a household that there
   should be a oneness of devotion to God! Where that is the first
   consideration, there is peace and blessedness; and that it may be so,
   it is of the greatest importance that the parents should be constant in
   their godly allegiance. The ruin of Saul's home, family, and realm,
   began in his personal disloyalty to God; and how far he influenced the
   nation for evil it is difficult to estimate.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chosen to be porters . . appointed over the furniture; . . the singers.
   1 Chron. ix. 22, 29, 31, 33.

   WHAT a busy scene is suggested in these words! When the morning broke,
   it called to duty first the porters who opened the House of God; and
   then, after due ablution, each band of white-robed Levites been its
   special service. There was no running to and fro in disorder, no
   intrusion on one another's office, no clashing in duty, no jealousy of
   each other's ministry. It was enough to know that each had been
   appointed to his task, and was asked to be faithful to it. The right
   ordering of the whole depended on the punctuality, fidelity, and
   conscientiousness of each.

   So it is in the Church of Christ, each is specially gifted for some
   post to which he has been set apart. One to see to the gates, admitting
   souls to the kingdom; one to the baking in pans, attending to the
   feeding of the household of God; some are appointed to the furnishing
   and maintaining of the House of Prayer; others to the psalmody, as the
   hymn-writers of our praise and holy song. How beautiful it is when we
   dwell together in this unity, not envying one another, nor interfering
   in each other's ministry. "He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets;
   and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers: for the
   perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
   edifying of the body of Christ." Whatever is successfully done by the
   Church is accredited by Christ to each faithful servant, just as the
   impression produced on the audience by an orchestra is the result of
   each instrument, even to the piccolo, doing its part. Whatever is done
   by the whole, is done by each part of the whole. Be content with the
   position to which thy Master has assigned thee, and let thine eye be
   single unto Him. So shall each have praise of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   So Saul died for his trespass. 1 Chron. x. 13 (R.V.).

   IT is suggestive to ponder the threefold analysis of Saul's trespass as
   given here. He kept not the word of the Lord -- this probably refers to
   his failure to execute the sentence on Amalck; he asked counsel of one
   that had a familiar spirit -- this errand had taken him to Endor on the
   eve of the battle; he enquired not of the Lord -- this was
   conspicuously the case in his persecution of David.

   Do we sufficiently inquire of the Lord? We ask the advice of our
   friends and religious teachers; we sometimes use doubtful methods of
   ascertaining God's will, as allowing the Bible to drop open, or
   interpreting some coincidence in the way we secretly desire to follow;
   besides which there is an increasing tendency in society to use the
   crystal, to consult spiritualistic mediums, to employ palmistry. These
   latter, course, repeat the sin of Saul, in going to Endor; and the
   resort to them on the part of children of this world shows that the
   heart of man must have something exterior to itself for worship and
   trust; if it has Forsaken God, it will deal with the devil rather than
   drift on alone. But let us all cultivate more carefully the blessed
   habit of waiting on God. If we ask Him for guidance, He will be sure to
   impart it; only we must put aside all selfish and personal ends,
   desiring to know his will, with a single purpose, and an unalloyed
   determination to follow it at any cost.

   Christ has told us that willingness to do his will is the sure organ of
   spiritual knowledge. "He that wills to do his will, shall know." Be of
   good career, beloved: God hath chosen thee that thou shouldst know his
   will, and see that Just One, and shouIdst hear the voice of his mouth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Oh that one would give me drink of the water at the well of Bethlehem!
   1 Chron. xi. 17.

   DAVID had often drunk of this well. As a boy he had gone with his
   mother to draw its clear, cold water. It was, therefore, associated
   with the happy days of childhood and youth that lay behind the haze of
   the years. In the sultry afternoon, as, from the cave in which be was
   hiding, he looked across the valley where his ancestress Ruth had
   gleaned in the fields of Boaz, to the long straggling town of his
   birth, it seemed as though nothing could stay his passionate longing
   for a draught of the water of the well of Bethlehem that was at the
   gate.

   Sometimes longings like his take possession of us. We desire to drink
   again the waters of comparative innocence, of child-like trust and joy;
   to drink again of the fountains of human love; to have the bright,
   fresh rapture in God, and nature, and home. But it is a mistake to look
   back. Here and now, within us, Jesus is waiting to open the well of
   living water which springs up to eternal life, of which if we drink we
   never thirst.

   Purity is better than innocence; the blessedness which comes through
   suffering is richer than the gladsomeness of childhood; the peace of
   the heart is more than peace of circumstances. We have solace in Jesus,
   which even the dear love of home could not equal; and before us lies
   the reunion with the blessed dead. How shall we thank Him who, at the
   cost of his own blood, broke through the hosts of our foes, and won for
   us the river of life; and who for evermore will lead us to the
   fountains, where life rises fresh from the heart of God! Listen to his
   voice as He bids us drink abundantly: "Let him that is athirst come;
   and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
     __________________________________________________________________

   All these men of war, that could keep rank, came to make David king. 1
   Chron. xii. 38.

   THE crowning of David secured the unity of Israel. Because all these
   men of war converged on the chosen king, they met each other, and
   became one great nation. The enthroning of David was the uniting of the
   kingdom. Herein is the secret of the unity of the Church. We shall
   never secure it by endeavouring to bring about an unity in thought, or
   act, or organization. It is as each individual heart enthrones the
   Saviour that each will become one with all kindred souls in the
   everlasting kingdom.

   Is your heart perfect to make Christ king? We read in verse 33 of
   Zebulon, whose warriors were not of a double heart; the margin says
   they were "without a heart and a heart." The double-minded man is
   unstable in all his ways; he is not to be relied upon in his loyalty or
   service to his king. The only blessed life is that of the man whose eye
   is single. It is only such an one that receives anything from the Lord.
   Let us ask that the thoughts of our hearts may be cleansed by the
   inspiration of God's Holy Spirit, that our hearts may be perfect
   towards Him, and so perfect to all who hold Jesus as King and Head,
   though they differ from us in minor points. Different regiments, but
   one army, one movement, one king.

   Let us learn to keep rank, shoulder to shoulder, and in step, with our
   brethren. Too many like to break the ranks, and do God's work
   independently. Fifty men who act together will do greater execution
   than five hundred acting apart. There is too much of this guerilla
   fighting. Unity is strength; and in their efforts to overthrow the
   kingdom of Satan it is most essential that the soldiers of Christ move
   in rank and keep step.

   And David was afraid of God that day. 1 Chron. xiii. 12.

   THERE was no reason for David to be afraid of God, if he conformed to
   the rules laid down in Leviticus. There it was expressly ordained that
   the Ark should be carried on the shoulders of the priests, because the
   cause of God must proceed through the world by the means of consecrated
   men, rather than by mechanical instrumentality. David ignored this
   provision when he placed the Ark on the new cart. He disobeyed the
   distinct law of the Divine procedure. What wonder that Uzza was struck
   dead! Fire will burn if you persist in violating its law. Obed-edom, on
   the other hand, studiously obeyed, so far as he knew them, the Divine
   regulations, and to him the Ark was a source of blessing; just as fire
   will toil for us in our furnaces and grates, and be the greatest
   possible benediction to human Iife, if only we carefully conform to its
   ascertained and immutable law.

   God is to us what we are to Him. To Pharaoh, blackness and darkness; to
   Israel, light and help. To the froward, He is froward; to the merciful
   man, merciful.To one of the thieves, the cross of Christ was the savour
   of death unto death, because his heart was impenitent; to the other,
   the savour of life unto life, because his heart was soft and believing
   You need not fear God so long as you walk in his ways and do his will.
   He is to be feared only by those who violate his law. God is a
   consuming fire. He will make a breach on those who disobey Him. He will
   consume the evil of our inner life. But let Him be welcomed into your
   life and home; let the Ark, which is the symbol of his presence, dwell
   within; bring up your children to minister unto Him; and you will be
   blessed, with all that you have.

   Then thou shalt go out to battle; for God is gone forth before thee. 1
   Chron. xiv. 15.

   WHAT was this "going"? It was not merely a fitful breeze stealing
   through the leaves; it was not the going of the wind; but of angel
   squadrons who were proceeding against the enemies of Israel. This
   thought often occurs in Scripture -- as when Jacob met God's host; and
   the warrior-Saviour told Joshua that He was captain of a host whom God
   had commissioned to take Jericho; so also the horses and chariots of
   fire surrounded Elisha. Hearken to the measured footfall of God's host,
   beneath which the mulberry trees sway, though no wind stirs the sultry
   air.

   God's hosts go forth against his foes and ours. Perhaps we should feel
   less oppressed with the burden of the fight if we realized this. The
   battle is not ours, but God's. He will deliver the Philistines to us so
   that we shall have to do little else than fight and spoil. Oh, believe
   in the co-operation of the Holy Spirit. Lonely missionary in some
   distant station of the foreign field, listen for the moving in the tops
   of the mulberry trees! God is stirring for thy succour. Thou art a
   co-worker with Him in making known his salvation; and He will prosper
   thee.

   Let us wait for our instructions. David inquired of the Lord; let us
   not anticipate Him. It is useless to go up until He has gone out before
   us. We may as well save ourselves from disappointment by quietly
   waiting for the salvation of our God. But oh, be sure that those who
   wait for God shall not be long before the God for whom they wait shall
   go forth before them to smite the host, whether it be the hosts of
   temptation that oppress the inner life, or the hosts of spiritual foes
   that oppose the progress of God's work.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song. 1 Chron. xv. 22.

   THE carrying of the Ark to its right place was associated with every
   expression of gladness on the part of king and people; but there were
   some who were specially set apart as the exponents of the general joy.
   In the old time such were David, Heman, Asaph, Chenaniah; in our time,
   Watts and Doddridge, Wesley and Toplady, Keble, Havergal, and Bonar.

   It is good to be for song. Many a heart that cannot rank as a musician
   or poet, may yet be susceptible to the joy of the Lord, which is ever
   passing through creation, catching it up so as to express it. As the
   Ark of the Lord comes to its place within you, sing.

   Song is harmony with the life of God. The will of God sometimes enters
   life as a sigh, as David's first attempt to move the Ark; but
   afterwards it becomes a song, as in the second attempt. Enshrine the
   Ark of God with its tables of stone, its mercy-seat of fellowship, its
   worshipping Cherubim in the Holy of Holies within; and you will find
   sighs turned to songs, tears to thanks, mourning to the garment of
   praise.

   Worship the will of God. Conform your life with it. Draw on the ground
   a circle to represent God's will, and step into it, resolving never to
   step out of its blessed precincts again. Dare to believe and confess
   that Paradise lies within, though it may be veiled to sight and sense.
   According to your faith it shall be unto you. If you believe that
   heaven is there, you will find heaven. The Ark of God is ever a
   provocative of song. His statutes seem awful in the distance; but so
   soon as we begin to practise them, they turn to songs
     __________________________________________________________________

   Talk ye of all His wondrous works. 1 Chron. xvi. 9.

   WE do not talk sufficiently about God. Why it is so may not be easy to
   explain; but there seems a too great reticence among Christian people
   about the best things. In the days of Malachi, "they that feared the
   Lord spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard." We
   talk about sermons, details of worship and church organization, or the
   latest phase of Scripture criticism; we discuss men, methods, and
   churches; but our talk in the home, and in the gatherings of Christians
   for social purposes, is too seldom about the wonderful works of God.
   Better to speak less, and to talk more of Him.

   But probably the real cause of our avoidance of this best of topics, is
   that our hearts are filled with so much which is not of God, and they
   speak out of their abundance. You may judge the contents of a shop by
   what is put in the windows; and you may judge of the inner life of too
   many Christians by the subjects which are most familiar to their lips.
   The heart does not seek for God and his strength, nor his face
   continually; and therefore we find it hard to talk of all his wondrous
   works.

   But go back in thought to the day of Pentecost. One of the first signs
   of the descent of the blessed Spirit was that the crowd heard every man
   speaking in his own tongue the wonderful works of God. What God has
   done in the past, as recorded on the page of Scripture; what He is
   doing day by day in the world around, and in our hearts; what He has
   promised to do on the horizon where heaven and earth shall blend in the
   Second Advent -- yield fit themes on which his children may beamingly
   talk to each other, till He goes beside and talks with them till their
   hearts burn.

   Do as Thou hast said, that thy name may be magnified for ever. 1 Chron.
   xvii. 23, 24.

   THIS is a most blessed phase of true prayer. Many a time we ask for
   things which are not absolutely promised. We are not sure therefore
   until we have persevered for some time whether our petitions are in the
   line of God's purpose or no. There are other occasions, and in the life
   of David this was one, when we are fully persuaded that what we ask is
   according to God's will. We feel led to take up slid plead some promise
   from the page of Scripture, under the special impression that it
   contains a message for us.

   At such times, in confident faith, we say, "Do as Thou hast said."
   There is hardly any position more utterly beautiful, strong, or safe,
   than to put the finger upon some promise of the Divine Word, and claim
   it. There need be no anguish, or struggle, or wrestling; we simply
   present the cheque and ask for cash, produce the promise, and claim its
   fulfilment; nor can there be any doubt as to the issue. It would give
   much interest to prayer, if we were more definite. It is far better to
   claim a few things specifically than a score vaguely.

   David's argument was not simply that his house might be established,
   but that God's name might be magnified for ever. It is good when we can
   lose sight of our personal interests in our keen desire for his glory;
   when we are so delivered from egotism, that Christ is all and in all.
   Let the attitude of your soul be more towards the glory of God; and as
   you quote promise after promise for the enthroning of Christ, the
   saving of men, and the sanctification of your soul, dare in humble
   faith to say, Do as Thou hast said, that thy Name may be magnified for
   ever.
     __________________________________________________________________

   He put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became servants to
   David. 1 Chron. xviii. 73.

   EDOM and Israel were closely related, but there was constant rivalry
   and war between the two peoples. Sometimes Israel held the upper-hand
   for a little; but Edom soon broke loose again, and resumed the old
   independence, with the border forays (2 Chron. xxi. 10; xxv. 11-14;
   Psa. cxxxvii. 7). Now, as Edom stands for the flesh, which hungers for
   the savoury dish, and is willing to give even its birthright of
   spiritual power to secure it -- this long feud is full of interest to
   us. It reminds us of the strife of Rom. vii., between the will of the
   renewed man and the law of the members, ever striving for mastery.

   We turn on the pages of our Bibles to Isa. Ixiii., where a mighty
   Conqueror is seen coming towards the southern frontier of Palestine,
   with his back on Bozrah and Edom. His garments are dyed with the blood
   of Israel's foes; and behind Him cities are desolate and depopulated,
   territories are laid waste without inhabitant, and Edom's hostility is
   for ever quenched in blood. What a portraiture is here of Jesus,
   "mighty to save," who in his cross triumphed over principalities and
   powers, and made a show of them openly. He has overcome the world, the
   flesh, and the prince of the power of darkness; and stands for evermore
   between us and our former oppressors.

   Let us resign the conflict wholly to Him. We have sought in vain for
   victory by resolutions and endeavours ; by close attention to religious
   duties; by occupying our mind with various interests, so that we had no
   leisure to be tempted; by diet and exercise. Now, hand the conflict
   absolutely over to Jesus: do not even try to help Him: just let Him do
   all: be quite still, and when temptation comes, let Him meet it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of
   our God. 1 Chron. xix. 13.

   THOSE were days in which rough soldiers, like Joab, did not hesitate to
   speak freely of God to their companions in arms. It is a sorry thing
   that it is considered a breach of etiquette to mention God's name in
   polite society. "It is not good form! "

   We are reminded in these words of Joab of Cromwell's memorable advice
   to trust in God and keep the powder dry. David's General felt that the
   ultimate issue of the battle must be left to God; but that nothing
   could absolve him and his soldier from doing their best. They, at
   least, must make careful dispositions for the fight, and show
   themselves valiant.

   This balance of statement and thought between God's work and ours is an
   evidence of fine Christian sanity. We must believe that God is the
   ultimate arbiter, but we must ever speak and act as though the
   responsibility were entirely on ourselves. To believe that God will do
   all, and therefore to do nothing, is as bad as to believe that God
   leaves us to our unaided endeavours. We believe in the strength and
   sufficiency of God's purpose; but we know that there is link in the
   chain of causation which we must supply.

   The servant of God who counts most absolutely on the communion and
   co-operation of the Divine Spirit will be most careful in making all
   needful dispositions for the fight. He will leave no stone unturned to
   secure the victory, though he knows that the ultimate decision rests
   with God. The conquests of the cross recorded in the Acts of the
   Apostles were the result of the united action of the Holy Spirit and
   the men who were sent forth with the message of the gospel "We are
   labourers together with God."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The time when Kings go out to battle. . . . . But David tarried at
   Jerusalem. 1 Chron. xx. 1.

   THERE are times and tides in the affairs of men. Favourable moments for
   doing and daring, for attempting and achieving. Hours when the ship
   must be launched, or it will have to wait for another spring tide. Days
   when the seed must be sown, or it will have to tarry till another
   autumn. Royal natures show their quality by taking advantage of times
   like these, when God and circumstances favour a great attempt.

   Alas, if long-continued prosperity has robbed the kingly soul of its
   desire or power to use its sacred opportunity! Once missed, it may
   never recur; and the soul that has missed it condemns itself, and loses
   heart, and surrenders itself to lower and ever lower depths of
   temptation.

   Beware of moments and hours of ease. It is in these that we most easily
   fall into the power of Satan. The sultriest summer days are most laden
   with blight. There is no such guard against temptation -- next to the
   keeping power of Jesus, which is all-sufficient -- as occupation to the
   full measure of time and capacity. If we cannot fill our days with our
   own matters, there is always plenty to be done for others. You think
   that no one has hired you, but it is not so; the Master has sent you
   into his vineyard. If you cannot do one thing, you can another. There
   is the ministry of intercession for those who are in the field. There
   is the exercise of worship, in which you take your place amongst the
   priests. There is the ministry of comfort to some of the sad hearts
   within your own circle. Redeem the time, because the days are evil.
   Watch and pray in days of vacation and ease, even more than at other
   times.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly in that I have done this
   thing. 1 Chron. xxi. 8 (R.V.).

   HIS sin lay in the spirit of pride and display. He vaunted in the
   growing numbers of Israel, and credited them to himself, as the result
   of his own prowess and prudence. All such boasting is very abhorrent to
   the all-holy God, who will not give his glory to another. It was the
   sin of Nebuchadnezzar, when he said, "Is not this great Babylon which I
   have built?" It was the sin of Herod Agrippa when the people shouted,
   saying, "The voice of a god, and not of a man"; and immediately the
   angel of the Lord smote him, "because he gave not God the glory."

   We are all tempted to it when we count up the number of our adherents
   and converts; when we unroll our securities and vouchers; when we count
   up our assets; when we display our jewels. All these are gifts
   entrusted to our care by our Father and Saviour, to be held in trust as
   a matter for gratitude rather than for pride.

   How greatly David had fallen from the level of his own sweet sonnet! --
   "Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty." Oh, let us ask our
   Master Christ to teach us how to be meek and lowly in heart, that we
   may find rest unto our souls; let us endeavour to be as little
   children, devoid of self. consciousness; and let us be careful, as we
   survey the growing treasures and power of our lives, to remember the
   Apostle's words: "Who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that
   thou didst not receive? But if thou didst receive it, why dost thou
   glory, as if thou hadst not received it? "

   How well John the Baptist parried the temptation to jealousy, when he
   said, "A man can receive nothing unless it be given him from heaven."
     __________________________________________________________________

   A man of rest . . . he shall build. 1 Chron. xxii. 9, 10.

   THE men of rest are the builders of the most lasting structures.
   Solomon builds the Temple, not David. Mary's deed of anointing, learnt
   in much sitting at the Lord's feet, fills the world with its aroma.
   What is needed to make us men and women of rest?

   First, a profound conviction that God is working. -- Never despair of
   the world, said the late Mrs. Beecher Stowe, when you remember what God
   did with slavery: the best possible must happen. This serene faith,
   that all things are working out for the best -- the best to God, the
   best to man -- and that God is at the heart of all, will calm and still
   us in the most feverish days. There is a strong and an experienced Hand
   on the helm.

   Next, an entire surrender to his will. -- God's will is certain to mean
   the destruction of the flesh, in whatever form He finds it; but it is
   our part to yield to Him; to will his will even to the cross; to follow
   our leader Christ in this, that He yielded Himself without reserve to
   execute his Father's purpose.

   Thirdly, a certain knowledge that He is working within to will and do
   of his good pIeasure. -- what a blessed peace possesses us when once we
   realize that we are not called on to originate or initiate, nor to make
   great far-reaching plans and try to execute them; but just to believe
   that God is prepared to work through our hands, speak by our life,
   dwell in our bodies, and fulfil in us the good purposes of his will. Be
   full of God's rest. Let there be no hurry, precipitation, or fret;
   yield to God's hands, that He may mould thee: hush thy quickly
   throbbing pulse! So shalt thou build to good and lasting purpose.

   Aaron was separated, he and his sons for ever, to minister unto Him. 1
   Chron. xxiii. 13.

   THE threefold office of Aaron suggests our own. When we are prepared to
   follow Jesus, through the rent vail of his flesh, living a truly
   separated life, cleansing ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh
   and spirit, we also, as chosen priests, may exercise these functions of
   intercession, ministry, and blessing.

   Intercession. -- The fragrant incense stealing heavenward is a
   beautiful emblem of intercessory prayer. Let us pray more, not for
   ourselves so much as for others. This is the sign of growth in grace,
   when our prayers are fragrant with the names of friend and foe, and
   mingled with the coals of the golden altar. This is one of the best
   gifts; oh to exercise it more persistently!

   Ministry. -- We have many things to engage our attention, but they
   maybe unified and elevated by the one threading purpose of doing all
   for the King. Whether we eat, or drink, or whatever else we do, we may
   do all to his glory. Go up and down in the Temple, priests; engage in
   song, or sacrifice, or whatever ministry you will: but be sure that all
   is of Him, and through Him, and to Him for ever.

   Blessing. -- As Aaron came forth from the most Holy Place to bless the
   congregation that waited for him, so we should bless that little
   portion of the world in which our lot is cast. It is not enough to
   Iinger in soft prayer within the vail, we must come forth to bless
   mankind. He who is nearest God is closest man. Let our smile, our
   touch, our words, our life, be the greatest blessing possible to those
   who know us best.

   Blessed Spirit, realize through each of us this threefoId ideal, and
   separate us from sin and the world, that we may be prepared for it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Princes of the Sanctuary. 1 Chron. xxiv. 5 (R.V.).

   IT is not enough for us to be in the sanctuary, we must be princes
   there. There must be the regal mien, which is a meek humility; the real
   largesse, which is peace and blessing; and the regal might, which is
   self-restraint and self-control. None can be princes of the sanctuary
   without two things: they must be priests, come of the priestly line;
   and kings, royal not because of deeds of war, but because they are
   related to the King Himself, and are regal in their holy and blameless
   character.

   There is only one power that can make us princes of the sanctuary --
   the hand of the exalted Lamb, who is Himself a Priest-King, after the
   order of Melchizedek. He it is who makes us kings and priests unto God
   his Father.

   He makes us priests. -- This is your position, not now to offer
   propitiatory sacrifices, but to present yourselves a living sacrifice;
   to have compassion on the ignorant, and on those who are out of the
   way; to swing the censer of prayer between the living and the dead, so
   that plagues may be stayed; and to plead for the dark sad world, with
   its load of wretchedness, need, and sin. See that your garments are
   ever white and stainless.

   He makes us kings. -- We reign with Him. Sin and Satan, the world and
   the flesh, are beneath our feet. Ours the life of overcoming power, of
   unbroken victory, of identification with Jesus in the glory that the
   Father has given Him. They that receive the abundance of his grace
   reign. It is there for us all, but many do not know, or knowing do not
   appreciate. It is on our reception by faith of God's abundant grace,
   that we reign in this life, and the next.
     __________________________________________________________________

   All these were under the hands of their father for song. 1 Chron. xxv.
   5, 6.

   WHAT a glorious family was here! The household was a band of
   choristers! From morning till night their home must have been full of
   holy song and psalm, or talk about the order of the Temple service, in
   which they were all so deepIy interested. Surely no jarring note, no
   unholy discord, would live in such an atmosphere! The common occupation
   and worship must have welded the brothers and sisters into to the
   tenderest union.

   How one would like to have seen Heman coming into the Temple with his
   children! It was largely owing to him arid their mother that they were
   what they were. We shall read the Psalms ascribed to him with more
   interest, now we know of the holy family life out of which they
   emanated. What interest there would be when the father had produced a
   new psalm, to know what music would suit it best!

   Parents! Be sure that you look on your children, as these Hebrews did
   on theirs, as the gifts of God; and remember that if He gives you many
   months to feed, He will send the wherewithal to feed them. Be careful
   also that your own hearts and lives are full of praise and prayer; what
   you are, the children will become. Would that mothers especially
   realized how they transmit their characters. But remember that you must
   be obeyed in the home. Heman's children were "under the hands of their
   father." Young people must not get the upper hand.

   But if you would rule well, you must obey. Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun,
   were under the king (6, R.V.). The man who is himself under authority,
   can say, Go, come, do this or that, with the calm assurance of being
   obeyed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   For the courses of the doorkeepers. 1 Chron. xxvi. 1 (R.V.).

   MIGHTY men of valour were needed for this, just as sweet singers were
   for the service of song. Entrance to the House of God was restricted to
   a privileged few. Gentiles were excluded from certain courts, and women
   from another. It was incumbent also to look out for those who, like the
   publican in the Lord's parable, might shrink from intruding, and
   encourage them to enter. Doorkeepers had to combine many qualities,
   which would be of the greatest service if they could be repeated in
   each church and chapel of our great cities, for welcoming old and
   young.

   But chiefly we are concerned with the temple of the heart. We surely
   need the doorkeeper there, for in the history of the inner life there
   is so much going and coming; such troops of thoughts pour into the
   shrine of the soul, and pour out. And often, in the crowd, disloyal and
   evil thoughts intrude, which, before we know it, introduce a sense of
   distance and alienation from God, as though a cloud had veiled the
   shining of the Shekinah. Whenever the sky is overcast within, we should
   question whether some traitor, some excommunicate, has entered. Our
   native wit is not quick enough to detect, and our strength not mighty
   enough to withstand, the entrance of all these evil things. Hence the
   necessity not only to live in the Spirit, but to walk in the Spirit, i.
   e., to submit everything to the Spirit's scrutiny.

   It is necessary also that strict supervision strong be exercised over
   those who unite with the visible Church, lest her holiness become
   diluted, and her fences broken down. Nothing is more important than the
   function of doorkeeping for the Church's purity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   All these were the rulers of the substance which was King David's. 1
   Chron. xxvii. 31.

   THERE was great variety in office and gift. He who cared for the work
   of the field could not have known how to care for the flocks. The
   overseer of olive-yard and vineyard would have been a poor hand with
   the camels and asses. One sort of talent was needed for the herds, and
   another for the wine cellars; and yet there was unity in the common
   service of the king. We are reminded of the words of the Apostle,
   describing the variety in unity which must obtain in every healthy
   church: "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit;
   diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord; diversities of
   operations, but the same God."

   Each of these different men had his distinct sphere for which he was
   doubtless specially qualified; and it was his duty -- not to be jealous
   of others, nor eager to imitate them, but -- to be faithful in his own
   province. How much happier we should all be if we recognised our
   specific work in God's house, and kept to it, being content to serve
   the King as He has seen fit to determine, rendering Him the produce in
   due season.

   How great an error it would have been had any of these begun to account
   the produce of cattle or ground as his own! He had nothing that he had
   not received, and whatever he controlled had been entrusted to his care
   for the emolument and of his sovereign. Yet, how few of us that we are
   put in business with God's capital, for God's use. We take all and give
   Him a percentage, instead of using all for Him and keeping a percentage
   for ourselves. In this we rob God, and greatly err. We must acknowledge
   that both we and all we possess belong to Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Lord God, even my God, . . will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. 1
   Chron. xxviii. 20.

   IT is very comforting to take these words to our hearts; especially
   when we connect them with the foregoing ones about the pattern, and
   apply the whole passage to the temple-building of our own lives. For
   each of us, too, there is a pattern, an ideal, a design, based on the
   possibilities which God sees to be within our reach; for each, too,
   there is abundance of stored provision; but we are not always strong to
   do. In Jesus there is the complete ideal of human life; of the Child at
   Nazareth; of the Servant in the workshop; of the Lover in his affection
   for his church; of the Friend, the Sufferer, the Patriot, the Saviour.
   Go forth and imitate Him!

   Sometimes our heart and flesh fail us in the mid-passage of life. Once
   the energy and vigour of youth promised to sustain and carry us to the
   end of life, without fear or failure; but these die down, and we wonder
   how the remainder of the life-plan can be fulfilled. And the one
   sufficient answer is -- God. He who helped our fathers to the very end
   will help us; He who did not fail or forsake them, will never leave nor
   forsake us, until all the work of life which He has planned, is
   finished.

   It is probable that you will do better and more enduring work
   henceforth than you have ever done in the heyday and plenitude of
   youthful power, if you let God work all through you to his own glory.
   You have no need for despondency, God is sufficient. Oh to write this
   down on the tablets of the heart -- God is; God is here ; God is
   all-sufficient; God has begun and will finish! God has promised that he
   will never leave nor forsake us; therefore we may boldly say, "God is
   my helper, I will not fear what man shall do unto me."

   Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding. 1
   Chron. xxix. 15. (R.V.).

   ALL life has been compared to the shadow of a smoke-wreath; a gesture
   in the invisible air; a hier-oglyph traced for an instant on the sand,
   and effaced a moment after by a breath of wind; an air-bubble vanishing
   on the river. Pilgrims and sojourners, as were all our fathers -- such
   is the universal confession. But even such may do a work that will last
   for ages. David and the men of his time, though transitory their stay
   on our planet, left behind them a standing evidence that they had been
   here.

   Our life is nothing, but it may be divine: our days are as a breath,
   but they may affect unborn generations: the tent of the body is laid
   aside, but the soul, which had dwelt in it, is immortal in its touch:
   it leaves traces of its own immortality behind in its works, and it
   lives in them. In one sense, the answer to the ancient prayer is
   certain: "Establish Thou the works of our hands upon us." But we may
   well ask, that they may be such that we shall have no need to be
   ashamed of.

   But, for this, God must live mightily within us. Abide in Me, said our
   Lord. . . . I have appointed you that ye may bring forth fruit, and
   that your fruit may abide. It is impossible to be in true union with
   Christ without feeling the pulse of his glorious life; and where it
   enters like a tidal river, it can have but one result -- it must
   manifest itself in fruit. It is only in proportion as our works are
   done in God, and God permeates our works, that they become sources of
   enduring blessing to coming time. Pilgrims though we be, yet, if our
   lives are spent before Him, we may build temples which will outlast the
   wreck of matter.

   I will give thee riches. 2 Chron. i. 11, 12.

   SOLOMON had chosen wisdom and knowledge that he might honour God in the
   sight of his people. And in return God honoured him, and supplemented
   his choice with abundant wealth.

   This reminds one of the constant teaching of Jesus. He who seeks his
   life loses it; but to lose it is to save it in the best and deepest
   sense. Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all
   these things shall be added.

   The conception of life given in the Bible differs by a whole heaven
   from the maxims and practices of some good and earnest people. Their
   notion is that they must work for their living, "keep the wolf from the
   door," educate their children for successfully meeting the demands of
   life. These objects are legitimate; but they were never meant by God to
   be the supreme aim of his servants.

   His object in our creation, redemption, and regeneration, was that we
   might serve his redemptive purposes in the world, manifest his
   character, do his will, win souls for his kingdom, administer the gifts
   with which He had entrusted us. He asks us to rise to this high
   calling, and give our whole life to its realization. He will be
   responsible for all else. It is surely his will that we should give
   ourselves to useful trades, and fill our days with honest toil; but the
   main purpose should ever be his glory, and the exemplification in word
   and act of his holy character. It we ask for wisdom to do this well, we
   shall get all eIse into the bargain. God is a being of perfect honour
   and integrity. And if we dare to make his service the main end of life,
   we shall find that no good thing will fail. He paves the streets of
   heaven with gold, and will not withhold it from his children, if they
   really need.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Because the Lord loveth His people, He hath made thee King over them. 2
   Chron. ii. 11(R.V.).

   HOW truly might these words be addressed to our blessed Lord! Because
   God loved the world, He gave his only-begotten Son, his well-beloved,
   to be both Prince and Saviour. And it is in knowing, loving, and
   serving Him that we can realize our supreme blessedness.

   God's loving appointment in making Jesus King will be apparent when we
   remember how beautiful He is in his personal character; how closely He
   is identified with our nature; the might of his arm with which He
   shields, the patience wherewith He bears, the redemption which He has
   wrought out and brought in for all who believe. What could God's love
   have done better to approve itself?

   Is He your King? Never till He is so, will you know the fulness of
   God's love. Those who question or refuse his authority are always in
   doubt about the love of God to themselves and to the world. Those, on
   the other hand, who acknowledge his claims, and crown Him as King,
   suddenly find themselves admitted to a standpoint of vision in which
   doubts and disputations vanish, and the secret love of God is unfolded.
   Then they experience the wise and gentle tendance of the Divine love in
   its most entrancing characteristics. All is love where Jesus reigns.

   Nothing is more indicative of God's benevolence than his incessant
   appeal to men to make Jesus King. The demand may sometimes involve
   severe agony and suffering for those who have acknowledged other lords
   too long; but God persists in his demand, because only in serving Jesus
   can the human heart be truly blessed.

   "Go, spread your trophies at his feet,

   And crown Him Lord of all!"
     __________________________________________________________________

   He set up the pillars before the Temple, . . . Jachin and Boaz. 2
   Chron. iii. 17.

   THE meaning of these names is significant -- He shall establish, and In
   it is strength. Each speaks of Him of whom the whole temple was a type.
   The Lord Jesus has established the work of redemption so that it shall
   never be removed; has established the covenant, ordered in all things
   and sure; has established his Church, so that the gates of Hades shall
   not prevail against it; has established us before the face of his
   Father for evermore.

   There is much in the New Testament about the established life. It is
   the desire of Peter that the scattered saints should be perfected,
   established, and strengthened. Paul desires to see the Roman
   Christians, that he may impart some spiritual gift so that they may be
   established: he desires that the Colossians may be built up in Christ,
   and established in the faith. The Epistle to the Hebrews says that it
   is good for the heart to be established with grace. Let us ask that
   Jesus should establish us in the Divine life, rooting and grounding us
   in love and faith, so that we may not be moved away from the Gospel,
   but abound therein with thanksgiving.

   It is only as we abide in Jesus, that we shall become steadfast,
   unmovable, and always abounding.

   But Christ is also our strong Helper. We have no strength of our own;
   but He is strong; and in Him we have righteousness and strength. Let
   its make our refuge in Him, as the conies, who are a feeble folk, do in
   the rock. They who abide in Jesus derive from Him fresh supplies of
   strength for each moment's need. They hear Him saying, "Fear not, I
   will strengthen, yea, I will help thee"; and they learn to say with
   Paul: "I can do all things in Christ that strengtheneth me."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Weight could not be found out. 2 Chron. iv. 18.

   THIS was as it should be. There was no attempt to keep an accurate
   account of what was given to the service of God. Even Solomon's left
   hand did not know what his right hand did. There is a tendency in all
   of us to keep a strict account of what we give to God. We note it down
   in our ledgers; we rigorously observe the compact into which we have
   entered with Him; but the loftiest form of devotion overleaps such
   calculation.

   This liberality of the people reminds us of Mary's. She never thought
   of the great cost of the precious spikenard which she broke over the
   Master's person. It was her joy to give her all; and it was only when
   Judas came on the scene, that we learn how many hundred pence it was
   worth. Thus the churches of Macedonia abounded from their deep poverty
   unto the riches of their liberality, so that, beyond their power, they
   gave to the cause of God.

   This lavish generosity is the reflection of God's. There is no measure
   in his bounty. It is heaped up, pressed down, and running over. He
   never says, I will give up to a certain amount, and hold my hand; but
   He continues to give like the overflowings of the river of Egypt, or
   the abundance of the spring flowers, which cover the earth as with a
   carpet. Ah, what a God is ours, who loves with a love that passeth
   knowledge; and when He gives, exceeds abundance, however much we may
   have asked or thought. How truly may we say with the psalmist, "Many,
   Lord my God, are the wonderful works that Thou hast done, and thy
   thoughts which are to us-ward. They cannot be reckoned up in order unto
   Thee; if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be
   numbered."

   Then the house was filled with a Cloud. 2 Chron. v. 13.

   THIS was the bright Shekinah cloud, the symbol of the Divine Presence,
   which had shone for Moses in the bush, and led the march through the
   desert. It was as though God had found a rest. And as it settled upon
   the Most Holy Place, it was as though God said, This is my rest for
   ever; here will I dwell, for I have desired it.

   The Most Holy Place is the symbol of our spirit, meant to be the
   abiding-place and home of God; and shall we not invite the blessed
   Shekinah cloud to enter thither, addressing it in the words of the
   Psalm, "Arise, Lord, into thy resting-place, Thou and the ark of thy
   strength." Because where He comes to abide He abundantly blesses the
   provision, and satisfies the poor with bread; He clothes his priests
   with salvation, and makes his saints shout aloud for joy; He erects the
   horn of strength and prepares the lamp of light. What were the
   conditions of this incoming? --

   First, UNITY.- "The trumpeters and singers were as one." We must put
   away strife, divisions, variance, and evil-speaking. Our heart and life
   must be full of love. When the disciples were with one accord,. in one
   place, the Spirit descended.

   Second, HEARTINESS. -- "They lifted up their voice." There was every
   symptom of sincerity and fervour.

   Third, THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE. -- "They praised the Lord, saying, He
   is good, for his mercy endureth for ever." No refrain occurs oftener in
   the Bible than this. It is an exquisite expression of the heart's joy
   and rest in God. Let us sing it in our darkest, as well as gladdest
   hours, full of trust, thanksgiving, and praise.
     __________________________________________________________________

   When Thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk. 2 Chron.
   vi. 27 (R.V.).

   THIS sentence is exactly parallel with the previous one, When Thou dost
   afflict them. The obvious meaning then is, that God sometimes taught
   Israel the good way wherein they should walk, by afflicting them and
   shutting up the heaven so that there was no rain. This was notably the
   case in the day.s of Elijah. Possibly, these words were in his heart,
   when be prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not for
   the space of three years and six months. Perhaps the prophet felt that
   in no other away could the people be brought back to their senses, and
   reconciled to God, except by learning the futility of idol-worship. So
   he asked God to teach them the good way, by shutting up the bad one.

   What a lesson for ourselves: God often teaches us by bitter
   disappointment and pain. Our familiar paths are barricaded by thorns,
   our familiar hidingplaces are blocked up, our fountains are poisoned,
   and all our pleasant things are laid waste. We sometimes suppose that
   this is in wrath; may it not rather be in love? God is reaching us the
   good by us the evil; is urging us to tread in the pleasant ways of
   wisdom, by allowing us to prove the sharp flints and thorns of
   transgression. Then Ephraim bemoans himself thus: Thou hast chastised
   me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed to the yoke: turn Thou
   me, and I shall be turned. Then the soul cries, I will go and return to
   my first husband, for then was it better with me than now.

   Sit in God's school, and learn from his Word and Spirit, that He may
   not be compelled to have recourse to such severe measures as these. Why
   shouldst thou be afflicted, when He is willing to instruct and teach
   thee in the way that thou shouldst go!
     __________________________________________________________________

   The fire came down from Heaven, and consumed the Burnt-Offering. 2
   Chron. vii. 1.

   IT was a very gracious and immediate response to the prayer of King and
   people. If we make room for God, He always comes and fills. If we seek
   Him, He is instantly with us. Directly the soul confesses, it is
   forgiven; or consecrates itself, it is accepted; or claims deliverance
   from the power of sin, it is cleansed. Do you really want the Lord to
   come to you? His glory has even now begun to shine in on you, to grow
   and enlighten you for evermore.

   The fire stands for the Divine Presence. Oh to have always a
   consciousness of it! Nothing would so soon arrest and destroy the
   impurity and evil within; as sunshine does fungus-growth. We are told
   that the fire was to be kept burning on the altar: it was never to go
   out. Thus, we should always perpetuate and practise the presence of
   God, feeding the fire with the fuel of prayer and meditation.

   Fire also stands for the Divine Purity. As the Plague of London was
   stamped out by the Great Fire which destroyed the nests where it had
   bred: and as the furnace rids the ore of dross -- so the Holy Spirit in
   thy heart and mine is a guarantee of holiness and righteousness all our
   days.

   Fire also stands for Divine Fellowship. It consumed that part of the
   offering which was placed on the altar; and it seemed as if the Divine
   nature was therefore feeding upon the sacrifice, whilst the remainder
   of it was consumed by the offerer. Thus, also, we have communion with
   Cod, as we eat the bread and drink the wine in the Lord's Supper. We
   feed on Christ in adoration, faith, and identification. God feeds on
   the completeness of Christ's obedience, ar.the glory of his character.
   Thus we have fellowship with the Father and the Son, by the Holy Ghost.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The places are holy, whereunto the Ark of God hath come. 2 Chron. viii.
   11.

   ON this account Solomon said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of
   David, king of Israel. What a fatal admission! She was the daughter of
   Pharaoh, and therefore it was no doubt considered a splendid match for
   the young king; and yet she could not dwell within the precincts of the
   old city of David, hallowed by the presence of the Ark. "He brought her
   out of the city of David, into the house that he had built for her." So
   from the very outset there was division of interests, making way no
   doubt for much of the waywardness of Solomon's character in after life,
   so that we are told "his wives turned away his heart."

   One of the first questions that youth and maiden should put in
   considering the question of marriage is, whether there can be perfect
   sympathy in the best and deepest things; for how can two walk together
   except they be agreed?

   The blessedness of the marriage tie depends on whether the twain are
   one in spirit, in a common love for Christ, and endeavour for his
   glory. Nothing is more terrible than when either admits in the secresy
   of the heart, concerning the other, My husband or my wife cannot
   accompany me into the holy places where I was reared, and in which my
   best life finds its home.

   All friendship should follow the same law. We must abide together in
   the secret place of the Most High, if our friends and we are to be
   friends indeed. All places may be made holy where the Ark of God's
   covenant comes. Where it goes, love may safely follow; but woe to the
   love that cannot! Its inability proves its lack of elements of
   permanence and perfect satisfaction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   She came to prove Solomon with hard questions. 2 Chron. ix. 1.

   SHE came to the right place, for Solomon passed all the kings of the
   earth in wisdom; and all the kings of the earth sought his presence, to
   hear the wisdom that God had put into his heart. Bring your hard
   questions to Christ; He is greater than Solomon. To Him is given riches
   and wisdom, and He is made unto us wisdom. Before the touch of his
   light the darkest perplexities must resolve themselves. Though He speak
   no audible word, the hardest questions are answered to the eyes and
   ears

   of such as wait before Him.

   She came in the right spirit, bringing him gold and spices and precious
   stones. Those who would get from Christ must be willing to give to Him.
   There must be a reciprocity; and if we hope to receive from Him from
   those infinite stores of which He has the key, we must count all things
   but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, and must be
   prepared to count them as refuse if only we may win Him.

   She came to a right conclusion. He answered all her questions, and she
   returned congratulating his servants and blessing God. To each of us
   life is full of perplexities, to which we can find no solution, however
   much we strain our eyes and weary our minds. But away there in the
   light Christ stands, with the perfect plan of every maze in his
   possession, with a key for every riddle, and solution for every enigma.
   Wait patiently. Each tough knot will be untied; and there will come
   into our hearts a radiancy, a bounding joy like that with which the
   Queen of Sheba turned to go to her own home. The half of the greatness
   of thy wisdom, Word of God can never be told!
     __________________________________________________________________

   For it was brought about of God. 2 Chron. x. 15 (R.V.).

   THIS revolt must have seemed to be the result of an unfortunate mistake
   on the part of the ill-advised young king. He and the young men that
   gathered around him thought that the best way of ruling people was by
   showing a strong hand, and adopting a policy of noncompliance with
   their very natural requests. But as the result, the Ten Tribes, never
   very closely bound to David's line, sprang away from it, leaving, as
   Ahijah had foretold, only two out of the twelve pieces of the rent
   garment. Here, however, a deeper explanation is given: "It was brought
   about of God." It seemed to be altogether a piece of human folly and
   passion; but now we are suddenly brought into the presence of God, and
   told that beneath the plottings and plannings of man He was carrying
   out his eternal purpose.

   To detect this Divine purpose lying beneath the cross-currents of human
   affairs is the prerogative of the saints. In a recent book, the Duke of
   Argyll has argued from the purpose-iveness of nature. With as much
   certainty we may apply that word to history, politics, the course of
   current events. All is under law. God doeth according to his will among
   the armies of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth. "And we know
   that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them
   who are the called according to his purpose." Without contravening the
   action of man's free choice He carries out his great designs and works
   his sovereign will. Lot us trust in this Almighty Providence, which
   underlies all events and catastrophes, and pursues its beneficent
   objects undeterred by our sins. He makes the wrath of man to praise
   Him, and weaves the malignant work of Satan into his plans.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to
   Jerusalem. 2 Chron. xi. 16.

   ALL the tribes were represented in those great convocations around the
   Temple and Ark of God. The territory of the northern tribes was now
   under Jeroboam; the gulf between the two kingdoms was marked and
   distinct. Everything was done by the son of Nebat to make it difficult
   for his people to cross the frontier; but their spiritual affinities
   prevailed. They were stronger than the antipathy which Rehoboam's
   haughty behaviour had excited; stronger than the fear of incurring
   odium with their own king; stronger than the inconvenience of the long
   journey. In spite of everything, those whose hearts were set on seeking
   the Lord God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the Lord God
   of their fathers.

   Does not this foreshadow the unity of the Church of Christ? Territorial
   distinctions, the risk of incur-ring disfavour, the necessity of making
   a sacrifice -- these things are as nothing compared with the attraction
   of our common Lord. Amid wide disunion and disparity of every kind,
   there is one mighty bond which draws believers of every nation,
   kindred, tribe, and people together. Each morning we all ascend the
   steps of the same temple of prayer; each evening we join in one great
   hymn of praise; at each Lord's Supper we sit at the same table. Eating
   of one Bread, we know that we are one Loaf; drinking of one Cup, we
   profess our indebtedness to the same precious Blood for our hope and
   ground of acceptance (1 Cor. x. 17, R.V., marg.).

   We must set our hearts, if we desire to execute any great purpose in
   our life: otherwise we shall be daunted and checkmated by the strong
   opposition of men and things.
     __________________________________________________________________

   He did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord. 2
   Chron. xii. 14.

   IN the margin of the A.V. for prepared the alternative rendering fixed
   is suggested. The R.V. gives set, "he set not his heart to seek the
   Lord." This is very true of all of us. Before temptation comes we
   almost always have a warning of some kind. The barometer falls; the sea
   birds come in to the shore; the leaves of the trees are bent back. The
   Spirit of God contrives to give the soul some signal that at any moment
   it may expect an assault. The question always is at such a time, Is the
   heart set on seeking and doing the will of God? If it be, if without
   reserve the whole nature is determined to do God's will at any cost,
   there is no fear of the enemy effecting an entrance. All day the
   thunder of its artillery may boom around, but from every side the foe
   will be repelled, until presently the storm will roll far down the
   wind.

   If, on the other hand, there is any vacillation; if, whilst ostensibly
   avowing our determination to do the right thing, we secretly whisper in
   our deepest consciousness that we intend to go as far as we can in
   self-indulgence, and would be almost thankful if circumstances
   compelled us to yield -- we are almost certain to fall. The will must
   be whole in its resolves; the heart must be consecrated in its most
   secret determinations; no traitor may be harboured, who may open the
   postern gate. Oh to say with David, "My heart is fixed, God, my heart
   is fixed"! But this steadfastness is one of those preparations of the
   heart which can only be obtained through the gracious indwelling of the
   Holy Spirit. Hence we pray with David, "Renew a steadfast spirit within
   me." And while we pray, we must never forget our Lord's command to
   watch also.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Behold, the battle was before and behind. 2 Chron. xiii. 14.

   ABIJAH'S address is full of true and noble utterances, especially when
   he describes God as being the Captain of the Host; and this spirit soon
   permeated his people, so that when the battle was sorest, and they were
   hemmed in by their foes, it was natural for them to turn to the Lord,
   and for the priests to give a blast on the trumpets, like that with
   which the new moon and the solemn feasts were inaugurated.

   The point for us to remember is that our enemies may shut us in on all
   sides, preventing reinforce-

   ments from north, south, east, and west; but no earthly power can ever
   shut off God from above us. The way upwards is always kept clear; the
   ladder which links the beleaguered soul with God and heaven can never
   be blocked, except by transgression and sin.

   The Priest is always with thee, child of God. His help is always at
   hand. Neither death, nor life, nor height, nor depth, nor
   principalities, nor powers, can ever separate thee from the down-coming
   of God's love.

   The battle is often before and behind. From behind come memories of
   past failure, the consequences of mistakes, the misunderstandings which
   have alienated us from others, and made it difficult for us to live as
   we would; on the other hand perplexities and anxieties seem to bar our
   future path. But when the battle is before and behind, remember that
   God besets his people behind and before, and covers them with his hand.
   The invisible film of his protection makes the soul invulnerable. The
   life that is hid with Christ in God is beyond the reach of harm.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lord, there is none beside Thee to help. 2 Chron. xiv. 11 (R.V.)

   REMIND God of his entire responsibility. -- "There is none beside thee
   to help." The odds against Asa were enormous. There were a million of
   men in arms against him, beside three hundred chariots. It seemed
   impossible to hold his own against that vast multitude. There were no
   allies who would come to his help: his only hope therefore was in God.
   There was none beside to help. It may be that your difficulties have
   been allowed to come to so alarming a pitch that you may be compelled
   to renounce all creature aid, to which in lesser trials you have had
   recourse, and cast yourself back on your Almighty Friend.

   Put God between yourself and the foe. -- To Asa's faith, Jehovah seemed
   to stand between the might of Zerah and himself, as one who had no
   strength. Nor was he mistaken. We are told that the Ethiopians were
   destroyed before the Lord and before his host, as though celestial
   combatants flung themselves against the foe in Israel's behalf, and put
   the large host to rout, so that Israel had only to follow up and gather
   the spoil. Our God is Jehovah of Hosts, who can summon unexpected
   reinforcements at any moment to the aid of his people. Believe that He
   is there between you and your difficulty, and what baffles you will
   flee before Him, as clouds before the gale.

   Identify your cause with his. -- "In thy name are we come. . . . . Let
   not man prevail against Thee." It is a great matter when a small State
   is so identified with a strong European power, as that an insult to one
   of its officials is deemed a casus belli by the more powerful
   Government; and whenever we are so delivered from selfish aims, as to
   be able to show that our cause and God's are one, we are invincible.
     __________________________________________________________________

   They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their fathers. 2
   Chron. xv. 12.

   WE hear but little talk in the present day of the covenant, the mention
   of which was dear to God's people of olden time. There is this
   difference between it and the covenants which we make with God. That is
   permanent, these evanescent. That is founded upon the oath and promise
   of God; these on the resolutions and endeavours of man. That is full of
   promises of what God will be and do; these recount what we are prepared
   to sacrifice and suffer. And though we sign them with blood drawn from
   our veins, they will disappoint and fail.

   Do not think too much of entering into and keeping a covenant with God;
   but remember that the Lord Jesus, on our behalf, has entered into
   covenant relation with the Father, and the Father with us in Him. This
   is the new covenant. It is drawn out at length in Hebrews viii. Very
   little is said about our side, but it is full to overflowing of God's.
   Nothing is said of our fidelity to our obligations, because man has
   been too often weighed in the balances and found wanting; and because
   the Lord Jesus Christ, as our representative, has already fulfilled all
   the conditions of obedience and devotion on which its provisions
   depend. He has also graciously undertaken to realize those conditions
   by the Holy Spirit in us.

   Every time we put to our lips the cup of the new covenant, we humbly
   remind God of all He has promised, and ask Him to do as He has said. At
   the same time we may confidently ask the great Surety of the covenant
   to accomplish in us such a mind as may love and keep our Father's law.
   And what He did for our fathers, who were naturally just such as we
   are, He will certainly do for us.

   To show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect
   toward him. 2 Chron. xvi. 9.

   THE emphasis is clearly on the word perfect. That was the point between
   Hanani the seer and Asa the king. Asa's mistake and sin lay in his
   resorting to Benhadad, king of Syria, as an ally against Baasha.
   Evidently he did not perfectly trust the delivering power of God; and
   in this failure of his faith, he forfeited the all-sufficient help
   which would have more than availed. As the seer said very truly, simple
   trust in God had brought deliverance from the Ethiopians and Lubim,
   though they were a much huger host than Baasha's; and the same attitude
   in respect of Baasha would have secured a like result. God was only
   awaiting the appeal of Asa's faith, to show Himself strong. What a
   mistake to send to Syria!

   Now, dear reader, this is very pertinent for your life and mine. We
   often complain that we are bereft of help, and send off for Benhadad.
   And all the while the eyes of the Lord are looking pitifully and
   longingly at us. Nothing would give Him greater pleasure than to show
   Himself strong on our behalf. This, however, He cannot do until
   renouncing all other confidants and helpers, our heart is perfect in
   the simplicity and frankness of its faith. What an exquisite thought is
   suggested by the allusion to the eyes of the Lord running to and fro
   throughout the whole earth! At a glance He takes in our position; not a
   sorrow, trial, or temptation visits us without exciting his notice and
   loving sympathy. In all the whole wide earth there is not one spot so
   lonely, one heart so darkened, as to escape those eyes. Oh for the
   perfect confidence which will allow Him to act! It is for lack of this
   that we remain unhelped, and spend our days in the midst of wars and
   tumults.

   His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord. 2 Chron. xvii. 6.

   SURSUM corda! Lift up your hearts! How beautiful is this ejaculation in
   the Communion Service of the Church of England, and the response, "We
   lift them up unto the Lord." I never hear it without the thrill of a
   holy impulse passing through me. It is possible, and it is meet and
   right, to lift up our hearts from the sordid cares and pressing
   responsibilities of daily life, into the calm, serene presence of God
   our Father.

   Lift up your heart to God, as a child its face to be kissed. Lift it up
   free from mistrust and sinful stain, and unkind feeling towards any.
   Lift it up in holy joy and inspiration. Lift it up as a censer filled
   with the hot coals, from which sweet fragrance exhales. And God will
   bend down to lift it higher, and fill it with his peace and joy and
   purity.

   In hours of depression look up, be lifted. Sursum corda! When the foe
   is pressing you most severely, look up, your redemption draweth nigh.
   When the river has to be crossed, when the last farewell must be said,
   when the flesh fails, let your mind and heart thither ascend, and there
   continually dwell where Jesus has entered as your Forerunner.

   If you would lift up your heart, you must be in the ways of the Lord,
   as the good Jehoshaphat. You must seek the Lord God, and walk in his
   commandments. You must take away the high places and groves of idolatry
   and impurity. Beware of the world's birdlime! Shake yourself from the
   bands and bonds that would detain you. Oh, heart of mine, why is thy
   flight so low? Lift thyself up and sit down with Christ in the heavenly
   places! "Unto Thee, Lord, do I lift up my soul. Let not mine enemies
   triumph over me!"

   I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil. 2
   Chron. xviii. 7.

   THIS was a very naive confession. Of course, Micaiah could not speak
   good of Ahab, whose life was diametrically opposed to all that was
   God-like and holy. Micaiah had no animosity towards the king of lsrael;
   it was not a personal matter with him. He simply read from the page of
   the future as God opened it to his eyes, and in which the out-working
   of the king's evil life was disclosed in gloomy characters. It was as
   absurd to hate him because he read such dark lessons from the
   inevitable future, as for a householder to shoot his dog, that bays all
   night, to warn his master against the burglar engaged in rifling his
   home.

   The Bible, the pastor, the whole Church of God, are hated by worldlings
   for the same reason, because they cannot speak hopefully of their
   future. It is as though a card-playing crew were to hate the watchman
   who told them that the course of their vessel was straight for the surf
   and rocks of the shore. If men will persist in violating God's law, in
   breaking through the hedge of thorns, and in pursuing their own wild
   ways, they cannot possibly expect the blessedness of the Beatitudes.
   However, their hatred against those who warn them is really directed
   towards God. They are indignant that they cannot have their way; their
   proud spirit would like to overturn the very order of the universe
   rather than that it should be thwarted. They cannot endure the contrast
   between God's children and themselves. Do not be surprised if the world
   hate you. It shows that you are no more of the world than your Master
   was. Jesus said: "If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute
   you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? 2
   Chron. xix. 2.

   THIS looks back to xviii. 1, where we learn that Jehoshaphat, though he
   had riches and honour in abundance, joined affinity with Ahab. Riches
   and abundance are dangerous things. They usually weaken our character,
   and incline us to worldly alliances; and it was to their subtle and
   pernicious influences that Jehoshaphat fell a victim. Ah! what a fall
   it was to hear him saying, "I am as thou art, and my people as thy
   people." Well might Jehu take up the role which his father had filled
   before Asa, and protest. But let us seriously question whether, though
   there are good things found in us, we may not be falling into the same
   mistake, and sin. Are there not ways in which we say to men of the
   world, with whom we mix, "I am as thou art "?

   There is a great tendency in the present day to boast in the closeness
   with which we can approach the world without injury. We join in the
   social life, read the same books, go to the same amusements, talk of
   the same themes; and it is almost impossible in a drawing-room to tell
   the difference between the Jehoshaphats and the Ahabs. So also, in our
   methods of doing good. The real difficulty lies away back in our want
   of engagedness with Christ. It is of little use to find fault with the
   outward, as long as the heart is wayward. Love to the Lord Jesus is our
   only safeguard. The love of Christ must constrain us. Personal
   attachment to Christ will wean us away from this close identification
   with the world. But if we persist in identifying ourselves with the
   world, which God has doomed, we must not be surprised to find that
   wrath is on us from the Lord: and He will chasten us for love's sake.

   He appointed singers unto the Lord, that should praise the beauty of
   holiness. 2 Chron. xx. 21.

   DOST thou praise the beauty of holiness? Is holiness beautiful to thee?
   Art thou in love with it as it is presented in the glorious Lord? Canst
   thou turn from the noise and anxiety of life's battle to dwell on the
   loveliness of God and of the devout life, and to praise Him whose mercy
   endureth for ever? It is a rare accomplishment, acquired only through
   the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. In each of us there should be the
   priest-side of character as well as the warrior: the love for what is
   beautiful in holiness as well as for the strong and active in service.

   But the special characteristic of this battle was that the good king
   put the singers in the forefront of the army, and praised for a victory
   which was only assured to him by faith. Yet so sure was he of it, that
   he could praise before he entered into the battle.

   There is much to help us here in our daily combat for God and truth.
   Let us fill the morning hour with holy song, in the heart, if not with
   the voice; let a psalm or hymn be part of the daily reading; let there
   be the confidence that God is going to bless, which cannot restrain its
   jubilant expression. So in all prayer, wait on God till you feel that
   you can praise Him for what you have asked Him to bestow.

   When they began to praise, the Lord did all the rest. Before the onset
   of his Divine reinforcements the enemy fled. His people had but to
   gather spoil, and then the praise which had anticipated the battle was
   consummated as they returned, in the valley of blessing.

   'There's a song in the valley of blessing so sweet,

   And angels would fain join the strain,

   As with rapturous praises we bow at his feet,

   Crying. 'Worthy the Lamb that was slain!'
     __________________________________________________________________

   The same time also did Libnah rebuild from under his hand. 2 Chron.
   xxi. 10.

   AS long as the kings of Judah remained true to their allegiance to God
   they were able to keep in subjection the surrounding nations; but just
   so soon as they revolted from God these peoples revolted from them. It
   was as though power descended into them from the source of all power;
   and when the link between themselves and God was broken, that between
   them and their subordinates was broken also.

   This applies very widely: To our passions. -- If they master you,
   rebelling against and revolting from your hand, it is because there is
   some flaw in your consecration, and you have forsaken to some extent
   the Lord God.

   To our families. -- When the heads of a home are in perfect unity with
   each other and God, they may generally expect that their children will
   grow up submissive and obedient. Their authority will be recognised and
   honoured. Revolt in the home indicates very often some lapse in
   obedience and loyalty to God.

   To our influence over men. -- When the soul is in blessed fellowship
   with God, power flows into it from Him, before which strongholds are
   overthrown. "I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord," said the
   prophet. "I am a man under authority, and have soldiers under me," said
   the centurion.

   Give yourself entirely to Jesus. Obey Him absolutely; receive by faith
   from Him living power and grace; be a channel through which He may pour
   Himself; and you will find that men and things will fall into line at
   your bidding, and you shall receive power. Our Libnahs will not revolt
   unless we forsake the Lord God of our fathers.

   Hid in the House of God. 2 Chron. xxii. 12.

   SAFE from Athaliah, who would have ruthlessly destroyed him if she had
   had an inkling of his existence, the Young Joash was reared beneath the
   care of Jehoiada and his wife within the precincts of the house of God.
   He was hidden in the secret place of the Most High, and abode under the
   shadow of the Almighty. There let us also live. Let us know what it is
   to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of our life, and all
   this day. Let us cultivate the life which is hid with Christ in God.

   It is well often to remind ourselves that we are in God, and that the
   film of his environing presence is about us like a wall of thick-ribbed
   steel. We are in Him as the jewel in the casket; as the chick under the
   feathers of the hen; as the child in the warm embrace of its mother.
   And so long as we stay there we are invulnerable. Therefore our great
   enemy is continually endeavouring to allure us into the open; he knows
   he can do as he likes with us, if only he can induce us to venture
   beyond our hiding-place. Therefore, beware of any temptation to worry,
   to amass this world's goods, or to seek the indulgence of appetite; it
   is by such lures and baits that Satan seduces unwary souls from their
   safe hiding.

   If a day in God's courts is better than a thousand, what must it be to
   dwell in the house of the Lord all one's days, to behold his beauty,
   and enquire in his temple. The rarest visions, the fairest fellowship,
   the most entrancing joys, the most confident outlook on life, and the
   hereafter, are the accompaniments of such a residence. The altar of
   incense, the laver of dairy cleansing, the light of the Shekinah, the
   holy psalm and song, the great altar of sacrifice, are familiar objects
   to the hidden soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And the city was quiet after they had slain Athaliah with the sword. 2
   Chron. xxiii. 21.

   THIS was a great revolution, admirably planned and carried into effect.
   It was intolerable that such a woman as Athaliah should desecrate the
   throne and temple. Jehoiada, by his prudence and courage, deserved well
   of the entire nation in ridding the world of her presence. No half
   measures would have availed to meet the case.

   There are times in every life when strong and strenuous action is
   inevitable if the cause of God is to be promoted and saved. In many of
   us there is a willingness to tolerate evil, rather than arouse
   ourselves to grasp it with a firm hand, and, if needs be, drag it up by
   its roots. Be strong, yea, be strong, is an injunction that has to be
   emphasized even to men who are greatly beloved. The easiest thing for
   Jehoiada would have been to shut himself up in the temple, and leave
   things to take their course. The noblest thing was to come forth, and
   boldly confront the rampant evil of his time. So God's call rings out
   for helpers in the great fight against sin. Its notes penetrate into
   the retirement of Christian homes, to noble women and devoted men,
   demanding that they should come forth to resist impurity, the love of
   strong drink, the strong tendency towards extravagance, luxury, and
   waste. The world is full of Athaliahs, and it is not befitting that the
   Jehoiadas should remain at their holy rites and services if there is a
   paramount need for action in the world's battlefield, in the strife
   against wrong.

   The children of God are citizens of the New Jerusalem, but they are
   also certainly citizens here; and they must not stand aside from great
   public issues, allowing them to be decided by ungodly and wicked men.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Spirit of God clothed itself with Zechariah the son of Jehoiada. 2
   Chron. xxiv. 20 (R. V., marg.).

   AS we put on a cloak or dress, so does the Spirit of God, as it were,
   hide Himself in those who surrender themselves to Him, so that it is
   not they who speak and act, but He within them. Have you at any time
   been conscious of having become the clothing of the Holy Spirit?
   Remember that cloth or leather must yield itself easily to the
   movements of its wearer, and not less pliable and supple must we be to
   the Spirit of God.

   When the Spirit of God is thus within us, and speaks or acts for us, we
   may expect, as Zechariah found it, to come into collision with the
   entire drift and current of society around us, and to incur odium and
   hatred. Men do not like to be told that they cannot prosper because
   they have forsaken God; but we have no alternative than to witness
   against their sins. Does the Spirit clothe Himself with you my friend,
   as you anticipate the work of to-day? Are you using Him, or is He to
   use you? Are you seeking to clothe yourself with his power for some
   personal ambition, or are you desirous that He should array Himself in
   you, so that the glory may evidently be his? In the agony of battle,
   when great deeds are to be done, no one stops to think of the uniform
   of the soldier, but only of the might beneath it.

   But for this you must be prepared to pay the cost, and be willing to
   cross the cherished purposes of men, as the Spirit of God by your voice
   or deed witnesses against them. They stoned Zechariah at the command of
   the king; but years after the Lord Jesus referred to it, for no
   faithful martyr seals his witness with his blood without some quick
   glance of recognition from the Master, and some record on the
   imperishable tablets of his heart.

   The Lord ia able to give thee much more than this. 2 Chron. xxv. 9.

   AMAZIAH had many good qualities, but he did not clearly see how
   impossible it was for Israel to be allied with Judah without
   invalidating the special Divine protection and care on which Judah had
   been taught to rely. We must understand that God cannot be in
   fellowship with us if we tolerate fellowship with the ungodly. We must
   choose between the two. If we can renounce all creature aid, and trust
   simply in the eternal God, there is no limit to the victories He will
   secure; but if, turning from Him, we hold out our hand toward the
   world, we forfeit his aid. child of God, let not the army of Israel go
   with thee! Do not adopt worldly policy, methods, or partnership.
   However strong you make yourself for the battle in alliance with these,
   you will fail. Indeed, God Himself will make you fall before the enemy,
   that you may be driven back to Himself.

   But you say that you have already entered into so close an alliance
   that you cannot draw back. You have invested your capital, you have
   gone to great expenditures Yet it will be better to forfeit these than
   Him. Without these aids, and with only God beside you, you will be able
   to rout Edom, and smite ten thousand men. Would that men knew the
   absolute deliverance which God will effect for those whose hearts are
   perfect towards Him!

   The soldiers of Israel committed depredations on their way back. This
   was the result of the folly and sin of Amaziah's proposal. We may be
   forgiven, and delivered, and yet there will be afterconsequences which
   will follow us from some ill-considered act. Sin may be forgiven, but
   its secondary results are sometimes very bitter. We must expect to reap
   as we sow.

   He was marvellously helped, till he was strong. 2 Chron. xxvi. 15, 16.

   GREAT and marvellous are thy works, God; that our soul knoweth quite
   well. Thou hast showed marvellous loving-kindness. We must sing to
   Thee; for Thou hast done marvellous things. lt is marvelous that Thou
   shouldst have set thy love upon us; that Thou shouldst have watched
   over our interests with unwearied care; that our sins, or unbelief, or
   declensions, have never diverted thy love from us. "Marvellous " is the
   only word we can use, as we think of the condescension of the
   well-beloved Son to the manger-bed; of the agony and bloody-sweat; of
   the cross and passion -- and all for us who were his enemies. But it is
   most marvellous of all that Thou least made us children, heirs, arid
   joint-heirs with Christ. To think that we shall shine as the sun in thy
   kingdom, that we are to sit upon his throne, and be included in that
   circle of love and life of which the throne of God and the Lamb is the
   centre! Surely the marvels of thy grace will only seem the greater when
   eternity with its boundless ages gives us time to explore them.

   The danger, however, is that we should become strong in our own
   conceit, and credit ourselves with the position which is due to the
   grace of God alone. Oh for the truly humble spirit of the little child,
   that we may never vaunt ourselves! The laden ship sinks in the water;
   the fruit-burdened bough stoops to the ground; the truest scientist is
   the humblest disciple. Oh to be submerged and abashed for the
   marvellous help of God!

   God cannot trust some of us with prosperity and success, because our
   nature could not stand them. We must tug at the oar, instead of
   spreading the sail, because we have not enough ballast.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jotham became mighty, because he ordered his ways. 2 Chron. xxvii. 6
   (R.V.).

   THERE is a lower sense in which this holds good in daily and business
   life. You can hardly imagine a really successful man being untidy and
   disorderly. Method is the law of success; and a truly holy soul is sure
   to be orderly. I do not remember ever meeting one who really walked
   with God who did not make orderliness one of the first principles of
   life.

   The Lord Jesus would have the men sit down in rows before He broke the
   bread; and He wrapt together his grave-clothes before He left the
   sepulchre. It was, therefore, in keeping with the whole tenor of his
   example when the apostle prescribed that all things should be done
   decently and in order.

   Clear handwriting, especially the direction of an envelope, to give the
   postman as little trouble as possible; the careful folding of our
   cast-off garments, to save the maids needless work; the leaving our
   room that we have been occupying as little disturbed in its
   arrangements as may be; the gathering up of luncheon fragments from the
   green banks, where we have sat to view the entrancing prospect; the
   arrangement of papers, and accounts, and magazines, so that we can
   readily lay our hand upon whatever is required; the adopting of mental
   order in prayer and conversation, and in the thinking out of plans and
   purposes; neatness in dress -- these are all part of the right ordering
   of life which makes for its success and comfort, and greatly for peace
   in the home. They are the habits of the soul that walks before God, and
   which is accustomed to think of Him as seeing in secret, and as
   considering all our ways. In this way we may become mighty, and by
   being faithful in that which is least come to great charges.

   They clothed all that were naked, and gave them to eat and drink. 2
   Chron. xxviii. 15.

   A GREAT burst of generosity was here, for Israel had every reason to be
   incensed against Judah for the raid made on their territory. But,
   instead of pushing their advantage to the uttermost, they returned good
   for evil, and anticipated the words of the apostle, "If thine enemy
   hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou
   shalt heap coals of fire on his head."

   Have you in your life people who have done you injury, and against whom
   you entertain hard thoughts? You do not injure them in return, but you
   cannot pray for them. So far as you can, you avoid them; you make no
   attempt to overcome the evil that is in them. But to act thus is to
   come short of Christ's standard. It is your duty, not merely to keep at
   a distance and give a wide berth, but by love to destroy the evil, to
   transform the enemy into a friend, and to create love and friendship
   where hostility and alienation had reigned. It is God's way, and in
   this we are bidden to be perfect, as our Heavenly Father is perfect.

   Will you try it? Will you begin by doing kind acts to those who have
   harmed you? Not because as yet you feel as you would, but because it is
   right. Then as you dig the trench in right doing, look up to God, and
   He will pour into your heart the warm gush of affection. If you
   sincerely will his will in this matter, and act as the Good Samaritan
   did to the Jew, and exercise faith, God will came to your aid whilst
   you clothe others and minister to them, you will find their hard heart
   melted, and yourselves clothed with the beautiful garments of
   salvation, and of a meek and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is of
   great price.

   When the burnt-offering began, the song of the Lord began also. 2
   Chron. xxix. 27.

   THIS chapter contains a parable of the cleansing of the heart, meant to
   be a temple for God; but the doors of prayer are unopened, the lamps of
   testimony unlit, the burnt-offerings of self-sacrifice neglected ; and,
   as the result, grass grows thick in courts which should have been
   trodden by the feet of Levite minstrels engaged in holy song. If ever
   that song is to break out again, it can only be after a thorough
   cleansing and renovation of the inner shrine. You tell me that you
   cannot sing the Lord's song; then I know you have gone into the strange
   land of backsliding. You acknowledge that for some time now you have
   taken no delight in God or his service; then I am sure that the temple
   is badly in need of renovation.

   Cleanse the house of the Lord. Bring out all the uncleanness. By
   self-examination, confession, and repudiation, be clean of all the
   filth which has accumulated through months and years of neglect. Resume
   the position of entire devotion, as a prepared and sanctified soul.
   Offer the sin-offering for the past, and prepare the burnt-offering of
   entire consecration for the future. And when that is offered, when you
   determine to be wholly God's, lay yourself, with all the interests of
   your life, at the feet of Jesus, for his disposal; then the song of the
   Lord will begin again.

   The music of your life is still, because you are out of accord with the
   will of God; but when by surrender and consecration there is unison,
   your heart will be filled with songs without words, and love like an
   ocean in the fulness of her strength. When tie rich, selfish bachelor
   suddenly finds himself compelled to care for his dead brother's little
   children, he is startled to find that a new song has begun in his life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to seek God. 2
   Chron. xxx. 18, 19.

   A VERY touching prayer, that opens up deep thoughts as to the progress
   of the true knowledge of God in Israel, and of the comparative value of
   heart preparation and ceremonial cleansing. Here were crowds of
   well-meaning people who had come from all parts of the land in answer
   to Hezekiah's invitation. Unaccustomed to temple usage, strangers to
   the temple rites, they had participated in the festivities of this
   great Passover without submitting first to the necessary ablutions.
   Their heart was prepared to seek God, they were proud of the great
   past, they desired to stand right with the Lord God of their fathers;
   but they were sadly ignorant and careless. The only thing to be done
   was to pray that their ignorances and negligences might be forgiven.

   It is thus that Jesus pleads in heaven; and there are many that obtain
   mercy on the ground of his merit, because when they sin they do so
   ignorantly, and from want of knowledge rather than from want of heart.
   The devout ritualist who lays an excessive stress on outward forms; the
   man who has sensuous and distorted views of Christ, but sincerely
   desires to be accepted through Him; the soul that touches the hem of
   the garment as though the healing power were independent of the
   will-power of the Redeemer; the dying malefactor, who, in his last
   hours, catches at some distorted representation of Christ which is
   filtered through to him from the chance word of an uninstructed
   preacher -- these are included in the fruitful pleading of the Great
   High Priest, who has compassion on the ignorant and on those who are
   out of the way. You may not understand doctrine, creed, or rite;but be
   sure to seek God. No splendid ceremonial nor rigorous etiquette can
   intercept the seeking soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   He did it with all his heart and prospered. 2 Chron. xxxi. 21.

   THE man who does his business with all his heart, is sure to prosper.
   To put your heart into your work is like genius manipulating common
   materials, till their worth becomes priceless, just because of what has
   been put into it.

   The heart stands for the emotions and affections. What the furnace is
   to the factory or steamship, that the heart is in the economy of our
   nature. It is a great thing to love our life-work, to have an aim that
   kindles us whenever we think of it. Those who are so happily
   circumstanced, cannot be sufficiently thankful. But what of those who
   are bound to a work which they did not choose and do not like, who find
   their daily toil irksome and distasteful -- is there any help for them?
   Can they possibly learn to do such work from their hearts? Certainly:
   because of Him who set it, and for whom it may be done.

   Love performs the most onerous duties with all its heart, if they
   conduce to the comfort and help of those whom it loves more than
   itself. Does not a mother or wife perform tasks from which the hireling
   would shrink? She does them with all her heart, not considering for a
   moment the loathesomeness and hardness of the demand. So if we look at
   our life-work as God-appointed; if we realize that He has fixed it for
   us, who determined the orbits of the stars; if we can hear the voice of
   Jesus saying, "Do this for Me " -- there is no further thought of
   hardship or distaste. Remember to do all your life-work for Jesus; do
   all in his name and for his glory; ask Him to fill your heart with
   submissive, loyal obedience, and you will find that when you introduce
   the personal element of Christ-service into the meanest acts, they will
   glisten like a piece of gold-tapestry.

   Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah, prayed and cryed to heaven.
   2 Chron. xxxii. 20.

   IT was the indignity done to Jehovah that stirred these two holy men to
   the heart. Not that their lives, and the lives of their people, and the
   beautiful holy city, were in danger; but that Sennacherib spake against
   the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth,
   which were the work of the hands of man. Oh that we were possessed with
   a similar zeal for God, so that we might look at sin as it affects Him,
   and lament over the awful wrongs which are continually being
   perpetrated against his holy, loving nature! What an argument this
   would give us in prayer!

   This constitutes a special reason why we should plead for a revival of
   religion throughout our land. Men speak and act so shamelessly, as
   though God had abdicated his throne, and was hardly to be taken account
   of. They sin against Him with so high a hand, and treat his laws with
   so much contumely. Are there no Hezekiahs and Isaiahs who will pray and
   cry to the God of our fathers to do again the great works He did in
   their days, and in the old time before?

   Then the Lord would save us, and guide us on every side (22). There
   never was a more conspicuous and glorious deliverance than when the
   angel of God wrought for Israel against Assyria. The Lord became a
   place of broad rivers and streams across which the enemy could not
   pass. As the mother bird settling down on her nest, He covered the city
   with his outspread wings. And the rich spoils of the foe were left for
   the beleagured garrison. Pray on, beloved; the Lord is our Judge, the
   Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King ; He will save us.

   When he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God. 2 Chron.
   xxxiii. 12.

   SO long as this story stands on the page of revelation, no sinner need
   despair of mercy. There was hardly a sin possible to man that Manasseh
   did not commit. "He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,
   like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord had cast out
   before the children of Israel." And he made his people do worse than
   the heathen.

   Then came awful sorrow. Bound in fetters, exposed to consummate cruelty
   and disgrace, he was carried to Babylon, and thrust into the dungeons,
   where other captive princes were immured, with little chance of
   liberation or permission to revisit his native land. But there the
   Spirit of God did his work. He humbled himself greatly, and prayed.
   What tears, and cries, and bursts of heart-broken penitence, were his!
   How those walls were saturated with the breath of confession, and those
   stone floors indented by his kneeling at perpetual prayer! And God came
   near to his low dungeon, and graciously heard his supplication, and
   brought him back again.

   Yes, and He will do as much for you. The blood of jesus Christ his Son
   cleanseth from all sin; the grace of God is exceedingly abundant with
   faith and love; all sins and blasphemies may be forgiven to the sons of
   men. Turn to Him with brokenness of soul, and He will not only forgive,
   but bring you again; and give you, as He did Manasseh, an opportunity
   of undoing some of those evil things which have marred your past. For
   the rest, it is good not to wait for affliction to stir us up to seek
   God, but to abide in Him for love's dear bake.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. 2 Chron.
   xxxiv. 15, 18.

   IT is supposed that this was the Book of Deuteronomy; though we have no
   sympathy whatever with a modern notion with respect to its discovery.
   In our judgment that book is rightly ascribed to Moses. Apparently,
   however, it had long been missing, and the young king was filled with
   horror when he heard the list of evils that were associated with
   apostasy. "He rent his clothes."

   We should read the Bible with a particular application to the days in
   which we live. It is well enough to accept its statements as being
   generally true and credible; but it is better to realize their
   pertinence to ourselves and our circumstances. The book of the law had
   been sadly neglected in the years preceding Josiah's accession; and
   through the neglect of God's Word the people had become indifferent to
   his commands, and deaf to the appeals of his prophets. Josiah turned
   the lantern on the evils of his time, and saw how God was feeling with
   respect to them.

   The Bible is a book for all time. What it said, it says. What it was,
   it is. You tell me it was written so many centuries ago; but I reply
   the ink is still wet on its immortal pages. They have been read and
   pondered by generations; but the light of its eye is not dim, nor its
   natural force abated. Sin is the same, man the same, God the same, in
   all ages. And the Bible's claim to be God's Word is substantiated by
   the fact that it is possessed of living power, and of the same
   perennial freshness as the sun, or the spring, or the ocean, or the
   faces of the little children. Would that we might daily read it as we
   read the newspaper, damp from the press, realizing that it is our
   Father's great message for the life of every day!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Prepare. 2 Chron. xxxv. 4, 6, 10, 14, 15, 16.

   NO great court function can be carried through successfully, without
   careful preparation. And Josiah's passover was so vast and rare a
   success because of the large amount of previous preparation, as is
   described in this chapter. The priests and Levites were prepared by
   careful washings and ceremonial rites. The course of the sacrifices was
   ordered according to the law of Moses. The routine of sacred song and
   praise was also provided for. Nothing was left to haphazard or chance.

   We are taught to rely on the promptings and inspirations of the Holy
   Spirit; and it is certain that He would use us more on special errands,
   if we were to trust and obey Him better. But these extraordinary
   ministries should not lead us to a life of haphazard. We should prepare
   ourselves for service so far as we may, laying our plans, anticipating
   the calls and exigencies of coming days, and preparing for the demand
   which almost certainly will be made on us. We may have to give our
   special words and addresses and arrangements to the winds; but we shall
   always need that preparedness of heart which is necessary for those who
   are to be used of God.

   Remember what is said of the vessels that were purged from uncleanness,
   sanctified, meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good
   work. Be always in your own place, clean so far as you can be, filled
   with the Holy Ghost, with the handle of your life turned towards the
   Master's hand, that at any moment He may take hold of you, and use you
   for his holy service. By the diligent study of his Word, as well as by
   earnest prayer and waiting upon God, on will be prepared to do his
   will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Rising up betimes. 2 Chron. xxxvi. 15.

   WHAT a touching and graphic phrase! How did God yearn over that sinful
   and rebellious city! Sending his messengers, "rising up betimes, and
   sending " -- like a man who has had a sleepless night of anxiety for
   his friend or child, and rises with the dawn to send a servant on a
   mission of inquiry, or a message of love. How eager God is for men's
   salvation!

   From God's eagerness, may we not learn a lesson of anxiety for the
   souls of men? We do not long after them enough, or rise betimes to urge
   them to repent. Did we realize what heaven is, or hell, what men are
   missing or incurring, what our duty is, as saved ourselves, we should
   rise up betimes to seek their eternal interests.

   But if God rises betimes to seek men, should they not do the same to
   seek Him? Think you not, that when Adam heard the voice of the Lord God
   walking in the garden at morning prime, he would be up and away to meet
   Him on the upland lawns of Paradise? Can we wonder that our Master
   would rise up a great while before day, to meet his Father on some
   unfrequented height? Let us not cling to beds of sloth when God is
   awaiting us; let us heed his loving remonstrances, that we may be saved
   in the overthrow of the world; and let us, like Lot, pass on the word
   to others enwrapt in fatal slumber around us, bidding them to escape to
   the mountains, before the sun rise on the earth, lest they be consumed.

   It was the practice of Sir Henry Havelock, during his campaigns in
   India, always to have two hours for prayer and Bible study before the
   march. If the camp was struck at 6.0 a.m., he would rise at 4. O.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus. Ezra i. 1.

   THERE were many rays focussed on this spot. In the first place, it bad
   been definitely foretold by Jeremiah that the captivity would only last
   for seventy years. In the next place, Daniel, having learned from
   comparison of dates that the allotted time had nearly expired, had set
   himself to pray. Also, if Josephus be credited, the aged prophet had
   shown the young king the predictions of Isaiah in which his own name
   was clearly mentioned: "Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus,
   whose right hand I have holden: . . . he shall build my city, and he
   shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the Lord of
   hosts" (Isa. xlv. 1, 13).

   God is the fountainhead and source of all spiritual blessing, and of
   all those great movements for the uplifting and enlightenment of
   mankind which have swept from time to time over the world. Go to Him
   when you want to reach the heart of kings, prophets, and people. Oh for
   the faith of Samuel, Elijah, Daniel, and other stalwart men of God,
   that through Him we may stir up the spirits of those who will not
   listen to our appeals! For the fervent prayer of a righteous man still
   availeth much. In prayer you can touch the spring of all the stirrings
   that the world needs.

   But it is not enough for God to stir men, they must obey. It appears
   that only a comparatively small number of captive Jews obeyed the
   Divine stirring and came out of Babylon with the chief of the fathers.
   The call resounds for volunteers, but only a few respond; the
   inspiration breathes over us, but only some are susceptible to it. God
   works to will and to do, but only certain of the children of men work
   out what He works in. Whenever there is a Divine stirring abroad, let
   us rise up and go.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummin. Ezra ii. 63.

   IT must have been a great disappointment to these people who found
   themselves excluded from sharing as priests. Their names were not on
   the register, and so they had to wait until a properly-qualified
   authority could adjudicate their case. The mere inference of reason was
   not enough; they needed the direct corroboration of the anointed priest
   with Urim and with Thummim.

   So in our life it is not enough to rely on the inference of reason, or
   to allow our Christian standing to be determined by the evidence of a
   document. We must seek the direct witness and testimony of the Holy
   Spirit. How many Christians there are who have no experimental
   knowledge of what the Apostle meant when he said that the Spirit
   witnesseth with our spirit that we are born again. They are always
   referring to inference, and the testimony of others; and therefore
   their consciousness varies, and they cannot eat of the holy bread of
   God. But when the Spirit of God speaks through the Urim and Thummim,
   and certifies that we are the children of God, giving us the white
   stone with its new name, and revealing Christ as dwelling within us, we
   have, immediately, boldness to enter into the holiest of all, and eat
   of the holy things.

   Assurance is needful before we dare to appropriate the things which are
   freely given to us of God. Who of us is not able to verify this from
   his personal experience? We could not enjoy the Father's table, so long
   as there was a doubt about our sonship. But the assurance of faith may
   be ours as we wait in the presence of our great High Priest, speaking
   to us by the Holy Spirit, who witnesses with our spirits that we are
   the children of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And they set the alter upon its bases. Ezra iii. 3.

   THIS is the first thing that must be done before our temple-building or
   other undertakings can be crowned with success. It was well that the
   returned remnant made this their care; it augured well for their
   future. The new start that God Himself was giving would have been
   invalidated without that altar, which meant forgiveness for the past,
   and renewed consecration for the future.

   Where is the altar in your life? Where the burnt sacrifice which
   betokens entire surrender of consecration? It cannot be too often
   insisted on, that since Christ died for all, all died in Him. We were
   not only saved by his death, we were included in it, but we must
   appropriate and identify ourselves with it. We must look up to God and
   say, "I desire that this death should be mine, to the world, to sin, to
   the flesh; make it so by the power of the Holy Ghost, that in Jesus I
   may be truly dead unto sin, but alive unto Thee."

   Perhaps that last clause will help some souls most. Do not perpetually
   dwell on the dying side, but think much of the living side. Yield
   yourselves to receive God's life, which is the life of the Son of God
   in the surrendered nature. Be very sensitive, and "quick of scent," to
   every movement and prompting of the Holy Spirit. Seek the things which
   are above, where Christ, your life, is seated. So you will find your
   energy drained away from self to Christ. Because He lives you will live
   also. A maple tree planted on a barren soil sent out one of its
   rootlets to a richer patch not far away, and ulti mately all its
   roothold was there, till finally it was bodily moved and transferred
   from its first position to this more salubrious one.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Let us build with you. Ezra iv. 2.

   AT first the world does its best to intimidate the Church; then it asks
   to be permitted to join with it. A most subtle temptation this. The
   child of God is greatly inclined to yield; the proposal seems so
   harmless, and so likely to be a means of blessing to the poor, hungry,
   weary world. But there is only one condition on which the world may be
   admitted; it must yield a true and humble submission to the cross, and
   be willing to give up all for Jesus -- conditions which the world will
   not consider for a moment; and so its heart is filled with bitterness
   and gall, and it sets itself to hinder where it had professed
   willingness to help.

   There are five things of which we are expressly bidden to beware --
   they are five phases of an unequal yoke: fellowship with
   unrighteousness; communion with darkness; concord with Belial; part
   with an unbeliever; agreement with idols. Let us beware of these
   things, and cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and
   spirit. There may seem to be great loss and needless sacrifice in
   dispensing with the help of Rehum and Shimshai; but if once we accepted
   their help, we should discover to our cost that they were adversaries
   still, and that their only desire was to retard our efforts.

   We sometimes shrink from some great undertaking for God, and are
   inclined to accept the proffered aid of wealthy but ungodly men. But
   their help may be purchased by the cost of all that makes our work
   worth doing. "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for
   what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?"

   "Yea, with one mouth, world, though thou deniest

   Stand thou on that side, for on this am I."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews. Ezra v. 5.

   IT was a delightful thought amid obloquy and opposition, like that
   which the Jews were at this moment encountering, to know that God was
   watching them with jealous care. We are reminded of the words of the
   Psalmist, quoted and authenticated by the Apostle Peter, "The eyes of
   the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry;
   but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil." And he goes on
   to argue, "Who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
   which is good?" The Jews certainly found it so; for the efforts of
   their enemies to induce them to desist from their work of
   temple-building were rendered nugatory and ineffectual by the special
   care exercised over them by their Almighty Friend.

   It may be that you will have to encounter hatred and opposition in
   doing God's work; but be sure not to look at these things, but
   steadfastly to Jesus. Must you not watch the foe? No; you could not
   make a greater mistake. You must look away to the face of Jesus, and
   you will find that He, like a good shepherd, is looking carefully and
   lovingly down on you, and watching the stealthy movements of your foe.
   Even when we are not directly conscious of that watchful eye, it still
   follows us. He knoweth the way that you take; and He is acquainted with
   the varied circumstances of your life. He has pledged Himself to be
   with you for ever; as Wordsworth once said of his beloved daughter Dora
   : --

   "Dear child, fair child, that walkest with me here,

   Though thou appear untouched by solemn thought,

   Thy nature is not therefore less divine;

   Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year,

   Thou worshippest at the temple's inner shrine,

   God being with thee when thou knowest not."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Lord had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the King unto
   them. Ezra vi. 22.

   YES, the hearts of men are in the hands of God, and He can turn them
   whither He will. There are many instances of this in Scripture. God
   gave Joseph favour with Pharaoh; Moses with the Princess; and Daniel
   with the King of Babylon. If certain matters can only be settled by
   reference to great men, kings or men of affairs, make the application;
   and then betake yourself to prayer, believing that as He inclined the
   heart of Darius, in the instance before us, so He can do as He will
   among the armies of heaven, and the inhabitants of earth.

   That unkind overseer, that vexatious member of your home-circle, that
   great man whose help you so greatly need -- these are accessible to
   God's Spirit, if only you are intent on seeking his glory, and doing
   his will. But you must be able to show, as these Jews could, that your
   cause is identical with the cause of God, before you can claim, with
   unwavering faith, his interference on your behalf.

   Then when the answer comes, let us thank Him, separating ourselves
   still further from the filthiness around us, so as to keep the feast
   with joy. Do not be afraid of joy; when God makes you joyful, do not
   think it necessary to restrain your songs or smiles, for fear that an
   equivalent of sorrow will presently be meted out as a make-weight. Our
   blessed Lord was desirous that his joy might be in his Disciples; it
   was for the joy that was set before Him that He endured the cross,
   despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of
   God; it is with exceeding joy that He will present us faultless before
   the presence of his glory. "Thou shalt rejoice in every good thing
   which the Lord thy God giveth thee."
     __________________________________________________________________

   I was strengthened, as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me. Ezra
   vii. 28.

   IT was no small work that the good Ezra had undertaken. To lead a great
   expedition across the inhospitable desert; to convoy the sacred vessels
   and a large treasure of gold and silver; to set magistrates and judges
   over all that great district beyond the river -- this was no slight
   task, and he needed strength. But in the simple language of his heart
   the good hand of his God was upon him, and that was sufficient to nerve
   and strengthen him.

   It is wonderful what resistless might comes to the soul, when it
   realizes that it is treading the path and working out the career
   determined for it from all eternity by the Almighty. The thought
   imparts the same kind of impulse to the soul, as the touch of love or
   authority on the arm. We are reminded of the veteran, who, when charged
   by the Duke of Wellington to take a difficult position, turned to him
   and said, "I will go, sir; but first give me a grip of your conquering
   hand."

   Think, soul, of what that hand is which holds the waters in its hollow,
   and spreads the curtains of the sky, and was nailed to the cross; that
   brought blessing with its touch to so many weary sufferers, and now
   holds the mysterious book, sealed with seven seals; that caught Peter,
   and lay lightly on the heads of the little babes. That hand is
   strengthening thee for a work for which by nature thou art unequal, but
   to which thou hast been evidently called. Go forward: it holds, guides,
   empowers thee. It can lead thee before kings, princes, and nobles, so
   that thou shalt not fear; it can preserve thee from dangers
   innumerable; it can shield thee from the fire of the enemy; and none,
   man or devil, can pluck you out of the Father's hand.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them at Jerusalem. Ezra viii.
   29.

   THEY were protected by God, whose presence with them across the wild
   desert made it needless to ask for an escort of soldiers; but they had
   to take care of the precious vessels of his house. It was a reciprocal
   trust. So it must be with us, as we are taught in 2 Tim. i. 12, 14.
   There are two deposits, as the margin shows. We deposit ourselves, and
   all we are and have, with God; whilst He deposits with us his sacred
   Gospel, the vessels of which we must "guard through the Holy Ghost
   which dwelleth in us," and be prepared to defend with our blood.

   Our deposit with God. -- How safe are they who commit their all to God!
   Faraday was asked, when dying, on what supposition he depended as he
   contemplated the other world; and he replied, "I am relying on no
   supposition, but on a certainty; I know in whom I have believed, and am
   persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed to Him."

   God's deposit with us. -- But let us be true to our trust. The Holy
   Bible, the Doctrines of the Christian Church, the Day of Rest, the
   House of God, the ordinances of the Lord's Supper and Christian
   Bap-tism -- these are some of the vessels which have been passed down
   to us, and we must hand on intact. Be ye clean that carry them! Oh,
   what joy it will be when we reach our destination, and can resign our
   trust, and weigh out the deposit, and hear the Master's "Well done!"
   But, in the meanwhile, whilst marching across the yellow sands, where
   wild dangers lie in wait, let us not seek the escort of creature or
   worldly might; but boast of the Hand of our God, which is for good upon
   all them that seek Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The people have not separated themselves. Ezra ix. 1.

   THIS was only too true! There had been, on the part of princes and
   rulers, gross intermarriage with the people of surrounding lands. The
   holy seed had become mixed and diluted. And it was the more sad that
   this should have taken place, when it was to cleanse his people from
   such alliances, and the evils to which they inevitably led, that God
   had passed them through the purging fires of the seventy years'
   captivity. It afflicted the good Ezra sorely. With every sign of
   Oriental grief he poured out his soul before God. And this is the
   lesson we should carry with us. It has been truly said that communion
   with the Lord dries many tears, but it starts many more. We no longer
   sorrow with the sorrow of the world; but we become burdened with some
   of the griefs that still rend the heart of the Lord in the glory.

   This fellowship between the Lord's people and the world is becoming
   increasingly close as we near the end of the age. In the appointments
   of our homes, our amusements, books, and practices, there is very
   little to choose between the one and the other. If there is any
   distinction, it lies in a certain sadness with which Christians take
   their pIeasures, as though remembering a something better. But the rest
   of us do not grieve over it; we do not rend our clothes: we do not take
   these things to heart, as though they specially concerned us.

   Let us at least separate ourselves after the manner of Christ, who
   frequented the temple, acknowledged the State, accepted invitations to
   great houses; but his heart and speech always revolved about his
   Father. What if it led to our being cast out without the camp!
     __________________________________________________________________

   We also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it. Ezra x. 4.

   THIS narrative reminds us of the story of Achan, who took of the
   accursed thing, and kindled the anger of the Lord against the children
   of Israel. There must be confession and the putting away of evil ere
   communion with God can be re-established.

   It is not given to every one to be an Ezra. There are abuses to deal
   with, and wrongs to right, on every side; but they require to be dealt
   with by those who are specially adapted or qualified for the work. Be
   always ready to do such work, if there should be no one else. It was
   the life motto of a great man always to act as though there were no one
   else who would. Still, Nehemiahs and Ezras are not given very largely
   to the Church or the world; and, for the most part, we must be content
   to be of those who say, "Be of good courage, and do it; we also will be
   with thee." But though this seems but a little thing, it may lead to
   great results. Many a man has been urged to a noble deed by the
   encouragement he received at a critical hour from some unknown and
   obscure disciple.

   If you cannot do a great thing, identify yourself with one who can.
   Stand by him, identify yourself with him in public or private, by
   sympathy and prayer. Though the strongholds of evil are great and high,
   they may be swept away before an avalanche of snowflakes, any one of
   which would melt in the warm hand of a child.

   Oh for more of that magnanimity, which is quick to recognise the
   matters that belong to certain elect souls -- not envying, nor
   disparaging, but frankly confessing their eminent qualifications, and
   falling in to further and accelerate their success, which will be the
   gain of all!
     __________________________________________________________________

   I was the king's cupbearer . Neh. i. 11.

   THE post was an important one. It gave its occupant the opportunity of
   coming into close contact with the king; it implied a character of
   unusual trustworthiness, since Oriental despots were very afraid of
   poison. But no one expected a royal cupbearer to do anything very
   heroic. He lived in the inner part of the palace, and was necessarily
   excluded from the great deeds of the stirring outward world. Nehemiah
   also was evidently a humble and retiring man. His response to the story
   of the ruined condition of Jerusalem was just a flood of tears and
   prayer to the God of heaven. And had you seen those tears and heard
   that prayer, you might have thought that just another flower was
   drooping, another seed falling into the ground to die.

   But this was not all. These prayers and tears were supplemented by an
   earnest purpose, which was maturing with every hour. He gave himself to
   God to be used, if God would have it so, as an instrument in the
   execution of his recorded purpose. He was a man of faith. It mattered
   little enough that he was only a cupbearer, for that was no barrier to
   God; indeed, God might work more efficiently through a frail, weak man,
   than through the prince, the soldier, or the orator, since He cannot
   give his glory to another. What a glorious faith was his, which dared
   to believe that through his yielded life God could pour his mighty
   rivers! Why do we not yield ourselves in our helplessness to God, and
   ask Him to work through us, to fulfil his mighty purposes?

   "We kneel, how weak! We rise, how full of power!

   Why therefore should we do ourselves this wrong,

   Or others -- that we are not always strong!"
     __________________________________________________________________

   So I prayed to the God of Heaven. Neh. ii. 4.

   ALL around the apartment in which this interview took place were
   effigies of idol gods: perhaps incense was burning before a shrine, and
   filling the air with its aroma. But Nehemiah, though standing amid
   these heathen emblems, and in the presence of the gre atest king on
   earth, thought little of either one or the other, and prostrated
   himself in spirit before the throne of heaven. Remember that thou hast
   within thee a shrine, a temple into which at any moment, even amid the
   excitement of an earthly court, thou mayest retire and ask direction of
   thy King and Friend.

   He had been sorely startled by the king's question; he did not know
   that his face had betrayed him. He had, doubtless, intended to seek an
   interview with the king, and formally state the whole case (see i. 11).
   But to be taken thus at unawares, to have to state his case on the spur
   of the moment, appeared to take him at a great disadvantage; and he
   instinctively turned to prayer.

   How little the king knew what was transpiring, or what had happened
   between his question and the reply which was given, apparently, without
   the loss of a moment. But how beautiful is the example for ourselves!
   You cannot acquire this habit of ejaculatory prayer unless you spend
   prolonged periods in holy fellowship. But when you are much with God in
   private, you will not find it diffecult at any moment to step aside to
   ask Him a question.The busy mart or the crowded street may at any time
   become the place of prayer.

   "A touch divine

   And the sealed eyeball owns the mystic rod;

   Visibly through His garden walketh God."

   Every one over against his house. Neh. iii. 28.

   THIS is the way to deal with the evil of this world. We are all fonder
   of starting schemes, forming committees, and discussing methods of
   work, than in setting definitely to work for ourselves. There is a lack
   of definiteness, and we hardly know where to begin. But this verse
   suggests that every one should begin over against his own house. Try
   and make your own neighbourhood a little more like what God would have
   it. It may be that you have gone too far afield in search of work; you
   are applying to the Foreign Missionary Society, or are waiting for a
   sphere of service; yet, all the time, there is that wretched
   neighbourhood, like a piece of ruined wall before you. Arise and repair
   it!

   Meshullam repaired over against his chamber (ver. 30). Perhaps he was
   not rich enough to have a whole house; he lived in a single room, but
   he discovered that there was a little bit of the wall just opposite his
   window, which would not be built unless he set to it. Is not that a
   hint for college students, and for those who live in flats, or
   industrial dwellings?

   The best way is not immediately to begin giving tracts, good though
   that is in its place. Ask God to give you an opportunity of showing
   kindness to your neighbours, so that they get to understand and trust
   you; and wait upon God until the answer comes -- until He shall show
   you what step He would have you take next. This is the foundation of
   your bit of wall. Then plod on step by step, tier by tier. God will
   show you how. You may be unpractised in wall-building; but He is the
   Architect and Builder, and you are but a bricklayer's labourer at the
   best. Do as He tells you.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Remember the Lord. Neh. iv. 14.

   IT was uncommonly good advice. Amid all the wise precautions taken by
   this man of sanctified common-sense, he kept bringing the people back
   to God. God was amongst them. God would fight for them. God was going
   to bring the counsel of their enemies to nought.

   This would make a good motto for daily living. If in all circumstances
   we would remember the Lord, the way would be brightened; the burdens
   would faII; our spirits would never droop; and songs of joy would take
   the place of sadness. Whenever enemies assail and difficulties gather
   like storm-clouds, look away from them and remember the Lord. When
   hemmed in on every side, be sure that He can help you from his holy
   heaven; remember the Lord. When heart and flesh fail, and you do not
   know what to do for the best, be sure to remember the Lord, and act as
   in his most holy presence. What a comfort and strength it is to see a
   friend, when standing amid a crowd of adversaries intent on your
   destruction, and to know that he will act and speak for you! But
   remember that Jesus is always like that.

   You say that you forget so soon; that you would remember, though at the
   critical moment you are betrayed into forgetfulness. But you must
   recall His precious promise, that the Holy Spirit will bring all to
   remembrance. If only you will trust the difficulty into his hands, you
   will find that He will gladly undertake it; and as long as you leave it
   with Him, you will hear his voice rising in your heart, and saying,
   "Remember the Lord."

   "Watch with me, Jesus, in my loneliness,

   Though others say me Nay, yet say Thou, Yea;

   Though others pass me by, stop Thou to bless.
     __________________________________________________________________

   So did not I, because of the fear of God. Neh. v. 15.

   THESE were great words. Nehemiah had a perfect right to take this
   money. Not a word could be said even by his critics, if he did. He was
   doing a priceless work, and might justly claim his maintenance. On the
   other hand, the people were very poor, and he would have a larger
   influence over them if he were prepared to stand on their level, and to
   share with them. It was just so that the Apostle argued in 1 Cor. ix.
   And from both we learn that often we must forego our evident rights and
   liberties in order to influence others for Christ. Do not always stand
   on your rights; but live for others, making any sacrifice in order to
   save some -- even as Christ loved us, and gave Himself for us.

   If Nehemiah did so much for the holy fear of God, what ought not we to
   do for love? Love is more inexorable than law. Its exactions are more
   stringent and searching. Are we doing as much for Iove of Jesus as
   generations before did simply on the score of duty? It is much to be
   questioned if Jesus does not get less, of outward service at least, out
   of his followers, than Mehomet or Buddha does. But what He does get is
   infinitely sweet to Him, in so far as love prompts it.

   All around you people are doing things that they say are perfectly
   legitimate; they call you narrow and bigoted because you do not join
   with them; they are always arguing with you to prove you are wrong. But
   your supreme law is your attitude to your Master. "I cannot do
   otherwise for the love of Jesus."

   "Not I, because of the fear of God."

   "Not I, but the grace of God that was with me."

   "Not I, but Christ liveth in me."
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Neh. vi. 3.

   IT was a sublime answer. Below was the Plain of Ono, where Nehemiah's
   foes awaited him. Let him once descend into it and he would become
   their easy prey; but he withstood their four-fold solicitation by
   considering the greatness of the work he was doing and the responsible
   position he was called to fill. Other-worldliness is the best cure for
   worldliness. Those whose affections are set on things above, will have
   no difficulty in refusing the appeals of sense. Get your heart and
   hands deeply engaged in the great work of building God's Temple, and
   you will be proof to the most flattering proposals ever made by Madam
   Bubble.

   Oh, children of the Great King, let us pray that we may know the
   grandeur of our position before Him; the high calling with which we
   have been called; the vast responsibilities with which we are
   entrusted; the great work of co-operating with God in erecting the city
   of God. Heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ! Called to sit with
   Christ in the Heavenlies! Risen, ascended, crowned in Him! Sitting with
   Christ, far above all principality and power! How can we go down --
   down to the world that rejected Him; down to the level of the first
   Adam, from which, at so great cost, we have been raised; down to the
   quarry from which we were hewn, and the hole of the pit whence we were
   digged! No, it cannot be; and as we make our choice, let us look to the
   living and ascended Christ to make it good. Put your will on his side,
   and expect that the energy of the power that raised Him from the dead
   will raise and maintain you in union with Him. For "your life is hid
   with Christ in God."
     __________________________________________________________________

   It was not found. Neh. vii. 64.

   CERTAIN claimed the maintenance of the priests, and were challenged to
   show their name in the register of the priestly line. In all likelihood
   they were descended from the sons of Aaron, but through marriage
   outside the priestly clan, and through the fact also of the name of the
   mother's father being adopted, their names were not reckoned in the
   priestly genealogy; consequently, their claim for priestly maintenance
   and service could not be established.

   Is there not something like this still? Men, who were called to be
   God's priests, drop out of the register of those who serve before Him.
   It may be they are not sure of their genealogy, and have lost the
   assurance of sonship; their spirit is no longer filled with the blessed
   co-witness of the Holy Ghost. God is afar from them; and, being out of
   harmony with Him, they are out of sympathy with their fellows. They
   are, therefore, rightly put out of the priesthood.

   Now trace this matter back to its beginning. As likely as not you will
   find it originated in some worldly alliance. He that will be a friend
   of the world is necessarily an enemy with God. For a mess of pottage
   Esau loses his birthright.

   But all this can be put right. There has arisen a Priest, who holds the
   Urim and Thummim in his hand: God's own Priest after the order of
   Melchizedek. "Wherefore it behoved Him in all things to be made like
   unto his brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest
   in things pertaining to God." He waits to reinstate the erring soul,
   restore it to the priestly office, and give it priestly food and
   maintenance.

   The joy of the Lord is your strength. Neh. viii. 10.

   "THE sad heart tires in a mile," is a frequent proverb. What a
   difference there is between the energy of the healthy, joyous heart and
   the forced activity of the morbid and depressed one! The one leaps to
   its task, the other creeps to it. The one discovers its meat and drink
   in self-sacrifice, the other limps, and stoops, and crawls. If you want
   to be strong for life's work, be sure to keep a glad heart. But, be
   equally sure to be glad with the joy of Lord. There is a counterfeit of
   it in the world, of which we must beware -- an outward merry-making,
   jesting, and mad laughter, which hides an aching and miserable heart.
   Solomon compares the joy of the world to the crackling of thorns under
   a pot, which flare up with great speed, but burn out before the water
   in the pot is warm.

   Ours must be the joy of the Lord. It begins with the assurance of
   forgiveness and acceptance in the Beloved. It is nourished in trial and
   tribulation, which veil outward sources of consolation, and lead us to
   rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus. It is independent of
   circumstances, so that its possessors can sing in the stocks. It lives
   not in the gifts of God, but in God Himself. It is the fruit of the
   Spirit, who begets in us love, joy, peace, long-suffering. Get the Lord
   Himself to fill your soul, and joy will be as natural as the murmur of
   a brook to its flow.

   And such joy will always reveal itself to others. You will desire to
   send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared. Your joy will be
   contagious; it will shed its kindly light on sad and weary hearts. As
   Rutherford said, we have a new heaven in the heaven of every soul we
   bring there.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The seed of Israel separated themselves. Neh. ix. 2.

   THIS is the beginning of the true life. Turn to the story of creation,
   and you learn, first, that God divided the light from the darkness;
   next, the waters of the clouds from those on the earth; and next, the
   seas from the land. It was only thus that He could effect his purpose
   of substituting kosmos for chaos. So, in the development of the inner
   life, there must be separation and judgment; the discrimination of the
   false from the true, the evil from the good." Separate Me . . . for the
   work whereunto I have called them."

   When God put his hand to man's highest culture, He separated Shem from
   his brethren; Terah's house from other kindred clans; and Abraham from
   his people. What weight this gave to those solemn words, "I am the Lord
   your God, which have separated you from other people. And ye shall be
   holy unto Me; for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other
   people that ye should be mine" (Lev. xx. 24, 26). It was not that God
   had no care for the great world; but that He desired to concentrate his
   attention on a few, that when they had fully caught his thought they
   might pass it on to mankind.

   This accounts for the cry of the Holy Ghost through the Apostle,
   "Wherefore, come out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch not
   the unclean thing." We must be separate in our practices, cleansing
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit; in our pursuits,
   going with Christ without the camp; in our pleasures; and in our
   alliances. "Follow the Christ -- the King! Live pure! Speak true! Right
   wrong! Follow the King! Else, wherefore born! "
     __________________________________________________________________

   The children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the
   offering. Neh. x. 39.

   IT was about this time that Malachi wrote the memorable words, "Bring
   ye all the tithes into my storehouse, that there may be meat in my
   house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord, if I will not pour
   you out a blessing." When a people has separated itself to God, there
   will be no lack in its house, no failure in its supplies, no lack for
   its ministers. So with the individual. All they that had separated
   themselves entered into an oath to charge themselves yearly for the
   service of the house of God. Separation is the negative side of
   consecration.

   How does this touch you, my friend? What proportion of your income are
   you setting apart for the service of God? The amount that a man gives
   in proportion to his income is a sure gauge of the genuineness and
   depth of his religious life. The Jew gave about a third of his yearly
   income to God; do we come up to this standard? Yet we speak of the Jews
   with contempt, as hard-fisted and miserly. These old Jews might set an
   example to us newer Christians. How often we reverse our position from
   God's ideal! He puts us over his estate that we should send Him all the
   produce, after deducting what is necessary for our maintenance, and
   that of our families. But we engross the entire proceeds for ourselves,
   sending Him an odd guinea, or half-crown, when we can easily spare it.
   Let us see that we give at least a fixed proportion of our income, and
   as much more as we can. Do not forsake the House of your God; so shall
   the heavens be opened in blessing. "There is that giveth and yet
   increaseth; there is that withholdeth more than is meet, and it sendeth
   to poverty."

   A certain portion should be for the singers. Neh. xi. 23.

   IT was the king's command, and it was very right and sensible, because
   they enlivened and quickened the life of the entire community. A mere
   utilitarian spirit might have refused to maintain them, because they
   did not contribute to the handicrafts of the community. They only sang
   the praises of God; but they fulfilled a very important part in the
   life of the city, and they deserved the portion which was regularly
   contributed to them.

   You sometimes feel your life to be comparatively useless. You can only
   say a kind word to those who are doing the main business of the world.
   When the brothers had wrought all day at the clearing for the farm,
   their sister Hope sang through the evening hours to cheer them and
   drive away their sense of fatigue. That was all she could do; but was
   she not deserving of maintenance? You can only sing your song of hope,
   and keep the heart of the toilers sweet and fresh. You can only get
   inspiration from God's heart and pass it on. You can do little but
   learn to detect, and translate into music that men love, the deep
   undertones of God's creation. But it is well. You are needed in God's
   world.

   There are invalids, who lie on their back through weary months and
   years, that are the inspiration of their homes, and to their side the
   elders and the children come for counsel and comfort. Sing on, ye sweet
   choristers, that alleviate our depressions and start our hearts to high
   endeavour! Ye that by night, in sleepless hours, stand in the house of
   the Lord, praise ye the Lord when all the busy life of men is hushed!
   The King will see to it that ye do not miss your maintenance, your
   portion day by day.
     __________________________________________________________________

   David, the man of God. Neh. xii. 24, 36, 37, 45, 46.

   HOW long the influence of David has lingered over the world, like the
   afterglow of a sunset! Mark the characteristic in him which laid the
   foundation of his supremacy over the hearts of his countrymen. He was
   pre-eminently "a man of God." Notwithstanding his terrible fall, his
   people recognised that his salient characteristic was Godward. Would
   you be one of God's men?

   (1) Give all to God. -- Too many live lives of piecemeal consecration,
   giving a bit here and a bit there, but never all. David surrendered
   himself to do God's will utterly, and in all, and so became a man after
   God's own heart. With what joy God's voice seems to quiver, as He says,
   "I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, who
   shall fulfil all my will" (Acts xiii. 22). Without reserve, holding
   nothing back, yield yourself to God, to be, and do, and suffer his
   will, whatever it may be.

   (2) Take all from God. -- "It is not what we give to Jesus, but what we
   take from Him, that makes us strong, helpful, and victorious day by
   day." Accept this as a fact, that in Jesus God has made all his fulness
   dwell. There is nothing we require, for life or godliness, that is not
   stored in Him; but the terrible loss of our lives is that we take so
   little. We have ourselves to blame if we are poor, and miserable, and
   blind, and naked.

   (3) Use all for God. -- It sometimes appears as though Christian people
   were urged to yield themselves to God, only that their lives might be
   more comfortable. But the supreme and final end in all surrender must
   be that his will be done, his glory promoted, and Himself magnified
   whether in life or death.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Remember me, O my God! Neh. xiii. 14, 22, 31.

   THRICE in this chapter this humble man asks to be remembered. We cannot
   think that he expected to purchase God's favour because of his
   sacrifices and endeavours. Of this he was already assured. But being a
   redeemed soul, he desired that his works might come up in remembrance
   before God, and secure a reward. There is no harm in keeping the eye
   fixed on the reward for faithful toil in the Lord's service. It was a
   constant incentive in the life, of the great Apostle that he might so
   run as to obtain; so finish his work that he might win the crown.

   Note the three departments of service mentioned in this chapter, in
   connection with which Nehemiah breathed this petition. He had turned
   all Tobia's household stuff out of the temple, so that the whole
   structure should be given up to the service of God. He had secured the
   Sabbath from desecration, so that its holy rest and calm were preserved
   intact. And he insisted on the purity of the holy seed being untainted
   by foreign alliances. Consecration to God, the Rest of Faith in the
   inner life, and the separation of God's children from the world, are
   the counterparts of these in our own time.

   Shall we not humbly set ourselves to seek them for the professing
   Church? Nehemiah was an ungifted, simple-hearted man, but he was able
   to secure them as the instrument and channel of God's purposes. Why
   should not God work through us for the same ends. But, first, let us
   see to it that each of these particulars is being realized in our own
   personal character and life. Let every room of the heart be for God;
   let no voice break the inner peace. Then what God has done for us, we
   may confidently plead as within his scheme for others.
     __________________________________________________________________

   That every man should bear rule in his own house. Esther i. 22.

   ONE of the pre-requisites in choosing a presiding officer in the early
   Church was that he should rule well his own house; "for if a man know
   not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the Church of
   God?" (1 Tim. iii. 4, 5).

   When a man bears rule as husband and father in the love of God, there
   is no issue of commands which conflict with primary obligations; rather
   than that, his authority represents the Divine authority. As Christ
   received his authority from the Father, so does a man derive and
   receive his from Christ; and in the recognition of his delegated right
   and ability to lead, the entire household becomes well ordered. The
   relaxation of the bonds of authority and government in our homes is one
   of the saddest symptoms of national decay, as it is among the predicted
   signs of the end (2 Tim. iii. 2, 3).

   But, on the other hand, you must show yourself worthy to lead and rule
   your home. Your character must be such as to command respect. Those
   whom God has put into your charge require that you do not us your
   authority for selfish or capricious ends. Above all, love is the source
   of the truest authority. We count nothing hard or irksome that we do
   for those we love. Show love, and you will win love; and on love will
   be built respect, reverence, and obedience.

   One of the most eloquent of modern Italians has said truly: "You can
   only obtain the exercise of your rights by deserving them, through your
   own activity, and your own spirit of love and sacrifice!" Christ's
   golden rule holds good in every phase of life -- "In all things,
   whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Hadassah, that is, Esther. Esther ii. 7.

   THROUGH this one girl-life God was about to save his people, though He
   was all the while hidden from view. The peculiarity of this book is
   that there is no mention of the name of God; but there is no book in
   the Bible more full of the presence and working of God for his own. His
   name is clearly in the watermark of the paper, if it do not appear in
   the print.

   We know that the meshes of evil plotting were laid for the hurt of
   Israel long before the fatal decree was made for the destruction of the
   entire nation; but here we find that God has begun his preparations for
   deliverance long before. In the beauty of Esther, in the position her
   uncle held at court, in the favour she won with the king, in the
   discovery through Mordecai of the plot against the king's life, there
   are the materials of a great and Divine deliverance. God was clearly
   beforehand to the devil. The angels of light were on the ground before
   those of darkness were marshalled.

   It is a sweet thought to carry with us always: God prepares of his
   goodness for the poor. He prepares the good work in which we are to
   walk, and the deliverances by which He will succour us in the hour of
   need. Do not dread the foe, be not fearful nor dismayed, as he draws
   his net around thee; God has prepared a way of escape, so that thou
   shalt be able to bear it. In the meanwhile, rest in the Lord, and wait
   patiently for Him; trust in the Lord; wait for the Lord; be silent to
   the Lord. He is more farseeing, his plans more far-reaching, his help
   more certain, than all the stratagems of evil. God laughs at them. Into
   the pit they have dug, thine enemies shall fall.
     __________________________________________________________________

   But Mordecai bowed not. Esther iii. 2.

   THERE was stern stuff in this old Jew. He was not going to prostrate
   himself before one so haughty and so depraved as Haman, albeit that he
   was the king's favourite. To be the only one in a city office that does
   not laugh at the questionable story; to stand alone on shipboard
   against the gambling mania; to refuse to countenance cleverness which
   is divorced from cleanness, and genius which is apart from goodness --
   this is to do as Mordecai did in the gate of the king's palace.

   Only God can give this power, since of ourselves we are as reeds shaken
   by the wind. Sooner might a single ear of wheat resist the breeze that
   bends all its companions in the same direction, than we stand alone,
   whilst all our associates bow, unless God Himself enable as. But God is
   prepared to enable us. Listen: "I will strengthen thee; yea, I will
   help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my
   righteousness." But the mistake we are so apt to make is to brace
   ourselves up by resolution and firm determination, in anticipation of
   some impending struggle. To do this is to fail. Live in Christ, look up
   into his face, derive from Him strength for the moment and at the
   moment; and often wrap about thee that exceeding great and precious
   promise, "I will make him to become a pillar in the temple of my God;
   and he shall go no more out; and I will write on him the name of my
   God." Oh to stand pillar-like amid men, bearing up the temple arch of
   truth, and inscribed with God's name, whilst the crowds go and come on
   the pavement beneath!

   "Greatly begin! though thou have time

   But for a line, be that sublime --

   Not Failure, but low aim, is Crime!"
     __________________________________________________________________

   Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as
   this? Esther iv. 14.

   WHAT grand faith was here! Mordecai was in God's secrets, and was
   assured that deliverance and enlargement would come to his people from
   some quarter -- if not from Esther, then from some other; but he was
   extremely anxious that she should not miss the honour of being her
   people's emancipator. Therefore he suggested that she had come to her
   high position for this very purpose.

   We none of us know, at the first, God's reasons for bringing us into
   positions of honour and trust. Why is that young girl suddenly made
   mistress over that household? Why is that youth taken from the ranks of
   the working-people, and placed over that great City church? Why is that
   man put forward in his business, so that he is the head of the firm in
   which he served as an office-boy? All these are parts of the Divine
   plan. God has brought them to the Kingdom that He may work out through
   them some great purpose of salvation. They have the option, however, to
   serve it or not. They may use their position for themselves, for their
   own emolument and enjoyment, that they may surround themselves with
   strong fortifications against misfortune; but in that case they court
   destruction. Their position and wealth may vanish as suddenly as it
   came; or ill-health and disaster may incapacitate them.

   If, on the other hand, all is used for God, though at the risk of
   perishing -- for it seemed to Esther as though the action to which
   Mordecai urged her meant that -- the issue is blessed. Those that love
   their lives lose them; those that are prepared to forfeit them keep
   them. The wheat grain which is buried in the soil bears much fruit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand.
   Esther v. 2.

   WHAT a beautiful type this is for each of us in our approaches to God!

   For the repentant sinner. -- You may have said with Esther, "I will go
   into the king's presence, and if I perish, I perish." But it is
   impossible for you to perish. None ever perished at the footstool of
   mercy. God is faithful to his promises, and just to his Son; and He can
   do no other -- He wants to do no other -- than forgive. As you stand
   amid the throng that surrounds his throne, He will espy you, and accept
   you graciously, because of the God-Man who sits at his right hand, and
   ever lives to intercede. In his name you may come boldly and obtain
   mercy.

   For the suppliant. -- You have a great boon to ask for yourself, or
   another. The King's court stands open; enter and lodge your petition.
   He will be very gracious at the voice of your cry: the golden sceptre
   extended, his word passed, that He will answer with the whole resources
   of his kingdom. The answer may not come at once, or in the way you
   expected; but no true suppliant was ever turned away without his
   complaint or cause being graciously considered, and in the best way met
   and adjusted.

   For the Christian worker. -- Surely Esther represents a Paul prepared
   to be himself accursed, a Luther, a Brainerd. It is a lovely sight when
   the child of God is so oppressed with the burden of other souls as to
   sacrifice all else in order to plead their cause. Surely such find
   favour with God; they are kindred spirits with his own, and He bids
   them share his throne. God will do anything for those who are consumed
   by his own redemptive purpose.

   As thou hast said, do even so to Mordecai the Jew. Esther vi. 10.

   HERE indeed was a turning of the tables! Haman doing honour to the
   humble Jew, who refused to do honour to himself. Surely that day the
   old refrain must have rung through Mordecai's heart: -- "He raiseth up
   the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghilI,
   to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of
   glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's." And there was an
   anticipation of yet other words: -- "For thou hast a little strength,
   and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name: behold, I will make
   them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved
   thee."

   How evidently God was working for his child. The gallows, indeed, was
   being prepared, but it would be used for Haman; whilst the triumph that
   Haman thought to be preparing for himself was to be used for Mordecai.

   This is not an isolated case. Any one who has lived a few years in the
   world and has observed the ways of God could duplicate it with
   instances that have come under his own notice. Dr. Gordon told us once
   of a church in Boston that would not admit coloured people; and after a
   few years it broke up, and the edifice is now occupied by a flourishing
   coloured church.

   Trust on, beloved friend, amid scorn, hate, and threatening death. So
   long as thy cause is God's, it must prevail. He will vindicate thee.
   Them that honour Him He will honour; whilst those that despise Him
   shall be lightly esteemed.

   "Though the mills of God grind slowly,

   Yet they grind exceeding small;

   Though with patience He stands waiting,

   With exactness grinds He all."

   What is thy petition, and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy
   request? Esther vii. 2.

   AMID the sensual conceptions of marriage that obtained in this heathen
   empire there was doubtless a consciousness in the king's breast of the
   essential unity between himself and his beautiful queen. She was his
   better self, and in her pleading he heard the voice of his own higher
   nature. To nothing less than this could he have made so far-reaching a
   promise. It was not so much Ahasuerus pledging himself to Esther, as
   Ahasuerus, the king, awakening to the appeal of a nobler Ahasuerus, for
   the most part buried. Such is the power of a pure and noble character
   awakening a nobler life. Will you try by your unselfishness and purity
   to awaken those around you to see and follow an ideal, which shall
   presently assume the form of the living Christ?

   In these words of the king we are reminded that God is willing to do
   beyond what we ask or think. Not to the half of his kingdom, but to the
   whole extent of it, has God pledged Himself, "according to the power
   that worketh in us." But our prayer must be in the name, or nature, of
   Christ; that is, the nature of Christ must pray in us, and God must
   recognise Himself come back through the circle of our intercession to
   Himself. The Spirit must make intercession in us, according to the will
   of God. When the unselfish, lovely, and holy nature of Jesus pleads in
   us by the Holy Ghost, there is nothing that God will not do for us,
   even to the whole of his kingdom.

   "If ye abide in Me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye
   will, and it shall be done unto you."

   "Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name He will give it you."

   Sealed with the king's ring. Esther viii. 8.

   IN chap. iii. 10 the king took the ring from his hand, and gave it to
   Haman. It is evident that he had resumed it from his chief officer's
   finger before sending him to execution. It was now entrusted to
   Mordecai, because it gave validity to the documents that proclaimed
   liberty to the Jews. Notice those words: "The writing which is written
   in the king's name, and sealed with the kings seal, no man may
   reverse," and apply them to that sealing with the Holy Ghost, of which
   we read so often in the New Testament.

   On the molten wax the ring, with its royal device, or perhaps the
   cutting of the royal profile, was pressed, giving sanction, validity,
   and irreversibleness; so on the tender heart of the believer in Christ,
   the Holy Spirit impresses the likeness of Jesus. The seal does not
   leave an impression of itself, but of the sovereign; and the Holy
   Spirit reveals not Himself, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and aims only to
   leave the mark and superscription of Christ on the character. The word
   character is used in Hebrews i. 3 (see Greek). How wonderful, that as
   the image or character of the Father was impressed on Christ, so the
   Saviour's image and character are impressed on us! "Him hath God the
   Father sealed," says the evangelist. "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of
   God, by whom ye were sealed," says the Apostle.

   This sealing us with the likeness of Jesus is God's attestation. It is
   his witness that we are born from above, and are become his sons and
   daughters. It is God's sign manual of his intention and decree that we
   should inherit an irreversible portion; and when God has once passed
   and sealed it, neither man nor devil can reverse it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Jews had rule over them that hated them . Esther ix. 1.

   YES, my reader, a similar reversal awaits us in the near future! Now,
   the god of this world and his followers bear rule over us, and work
   their way with the servants of God. They butcher them like sheep, and
   scatter the ashes of their homes to the winds; and sometimes it seems
   as though God had forgotten to avenge the cause of his saints. But the
   hour is coming when the Almighty will arise on our behalf; and to him
   who has patiently kept his works unto the end, He will give authority
   over the nations. Listen to these great words: "Behold, I give of the
   synagogue of Satan, of them which say they are Jews, and they are not,
   but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy
   feet, and to know that I have loved thee." Words more applicable to the
   case of the Jews in the days of Mordecai, and to the history of the
   Church, it would be impossible to find.

   But mark a notable distinction. In the case of the enemies of the
   Jewish people, there was no quarter. Destruction and death were meted
   to those who had breathed out persecution and slaughter. But in the
   case of Christ and his Church, power is viewed only as an opportunity
   of securing salvation and life. The Saviour said, after his
   resurrection, "All power is given unto Me in heaven and on earth; go
   ye, therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them
   into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: and
   lo, I am with you alway." And the Church says, as through suffering she
   passes to the right hand of power, "Lay not this sin to their charge;
   but out of our persecutors raise apostles to carry the Gospel to the
   confines of the earth."

   Seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.
   Esther x. 3 (R.V.).

   THIS epitaph on the life of a simple-minded, truehearted man, might be
   yours also. Why should you not from this moment adopt these, twin
   characteristics? Go about the world seeking the good of people. It does
   not always mean that you should give them a tract, or a little book. It
   is much easier to do this than to sacrifice your own good in order to
   seek theirs. You may be quite sure that some little act of
   self-sacrifice or thoughtfulness for a weary mother, or crying child,
   for a sick friend, or for some person who is always maligning and
   injuring you, would do a great deal in the way of preparing an entrance
   for the Gospel message. It is thus that the genial spring loosens the
   earth and prepares the way for the germination of multitudinous life.
   Count the day lost in which you have not sought to promote the good of
   some one. Adopt as your own the pious Quaker's motto, "Do all the good
   you can, to all the people you can, in all the ways you can."

   Speak peace to people. -- Soothe agitated and irritated souls. Throw
   oil on troubled waters. There are worried and anxious hearts all around
   us; a word of sympathy and earnest prayer with them will often remove
   the heavy load, and smooth out the wrinkles of care. Let the law of
   kindness be on your lip. Do not say sharp or unkind things of the
   absent, or allow your lips to utter words that will lead to bitterness
   or wrath. Seek peace and pursue it. And in order to this, let the peace
   of God that passeth all understanding keep your mind and heart.

   "Come, my beloved! We will haste and go

   To those pale faces of our fellow-men!

   Our loving hearts, burning with summer-fire,

   Shall cast a glow upon their pallidness."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and renounced God in their
   hearts. Job i. 5 (R.V.).

   TIMES of festivity are always full of temptation. The loins are
   relaxed, the girdle of the soul is loosed. Amid the general hilarity
   and the passing of the merry joke, words are said and thoughts
   permitted which are not always consistent with the character of God and
   his glorious kingdom and service. Job was not wrong, therefore, in
   supposing that his children might have contracted some defiling stain.

   It necessary for some of us to move in society, and to attend festive
   gatherings. As the Lord went to the wedding feast, and accepted Simon's
   invitation, so must we. The sphere of our life lies necessarily in the
   world. But when we are entering scenes of recreation and pleasure we
   should be more than ever careful to put on our armour, and by previous
   meditation and prayer prepare ourselves for the inevitable temptation;
   and when it is all over, and the lights are down, we should quietly
   review our behaviour under the light that streams from the Word of God.
   If we then are made aware of frivolous or uncharitable words, of
   jealousy because others have outshone us, or of pride at the splendour
   of our dress and the brilliance of our talk, we must confess it, and
   obtain forgiveness and restoration.

   What a beautiful example is furnished by Job to Christian parents! When
   your girls are going among strangers, and your boys into the great ways
   of the world, and you are unable to impose your will upon them, as in
   the days of childhood, you can yet pray for them, casting over them the
   shield of intercession, with strong cryings and tears. They are beyond
   your reach; but by faith you can move the arm of God on their behalf.
     __________________________________________________________________

   A perfect and an upright man. Job ii. 3.

   EVEN God spoke of Job as perfect. Not that he was absolutely so, as
   judged by the perfect standard of eternity, but as judged by the
   standard of his own light and knowledge. He was living up to all the
   requirements of God and man, so far as he understood them. His whole
   being was open and obedient to the Divine impulses. So far as he knew
   there was no cause of controversy in heart or life. Probably he could
   have adopted the words of the Apostle, "I know nothing against myself."
   He exercised himself to have always a conscience void of offence toward
   God and man.

   Satan suggested that his goodness was pure selfishness; that it paid
   him well to be as he was, because God had hedged him around and blessed
   his substance. This malignant suggestion was at once dealt with by the
   Almighty Vindicator of the saints. It was as if God said, "I give thee
   permission to deprive him of all those favouring conditions, for the
   sake of which thou sayest he is bribed to goodness; and it shall be
   seen that his integrity is rooted deep down in the work of my grace
   upon his heart."

   But the book goes on to show that God desired to teach Job that there
   were flaws and blemishes in his character which could only be seen by
   comparing it with the more perfect glory of his own Divine nature. His
   friends sought to prove him faulty, and failed; God revealed himself,
   and he cried, "Behold, I am vile, and abhor myself, and repent in dust
   and ashes."

   How often God takes away our consolations, that we may only love Him
   for Himself; and reveals our sinfulness, that we may better appreciate
   the completeness of his salvation!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day. Job iii. 1.

   THAT is, the day of his birth. Probably there have been hours in the
   majority of lives in which men have wished that they had never been
   born. When they have stood beside the wreck of all earthly hope, or
   entered the garden of the grave they have cried, "Why died I not from
   the birth!" The reason for this is, that the heart has been so occupied
   with the transient and earthly, that it has lost sight of the unseen
   and eternal; and in finding itself deprived of the former, it has
   thought that there was nothing left to live for.

   One of the greatest tests of true religion is in bearing suffering. At
   such a time we are apt, if we are professing Christians, to exert a
   certain constraint over ourselves, and bear ourselves heroically. We
   have read of people in like circumstances who have not shed a tear or
   uttered a complaining word; and we have braced ourselves to a Christian
   stoicism. "I am sure you cannot find fault with my behaviour," said one
   such to me. And yet beneath the correct exterior there may be the pride
   and haughtiness of an altogether unsubdued self.

   There is a more excellent way: to humble oneself under the mighty hand
   of God; to search the heart for any dross that needs to be burnt out;
   to resign oneself to the will of the Father; to endeavour to learn the
   lesson in the black-lettered book; to seek to manifest the specific
   grace for which the trial calls; to be very tender and thoughtful for
   others; to live deeper down.

   "Nearer, my God to Thee! -- Nearer to Thee!

   E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,

   Still all my song shall be -- Nearer, my God, to Thee!

   Nearer to Thee!"
     __________________________________________________________________

   But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest. Job iv. 5 (R.V.).

   IT is much easier to counsel others in their trouble than to bear it
   ourselves. Full often the soul, which has poured floods of consolation
   on others, feels sadly in need of a touch, a voice, a sympathising
   companion, as the chill waters begin to rise towards the knees, and the
   shadow of the great eclipse falls around. The fact of our having
   consoled so many others seems at such a moment to leave us the more
   solitary and lonesome. People have been so wont to be helped by as that
   they hardly dare approach us; besides, they suppose that all the fund
   of comfort from which we have succoured others must be now available
   for us. What can they say that we have not said a hundred times? and if
   we have said it, of course we must know all about it; but they do not
   know how wistful the heart is to hear it said to us with the accent of
   a sympathetic voice and the touch of a ministering hand.

   Ah, it will come unto thee at last. The pain and sorrow of life will
   find thee out. The arrow will at last fix itself quivering in thy
   heart. How wilt thou do then? Thou wilt faint unless thy words have
   sprung from a living experience of the love and presence of Jesus. Thou
   must have a better hope than "the integrity of thy ways," as suggested
   by Eliphaz. But there awaits thee the personal fellowship of Jesus, a
   brother born for the hour of trial. He is the never-failing Friend, who
   sticketh closer than a brother. Put Him and his will and his choice
   between thee and thy sorrow, whatever it may be. Hide thee in his
   secret place, and under the shadow of his wings thou shalt enjoy sweet
   peace.

   "Only heaven Is better than a walk

   With Christ at midnight over moonlit seas."
     __________________________________________________________________

   He maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth and his hands make whole.
   Job v. 18.

   HAS this been your experience lately? Have you been made sore by the
   heavy scourge of pain, and wounded by the nails of the cross? Do not
   look at second causes. Men may have been the instruments, but God is
   the Agent. The cup has been presented by a Judas, but the Father
   permitted it; and it is therefore the cup that the Father hath given
   you to drink. Shall you not drink it? How much He must love you, to
   dare to inflict this awful discipline, which makes your love and trust,
   that He values so infinitely, tremble in the scale! "Despise not thou
   the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him; for
   whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He
   receiveth."

   But do not look back on what you have suffered; look on and up! As
   surely as He has made sore, He will bind up; as soon as He has wounded,
   his hands will begin to make whole. Consider the reparative processes
   of nature. So soon as the unsightly ruin or chasm yawns, nature begins
   to weave her rich festoons, to cover it with moss and lichen; let the
   flesh be punctured or lacerated, the blood begins to poor out the
   protoplastic matter to be woven into a new fabric. So when the heart
   seems bleeding its life away, God is at work binding up and healing.
   Think of those dear and tender hands, that fashioned the heavens, and
   touched the eyeballs of the blind, as laid upon you to make you whole.
   Trust Him; He loves infinitely, and will suffer none that trust in Him
   to be desolate.

   We must be careful, however, that nothing on our part shall hinder the
   life of the Son of God from flowing through us, as the sap of the vine
   through every branch.
     __________________________________________________________________

   As a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away. Job vi. 15 (R.V.).

   JOB complains of his three friends. He was glad when they first came to
   his side, as likely to yield him comfort in his sore distress. Instead
   of this, however, they began probing his heart and searching his life,
   to find the secret sin on account of which his heavy troubles had
   befallen him. Their philosophy was at fault.They held that special
   misfortune is always the result of special sin; and since there was
   nothing in Job's outward conduct to account for his awful sufferings,
   they felt that he was hiding some secret defection, which they urged
   him to confess. Job felt that in all this they cruelly misunderstood
   him, and compares them in these words to one of the desert streams that
   are choked with ice and snow in the time of the winter rains, but
   dwindle and dry up on the first approach of summer. And when the weary
   caravans come to their banks, lo, their bed is a mere heap of stones.
   "They come thither and are confounded."

   Is it not so with human friendships? We hoped that they would quench
   the raging thirst of our souls; this hope increases when they draw nigh
   us in days of sorrow; but how often they fail us -- stones for bread,
   scorpions for fish, and scorching pebbles instead of water-brooks. How
   great a contrast to the love and friendship of Jesus! Not like a brook
   that dries in the time of drought, but like a well of water springing
   up within the heart for ever. He does not merely give consolation and
   sympathy, but He is what He gives. He imparts Himself. His promise
   chases away our fears as his Spirit reminds us of the words, "I will
   never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Nothing gives Him greater joy than
   to be the perfect circle of which earth's friendships are broken arcs.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What is man . . . that thou shouldest visit him every morning? Job vii.
   17, 18.

   GOD visits us with mercy every morning. Before we are awake He is at
   work in the world, baptizing it with dew, feeding the birds and wild
   things, taking pleasure in the jasmine and heliotrope, the honeysuckle,
   and the rose; and with all his care for his world, He does not forget
   man, whom He has placed there to be its tenant. There is no life so
   mean and abject, so suffering and wretched, that He does not visit in
   order to comfort and relieve it. No heart so forlorn that He does not
   knock at the door: no window so selfishly curtained and shuttered, at
   which He does not tap. "Open to Me!" the heavenly visitor entreats, "my
   love, my dove, my spouse!" Alas for us! that we keep the doors and
   windows closed to Him -- as the poor widow to a beneficent friend, who
   called to relieve her, but she mistook him for the rent-collector.

   But probably Job meant that God visits us in discipline, training,
   education. He is the watcher of men; not to detect their failures, but
   to discover opportunities of leading them on to richer, fuller
   experiences of his grace and life. Surely, as we consider all the time
   and pains which God has expended on us, we too may cry, with the
   patriarch, "What is man?" Man is more than we guess, else God would
   never take such time and pains with him. When a lapidary spends years
   over a single diamond, the most careless observer begins to appraise
   properly its intrinsic value.

   Every morning God visits thee, with holy thoughts and warnings, with
   miracles and parables, with anticipations and forecasts -- oh, realize
   how much thou art to Him: give Him love for love, thanks and loving
   recognition, a child's welcome and trust.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If thou wert pure and upright, surely now he would awake for thee. Job
   viii. 6.

   SO Bildad spoke, suggesting that Job was not pure and upright, since
   God did not appear to deliver him. The premises from which he argued
   were that God always delivers and prospers pure and upright men, and
   that therefore, if a man were not delivered and prospered, he was
   proved to be neither pure nor upright. The fallacy lay in the premiss.
   It is not universally true that God delivers his saints from adverse
   circumstances, or prospers them with outward good. There have been in
   all ages thousands of devoted servants of God who have been destitute,
   afflicted, and tormented; and there are thousands of such to-day in
   prisons, in hospital wards, in every condition of privation and trial;
   but in none of these cases can there be the least imputation on the
   love and righteousness of God, nor necessarily on their fidelity and
   goodness.

   God's arrangements for us are not governed by the superficial
   philosophy which would make material prosperity a sign of his favour,
   and adversity of his displeasure. There are many considerations beside.
   Our privations in the outward strengthen and ripen the inward. As the
   outward man decays, the inward is renewed day by day. We have to learn
   and manifest those passive virtues which can only mature in silence and
   sorrow. We must be taught to be largely independent of circumstances,
   and to find in God Himself the springs of unfailing supply. We must
   learn to carry the sentence of death in ourselves, that we may not
   trust in ourselves, but in the living God. We have to stiffer with and
   for others. All these things worketh God with us to make us partakers
   of his holiness. But amid all our sorrows, He is always awake for us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor
   me. Job ix. 31.

   WE shall never got beyond the need of using daily the Lord's prayer. He
   has bound by the conjunction and the prayer for forgiveness with that
   for daily bread, as though to teach us that we shall need the one as
   Iong as we need the other. At the end of the best day that we ever
   spent, when we are not aware of having consciously sinned in act, or
   speech, or thought, we shall still have need of the precious blood. We
   may know nothing against ourselves, yet we shall not be thereby
   justified; because He that judgeth us is our holy Lord, and the
   standard by which we are judged is his own perfect character. A piece
   of cambric looks extremely fine to the eye, but how coarse to the
   microscope! Sheep look white against the dark ground of the early
   spring; but how dark if there should be a fall of snow! Our characters
   seem stainless, only because we compare ourselves with ourselves, or
   with others.

   But, when our eyes are opened to see God, to behold the whiteness of
   the great white throne, and we stand in the searching light of heaven,
   we are as those who have just emerged from a ditch. I heard the other
   day of a woman being proud of having lived without sin for ten years!
   So we deceive ourselves. No, at the best we are sinful men and women,
   needing constant cleansing; even though we may be kept from known sin
   by the grace of Christ. It was at an advanced period in the life of the
   great Apostle, and when he lived nearest God, that he realized himself
   to be the chief of sinners.

   "I know not what I am, but only know

   I have had glimpses tongue may never speak:

   No more I balance human joy and woe,

   But think of my transgressions, and am meek."
     __________________________________________________________________

   The land of darkness and the shadow of death. Job x. 21.

   THIS represented the highest thinking of that age about the future.
   There were gleams now and again of something more; but they were fitful
   and uncertain, soon overtaken by dark and sad forebodings. How
   different to our happy condition, for whom death is abolished, whilst
   life and immortality have been brought to light! The patriarch called
   the present life Day, and the future Night. We know that in comparison
   the present is Night, and the future Day. "The night is far spent, the
   day is at hand; let us put on the armour of light."

   For us, too, there is something better. We wait for his Son from
   heaven; we look for that blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our
   great God and Saviour Jesus Christ. "As the waters of the sea are held
   between two mighty gravitations, the moon now drawing them towards
   itself, and the earth drawing them back again, thus giving the ebbing
   and flowing tide, by which our earth is kept clean and healthful, so
   must the tides of the soul's affection move perpetually between the
   cross of Christ and the coming of Christ, influenced now by the power
   of memory and now by the power of hope." It is said of the late Dr.
   Gordon: "Hardly a sermon was preached without allusion to the glorious
   appearing. Never a day passed in which he did not prepare himself for
   it, in which its hastening was not sought for with prayer." "Yet a
   little while [Greek, how little! how little!] and He that shall come
   will come." The attitude of every believer should be that of waiting:
   with loins girt and lamp burning, let us be ready to meet our Lord.

   "The Best is yet to be,

   The Last for which the First was made."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canst thou by searching find out God? Job xi. 7.

   THERE is but one answer to that question. No one can. The very angels
   veil their faces before the insufferable glory of his face.

   "The firstborn sons of light

   Desire in vain his depths to see;

   They cannot reach the mystery,

   The length, and breadth, and height.

   Do not be surprised, then, if there should be matters in the Bible, in
   your own life, and in the Providential government of the world, which
   baffle your thought. Remember you are only a little child in an infant
   class, and it is not likely that you can comprehend the whole system of
   your instructor. God would cease to be God to us, if we by searching
   could find Him out.

   But though we cannot find out God by the searching of the intellect, we
   may know Him by love. "He that loveth, knoweth God; for God is Love."
   There is a way of knowing God, which is hidden from the wise and
   prudent, and revealed to babes. Seek to be strengthened with might by
   his Spirit in the inner man. Let Christ dwell deep in your heart by
   faith. Take care to obey all his commandments, and then the Holy God
   will come into you, and abide. He will give you Himself, and you will
   know Him as a little child knows its parent, whom it cannot grasp with
   its mind, but loves and trusts and knows with its heart. We cannot find
   out God by searching, but we can by loving.

   We can also find Him in the character and life of Jesus. He that hath
   seen Him hath seen the Father; why then ask to be shown the Father?
   "What is Thy name, mystery of strength and beauty?" "Shiloh,
   Rest-Giver," is the deep response.

   Doth not the ear try words? and the palate tasteth its meat. Job xii.
   11 (R.V.).

   THERE is no appeal from the verdict of our palate.We know in a moment
   whether a substance is sweet or bitter, palatable or disagreeable. Now,
   what the taste is to articles of diet, that the ear is to words,
   whether of God or man. More especially we can tell in a moment whether
   the fire of inspiration is burning in them. This is the test which Job
   proposed to apply to the words of his friends; and it would be well for
   all of us to apply the same test to Holy Scripture.

   The humble student of the Word of God is sometimes much perplexed and
   cast down by the assaults which are made on it by scholars and
   teachers, who do not scruple to question the authorship and authority
   of large tracts of Scripture. We cannot vie with these in scholarship,
   but the humblest may apply the test of the purged ear; and it will
   detect a certain quality in the Bible which is absent everywhere
   beside. There is a tone in the voice of Scripture, which the child of
   God must recognise. This is the interesting characteristic in the
   quotations made in the New Testament from the Old. All the writers in
   the later Revelation detect the voice of God in the Old; to them, it is
   the Divine utterance through holy lips. Hearken, they cry, "the holy
   Ghost saith." God is speaking in the prophets, as He spake in his Son.

   It is one of the characteristics of Christ's sheep that they know his
   voice, and follow Him, whilst they flee from the voice of strangers.
   Ask that the Lord may touch your ears, that they may discern by a swift
   intuition the voice of the Good Shepherd from that of strangers; and
   for grace to follow immediately He calls you.

   Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him. Job xiii. 15.

   THIS was a noble expression, which has been appropriated by thousands
   in every subsequent age. In every friendship there is a probation,
   during which we narrowly watch the actions of another, as indicating
   the nature of his soul; but after awhile we get to such intimate
   knowledge and confidence, that we read and know his inner secret. We
   have passed from the outer court into the Holy Place of fellowship. We
   seem familiar with every nook and cranny of our friend's nature. And
   then it is comparatively unimportant how he appears to act; we know
   him.

   So it is in respect of God. At first we know Him through the testimony
   of others, and on the evidence of Scripture; but as time passes, with
   its everdeepening experiences of what God is, with those opportunities
   of converse that arise during years of prayer and communion, we get to
   know Him as He is and to trust Him implicitly. And when that point has
   been reached and passed, nothing afterwards can greatly move us.
   Instead of looking at God from the standpoint of his acts, we look at
   his dealings with us and all men from the standpoint of his heart.
   Though He put us on the altar, as Abraham did Isaac, and take the knife
   to slay us, we trust Him. If we die, it is to pass into a richer life.
   If He seem to forget and forsake us, it is only in appearance. His
   heart is yearning over us more than ever. God cannot do a thing which
   is not perfectly loving and wise and good. Oh to know Him thus!

   " Leaving the final issue In His hands

   Whose goodness knows no change, whose love is sure,

   Who sees, foresees, who cannot judge amiss."

   All the days of my warfare would I wait, till my release should come.
   Job xiv. 14 (R.V.).

   THE Lord Jesus has chosen us to be his soldiers. We are in the midst of
   a great campaign: let us endure hardness, as good soldiers of Jesus
   Christ, and strive above all things to please Him (2 Tim. ii. 4).
   Amongst other things, let us be sure not to entangle ourselves in the
   affairs of this life. What purpose could a soldier serve who insisted
   on taking all his household goods with him on the march!

   There is no pause in the warfare. We can never, like Gideon's soldiers,
   throw ourselves on the bank and quaff the water at our leisure. Every
   bush may hide a sharp-shooter; every brake an ambuscade. It becomes us
   to watch and pray; to keep on our harness of armour; to be on the alert
   for our Captain's voice. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
   against the hosts of wicked spirits in the heavenly places; we need to
   be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, and to take unto
   ourselves the whole armour of God, that we may be able to withstand in
   the evil day, and having done all to stand.

   But the release will come at last. When the soldier has fought the good
   fight, the time of his departure will come, and he will go in to
   receive the crown which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give in
   that day. "Come," said the dying Havelock to his son, "and see how a
   Christian can die." Sometimes it demands more of a soldier's courage to
   wait than to charge. Remember that long waiting on the field at
   Waterloo, when the day passed from morning to evening. If you can do
   nothing else, wait. Be steadfast, immovable: lying still to suffer, to
   bear, to endure. This is fighting of the noblest sort.

   Thou restrainest prayer before God. Job xv. 4.

   JOB'S friends were bent on discovering the cause of his sufferings in
   some secret failure and declension. This is why Eliphaz accused him so
   groundlessly. They did not know of those secret habits of intercession
   described in the first chapter. But this charge is eminently true of
   some professing Christians.

   They restrain private prayer. -- The closet door is too seldom shut
   behind them, or it is kept shut for to brief a period. They do not give
   themselves time to get into the mid-current of intercession and be
   borne forward by it whither it will. The voice of the Holy Spirit is
   barely able to assert itself amid the hubbub of voices within. They are
   so taken up with speaking of the Lord, or working for Him, that they
   slur over private audiences with Himself.

   They restrain social prayer. -- Their minister never them in the
   gatherings for intercession on behalf of the work of the Church and the
   salvation of the lost. They forsake the assembling of themselves with
   the saints. Like Thomas, they are absent from the gathering in the
   upper room, and miss the smile of the Lord.

   They restrain family prayer. -- Surely we ought to gather at least once
   a day around the family altar. Where Abraham pitched his tent he
   erected the altar. A prayerless home is apt to become a worldly and
   unhappy one. There is no such keystone to the arch of home-life and
   home-love, as the habit of family worship.

   How foolish, how short-sighted, how sinful, it is to restrain prayer!
   What wonder that your soul is famished when you fail to feed it, or
   impoverished when you neglect intercourse with heaven!
     __________________________________________________________________

   I was at ease, and He brake me asunder. Job xvi. 12 (R.V.).

   THE other day, it was the Lord's Day morning, two sparrows fell from
   the leads of my church into the vestry, which has a lofty glass
   skylight. As soon as they had recovered from their astonishment at
   finding themselves prisoners, they flew up against this skylight as
   though to break through it to the open heaven, and then round and round
   the room. They were desperately afraid of myself and the verger, whom I
   had called, not realizing that we were as anxious as they to get them
   out again into the air. The only thing we could do to help them was to
   keep them from alighting to rest; so with long brooms and soft missiles
   we constantly drove them from every cornice and picture-frame on which
   they alighted, till they fell exhausted, and with panting breasts, to
   the ground. Then we captured them and set them free. They might have
   said many a time, in the course of that encounter, "We were at case,
   and they brake us asunder; they also set us up for their mark." But if
   they could review that episode now, they would doubtless see that it
   was love which forbade them to rest anywhere in the vestry, because it
   desired to give them their fullest liberty.

   So with Job. God would not allow him to rest in anything short of the
   best, and therefore He broke up his nest. Is not this the key to his
   dealings with you? Oh, believe that behind the perpetual change and
   displacement of your life God is leading you into the glorious liberty
   of his children!

   "Therefore to whom turn I but Thee, the ineffable Name?

   Builder and Maker Thou of houses not made with hands!

   What? have fear of change from Thee who art ever the same?

   Doubt that Thy power can fill the heart that Thy power expands?

   There shall never be one lost good."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Yet shall the righteous hold on his way. Job xvii. 9 (R.V.).

   WHEN the real life of God enters the soul, it persists there. Genuine
   religion is shown by its power of persistence. Anything short of a
   Godgiven faith will sooner or later fail. It may run well for a time,
   but its pace will inevitably slacken till it comes to a stand. The
   youths faint and are weary, and the young men utterly fall. The seed
   sown on the rock springs up quickly, and as quickly dies down and
   perishes. But where there is the rooting and grounding in God, there is
   a perpetuity and persistence which outlives all storms and survives all
   resistance.

   You shall hold on your way because Jesus holds you in his strong hand.
   He is your Shepherd; He has vanquished all your foes, and you shall
   never perish.

   You shall hold on your way because the Father has designed through you
   to glorify his Son; and there must be no gaps in his crown where jewels
   ought to be.

   You shall hold on your way because the Holy Spirit has deigned to make
   you his residence and home; and He is within you the perennial spring
   of a holy life.

   It is said that there was once a debate in heaven, as to which kind of
   life needed most of God's grace. That of a man who after a lifetime of
   gross sins was converted at the eleventh hour, or of a man that for his
   whole career had been kept from destruction. And finally the latter was
   agreed to be the most conspicuous miracle. And there is no doubt that
   this is so. Yet for this also shall God's grace avail: and He shall
   enable thee to hold on thy way till heaven open to thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The king of terrors. Job xviii. 14.

   S0 the ancients spoke of death. They were constantly pursued by the
   dread of the unknown. Every unpeopled or distant spot was the haunt and
   dwellingplace of evil and dreadful objects. But the grave, and the
   world beyond, were above all terrible, and death the King of Terrors.
   It is difficult for us, who inherit centuries of Christian teaching, to
   realize how dark and fearsome was all the realm that lay under the
   dominion of death and the grave. What a shiver in those words, King of
   Terrors!

   But for us how vast the contrast! Jesus has abolished death, and
   brought life and immortality to light. He has gone through the grave,
   and come again to assure us that it is the back door into our Father's
   house, with its many mansions. At his girdle hang the keys of death and
   Hades; none can shut the door when He opens it, and none open when He
   keeps it shut. He was Himself dead; but He lives for evermore, and
   comes to the side of each dying saint to escort him through the valley
   to his own bright abode.

   There is something better. In the case of immense numbers, who shall be
   alive and remain when He comes again, death will be entirely evaded.
   "He that liveth and believeth in Him shall never die." They shall be
   caught away to meet the Lord in the air. Suddenly, in the twinkling of
   an eye, this mortal shall put on immortality, this corruptible
   incorruption. At his coming the grave shall be despoiled of its
   treasures, and death shall miss its expected prey.

   " death, where is thy sting! grave, where is thy victory! Thanks be to
   God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
     __________________________________________________________________

   I know that my Redeemer liveth. Job xix. 25.

   THOSE words express the deepest and most radiant conviction of
   believing hearts. "He lives, the great Redeemer lives!" Man did his
   worst; the nail, the cross, the spear, were bitter; but He liveth!
   Death stood over Him as a vanquished foe; but He liveth! Captain
   Sepulchre and his henchman Corruption held earnest colloquy together
   about the best method of detaining Him; but He liveth! He ever liveth:
   and because He continueth ever, He hath an unchangeable priesthood.

   But it is not probable that his words meant all this to Job. The word
   translated "Redeemer " is Goel -- the nearest kinsman, sworn to avenge
   the wrongs of blood relations. This conception of the kinsman avenger
   has been always in vogue in the East, where the populations are
   scattered and migratory, and our system of law impossible. Beyond the
   heavens Job thought there lived a Kinsman, who saw all his sufferings,
   and pitied, and would one day appear on earth to vindicate his
   innocence and avenge his wrongs. He was content to leave the case with
   Him, sure that He would not fail, as his friends had done.

   Beyond the sorrows and anguish of time he should yet see God; and he
   longed to see Him, that he might learn the secret purpose, which
   explained the sorrow of his lot. He had no dread of that momentous
   event, since his Goel would be there to stand beside him.

   "Sudden the Worst turns the Best to the brave,

   The black minute's at end!--

   And the Elements' rage, the fiend voices that rave,

   Shall dwindle, shall blend,

   Shall change, shall become, -- first a Peace out of Pain,

   Then a Light, then thy breast."
     __________________________________________________________________

   This is the portion of a wicked man from God. Job xx. 29.

   REPEATEDLY in reading this book we are reminded of the strong
   convictions entertained by thoughtful men among these Eastern peoples,
   of the sure connection between wrong-doing and its bitter penalty. The
   friends of the sufferer express their opinions in cold-blooded and
   unfeeling words; but we can detect their intense convictions beneath
   all -- that special suffering indicates the presence of special sin,
   and that all wickedness is sooner or later brought to light and
   punished.

   We are less able to follow the track of God's providences in these
   crowded, hurrying days; but there can be little doubt of the connection
   between wrong-doing and punishment. The law is immutable. As a man
   soweth, so shall be also reap. The triumphing of the wicked is short,
   and the joy of the godless but for a moment. He shall disgorge his
   wealth; he shall suck the poison of asps in the remorse and bitterness
   of his soul; the heavens shall reveal his iniquity; and his descendants
   shall seek favour of the poor. These things are still to be seen among
   us, in the rise and fall of proud men and their families.

   Let us go into the sanctuary of God, and consider their latter end; and
   as we contrast it with that of the poorest of his children, we shall
   find no reason to envy them. Even though no human tribunal sentence
   them, they carry the harpoon in their heart, and sooner or later it
   will bring them to a certain and awful doom. It cannot be otherwise
   whilst God is God. The psalmist said:

   "I have seen the wicked in great power,

   And spreading himself like a green bay tree;

   Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Shall any teach God knowledge? Job xxi. 22.

   WE cannot tell God anything He does not know already. The most fervent
   and full of our prayers simply unfold in word all that has been patent
   to his loving, pitying eye. This does not make prayer needless; on the
   contrary, it incites to prayer, since it is pleasant to talk with one
   who knows the whole case perfectly; and it is a relief to feel that
   God's answers depend -- not on the information we bring Him, or even on
   the specific requests we make, but -- on his infinite and perfect
   acquaintance with circumstances and conditions of which we are
   altogether ignorant.

   "Your Father knoweth." Quicker than lightning is his notice of every
   transition in your inner life -- of your downsittings and your
   uprisings; of every thought in your heart; every word on your tongue;
   of the fretting of that inward cross; of the anguish of that stake in
   your flesh; of the enemy that, like a sword in your bones, reproaches
   you with the derisive challenge. "Thou compassest my path and my lying
   down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in
   my tongue, but, lo, Lord, thou knowest it altogether." Yes, He knows it
   all, and loves you better than you know.

   Do not presume to dictate to Him; do not dare to say that some other
   way would be better, some other lot more likely to develop your best
   self. He knows every track by which to bring sons to glory; and that He
   has chosen this one is a positive proof that it is the best, the one
   most adapted to your idiosyncrasies and needs. His ways are, higher
   than your ways, and his thoughts than your thoughts. You could not
   teach Him knowledge, or increase his love -- then trust both.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If thou return to the Almighty. Job xxii. 23.

   THESE words introduce a most exquisite picture of the blessings
   consequent on return to God. They do not fit the case of Job, to whom
   they were addressed, because he had not left God; and they sound
   strange as coming from the mouth of Eliphaz. Still they are full of
   sublime truth.

   There are three conditions. -- We must retrace the steps of our
   backsliding and wandering lives. We must put away unrighteousness from
   our home-life and business engagements, so that the tent may be free
   from idols. We must be content to lay our most treasured possessions in
   the dust at God's feet for Him to deal with as He pleases.

   There are four consequences. -- Whatever we give up for God, we shall
   find again in Him; He shall become our treasure. Prayer shall have new
   zest, new success; be full of delight; become the interchange of
   face-to-face fellowship. There shall be more certainty and permanence
   in our decisions and achievements. Our decrees shall stand, our work
   shall last, our path shall be illumined with light. Trouble and trial
   shall depress us for only a brief space, like the passing of an
   Atlantic breaker over a lighthouse rock, whilst a glad relief shall
   always follow close on disaster.

   Let us ask for all this in our daily prayer. God, be my precious
   silver; give me delight in Thee; hear my prayers; may I decree what
   Thou canst establish; let Thy light shine on my ways; lift me up above
   all my depressions and fears -- that I may stretch out a strong hand to
   those who are in trouble.

   "Oh, strengthen me, that while I stand

   Firm on the Rock, and strong In Thee,

   I may stretch out a loving hand

   To wrestlers with the troubled sea."
     __________________________________________________________________

   O that I knew where I might find Him, that I might come even to his
   seat! Job xxiii. 3.

   POOR tempest-driven man, he knew not that God was intimately near,
   nearer than breathing. There was no need for him to go forward and
   backward, on the right hand or the left. The Lord his God was nigh him,
   even in his heart; for his throne was pitched there on the sands of the
   desert, between Job and his pitiless accusers.

   Thou needest not speak like this. Thou knowest where to find Him; thou
   canst find the way to his seat. He is to be found in Jesus, seated on
   the mercy-seat; in that room where thou sittest reading these words; in
   that railway train or store. No need to ascend into heaven, or descend
   into the abyss. Thou couldst not be nearer God, if thou wert in heaven.
   True, the obscuring vail shall be then removed.

   "And without a screen,

   At one burst shall be seen,

   The Presence in which we have ever been";

   but the dropping- of the scales from our eyes will not make us nearer
   God than we are at this moment.

   Now go to his seat, just in front of thee. Order thy cause before Him,
   and argue it. Wait to know the words with which He shall answer thee,
   and understand his reply. Only be sure that He will not contend against
   thee with his great power. Sometimes we are so bewildered and perplexed
   that we lose the realizing sense of God's presence; but there is no
   real difference. God is not really farther away; and nothing glorifies
   and pleases Him more than for us to go on speaking with Him as though
   we could see his face, and realize his embrace. Be still for a moment,
   and say, reverently and believingly: Lo, God is in this place.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Yet a little while, and they are gone. Job xxiv. 24 (R.V.).

   JOB here describes the insecurity of the wicked. He may have raged
   against the poor and innocent; but in a moment he comes down to Sheol,
   is hurried to stand before his Maker to receive his sentence. As he had
   treated the poor, so he is treated. As he had devoured the houses of
   the innocent, so he is devoured. "How are they become a desolation in a
   moment! They are utterly consumed with terrors. As a dream when one
   awaketh; so, Lord, when Thou awakest, Thou shalt despise their image."

   For those who fear God there is a greatly contrasted lot. They receive
   a kingdom that cannot be moved. Zion may be a desolation, and Jerusalem
   a wilderness; the holy and beautiful institutions in which their early
   religious impressions were made may crumble; but they are come to the
   heavenly Jerusalem. The removing of those things that are capable of
   being shaken only makes more apparent those which cannot be shaken.

   Where do you build your nest? In the trees of this world, that sway in
   the tempest, or may be hewn down by the woodman's axe; or have you
   learnt to build in the clefts of the Rock of Ages? Is your treasure in
   human friendships, which may change or be cut in twain by the sharp
   shears of death; or is it in the love of God, the unchangeable and
   everlasting Lover of souls? Let us look off from ourselves; from that
   diseased introspection that so confuses and dims our life; from the old
   fears that made us tremble and the old matters of which we must speak
   no more. And let us look upward and forward to that near future, which
   is so much larger and better than the past has been, and where we shall
   attain more than the heights of our dreams.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How then can man be just with God? Job xxv. 4 (R.V.).

   THIS is the question of the ages. Man knows that he is as a worm, and
   worse. For no animal, however humble, has consciously and determinedly
   broken the law of God, and defiled its nature.

   Our first effort is to go about to establish a righteousness of our
   own. Repeated failure only aggravates our misery and chagrin, till we
   fall helpless at the foot of Sinai. Our vows are broken, the law of God
   lies shivered around us, the thunders and lightnings make us afraid.
   Then God in the Person of Jesus comes to our help. First, He meets and
   satisfies the demands of the broken law, so that it can ask no more.
   With his own hands He works out, and brings in, everlasting
   righteousness. And finally, He produces in us that faith by which his
   finished work is applied to our conscience and heart.

   By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for
   by the law is the knowledge of sin. But we are justified freely by his
   grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God hath set
   forth to be a propitiation. God is Himself the Justifier of the
   ungodly. "Whom He called, them He also justified." He takes off the
   filthy garments, and clothes us in change of raiment.

   But the condition is faith. We must believe in Him who justifieth the
   ungodly. They who believe are justified from all things. Being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus
   Christ. We are not saved by believing about his work, but in Himself.
   The Greek of John iii. 16 might be rendered, Whosoever even believeth
   into Him. The motion of faith is ever towards the heart of Him who
   died, and rose, and lives. Then through our faith the Spirit produces a
   holy character.
     __________________________________________________________________

   How small a whisper do we hear of Him! Job xxvi. 14 (R.V.).

   JOB in thought passes through the universe. Sheol stands for the grave
   and the unseen world; Abaddon, for Satan, or for the great reservoirs
   in which the destructive agencies of creation have their home. With a
   marvellous anticipation of the conclusions of modern science, he speaks
   of the world as pendant in space. He passes to the confines of light
   and darkness, rides on the wings of the wind, discourses of the clouds,
   skims the mighty surface of the sea. All this, however, he deems as the
   outskirts of God's ways. It is but a whisper compared to the mighty
   thunder of his glory and power. If this is a whisper, what must the
   thunder be! If this universe is but a flower on the meadows of God's
   life, what must not God Himself be!

   Perhaps we know something more of the thunder of his power than Job
   could, because we have stood beneath Calvary and seen Jesus die, and He
   is the wisdom and power of God; yea, we have witnessed the exceeding
   greatness of his power, according to the working of the strength of his
   might, which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead.

   Who of us can fathom or understand the power of God? But what a comfort
   to know that it is an attribute of his heart. God is not power, but He
   is love, and his love throbs through and commands his power. Be
   reverent when you kneel before the great and mighty God; but believe
   that all his power is engaged on the side of his weakest, needist
   child. And more: cease not to wait upon God until He endue you with his
   mighty power, for service and for daily living. A Nasmyth hammer can
   break a nutshell without crushing or touching the kernel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let go. Job xxvii. 6.

   JOB had an ideal and clung to it. Have you such? A vision of what you
   may be, and, by the grace of God, will aim at being. Bishop Westcott
   says: -- "The vision of the ideal guards monotony of work from becoming
   monotony of life." Bitter indeed is life for those who have not seen
   the heavenly vision, or heard the calling upward of the voice that
   says, Come up hither. Any life looks more interesting and attractive
   when the light of our ideal falls on it, and we realize that every yard
   leads somewhere, and every step is one nearer the goal. So some one has
   suggested that "If we cannot realize our ideal, we may at least
   idealize our real."

   But there are many hindrances, many adverse influences to combat, many
   suggestions that we should let go our ideal. We have so often failed,
   slipped where we thought we should stand, limped where we thought to
   overcome by wrestling. The crags are so steep, the encouragement we
   receive from fellow-climbers so scant, the dissuasions and
   misconstructions -- like those Job had from his friends -- so many. But
   Jesus who inspired the ideal waits to realize it, if only you will open
   your heart and let Him enter. Do you hunger and thirst? then He will
   satisfy. He does not tantalize and disappoint the seeking soul.

   "Have we not all, amid life's petty strife,

   Some pure ideal of a noble life

   That once seemed possible? It was. And yet

   We lost it in this daily jar and fret,

   And now live idle in a vague regret.

   but still our place is kept, and it will wait.

   Ready for us to fill it, soon or late:

   No star is ever lost we once have seen --

   We always may be what we might have been.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The deep saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
   Job xxviii. 14 (R.V.).

   In this sublime chapter the holy soul goes in quest of wisdom, which is
   the perfect balance of the moral and intellectual attributes of the
   soul; that knowledge of God, and life, and truth, which is only
   possible when the eyes of the heart have been enlightened to know; that
   radiancy of spirit which is enlightened and illuminated with God who is
   HimseIf the Light.

   In a marvellous description of mining operations, which would arrest
   any company of miners in the world, if read from the Revised Version,
   Job declares it is not to be found in the deep. From one quarter of the
   universe after another, he receives the intelligence that it is not
   there. God alone has the secret; He only can communicate it, or give
   the disposition to appreciate and receive.

   We must deal with God. Looking away from every other source of
   illumination and satisfaction, we must have close and searching
   fellowship with Him. Dr. Gordon was wont to say that evangelical faith
   consists not in a glance alone, but in a gaze. "We live in a very busy,
   perspiring time, when a thousand clamant calls assail us on every side;
   but we must have more time for visions if we would be well equipped for
   our tasks." Let us then turn from the quarters where we have been
   accustomed to draw our supplies -- broken cisterns, with uncertain and
   brackish water -- and let us come to God, the eternal source of life
   and peace. Love and rest we want, Thy love and rest, oh, give us! From
   men and things; from the mine, the deep, and the sea; from the murmur
   of human voices, and the crosslights of human interests, we come back
   to Thee, our Home.

   Oh that I were as in the months of old! Job xxix. 2 (R.V.).

   WE are irresistibly reminded of Cowper's sad complaint: --

   What peaceful hours I once enjoyed!

   How sweet their memory still;

   But they have left an aching void

   The world can never fill."

   We are all prone to think that the earliest days were the best; and it
   is quite possible they were. But we must carefully distinguish between
   the exchange of the freshness and novelty of our first love for a
   deepening and maturing love, and the loss of love. The streamlet may
   not babble so cheerily, but there may be more water in the river. We
   lose the green Spring, but is it not better to have the intense light
   of Autumn in which the fruits ripen? There may not be so much ecstasy,
   but there may be stronger, deeper experience. We should not reckon our
   position in God's sight by our raptures, and count ourselves
   retrograding because they have gone; there is something better than
   rapture: the peace of a settled understanding and unvarying faith.

   Still, if it be really so, that you have left the old place on the
   bosom or at the feet of Christ, that your love is cooling and your
   spirituality waning, I beseech thee, get back! Remember whence thou art
   fallen, and repent, and do the first works. Jesus yearns to reinstate
   thee, and has permitted this restless longing for the past to come,
   that it may be with thee as in the months of old. Again his lamp shall
   shine above thy head, and the secret of the Lord shall be upon thy
   tent; thy steps shall be washed with butter, and the rock pour out
   rivers of oil; thy roots shall spread to the waters, and the dew shall
   lie all night upon thy branch.
     __________________________________________________________________

   I cry unto Thee, and Thou dost not answer me. Job xxx. 20 (R.V.).

   IT may have seemed so to the sufferer; but there is not a cry that goes
   from the anguished soul which does not ring a bell in the very heart of
   God, where the Man of Sorrows waits, touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities.

   I have sometimes gone to a telephone office, and have rung the bell,
   asking to be put in connection with my friend, but it has seemed
   impossible to get at him; either he has been engaged or absent, and one
   has found oneself speaking to a stranger, and the voice which replied
   has been unfamiliar. Thoroughly disappointed, one turns away. But this
   is never the case with God. And the comfort is, that He is most quick
   to succour those whose cry is lowest. As a mother goes about her work,
   she is less sensitive to the trains that thunder past, and the heavy
   drays, and the laughter of boisterous health, than to the stifled cry
   of her little invalid; and if there could be one thing more sure than
   another of awakening God's immediate response, it would be such broken
   cries as pain elicited from Job.

   But the answer will come -- nay, it is on its way, timed to arrive in
   the fourth watch of the night. Perhaps the delay is the answer, because
   the heart needs to be prepared to receive the great gift when it comes.
   Perhaps, like the Syrophenician woman, you have to give Christ his
   right place as Lord, and take yours amongst the dogs. Perhaps the
   answer is coming all the time by one door, whilst you are looking for
   it through another; but you cannot and must not say that God is not
   answering. All the time you are crying, the answer is to your hand,
   awaiting your appropriation. Go to the post-office for the letter:
   hasten to the landing-stage for the ship -- it is in.

   Mine integrity. Job xxxi. 6.

   INTEGRITY is from the Latin word integrita, wholeness. It means
   whole-heartedness. It is interesting in this chapter to see what, in
   Job's estimation, it involved.

   v.1. Purity in the look.

   v.7. Cleanliness of the hands.

   v.13. Thoughtfulness for domestic servants and underlings.

   v.16. Justice to the poor and the widow.

   v.17. Willingness to share morsels, and to be a father to the
   fatherless.

   v.19, 20. Clothing for the naked.

   v.21. The refusal to depute to others help which one might render.

   v.24.. The heart weaned from the love of gold.

   v.26. Refusal to turn aside to idols.

   v.29. Inability to rejoice at the destruction of those who had derided
   and hated.

   v. 33. The frank confession of wrong-doing.

   It becomes us prayerfully to go over these items, and use them as the
   catechism of our soul; for if this was the standard of character for
   one who lived so many centuries before the full revelation of Christ,
   what should not our standard be! How impossible, however, it is to live
   like this from without! We must enshrine within us the blessed Spirit
   of God, who alone originates and maintains that perfect love to God and
   man which compared to Job's maxims is as the heart to the body. Law is
   given as the expression of God's will for the regulation of life: but
   it is impossible to keep the law till we have the love; and it is
   impossible to have the love until we have the Lord Jesus Christ,
   through the Holy Ghost.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth
   understanding. Job xxxii. 8 (R.V.).

   ELIHU had waited whilst the three elder men said all that was in their
   hearts. He now excuses his youth and demands audience, because so
   conscious that the breath of inspiration had entered his soul. Wisdom
   is not with age; but wherever the heart is freely open to God, He will
   make it wise. We have received not the spirit which is of the world,
   but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know.

   George Fox tells us that though he read the Scriptures which spoke of
   Christ and of God, yet he knew Him not till He who had the key did
   open. "Then the Lord gently led me along and let me see his love which
   was endless and eternal, surpassing all the knowledge that men have in
   the natural state, or can get by history or books. I had not fellowship
   with any people, priests or professors, but with Christ, who hath the
   key, and opened the door of life and light unto me. His one message was
   the necessity of the Inner Light, the inward witness of the Spirit, his
   secret revelations of truth to the soul. "

   This distinction needs to be deeply pondered. We have been trying to
   know God by the intellect, by reading the Bible intellectually, by
   endeavouring to apprehend human systems. There is, however, a deeper
   and truer method. "There is a spirit in man!" Open your spirit to the
   Divine Spirit as you open a window to the sunny air. Instantly God
   enters and fills. The Spirit witnesses with our spirit. The inbreathed
   life of God gives us light. We know by intuition, by fellowship with
   God, by direct vision, what the wise of this world could never
   discover.
     __________________________________________________________________

   If there be with him a messenger, an interpreter. Job xxxiii. 23.

   GOD is greater than man, and by his love seeks to hold man back from
   his purpose. Sometimes He comes in the visions of the night; sometimes
   in pain and sickness. But we are too dull to understand the inner
   reason of God's endeavours to deliver us from the brink of destruction;
   and therefore we need an interpreter, one among a thousand, to explain
   the meaning of his dealings, and to show us the way in which we should
   amend our ways. How often has the sick visitor, the minister, the
   friend, interpreted God's purpose, enabling us to see light in his
   light. There are few higher offices in this world than to act in this
   way between God and our fellows.

   To perform this function, however, we need to understand two languages;
   the one of the throne, obtained from deep and intimate converse with
   our Father, while the other is man's native language of pain and
   sorrow. Each must be spoken perfectly before we can interpret: --

   "And to the height of this great argument

   Assert eternal Providence,

   And justify the ways of God to man."

   But, as Bunyan truly says, the best Interpreter is the Holy Spirit. As
   soon as the Pilgrim has passed the Wicket-gate, he is conducted through
   the Interpreter's house by the Interpreter Himself. Are you perplexed
   as to the meaning of God's Word, the dealings of God's providence, the
   mystery of God's moral government? Ask the Holy Spirit to lead you
   through chamber after chamber, unfolding to you the mysteries of the
   kingdom of heaven. They are for babes -- for the childlike and pure in
   heart. He will show you wondrous things out of his law.

   He giveth quietness. Job xxxiv. 29.

   QUIETNESS amid the accusations of Satan. -- The great accuser points to
   the stains of our past lives, by which we have defiled our robes and
   those of others; he says that we shall fall again and again; he imputes
   evil motives to our holiest actions, and detects flaws in our most
   sacred services; he raises so great a hubbub that we can hardly hear
   another voice within our souls. Then the great Intercessor arises and
   saith, "The Lord rebuke thee, Satan; the Lord that hath chosen
   Jerusalem rebuke thee: I have loved with an everlasting love, I have
   paid the ransom. So "He giveth quietness."

   Quietness amid the dash of the storm. -- We sail the lake with Him
   still, and as we reach its middle waters, far from land, under midnight
   skies, suddenly a great storm sweeps down. Earth and hell seem arrayed
   against us, and each billow threatens to overwhelm. Then He arises from
   his sleep, and rebukes the winds and the waves; his hand waves
   benediction and repose over the rage of the tempestuous elements. His
   voice is heard above the scream of the wind in the cordage and the
   conflict of the billows. Peace, be still! Can you not hear it? And
   there is instantly a great calm. "He giveth quietness."

   Quietness amid the loss of inward consolations. -- He sometimes
   withdraws these, because we make to much of them. We are tempted to
   look at our joy, our ecstasies, our transports, or our visions, with
   too great complacency. Then love, for love's sake, withdraws them. But,
   by his grace, He leads us to distinguish between them and Himself. He
   draws nigh, and whispers the assurance of his presence. Thus an
   infinite calm comes to keep our heart and mind. "He giveth quietness."
     __________________________________________________________________

   None saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night? Job
   xxxv. 10.

   DO you have sleepless nights, tossing on the hot pillow, and watching
   for the first glint of dawn? Ask the Divine Spirit to enable you to fix
   your thoughts on God, your Maker, and believe that He can fill those
   lonely, dreary hours with song.

   Is yours the night of doubt? -- A holy man tells us that once as he was
   sitting by the fire, a great cloud came over him, and a temptation
   beset him to think that all things came by nature; and as he sat still
   under it, and let it alone, a living hope arose in him, and a true
   voice said, "There is a living God who made all things." And
   immediately the cloud and temptation vanished away, and life rose over
   it all. His heart was glad, and he praised the living God. Was not this
   a song in the night?

   Is yours the night of bereavement? -- Is it not often to such God draws
   near, and assures the mourner that the Lord had need of its beloved,
   and called "the eager, earnest spirit to stand in the bright throng of
   the invisible, liberated, radiant, active, intent on some high
   mission"; and as the thought enters, is there not the beginning of a
   song?

   Is yours the night of discouragement and fancied or actual failure? --
   No one understands you, your friends reproach; but your Maker draws
   nigh, and gives you a song -- the song of hope, the song which is
   harmonious with the strong, deep music of his providence. Be ready to
   sing the songs that your Maker gives.

   "What then? Shall we sit idly down and say

   'The night hath come; it is no longer day'?

   . . . . . . . . .

   Yet as the evening twilight fades away,

   The sky is filled with stars, invisible to day."

   Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any. Job xxxvi. 5.

   WHAT entrancing assurances are contained in this and the preceding
   sentence! To think that in all our wayfarings through this world One
   that is perfect in knowledge is always with us, and One that is mighty
   is pledged to bring us through! Nothing could be desired beside. This
   makes prayer new. It is a child's confidential whisper to the One who
   is attent to the lowest murmur, who cannot forget, who will not
   relinquish a purpose which He has formed though years pass, and who is
   able to do exceeding abundantly.

   It is because God is so great that He despises none. If He were less
   than infinite, He might overlook. The boundlessness of his being has no
   ebb, fails of no soul He has made, and is as much at any one point as
   if He had no care or thought beside. In fact, those that man despises
   stand the best chance with God. Just because no one else cares for
   them, he must; just because no one else will help them, He will. This
   is necessary to his nature.

   When a philanthropist adopts a certain lapsed section of the community,
   he does so because no one else will. It becomes a matter of honour with
   him that none of these, outcast by all else, should miss his help. And
   God has constituted Himself Champion, Guardian, and Saviour, of all who
   have no help from their fellows. Friendless, forlorn, helpless,
   despised, He recognises and meets the claim of their urgent necessity.
   Bruised reeds, bits of smoking tow, half-consumed fire-brands, lost
   sheep, prodigal sons, waifs and strays, homeless, destitute, neglected
   -- these have a first claim on the Almightiness of the living God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Men see not the bright light which is in the clouds. Job xxxvii. 21.

   THE world owes much of its beauty to cloudland. The unchanging blue of
   the Italian sky hardly compensates for the changefulness and glory of
   the clouds. Clouds also are the cisterns of the rain. Earth would
   become a wilderness apart from their ministry. There are clouds in
   human life, shadowing, refreshing, and sometimes draping it in
   blackness of night; but there is never a cloud without its bright
   light. "I do set my bow in the cloud! "

   If only we could see the clouds from the other side where they lie in
   billowy glory, bathed in the light they intercept, like heaped ranges
   of Alps, we should be amazed at their splendid magnificence. We look at
   their under side; but who shall describe the bright light that bathes
   their summits, and searches their valleys, and is reflected from every
   pinnacle of their expanse? Is not every drop drinking in health-giving
   qualities, which it will carry to the earth?

   child of God! If you could see your sorrows and troubles from the other
   side; if instead of looking up at them from earth, you would look down
   on them from the heavenly places where you sit with Christ; if you knew
   how they are reflecting in prismatic beauty before the gaze of heaven,
   the bright light of Christ's face -- you would be content that they
   should cast their deep shadows over the mountain slopes of existence.
   Only remember that clouds are always moving, and passing before God's
   cleansing wind.

   "Green pastures are before me, which yet I have not seen;

   Bright skies will soon be o'er me, where the dark clouds have been:

   My hope I cannot measure, my path of life is free;

   My Saviour hath my treasure, and He will walk with me."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades? Job xxxviii. 31 (R.V.).

   THE seven stars of the Pleiades always stand for the sweet influences
   of spring; Orion for the storm and tempest. In this sublime catechism,
   Jehovah asks Job if he has any control over the One or the other. As it
   is with the year, so with our life.

   There are times when the PLEIADEs are in the ascendant. The winter is
   over and gone, the time of the singing of birds is come. Doves coo
   their love notes in the trees, and the flowers gem the soil. Days of
   hope, of radiant light, of ecstatic joy! Days in which God seems to be
   making a new heaven and a new earth within us! Days when our Beloved
   shows Himself through the lattice-work, and says, "Come, my beloved!"
   Oh, tender influences of the Pleiades, we would that ye might ever
   stay, filling us with immortal youth! When God bids them shine, no one
   can bind them. When He gives joy, none can give sorrow. No mortal man
   can restrain the outburst of Nature's spring. You might as well stay
   the resurrection of the Son of God and his saints!

   But ORION has his work as well. Storms come; the drenching rain veils
   the landscape; the mighty billows are lashed to fury. But all works for
   good. The blast in the forest snaps off dead wood. The rain fills up
   the wells. Frost pulverises the earth. When God binds Orion, man cannot
   unloose him; "No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper." But
   when the Almighty unlooses Orion, like another Samson, he does his work
   of devastation, before which we must find refuge in the cleft of the
   Rock.

   "God sendeth sun,

   He sendeth shower,

   Alike they're needful for the flower."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Knowest thou? Job xxxix. 1.

   THE catechism of this chapter is designed to convince man of his
   ignorance. How little he knows of nature! Even though centuries of
   investigation and research have passed, there are still many questions
   which baffle us. And if we know so little of tile Creator's handiwork,
   how much less do we know of Himself, or the principles on which He
   acts!

   The knowledge of God is not intellectual, but moral and spiritual.
   Things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, are made known to Love and
   Obedience. Let the Love of God be shed through the heart, and the will
   of God be the ruling principle of life, and there will be given a
   knowledge of God which the research of the investigator could never
   gain. "We have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit
   which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us
   of God . . . they are spiritually discerned." Knowest thou?

   Dost thou know the exceeding greatness of his power, which He wrought
   in the Resurrection of thy Lord -- that it is all around thee waiting
   to do as much for thee also; lifting thee, dead weight as thou art, to
   sit in the heavenlies?

   Dost thou know the hope of his calling to a life within the vail, with
   the vail behind thee, and the light of the Shekinah ever on thy face?

   Dost thou know the riches of his glorious indwelling, that He is
   prepared so to infill thee, that thou shalt partake of the very life
   wherewith He liveth and reigneth evermore?

   Dost thou know the length, and breadth, and depth, and height, of the
   love that passeth knowledge; and Christ Jesus the Lord?
     __________________________________________________________________

   I am of small account; what shall I answer Thee? I lay mine hand upon
   my mouth. Job xl. 4.

   WHAT a different tone is here! This is be who so vehemently protested
   his innocence, and defended himself against the attacks of his
   accusers. The Master is come, and the servant who had contended with
   his fellows takes a lowly place of humility and silence.

   The first step in the noblest life, possible to any of us, is to learn
   and say that we are of small account. We may learn it by successive and
   perpetual failures which abash and confound us. It is better to learn
   it by seeing the light of God rise in majesty above the loftiest of
   earth's mountains. "When I was young," said Gounod to a friend, "I used
   to talk of 'I and Mozart.' Later I said, 'Mozart and I.' But now I only
   say 'Mozart."' Substitute God, and you have the true story of many a
   soul.

   The next step is to choke back words, and lay the hand on the mouth.
   Silence and meditation! Not arguing or contending! Not complaining or
   murmuring! Not cavilling or criticising! But just being still -- still,
   that you may feel God near; still, that you may hear Him speak. "Take
   heed of many words," said George Fox; "keep down, keep low, that
   nothing may reign in you but life itself."

   The greatest saints avoided, when they could, the society of men, and
   did rather choose to live to God, in secret. A certain one said, "As
   oft as I have been among men I returned home less a man than I was
   before. Shut thy door upon thee, and call unto Jesus, thy Beloved. Stay
   with Him in thy closet, for thou shalt not find elsewhere so great
   peace." How good it would be to lay our hands on our mouths rather
   oftener, whether in silence with our fellows, or in the hour of secret
   prayer!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Who then is he that can stand before Me? Job xii. 10 (R.V.).

   THE first catechism had been on Job's knowledge; now it turns on his
   power. The pivot of the one was, Knowest thou? of the other, Canst
   thou? If a man cannot stand before one of God's creatures, how much
   less before the Creator! If we dread the wrath of the enraged
   crocodile, what should not be our dread before the wrath of the
   Eternal? Canst thou stand before Him? Canst thou strive against Him,
   with any hope of success? Canst thou force thyself, unbidden and unfit,
   into the presence of the Most Holy? Thou couldst not intrude on an
   earthly sovereign; how much less on Him, in whose sight the heavens are
   not clean?

   "Eternal light! eternal light!

   how pure the soul must be,

   When placed within thy searching light,

   It shrinks not, but with calm delight

   Can live, and look on Thee!"

   But Jesus can make it possible. Through Him we draw nigh to God. We
   have boldness to enter into the Holiest of All by his Blood. We may,
   through Him, be able to say, with Elijah, "Thus saith Jehovah, before
   whom I stand." Jesus is the minister of the heavenly sanctuary, and in
   virtue of his office He is able to bring us into, and maintain us
   within, the Most Holy Place. He comes out to take its by the hand; and
   then, having fulfilled in us the good pleasure of his will, He brings
   us in and places us before the face of God for ever. Like Solomon's
   servants, we evermore stand before the king, see his face, and hear his
   words.

   "The sons of ignorance and night

   May dwell in the Eternal Light,

   Through the Eternal Love."

   Now mine eye seeth Thee: wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust
   and ashes. Job xiii. 5, 6.

   THIS is the clue to the entire book. Here is a man, who was universally
   known as perfect and upright, one that feared God, and eschewed evil;
   who abounded in beneficent and loving ministries to all who were in
   need; to whom respect and love flowed in a full tide. He was not
   conscious of any failure in perfect obedience, or of secret sin;
   indeed, when his friends endeavoured to account for his unparalleled
   calamities by suggesting that there was some discrepancy between his
   outward reputation and inward consistency, he indignantly repelled the
   charge, and repudiated the impeachment.
