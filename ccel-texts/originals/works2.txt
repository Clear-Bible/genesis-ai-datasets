DISPUTATION I ON THEOLOGY

   As we are about again to commence our course of theological
   disputations under the auspices of our gracious God, we will previously
   treat a little on theology itself. II. By the word "theology" we do not
   understand a conception or a discourse of God himself, of which meaning
   it would properly admit; but we understand by it, "a conception" or "a
   discourse about God and things divine," according to its common use.
   III. It may be defined, the doctrine or science of the truth which is
   according to godliness, and which God has revealed to man that he may
   know God and divine things, may believe on him and may through faith
   perform to him the acts of love, fear, honour, worship and obedience,
   and obtain blessedness from him through union with him, to the divine
   glory. IV. The proximate and immediate object of this doctrine or
   science is, not God himself, but the duty and act of man which he is
   bound to perform to God. In theology, therefore, God himself must be
   considered as the object of this duty. V. On this account, theology is
   not a theoretical science or doctrine, but a practical one, requiring
   the action of the whole man, according to all and each of its parts --
   an action of the most transcendent description, answerable to the
   excellence of the object as far as the human capacity will permit. VI.
   From these premises, it follows that this doctrine is not expressed
   after the example of natural science, by which God knows himself, but
   after the example of that notion which God has willingly conceived
   within himself from all eternity, about the prescribing of that duty
   and of all things required for it.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION II ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THEOLOGY MUST BE TAUGHT

   It has long been a maxim with those philosophers who are the masters of
   method and order, that the theoretical sciences ought to be delivered
   in a synthetical order, but the practical in an analytical order, on
   which account, and because theology is a practical science, it follows
   that it must be treated according to the analytical method. II. Our
   discussion of this doctrine must therefore commence with its end, about
   which we must previously treat, with much brevity, both on its nature
   or what it is, and its qualities; we must then teach, throughout the
   entire discourse, the means for attaining the end, to which the
   obtaining of the end must be subjoined, and, at this, the whole
   discussion must terminate. III. For, according to this order, not only
   the whole doctrine itself, but likewise all its parts, will be treated
   from its principal end, and each article will obtain that place which
   belongs to it according to the principal relation which it has to its
   total and to the end of the whole. IV. But though we are easily
   satisfied with all treatises in which the body of divinity is
   explained, provided they agree according to the truth, at least in the
   chief and fundamental things, with the Scripture itself; and though we
   willingly give to all of them praise and commendation; yet, if on
   account only of inquiry into the order, and for the sake of treating
   the subject with greater accuracy, we may be allowed to explain what
   are our views and wishes. V. In the first place, the order in which the
   theology ascribed to God, and to the actions of God, is treated, seems
   to be inconvenient. Neither are we pleased with the division of
   theology into the pathological, and the therapeutic after a preface of
   the doctrine about the principles, the end and the efficient; nor with
   that, how accommodating soever it may be, in appearance, in which,
   after premising as its principles the word of God, and God himself, as
   the causes of our salvation, and therefore the works and effects of
   God, and man who is its subject is placed as a part of it. So neither
   do we receive satisfaction from the partition of theological science
   into the knowledge of God and of man; nor from that by which theology
   is said to exercise itself about God and the church; nor that by which
   it is previously determined that we must treat about God, the motion of
   a rational creature to him, and about Christ; nor does that which
   prescribes us to a discourse about God, the creatures, and principally
   about man and his fall, about his reparation through Christ, and about
   the sacraments and a future life.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION III ON BLESSEDNESS, THE END OF THEOLOGY

   The end of theology is the blessedness of man; and that, not animal or
   natural, but spiritual and supernatural. II. It consists in fruition,
   the object of which is a perfect, chief, and sufficient good, which is
   God. III. The foundation of this fruition is life, endowed with
   understanding and with intellectual feeling. IV. The connective or
   coherent cause of fruition is union with God, by which that life is so
   greatly perfected, that they who obtain this union are said to be
   "partakers of the divine nature and of life eternal." V. The medium of
   fruition is understanding and emotion or feeling -- understanding, not
   by species or image, but by clear vision, which is called that of face
   to face; and feeling, corresponding with this vision. VI. The cause of
   blessedness is God himself, uniting himself with man; that is, giving
   himself to be seen, loved, possessed, and thus to be enjoyed by man.
   VII. The antecedent or only moving cause is the goodness and the
   remunerative justice of God, which have the wisdom of God as their
   precursor. VIII. The executive cause is the power of God, by which the
   soul is enlarged after the capacity of God, and the animal body is
   transformed and transfigured into a spiritual body. IX. The end, event,
   or consequence is two-fold, (1.) a demonstration of the glorious
   wisdom, goodness, justice, power, and likewise the universal perfection
   of God; and (2.) his glorification by the beatified. X. Its adjunct
   properties are, that it is eternal, and is known to be so by him who
   possesses it; and that it at once both satisfies every desire, and is
   an object of continued desire.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION IV ON RELIGION

   Omitting all dispute about the question, "whether it be possible for
   God to render man happy by a union with himself without the intervening
   act of man," we affirm that it has pleased God not to bless man except
   by some duty performed according to the will of God, which God has
   determined to reward with eternal blessedness. II. And this most
   equitable will of God rests on the foundation of the justice and equity
   according to which it seems lawful and proper, that the Creator should
   require from his creature, endowed with reason, an act tending to God,
   by which, in return, a rational creature is bound to tend towards God,
   its author and beneficent lord and master. III. This act must be one of
   the entire man, according to each of his parts -- according to his
   soul, and that entirely, and each of his faculties, and according to
   his body, so far as it is the mute instrument of the soul, yet itself
   possessing a capacity for happiness by means of the soul. This act must
   likewise be the most excellent of all those things which can proceed
   from man, and like a continuous act; so that whatever other acts those
   may he which are performed by man through some intervention of the
   will, they ought to be performed according to this act and its rule.
   IV. Though this duty, according to its entire essence and all its
   parts, can scarcely be designated by one name, yet we do not improperly
   denominate it when we give it the name of Religion This word, in its
   most enlarged acceptation, embraces three things -- the act itself, the
   obligation of the act, and the obligation with regard to God, on
   account of whom that act must be performed. Thus, we are bound to
   honour our parents on account of God. V. Religion, then, is that act
   which our theology places in order; and it is for this reason justly
   called "the object of theological doctrine." VI. Its method is defined
   by the command of God, and not by human choice; for the word of God is
   its rule and measure. And as in these days we have this word in the
   Scriptures of the Old and New Testament alone, we say that these
   Scriptures are the canon according to which religion is to be
   conformed. We shall soon treat more fully about the Scriptures how far
   it is required that we should consider them as the canon of religion.
   VII. The opposites to religion are, impiety, that is, the neglect and
   contempt of God, and eqeloqrhskeia will-worship, or superstition, that
   is, a mode of religion invented by man. Hypocrisy is not opposed to the
   whole of religion, but to its integrity or purity; because that in
   which the entire man ought to be engaged, is performed only by his
   body.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION V ON THE RULE OF RELIGION, THE WORD OF GOD, AND THE SCRIPTURES IN
PARTICULAR

   As religion is the duty of man towards God, it is necessary that it
   should be so prescribed by God in his sure word as to render it evident
   to man that he is bound by this prescript as it proceeds from God; or,
   at least, it may and ought to be evident to man. II. This word is
   either endiaqeton, [an inward or mental reasoning,] or wroforikon, [a
   spoken or delivered discourse] the former of them being engrafted in
   the mind of man by an internal inscription, whether it be an increation
   or a superinfusion; the latter being openly pronounced. III. By the
   engrafted word, God has prescribed religion to man, first by inwardly
   persuading him that God ought, and that it was his will, to be
   worshipped by man; then, by universally disclosing to the mind of man
   the worship that is pleasing to himself, and that consists of the love
   of God and of one's neighbour; and, lastly, by writing or sealing a
   remuneration on his heart. This inward manifestation is the foundation
   of all external revelation. IV. God has employed the outward word,
   First, that he might repeat what had been engrafted -- might recall it
   to remembrance, and might urge its exercise. Secondly, that he might
   prescribe to him other things besides, which seem to be placed in a
   four-fold difference. (1.) For they are either such things as are
   homogeneous to the law of nature, which might easily be raised up on
   the things engrafted, or which man could not with equal ease deduce
   from them. (2.) Or they may appear to be such things as these, yet such
   as it has pleased God to circumscribe, lest, from the things engrafted,
   conclusions should be drawn that were universally, or at least for that
   time, repugnant to the will of God. (3.) Or they are merely positive,
   having no communion with these engrafted things, although they rest on
   the general duty of religion. (4.) Or, lastly, according, to some state
   of man, they are suitable to him, particularly for that into which man
   was brought by the fall from his primeval condition. V. God
   communicates this external word to man, either orally, or by writing.
   For, neither with respect to the whole of religion, nor with respect to
   its parts, is God confined to either of these modes of communication;
   but he sometimes uses one and sometimes another, and at other times
   both of them, according to his own choice and pleasure. He first
   employed oral enunciation in its delivery, and afterwards, writing, as
   a more certain means against corruption and oblivion. He has also
   completed it in writing; so that we now have the infallible word of God
   in no other place than in the Scriptures, which are therefore
   appropriately denominated "the instrument of religion." VI. These
   Scriptures are contained in those books of the Old and the New
   Testament which are called "canonical:" They consist of the five books
   of Moses; the books of Joshua, Judges, and of Ruth; the First and
   Second of Samuel; the First and Second of Kings; the First and Second
   of Chronicles; the books of Ezra and of Nehemiah, and the first ten
   chapters of that of Esther; fifteen books of the prophets, that is, the
   three Major and the twelve Minor Prophets; the books of Job, the
   Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Canticles, Daniel, and of the
   Lamentations of Jeremiah: All these books are contained in the Old
   Testament. Those of the New Testament are the following: The four
   Evangelists; one book of the Acts of the Apostles; thirteen of St.
   Paul's Epistles; the Epistle to the Hebrews; that of St. James; the two
   of St. Peter; the three of St. John; that of St. Jude; and the
   Apocalypse by St. John. Some of these are without hesitation accounted
   authentic; but about others of them doubts have been occasionally
   entertained. Yet the number is quite sufficient of those about which no
   doubts were ever indulged. VII. The primary cause of these books is
   God, in his Son, through the Holy Spirit. The instrumental causes are
   holy men of God, who, not at their own will and pleasure, but as they
   were actuated and inspired by the Holy Spirit, wrote these books,
   whether the words were inspired into them, dictated to them, or
   administered by them under the divine direction. VIII. The matter or
   object of the Scriptures is religion, as has already been mentioned.
   The essential and internal form is the true intimation or signification
   of the will of God respecting religion. The external is the form or
   character of the word, which is attempered to the dignity of the
   speaker, and accommodated to the nature of things and to the capacity
   of men. IX. The end is the instruction of man, to his own salvation and
   the glory of God. The parts of the whole instruction are doctrine,
   reproof, institution or instruction, correction, consolation, and
   threatening.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION VI ON THE AUTHORITY AND CERTAINTY OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES

   The authority of the word of God, which is comprised in the Scriptures
   of the Old and New Testament, lies both in the veracity of the whole
   narration, and of all the declarations, whether they be those about
   things past, about things present, or about those which are to come,
   and in the power of the commands and prohibitions, which are contained
   in the divine word. II. Both of these kinds of authority can depend on
   no other than on God, who is the principal author of this word, both
   because he is truth without suspicion of falsehood, and because he is
   of power invincible. III. On this account, the knowledge alone that
   this word is divine, is obligatory on our belief and obedience; and so
   strongly is it binding, that this obligation can be augmented by no
   external authority. IV. In what manner or respect soever the church may
   be contemplated, she can do nothing to confirm this authority; for she,
   also, is indebted to this word for all her own authority; and she is
   not a church unless she have previously exercised faith in this word as
   being divine, and have engaged to obey it. Wherefore, in any way to
   suspend the authority of the Scriptures on the church, is to deny that
   God is of sufficient veracity and supreme power, and that the church
   herself is a church. V. But it is proved by various methods, that this
   word has a divine origin, either by signs employed for the enunciation
   or declaration of the word, such as miracles, predictions and divine
   appearances -- by arguments engrafted on the word itself, such as the
   matters which it contains, the style and character of the discourse,
   the agreements between all the parts and each of them, and the efficacy
   of the word itself; and by the inward testification or witness of God
   himself by his Holy Spirit. To all these, we add a secondary proof --
   the testimony of those persons who have received this word as divine.
   VI. The force and efficacy of this last testimony is entirely human,
   and is of importance equal to the quantum of wisdom, probity and
   constancy possessed by the witnesses. And on this account the authority
   of the church can make no other kind of faith than that which is human,
   but which may be preparatory to the production of faith divine. The
   testimony of the church, therefore, is not the only thing by which the
   certainty of the Scriptures is confirmed to us; indeed it is not the
   principle thing; nay, it is the weakest of all those which are adduced
   in confirmation. VII. No arguments can be invented for establishing the
   divinity of any word, which do not belong by most equitable reason to
   this word; and, on the other hand, it is impossible any arguments can
   be devised which may conduce even by a probable reason to destroy the
   divinity of this word. VIII. Though it be not absolutely necessary to
   salvation to believe that this or that book is the work of the author
   whose title it bears; yet this fact may be established by surer
   arguments than are those which claim the authorship of any other work
   for the writer. IX. The Scriptures are canonical in the same way as
   they are divine; because they contain the rule of faith, charity, hope,
   and of all our inward and outward actions. They do not, therefore,
   require human authority in order to their being received into the
   canon, or considered as canonical. Nay, the relation between God and
   his creatures, requires that his word should be the rule of life to his
   creatures. X. We assert that, for the establishment of the divinity of
   the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, this disjunctive
   proposition is of irrefutable validity: Either the Scriptures are
   divine, or (far be blasphemy from the expression!) they are the most
   foolish of all writings, whether they be said to have proceeded from
   man, or from the evil spirit. COROLLARIES I. To affirm "that the
   authority of the Scriptures depends upon the church, because the church
   is more ancient than the Scriptures," is a falsehood, a foolish speech,
   an implication of manifold contradictions and blasphemy. II. The
   authority of the Roman pontiff to bear witness to the divinity of the
   Scriptures, is less than that of any bishop who is wiser and better
   than he, and possessed of greater constancy.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION VII ON THE PERFECTION OF THE SCRIPTURES

   We denominate that which comprehends all things necessary for the
   church to know, to believe, to do and to hope, in order to salvation,
   "THE PERFECTION OF THE SACRED SCRIPTURES." II. As we are about to
   engage in the defense of this perfection, against inspirations,
   visions, dreams and other novel enthusiastic things, we assert, that,
   since the time when Christ and his apostles sojourned on earth, no
   inspiration of any thing necessary for the salvation of any individual
   man, or of the church, has been given to any single person or to any
   congregation of men whatsoever, which thing is not in a full and most
   perfect manner comprised in the sacred Scriptures. III. We likewise
   affirm, that in the latter ages no doctrine necessary to salvation has
   been deduced from these Scriptures which was not explicitly known and
   believed from the very commencement of the Christian church. For, from
   the time of Christ's ascent into heaven, the church of God was in an
   adult state, being capable indeed of increasing in the knowledge and
   belief of things necessary to salvation, but not capable of receiving
   accessions of new articles; that is, she was capable of increase in
   that faith by which the articles of religion are believed, but not in
   that faith which is the subject of belief. IV. Whatever additions have
   since been made, they obtain only the rank of interpretations and
   proofs, which ought themselves not to be at variance with the
   Scriptures, but to be deduced from them; otherwise, no authority is due
   to them, but they should rather be considered as allied to error; for
   the perfection, not only of the propositions, but likewise of the
   explanations and proofs which are comprised in the Scriptures, is very
   great. V. But the most compendious way of forming a judgment about any
   enunciation or proposition, is, to discern whether its subject and
   predicate be either expressly or with equal force contained in them,
   that proposition may be rejected at least as not necessary to
   salvation, without any detriment to one's salvation. But the predicate
   may be of such a kind, that, when ascribed to this subject, it cannot
   be received without detriment to the salvation. For instance, "The
   Roman pontiff is the head of the church." "The virgin Mary is the
   mediatrix of grace."
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION VIII ON THE PERSPICUITY OF THE SCRIPTURES I.

   The perspicuity of the Scriptures is a quality agreeing with them as
   with a sign, according. to which quality they are adapted clearly to
   reveal the conceptions, whose signs are the words comprised in the
   Scriptures, to those persons to whom the Scriptures are administered
   according to the benevolent providence of God. II. That perspicuity is
   a quality which agrees with the Scriptures, is proved from its cause
   and its end. (1.) In cause, we consider the wisdom and goodness of the
   author, who, according to his wisdom knew, and according to his
   goodness willed, clearly and well to enunciate or declare the meanings
   of his own mind. (2.) In the end is the duty of those to whom the
   Scriptures are directed, and who, through the decree of God, cannot
   attain to salvation without this knowledge. III. This perspicuity comes
   distinctly to be considered both with regard to its object and its
   subject. For all things [in the Scriptures] are not equally
   perspicuous, nor is every thing alike perspicuous to all persons; but
   in the epistle of St. Paul, some things occur which "are hard to be
   understood;" and "the gospel is hid, or concealed, to them who are
   lost, in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them who
   believe not" IV. But those senses or meanings, the knowledge and belief
   of which are simply necessary to salvation, are revealed in the
   Scriptures with such plainness, that they can be perceived even by the
   most simple of mankind, provided they be able duly to exercise their
   reason. V. But they are perspicuous to those alone who, being
   illuminated by the light of the Holy Spirit, have eyes to see, and a
   mind to understand and discern. For any colour whatever, though
   sufficiently illuminated by the light, is not seen except by the eye
   which is endued with the power of seeing, as with an inward light. VI.
   But even in those things which are necessary to be known and believed
   in order to salvation, the law must be distinguished from the gospel,
   especially in that part which relates to Jesus Christ crucified and
   raised up again. For even the gentiles, who are aliens from Christ,
   have "the work of the law written in their hearts," though this is not
   saving, except by the addition of the internal illumination and
   inspiration of God; but "the doctrine of the cross, which is
   foolishness and a stumbling block to the natural man," is not perceived
   without the revelation of the Spirit. VII. In the Scriptures, some
   things may be found so difficult to be understood, that men of the
   quickest and most perspicacious genius may, in attaining to an
   understanding of those things, have a subject on which to bestow their
   labours during the whole course of their lives. But God has so finely
   attempered the Scripture, that they can neither be read without profit,
   nor, after having been perused and reperused innumerable times, can
   they be put aside through aversion or disgust.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION IX ON THE MEANINGS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES

   The legitimate and genuine sense of the holy Scriptures is, that which
   the Holy Ghost, the author of them, intended, and which is collected
   from the words themselves, whether they be received in their proper or
   in their figurative signification; that is, it is the grammatical
   sense, as it is called. II. From this sense, alone, efficacious
   arguments may be sought for the proof of doctrines. III. But, on
   account of the analogical similitude of corporeal, carnal, natural, and
   earthly things, and those belonging to the present life, to things
   spiritual, heavenly, future and eternal, it happens that a double
   meaning, each of them certain and intended by the author, lies under
   the very same words in the Scriptures, of which the one is called "the
   typical," the other "the meaning prefigured in the type" or "the
   allegorical." To this allegorical meaning, we also refer the
   analogical, as opposed in a similar manner to that which is typical.
   IV. From these meanings, that which is called "the ethiological" and
   "the tropological" do not differ, since the former of them renders the
   cause of the grammatical sense, and the latter contains an
   accommodation of it to the circumstances of persons, place, time, &c.
   V. The interpretation of Scripture has respect both to its words and to
   its sense or meaning. VI. The interpretation of its words is either
   that of single words, or of many words combined; and both of these
   methods constitute either a translation of the words into another
   language, or an explanation [or paraphrase] through other words of the
   same language. VII. Let translation be so restricted, that, if the
   original word has any ambiguity, the word into which it is translated
   may retain it: or, if that cannot be done, let it have something
   equivalent by being noted in the margin. VIII. In the explanation [or
   paraphrase] which shall be made by other words, endeavours must be used
   that explanatory words be sought from the Scriptures themselves. For
   this purpose, attention to the synonymy and phraseology will be
   exceedingly useful. IX. In the interpretation of the meanings of the
   words, it must be sedulously attempted both to make the sense agree
   with the rule or "form of sound words," and to accommodate it to the
   scope or intention of the author in that passage. To this end, in
   addition to a clear conception of the words, a comparison of other
   passages of Scripture, whether they be similar, is conducive, as is
   likewise a diligent search or institution into its context. In this
   labour, the occasion [of the words] and their end, the connection of
   those things which precede and which follow, and the circumstances,
   also, of persons, times and places, will be principally observed. X. As
   "the Scriptures are not of private or peculiar explanation," an
   interpreter of them will strive to "have his senses exercised" in them;
   that the interpretation of the Scriptures, which, in those sacred
   writings, comes under the denomination of "prophecy," may proceed from
   the same Spirit as that which primarily inspired the prophecy of the
   Scriptures. XI. But the authority of no one is so great, whether it be
   that of an individual or of a church, as to be able to obtrude his own
   interpretation on the people as the authentic one. From this
   affirmation however, by way of eminence, we except the prophets and the
   apostles. For such interpretation is always subjected to the judgment
   of him to whom it is proposed, to this extent -- that he is bound to
   receive it, only so far as it is confirmed by strength of arguments.
   XII. For this reason, neither the agreement of the fathers, which can,
   with difficulty, be demonstrated, nor the authority of the Roman
   pontiff, ought to be received as the rule of interpretation. XIII. We
   do not wish to introduce unbounded license, by which it may be
   allowable to any person, whether a public interpreter of Scripture or a
   private individual, to reject, without cause, any interpretations
   whatsoever, whether made by one prophet, or by more; but we desire the
   liberty of prophesying [or public expounding] to be preserved entire
   and unimpaired in the church. This liberty, itself, however, we subject
   to the judgment of God, as possessing the power of life and death, and
   to that of the church, or of her prelates who are endowed with the
   power of binding and loosing.

DISPUTATION X ON THE EFFICACY OF THE SCRIPTURES

   When we treat on the force and efficacy of the word of God, whether
   spoken or written, we always append to it the principal and concurrent
   efficacy of the Holy Spirit. II. The object of this efficacy is man,
   but he must be considered either as the subject in whom the efficacy
   operates, or as the object about whom this efficacy exercises itself.
   III. The subject of this efficacy in whom it operates, is man according
   to his understanding and his passions, and as being endowed with a
   capacity, either active or passive. (1.) According to his
   understanding, by which he is able to understand the meanings of the
   word, and to apprehend them as true and good for himself: (2.)
   According to his passions, by which he is capable of being carried by
   his appetites to something true and good which is pointed out, to
   embrace it, and to repose in it. IV. This efficacy is not only
   preparatory, by which the understanding and the passions are prepared
   to apprehend something else that is yet more true and good, and that is
   not comprised in the external word; but it is likewise perfective, by
   which the human understanding and affections are so perfected, that man
   cannot attain to an ulterior perfection in the present life. Therefore,
   we reject [the doctrine of] those who affirm that the Scriptures are a
   dead letter, and serve only to prepare a man, and to render him capable
   of receiving another inward word. V. This efficacy is beautifully
   circumscribed in the Scriptures by three acts, each of which is
   two-fold. (1.) That of teaching what is true, and of confuting what is
   false. (2.) That of exhorting to what is good, dissuading from what is
   evil, and of reproving if any thing has been done beyond or contrary to
   one's duty. (3.) That of administering consolation to a contrite
   spirit, and of denouncing threats against a lofty spirit. VI. The
   object of this efficacy, about which it exercises itself, is the same
   man, placed before the tribunal of divine justice, that, according to
   this word, he [reporter] may bear away from it a sentence either of
   justification or of condemnation.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XI ON RELIGION IN A STRICTER SENSE

   We have treated on religion generally, and on its principles as they
   are comprehended in the scriptures of the Old and New Testament. We
   must now treat upon it in a stricter signification. I. As religion
   contains the duty of man towards God, it must necessarily be founded in
   the mutual relation which subsists between God and man. If it happen
   that this relation is varied, the mode of religion must also be varied,
   the acts pertaining to the substance of every religion always
   remaining, which are knowledge, faith, love, fear, trust, dread and
   obedience. II. The first relation between God and man is that which
   flows from the creation of man in the divine image, according to which
   religion was prescribed to him by the comprehensive law that has been
   impressed on the minds of men, and that was afterwards repeated by
   Moses in the ten commandments. For the sake of proving man's obedience,
   God added to this a symbolical law, about not eating the fruit of the
   tree of the knowledge of good and evil. III. Through the sin of man,
   another relation was introduced between him and God, according to
   which, man, being liable to the condemnation of God, needs the grace of
   restoration. If God bestow this grace on man, the religion which is to
   be prescribed to man must now be also founded on that act, in addition
   to creation. Since this act [on the part of God] requires from man an
   acknowledgment of sin and thanksgiving for deliverance, it is apparent
   that, in this new relation, the mode of religion ought likewise to be
   varied, as, through the appointment of God, it has in reality been
   varied. IV. It was the pleasure of God so to administer this variation,
   that it should not immediately exhibit this grace in a complete manner,
   but that it should retain man for a season under the sealed dominion of
   guilt, yet with the addition of a promise of grace to be exhibited in
   his own time. Hence, arises the difference of the religion which was
   prescribed by Moses to the children of Israel, and that which was
   delivered by Christ to his followers -- of which the former is called
   "the religion of the Old Testament and of the promise," and the
   latter," that of the New Testament and of the gospel;" the former is
   also called the Jewish religion; the latter, the Christian. V. The use
   of the ceremonial law under Moses, and its abrogation under Christ,
   teach most clearly that this religion or mode of religion differs in
   many acts. But as the Christian religion prevails at this time, and as
   [its obligations are] to be performed by us, we will treat further
   about it, yet so as to intersperse, in their proper places, some
   mention, both of the primitive religion and of that of the Jews, so Jar
   as they are capable, and ought to serve to explain the Christian
   religion. VI. But it is not our wish for this difference to be extended
   so far as to have the attainment of salvation, without the intervention
   of Christ, ascribed to those who served God under the pedagogy of the
   Old Testament and by faith in the promise; for the subjoined
   affirmation has always obtained from the time when the first promise
   was promulgated: "There is none other name under heaven, given among
   men, than that of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which men must be saved."
   VII. It appears, from this, that the following assertion, which was
   used by one of the ancients, is false and untheological: "Men were
   saved at first by the law of nature, afterwards, by that of Moses, and
   at length, by that of grace." This, also, is further apparent, that
   such a confusion of the Jewish and Christian religions as was
   introduced by it, is completely opposed to the dispensation or economy
   of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XII ON THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, ITS NAME AND RELATION

   Beginning now to treat further on the Christian religion, we will first
   declare what is the meaning of this term, and we will afterwards
   consider the matter of this religion, each in its order. II. The
   Christian religion, which the Jews called "the heresy of the
   Nazarenes," obtained its name from Jesus of Nazareth, whom God hath
   appointed as our only master, and hath made him both Christ and Lord.
   III. But this name agrees with him in two ways -- from the cause and
   from the object. (1.) From the cause; because Jesus Christ, as "the
   Teacher sent from God," prescribed this religion, both by his own
   voice, when he dwelt on earth, and by his apostles, whom he sent forth
   into all the world. (2.) From the object; because the same Jesus
   Christ, the object of this religion, according to godliness, is now
   exhibited, and fully or perfectly manifested; whereas, he was formerly
   promised and foretold by Moses and the prophets, only as being about to
   come. IV. He was, indeed, a teacher far transcending all other teachers
   -- Moses, the prophets, and even the angels themselves -- both in the
   mode of his perception, and in the excellence of his doctrine. In the
   mode of his perception; because, existing in the bosom of the Father,
   admitted intimately to behold all the secrets of the Father, and endued
   with the plenitude of the Spirit, he saw and heard those things which
   he speaks and testifies. But other teachers, being endued, according to
   a certain measure with the Spirit, have perceived either by a vision,
   by dreams, by conversing "face to face," or by the intervention of an
   angel, those things which it was their duty to declare to others; and
   this Spirit itself is called "the Spirit of Christ." V. In the
   excellence of his doctrine, also, Christ was superior to all other
   teachers, because he revealed to mankind, together and at once, the
   fullness of the very Godhead, and the complete and latest will of his
   Father respecting the salvation of men; so that, either as it regards
   the matter or the dearness of the exposition, no addition can be made
   to it, nor is it necessary that it should. VI. From their belief in
   this religion, and their profession of it, the professors were called
   Christians. (Acts xi. 26; 1 Pet. iv. 16.) That the excellence of this
   name may really belong to a person, it is not sufficient for him to
   acknowledge Christ as a teacher and prophet divinely called. But he
   must likewise religiously own and worship him as the object of this
   doctrine, though the former knowledge and faith precede this, and
   though from it, alone, certain persons are sometimes said to have
   believed in Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XIII ON THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION, WITH REGARD TO THE MATTER GENERALLY

   Since God is the object of all religion, in its various modifications,
   he must likewise be the object of this religion. But Christ, in
   reference to God, is also an object of it, as having been appointed by
   God the Father, King and Lord of the universe, and the Head of his
   church. II. For this reason, in a treatise on the Christian religion,
   the following subjects come, in due order, under our consideration:
   (1.) The object itself, towards which faith and religious worship ought
   to tend. (2.) The cause, on account of which, faith and worship may and
   ought to be performed to the object. (3.) The very act of faith and
   worship, and the method of each, according to the command of God and
   Christ. (4.) Salvation itself, which, as being promised and desired,
   has the power of an impelling cause, which, when obtained, is the
   reward of the observance of religion, and from which arises the
   everlasting glory of God in Christ. III. But man, by whom [the duties
   of] this religion must be executed, is a sinner, yet one for whom
   remission of sins and reconciliation have now been obtained. By this
   mark, it is intended to be distinguished from the religion of the Jews,
   which God also prescribed to sinners; but it was at a time when
   remission of sins had not been obtained, on which account, the mode of
   religion was likewise different, particularly with regard to
   ceremonies. IV. This religion, with regard to all those things which we
   have mentioned as coming under consideration in it, is, of all
   religions, the most excellent; or, rather, it is the most excellent
   mode of religion. Because, in it, the object is proposed in a manner
   the most excellent; so that there is nothing about this object which
   the human mind is capable of perceiving, that is not exhibited in the
   doctrine of the Christian religion. For God has with it disclosed all
   his own goodness, and has given it to be viewed in Christ. V. The
   cause, on account of which, religion may and ought to be performed to
   this object, is, in every way, the most efficacious; so that nothing
   can be imagined, why religion may and ought to be performed to any
   other deity. that is not comprehended in the efficacy of this cause, in
   a pre-eminent manner. VI. The very act of faith and worship is
   required, and must be performed, in a manner the most signal and
   particular; and the salvation which arises from this act, is the
   greatest and most glorious, both because God will afford a fuller and
   more perfect sight of himself, than if salvation had been obtained
   through another form of religion, and because those who will become
   partakers of this salvation, will have Christ eternally as their head,
   who is the brother of men, and they will always behold him. On this
   account, in the attainment and possession of salvation, we shall
   hereafter become, in some measure, superior to the angels themselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XIV ON THE OBJECT OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION: AND, FIRST, ABOUT GOD,
ITS PRIMARY OBJECT, AND WHAT GOD IS I.

   The object of the Christian religion is that towards which the faith
   and worship of a religious man ought to tend. This object is God and
   his Christ -- God principally, Christ subordinately under God -- God
   per se, Christ as God has constituted him the object of this religion.
   II. In God, who is the primary object of the Christian religion, three
   things come in order under our consideration: (1.) The nature of God,
   of which the excellence and goodness is such that religion can
   honourably and usefully be performed to it. (2.) The acts of God, on
   account of which religion ought to be performed to him. (3.) The will
   of God, by which he wills religion to be performed to himself, and that
   he who performs it be rewarded; and, on the contrary, that the
   neglecter of it be punished. III. To every treatise on the nature of
   God, must be prefixed this primary and chief axiom of all religion:
   "There is a God." Without this, vain is every inquiry into the nature
   of God; for, if the divine nature had no existence, religion would be a
   mere phantasm of man's conception. IV. Though the existence of God has
   been intimated to every rational creature that perceives his voice, and
   though this truth is known to every one who reflects on such an
   intimation; yet, "that there is a God," may be demonstrated by various
   arguments. First, by certain theoretical axioms; and because when the
   terms in which these are expressed have been once understood, they are
   known to be true, they deserve to receive the name of "implanted
   ideas." V. The first axiom is, "Nothing is or can be from itself? For
   thus it would at one and the same time, be and not be, it would be both
   prior and posterior to itself, and would be both the cause and effect
   of itself. Therefore, some one being must necessarily be pre-existent,
   from whom, as from the primary and supreme cause, all other things
   derive their origin. But this being is God. VI. The second axiom is,
   "Every efficient primary cause is better or more excellent than its
   effect." From this, it follows that, as all created minds are in the
   order of effects, some one mind is supreme and most wise, from which
   the rest have their origin. But this mind is God. VII. The third axiom
   is, "No finite force can make something out of nothing; and the first
   nature has been made out of nothing." For, if it were otherwise, it
   neither could nor ought to be changed by an efficient or a former; and
   thus, nothing could be made from it. From this, it follows, either that
   all things which exist have been from eternity and are primary being,
   or that there is one primary being. But this being is God. VIII. The
   same truth is proved by the practical axiom, or the conscience, which
   has its seat in all rational creatures. It excuses and exhilarates a
   man in good actions; and, in these which are evil, it accuses and
   torments -- even in those things [of both kinds] which have not come,
   and which never will come, to the knowledge of any creature. This
   stands as a manifest indication that there is some supreme judge, who
   will institute a strict inquiry, and will pass judgment. But this judge
   is God. IX. The magnitude, the perfection, the multitude, the variety,
   and the agreement, of all things that exist, supply us with the fifth
   argument, which loudly proclaims that all these things proceed from one
   and the same being and not from many beings. But this being is God. X.
   The sixth argument is from the order perceptible in things, and from
   the orderly disposition and direction of all of them to an end, even of
   those things which, devoid of reason, themselves, cannot act on account
   of an end, or at least, cannot intend an end. But all order is from one
   being, and direction to an end is from a wise and good being. But this
   being is God. XI. The preservation of political, ecclesiastical and
   economical society among mankind, furnishes our seventh argument.
   Amidst such great perversity and madness of Satan and of evil men,
   human society could never attain to any stability or firmness, except
   it were preserved safe and unimpaired by One who is supremely powerful.
   But this is God. XII. We take our eighth argument from the miracles
   which we believe to have been done, and which we perceive to be done,
   the magnitude of which is so great as to cause them far to exceed the
   entire force and power of the created universe. Therefore, a cause must
   exist which transcends the universe and its power or capability. But
   this cause is God. XIII. The predictions of future and contingent
   things, and their accurate and strict completion, supply the ninth
   argument as being things which could proceed from no one except from
   God. XIV. In the last place, is added, the perpetual and universal
   agreement of all nations, which general consent must be accounted as
   equivalent to a law, nay to a divine oracle. COROLLARY On account of
   the dissensions of very learned men, we allow this question to be
   discussed, "from the motion which is apparent in the world, and from
   the fact, that whatever is moved is moved by another, can it be
   concluded that there is a God?
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XV ON THE NATURE OF GOD

   Concerning God, the primary object of theology, two things must be
   known, (1.) His nature, or what God is, or rather what qualities does
   he possess? (2.) Who God is, or to whom this nature must be attributed.
   These must be known, lest any thing foolish or unbecoming be ascribed
   to God, or lest another, or a strange one, be considered as the true
   God. On the first of these we will now treat in a few disputations. II.
   As we are not able to know the nature of God, in itself, we can, in a
   measure, attain to some knowledge from the analogy of the nature which
   is in created things, and principally that which is in ourselves, who
   are created after the image of God; while we always add a mode of
   eminence to this analogy, according to which mode God is understood to
   exceed, infinitely, the perfections of things created. III. As in the
   whole nature of things, and in man, who is the compendium or abridgment
   of it, only two things can be considered as essential, whether they be
   disparted in their subjects, or, in a certain order, connected with
   each other and subordinate in the same subject, which two things are
   Essence and Life; we will also contemplate the nature of God according
   to these two impulses of his nature. For the four degrees, which are
   proposed by several divines -- to be, to live, to. feel, and to
   understand -- are restricted to these two causes of motion; because the
   word "to live," embraces within itself both feeling and understanding.
   IV. We say the essence of God is the first impulse of the divine
   nature, by which God is purely and simply understood to be. V. As the
   whole nature of things is distributed according to their essence, into
   body and spirit, we affirm that the divine essence is spiritual, and
   from this, that God is a Spirit, because it could not possibly come to
   pass that the first and chief being should be corporeal. From this, one
   cannot do otherwise than justly admire the transcendent force and
   plenitude of God, by which he is capable of creating even things
   corporeal that have nothing analogous to himself. VI. To the essence of
   God no attribute can be added, whether distinguished from it in
   reality, by relation, or by a mere conception of the mind; but only a
   mode of pre-eminence can be attributed to it, according to which it is
   understood to comprise within itself and to exceed all the perfections
   of all things. This mode may be declared in this one expression: "The
   divine essence is uncaused and without commencement." VII. Hence, it
   follows that this essence is simple and infinite; from this, that it is
   eternal and immeasurable; and, lastly, that it is unchangeable,
   impassable and incorruptible, in the manner in which it has been proved
   by us in our public theses on this subject. VIII. And since unity and
   goodness reciprocate with being, and as the affections or passions of
   every being are general, we also affirm that the essence of God is one,
   and that God is one according to it, and is, therefore, good -- nay,
   the chief good, from the participation of which all things have both
   their being, and their well being. IX. As this essence is itself pure
   from all composition, so it cannot enter into the composition of any
   thing. We permit it to become a subject of discussion, whether this be
   designated in the Scriptures by the name of "holiness," which denotes
   separation or a being separated. X. These modes of pre-eminence are not
   communicable to any thing, from the very circumstance of their being
   such. And when these modes are contemplated in the life of God, and in
   the faculties of his life, they are of infinite usefulness in theology,
   and are not among the smallest foundations of true religion.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XVI ON THE LIFE OF GOD I.

   Life is that which comes under our consideration, in the second impulse
   of the divine nature; and that it belongs to God, is not only evident
   from its own nature, but is likewise known, per se, to all those who
   have any conception of God. For it is much more incredible that God is
   something senseless and dead, than that there is no God. And the life
   of God is easily proved. For, as whatever is beside God is from him, we
   must also attribute life to him, because among his creatures are many
   things which have life; and we affirm that God is a living substance,
   and that life belongs to him, not only eminently but also formally,
   since life is simply perfection. II. But, as life is taken, either in
   the second act, and is called "operation," or in the first, principal
   and radical act, and thus is the very nature and form of a living
   thing, we attribute this, of itself, primarily and adequately to God;
   so that he Is the life of himself, not having it from His union with
   another thing; (for that is the part of imperfection,) but existing the
   same as it does -- he being life itself, and living by the first act,
   but bestowing life by the second act. III. The life of God, therefore,
   is most simple, so that it is not, in reality, distinguished from his
   essence; and according to the confined capacity of our conception, by
   which it is distinguished from his essence, it may, in some degree, be
   described as being "an act that flows from the essence of God," by
   which is intimated that it is active in itself; first, by a reflex act
   on God himself, and then on other objects, on account of the most
   abundant copiousness, and the most perfect activity of life in God. IV.
   The life of God is the foundation and the proximate and adequate
   principle not only of ad intra et ad extra, an inward and an outward
   act, but likewise of all fruition by which God is said to be blessed in
   himself. This seems to be the cause why God wished himself, principally
   in reference to life, to be distinguished from false gods and dead
   idols, and why he wished men to swear by his name, in a form composed
   thus: "The Lord liveth." V. As the essence of God is infinite and most
   simple, eternal, impassable, unchangeable and incorruptible, we ought
   likewise to consider His life with these modes of being and life; on
   which account we attribute to him per se immortality, and a most
   prompt, powerful, indefatigable and insatiable desire, strength and
   delight to act and to enjoy, and in action and enjoyment, if it be
   lawful, thus to express ourselves. VI. By two faculties, the
   understanding and the will, this life is active towards God himself;
   but towards other things it is active by three faculties, power, or
   capability, being added to the two preceding. But the faculties of the
   understanding and the will are accommodated to fruition, and this
   chiefly as they tend towards God himself; secondarily, and because it
   thus pleases him of his abundant goodness, as they tend towards the
   creatures.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XVII ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF GOD I.

   The understanding of God is that faculty of his life which is first in
   nature and order, and by which the living God distinctly understands
   all things and every one, which, in what manner soever, either have,
   will have, have had, can have, or might hypothetically have, a being of
   any kind, by which he also distinctly understands the order,
   connection, and relation of all and each of them between each other,
   and the entities of reason, those beings which exist, or which can
   exist, in the mind, imagination, and enunciation. II. God knows all
   things, neither by intelligible representations, nor by similitude, but
   by his own and sole essence; with the exception of evil things, which
   he knows indirectly by the good things opposed to them, as privation is
   known by means of our having been accustomed to any thing. III. The
   mode by which God understands, is, not by composition and division, not
   by gradual argumentation, but by simple and infinite intuition,
   according to the succession of order and not of time. IV. The
   succession of order, in the objects of the divine knowledge, is in this
   manner: First. God knows himself entirely and adequately, and this
   understanding is his own essence or being. Secondly. He knows all
   possible things, in the perfection of his own essence, and, therefore,
   all things impossible. In the understanding of possible things, this is
   the order: (1.) He knows what things can exist by his own primary and
   sole act. (2.) He knows what things, from the creatures, whether they
   will come into existence or will not, can exist by his conservation,
   motion, assistance, concurrence, and permission. (3.) He knows what
   things he can do about the acts of the creatures consistently with
   himself or with these acts. Thirdly. He knows all entities, even
   according to the same order as that which we have just shown in his
   knowledge of things possible. V. The understanding of God is certain
   and infallible; so that he sees certainly and infallibly, even, things
   future and contingent, whether he sees them in their causes, or in
   themselves. But this infallibility depends on the infinity of the
   essence of God, and not on his unchangeable will. VI. The act of
   understanding of God is occasioned by no external cause, not even by
   its object; though if there be not afterwards an object, neither will
   there be any act of God's understanding about it. VII. How certain
   soever the acts of God's understanding may themselves be, this does not
   impose any necessity on things, but rather establishes contingency in
   them. For, as he knows the thing itself and its mode, if the mode of
   the thing be contingent, he must know it as such, and, therefore, it
   remains contingent with respect to the divine knowledge. VIII. The
   knowledge of God may be distinguished according to its objects. And,
   First, into the theoretical, by which he understands things under the
   relation of entity and truth; and into the practical, by which he
   considers things under the relation of good, and as objects of his will
   and power. IX. Secondly. One [quality of the] knowledge of God is that
   of simple intelligence, by which he understands, himself, all possible
   things, and the nature and essence of all entities; another is that of
   vision, by which he beholds his own existence and that of all other
   entities or beings. X. The knowledge by which God knows his own essence
   and existence, all things possible, and the nature and essence of all
   entities, is simply necessary, as pertaining to the perfection of his
   own knowledge. But that by which he knows the existence of other
   entities, is hypothetically necessary, that is, if they now have, have
   already had, or shall afterwards have, any existence. For when any
   object, whatsoever, is laid down, it must, of necessity, fall within
   the knowledge of God. The former of these precedes every free act of
   the divine will; the latter follows every free act. The schoolmen;
   therefore, denominate the first "natural," and the second "free
   knowledge." XI. The knowledge by which God knows any thing if it be or
   exist, is intermediate between the two [kinds] described in theses 9 &
   10; In fact it precedes the free act of the will with regard to
   intelligence. But it knows something future according to vision, only
   through its hypothesis. XII. Free knowledge, or that of vision, which
   is also called "prescience," is not the cause of things; but the
   knowledge which is practical and of simple intelligence, and which is
   denominated "natural," or "necessary," is the cause of all things by
   the mode of prescribing and directing to which is added the action of
   the will and of the capability. The middle or intermediate [kind of]
   knowledge ought to intervene in things which depend on the liberty of
   created choice or pleasure. XIII. From the variety and multitude of
   objects, and from the means and mode of intelligence and vision, it is
   apparent that infinite knowledge and omniscience are justly attributed
   to God; and that they are so proper or peculiar to God according to
   their objects, means and mode, as not to be capable of appertaining to
   any created thing.

DISPUTATION XVIII ON THE WILL OF GOD

   The will of God is spoken of in three ways: First, the faculty itself
   of willing. Secondly, the act of willing. Thirdly, the object willed.
   The first signification is the principal and proper one, the two others
   are secondary and figurative. II. It may be thus described: It is the
   second faculty of the life of God, flowing through the understanding
   from the life that has an ulterior tendency; by which faculty God is
   borne towards a known good -- towards a good, because this is an
   adequate object of every will -- towards a known good, not only with
   regard to it as a being, but likewise as a good, whether in reality or
   only in the act of the divine understanding. Both, however, are shown
   by the understanding. But the evil which is called that of culpability,
   God does not simply and absolutely will. III. The good is two-fold. The
   chief good, and that which is from the chief. The first of these is the
   primary, immediate, principal, direct, peculiar and adequate object of
   the divine will; the latter is secondary and indirect, towards which
   the divine will does not tend, except by means of the chief good. IV.
   The will of God is borne towards its objects in the following order:
   (1.) He wills himself. (2.) He wills all those things which, out of
   infinite things possible to himself he has, by the last judgment of his
   wisdom, determined to be made. And first, he wills to make them to be;
   then he is affected towards them by his will, according as they possess
   some likeness with his nature, or some vestige of it. (3.) The third
   object of the will of God is those things which he judges fit and
   equitable to be done by creatures who are endowed with understanding
   and with free will, in which is included a prohibition of that which he
   wills not to be done. (4.) The fourth object of the divine will is his
   permission, that chiefly by which he permits a rational creature to do
   what he has prohibited, and to omit what he has commanded. (5.) He
   wills those things which, according to his own wisdom, he judges to be
   done concerning the acts of his rational creatures. V. There is out of
   God no inwardly moving cause of his will; nor out of him is there any
   end. But the creature, and its action or passion, may be the outwardly
   moving cause, without which God would supersede or omit that volition
   or act of willing. VI. But the cause of all other things is God, by His
   understanding and will, by means of His power or capability; yet so,
   that when he acts either through his creatures, with them or in them,
   he does not take away the peculiar mode of acting, or of suffering,
   which he has divinely placed within them; and that he suffers them,
   according to their peculiar mode, to produce their own effects, and to
   receive in themselves the acts of God, either necessarily,
   contingently, or freely. As this contingency and liberty do not make
   the prescience of God to be uncertain, so they are destroyed by the
   volition of God, and by the certain futurition of events with regard to
   the understanding of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XIX ON THE VARIOUS DISTINCTIONS OF THE WILL OF GOD

   Though the will of God be one and simple, yet it may be variously
   distinguished, from its objects, in reference to the mode and order
   according to which it is borne towards its objects. Of these
   distinctions the use is important in the whole of the Scriptures, and
   in explaining many passages in them. II. The will of God is borne
   towards its object either according to the mode of nature, or that of
   liberty. In reference to the former, God tends towards his own primary,
   proper and adequate object, that is, towards himself. But, according to
   the mode of liberty, he tends towards other things -- and towards all
   other things by the liberty of exercise, and towards many by the
   liberty of specification; because he cannot hate things, so far as they
   have some likeness of God, that is, so far as they are good; though he
   is not necessarily bound to love them, since he might reduce them to
   nothing whenever it seemed good to himself. III. The will of God is
   distinguished into that by which he absolutely wills to do any thing or
   to prevent it; and into that by which he wills something to be done or
   omitted by his rational creatures. The former of these is called "the
   will of his good pleasure," or rather "of his pleasure;" and the
   latter, "that of his open intimation." The latter is revealed, for this
   is required by the use to which it is applied. The former is partly
   revealed, partly secret, or hidden. The former employs a power that is
   either irresistible, or that is so accommodated to the object and
   subject as to obtain or insure its success, though it was possible for
   it to happen otherwise. To these two kinds of the divine will, is
   opposed the remission of the will, that is, a two-fold permission, the
   one opposed to the will of open intimation, the other to that of good
   pleasure. The former is that by which God permits something to the
   power of a rational creature by not circumscribing some act by a law;
   the latter is that by which God permits something to the will and
   capability of the creature, by not placing an impediment in its way, by
   which the act may in reality be hindered. IV. Whatever things God wills
   to do, he wills them (1.) either from himself, not on account of any
   other cause placed beyond him, (whether that be without the
   consideration of any act perpetrated by the creature, or solely from
   the occasion of the act of the creature,) (2.) or on account of a
   preceding cause afforded by the creature. In reference to this
   distinction, some work is said to be "proper to God," some other
   "extraneous, strange and foreign." But there is a two-fold difference
   in those things which he wills to be done; for they are pleasing and
   acceptable to God, either in themselves, as in the case of moral works;
   or they please accidentally and on account of some other thing, as in
   the case of things ceremonial. V. The will of God is either peremptory,
   or with a condition. (1.) His peremptory will is that which strictly
   and rigidly obtains, such as the words of the gospel which contain the
   last revelation of God: "The wrath of God abides on him who does not
   believe;" "He that believes shall be saved;" also the words of Samuel
   to Saul: "The Lord hath rejected thee from being king over Israel."
   (2.) His will, with a condition, is that which has a condition annexed,
   whether it be a tacit one, such as, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall
   be overthrown." "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
   which are written in the book of the law to do them," that is, unless
   he be delivered from this curse as it is expressed in Gal. iii. 13. See
   also Jer. xviii. 7-10. VI. One will of God is absolute, another
   respective. His absolute will is that by which he wills any thing
   simply, without regard to the volition or act of the creature, such as
   is that about the salvation of believers. His respective will is that
   by which he wills something with respect to the volition or the act of
   the creature. It is also either antecedent or consequent. (1.) The
   antecedent is that by which he wills something with respect to the
   subsequent will or act of the creature, as, "God wills all men to be
   saved if they believe." (2.) The consequent is that by which he wills
   something with respect to the antecedent volition or act of the
   creature, as, "Woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!
   Better would it have been for that man if he had never been born! Both
   depend on the absolute will, and according to it each of them is
   regulated. VII. God wills some things, so far as they are good, when
   absolutely considered according to their nature. Thus he wills
   alms-giving, and to do good to man so far as he is his creature. He
   also wills some other things, so far as, all circumstances considered,
   they are understood to be good. According to this will, he says to the
   wicked man, "What hast thou to do, that thou shouldst take my covenant
   in thy mouth?" And he speaks thus to Eli: "Be it far from me that thy
   house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever; for
   them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
   lightly esteemed." This distinction does not differ greatly from the
   antecedent will of God, which has been already mentioned. VIII. God
   wills some things per se or per accidens. Of themselves, he wills those
   things which are simply relatively good. Thus He wills salvation to
   that man who is obedient. Accidentally, those things which, in some
   respect are evil, but have a good joined with them, which God wills
   more than the respective good things that are opposed to those evil.
   Thus he wills the evils of punishment, because he chooses that the
   order of justice be preserved in punishment, rather than that a sinning
   creature should escape punishment, though this impunity might be for
   the good of the creature. IX. God wills some things in their antecedent
   causes, that is, he wills their causes relatively, and places them in
   such order that effects may follow from them; and if they do follow, he
   wills that they, of themselves, be pleasing to him. God wills other
   things in themselves. This distinction does not substantially differ
   from that by which the divine will is distinguished into absolute and
   selective. COROLLARIES I. Is it possible for two affirmatively contrary
   volitions of God to tend towards one object which is the same and
   uniform? We answer in the negative. II. Can one volition of God, that
   is, one formally, tend towards contrary objects? We reply, It can tend
   towards objects physically contrary, but not towards objects morally
   contrary. III. Does God will, as an end, something which is beyond
   himself, and which does not proceed from his free will? We reply in the
   negative.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XX ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD WHICH COME TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER HIS
WILL AND, FIRST, ON THOSE WHICH HAVE AN ANALOGY TO THE AFFECTIONS OR PASSIONS IN
RATIONAL CREATURES

   Those attributes of God ought to be considered, which are either
   properly or figuratively attributed to him in the Scriptures, according
   to a certain analogy of the affections and virtues in rational
   creatures. II. Those divine attributes which have the analogy of
   affections, may be referred to two principal kinds, so that the first
   class may contain those affections which are simply conversant about
   good or evil, and which may be denominated primitive affections; and
   the second may comprehend those which are exercised about good and evil
   in reference to their absence or presence, and which may be called
   affections derived from the primitive. III. The primitive affections
   are love, (the opposite to which is hatred,) and goodness; and with
   these are connected grace, benignity and mercy. Love is prior to
   goodness towards the object, which is God himself; goodness is prior to
   love towards that object which is some other than God. IV. Love is an
   affection of union in God, whose objects are not only God himself and
   the good of justice, but also the creature, imitating or related to God
   either according to likeness, or only according to impress, and the
   felicity of the creature. But this affection is borne onwards either to
   enjoy and to have, or to do good; the former is called "the love of
   complacency;" the latter, "the love of friendship," which falls into
   goodness, God loves himself with complacency in the perfection of His
   own nature, wherefore he likewise enjoys himself. He also loves himself
   with the love of complacency in his effects produced externally; both
   in acts and works, which are specimens and evident, infallible
   indications of that perfection. Wherefore he may be said, in some
   degree, likewise to enjoy these acts and works. Even the justice or
   righteousness performed by the creature, is pleasing to him; wherefore
   his affection is extended to secure it. V. Hatred is an affection of
   separation in God, whose many object is injustice or unrighteousness;
   and the secondary, the misery of the creature. The former is from "the
   love of complacency;" the latter, from "the love of friendship." But
   since God properly loves himself and the good of justice, and by the
   same impulse holds iniquity in detestation; and since he secondarily
   loves the creature and his blessedness, and in that impulse hates the
   misery of the creature, that is, he wills it to be taken away from the
   creature; hence, it comes to pass, that he hates the creature who
   perseveres in unrighteousness, and he loves his misery. VI. Hatred,
   however, is not collateral to love, but necessarily flowing from it;
   since love neither does nor can tend towards all those things which
   become objects to the understanding of God. It belongs to him,
   therefore, in the first act, and must be placed in him prior to any
   existence of a thing worthy of hatred, which existence being laid down,
   the act of hatred arises from it by a natural necessity, not by liberty
   of the will. VII. But since love does not perfectly fill the whole will
   of God, it has goodness united with it; which also is an affection in
   God of communicating his good. Its first object externally is nothing;
   and this is so necessarily first, that, when it is removed, no
   communication can be made externally. Its act is creation. Its second
   object is the creature as a creature; and its act is called
   conservation, or sustentation, as if it was a continuance of creation.
   Its third object is the creature performing his duty according to the
   command of God; and its act is the elevation to a more worthy and
   felicitous condition, that is, the communication of a greater good than
   that which the creature obtained by creation. Both these advances of
   goodness may also be appropriately denominated "benignity," or
   "kindness." Its fourth object is the creature not performing his duty,
   or sinful, and on this account liable to misery according to the just
   judgment of God; and its act is a deliverance from sin through the
   remission and the mortification of sin. And this progress of goodness
   is denominated mercy, which is an affection for giving succour to a man
   in misery, sin presenting no obstacle. VIII. Grace is a certain adjunct
   of goodness and love, by which is signified that God is affected to
   communicate his own good and to love the creatures, not through merit
   or of debt, not by any cause impelling from without, nor that something
   may be added to God himself, but that it may be well with him on whom
   the good is bestowed and who is beloved, which may also receive the
   name of "liberality." According to this, God is said to be "rich in
   goodness, mercy," &c. IX. The affections which spring from these, and
   which are exercised about good or evil as each is present or absent,
   are considered as having an analogy either in those things which are in
   the concupiscible part of our souls, or in that which is irascible. X.
   In the concupiscible part are, first, desire and that which is opposed
   to it; secondly, joy and grief. (1.) Desire is an affection of
   obtaining the works of righteousness from rational creatures, and of
   bestowing a remunerative reward, as well as of inflicting punishment if
   they be contumacious. To this is opposed the affection according to
   which God execrates the works of unrighteousness, and the omission of a
   remuneration. (2.). Joy is an affection from the presence of a thing
   that is suitable or agreeable -- such as the fruition of himself, the
   obedience of the creature, the communication of his own goodness, and
   the destruction of His rebels and enemies. Grief, which is opposed to
   it, arises from the disobedience and the misery of the creature, and in
   the occasion thus given by his people for blaspheming the name of God
   among the gentiles. To this, repentance has some affinity; which is
   nothing more than a change of the thing willed or done, on account of
   the act of a rational creature, or, rather, a desire for such change.
   XI. In the irascible part are hope and its opposite, despair,
   confidence and anger, also fear, which is affirmatively opposed to
   hope. (1.) Hope is an earnest expectation of a good, due from the
   creature, and performable by the grace of God. It cannot easily be
   reconciled with the certain foreknowledge of God. (2.) Despair arises
   from the pertinacious wickedness of the creature, opposing himself to
   the grace of God, and resisting the Holy Spirit. (3.) Confidence is
   that by which God with great animation prosecutes a desired good, and
   repels an evil that is hated. (4.) Anger is an affection of depulsion
   in God, through the punishment of the creature that has transgressed
   his law, by which he inflicts on the creature the evil of misery for
   his unrighteousness, and takes the vengeance which is due to him, as an
   indication of his love towards justice, and of his hatred to sin. When
   this affection is vehement, it is called "fury." (5.) Fear is from an
   impending evil to which God is averse. XII. Of the second class of
   these derivative affections, (See Thesis 11) some belong to God per se,
   as they simply contain in themselves perfection; others, which seem to
   have something of imperfection, are attributed to him after the manner
   of the feelings of men, on account of some effects which he produces
   analogous to the effects of the creatures, yet without any passion, as
   he is simple and immutable and without any disorder and repugnance to
   right reason. But we subject the use and exercise of the first class of
   those affections (See Thesis 10) to the infinite wisdom of God, whose
   property it is to prefix to each of them its object, means, end and
   circumstances, and to decree to which, in preference to the rest, is to
   be conceded the province of acting.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXI ON THOSE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD WHICH HAVE SOME ANALOGY TO THE MORAL
VIRTUES, AND WHICH ACT LIKE MODERATORS OF THE AFFECTIONS, CONSIDERED IN THE
PRECEDING DISPUTATION.

   But these attributes preside generally over all the affections, or
   specially relate to some of them. The general is justice, or
   righteousness, which is called "universal" or "legal," and concerning
   which it was said by the ancients, that it contains, in itself, all the
   virtues. The special are, particular justice, patience, and those which
   are the moderators of anger, and of chastisements and punishments. II.
   The justice of God, considered universally, is a virtue of God,
   according to which he administers all things correctly and in a
   suitable manner, according to that which his wisdom dictates as
   befitting himself. In conjunction with wisdom, it presides over all his
   acts, decrees and deeds; and according to it, God is said to be "just
   and right," his way "equal," and himself to be "just in all his ways."
   III. The particular justice of God is that by which he consistently
   renders to every one his own -- to God himself that which is his, and
   to the creature that which belongs to itself. We consider it both in
   the words of God and in his deeds. In this, the method of the decrees
   is not different; because, whatever God does or says, he does or says
   it according to his own eternal decree. This justice likewise contains
   a moderator partly of his love for the good of obedience, and partly of
   his love for the creature, and of his goodness. IV. Justice In deeds
   may be considered in the following order: That the first may be in the
   communication of good, either according to the first creation, or
   according to regeneration. The second is in the prescribing of duty, or
   in legislation, which consists in the requisition of a deed, and in the
   promise of a reward, and the threat of a punishment. The third is in
   the judging about deeds, which is retributive, being both communicative
   of a reward and vindicative. In all these, the magnanimity of God is to
   be considered. In communication, in promise, and in remuneration, his
   liberality and magnificence are also to come under consideration; and
   they may be appropriately referred partly to distributive, and partly
   to commutative justice. V. Justice in words is also three-fold. (1.)
   Truth, by which he always enunciates or declares exactly as the thing
   is, to which is opposed falsehood. (2.) Sincerity and simplicity, by
   which he always declares as he inwardly conceives, according to the
   meaning and purpose of his mind, to which are opposed hypocrisy and
   duplicity of heart. And (3.) Fidelity, by which he is constant in
   keeping promises and in communicating privileges, to which are opposed
   inconstancy and perfidy. VI. Patience is that by which he patiently
   endures the absence of that Good, that is, of the prescribed obedience
   which he loves, desires, and for which he hopes, and the presence of
   that evil which he forbids, sparing sinners, not only that he may
   execute the judicial acts of His mercy and severity through them, but
   that he may also lead them to repentance, or that he may punish the
   contumacious with greater equity and severity. And this attribute seems
   to attemper the love [which God entertains] for the good of justice.
   VII. Long suffering, gentleness or lenity, clemency and readiness to
   pardon, are the moderators of anger, chastisements and punishments.
   VIII. Long suffering is a virtue by which God suspends his anger, lest
   it should instantly hasten to the depulsion of the evil, as soon as the
   creature has by his sins deserved it. IX. Gentleness or lenity is a
   virtue, by which God preserves moderation concerning anger in taking
   vengeance, lest it should be too vehement -- lest the seventy of the
   anger should certainly correspond with the magnitude of the wickedness
   perpetrated. X. Clemency is a virtue by which God so attempers the
   chastisements and punishments of the creature, even at the very time
   when he inflicts them, that, by their weight and continuance, they may
   not equal the magnitude of the sins committed; indeed, that they may
   not exceed the strength of the creature. XI. Readiness to forgive is a
   virtue by which God shows himself to be exorable to his creature, and
   which fixes a measure to the limits of anger, lest it should endure for
   ever, agreeably to the demerit of the sins committed. COROLLARIES Does
   the justice of God permit him to destine to death eternal, a rational
   creature who has never sinned? We reply in the negative. Does the
   justice of God allow that a creature should be saved who perseveres in
   his sins? We reply in the negative. Cannot justice and mercy, in some
   accommodated sense, be considered, as, in a certain respect, opposed?
   We reply in the affirmative.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXII ON THE POWER OR CAPABILITY OF GOD I.

   When entering on the consideration of the power or capability of God,
   as we deny the passive power which cannot belong to God who is a pure
   act, so we likewise omit that which is occupied with internal acts
   through necessity of nature; and at present we exhibit for examination
   that power alone which consists in the capacity of external actions,
   and by which God not only is capable of operating beyond himself, but
   actually does operate whenever it is his own good pleasure. II. And it
   is a faculty of the divine life, by which, (subsequently to the
   understanding of God that shows and directs, and to his will that
   commands,) he is capable of operating externally what things soever he
   can freely will, and by which he does operate whatever he freely wills.
   III. The measure of the divine capability is the free will of God, and
   that is truly an adequate measure; so that the object of the capability
   may be, and, indeed, ought to be, circumscribed and limited most
   appropriately from the object of the free will of God. For, whatever
   cannot fall under his will, cannot fall under his capability; and
   whatever is subject to the former, is likewise subject to the latter.
   IV. But the will of God can only will that which is not opposed to the
   divine essence, (which is the foundation both of His understanding and
   of his will,) that is, it can will nothing but that which exists, is
   true and good. Hence, neither can his capability do any other. Again,
   since, under the phrase "what is not opposed to the divine essence," is
   comprehended whatsoever is simply and absolutely possible, and since
   God can will the whole of this, it follows that God is capable of every
   thing which is possible. V. Those things are impossible to God which
   involve a contradiction, as, to make another God, to be mutable, to
   sin, to lie, to cause some thing at once to be and not to be, to have
   been and not to have been, &c., that this thing should be and not be,
   that it and its contrary should be, that an accident should be without
   its subject, that a substance should be changed into a pre-existing
   substance, bread into the body of Christ, that a body should possess
   ubiquity, &c. These things partly belong to a want of power to be
   capable of doing them, and partly to a want of will to do them. VI. But
   the capability of God is infinite -- and this not only because it can
   do all things possible, which, indeed, are innumerable, so that as many
   cannot be enumerated as it is capable of doing, [or after all that can
   be numbered, it is capable of doing still more]; nor can such great
   things be calculated without its being able to produce far greater, but
   likewise because nothing can resist it. For all created things depend
   upon him, as upon the efficient principle, both in their being and in
   their preservation. Hence, omnipotence is justly ascribed to him. VII.
   This can be communicated to no creature.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXIII ON THE PERFECTION, BLESSEDNESS AND GLORY OF GOD

   Next in order, follows the perfection of God, resulting from the simple
   and infinite circuit of all those things which we have already
   attributed to God, and considered with the mode of pre-eminence -- not
   that perfection by which he has every individual thing most perfectly,
   (for this is the office of simplicity and infinity,) but that by which
   he has all things simply denoting some perfection in the most perfect
   manner. And it may be appropriately described thus: It is the
   interminable, and, at the same time, the entire and perfect possession
   of essence and life. II. And this perfection of God infinitely
   transcends every created perfection, in three several ways: (1.)
   Because it has all things. (2.) It has them in a manner the most
   perfect. And (3.) It does not derive them from any other source. But as
   the creatures have, through participation, a perfection from God,
   faintly shadowed forth after its archetype, so, of consequence, they
   neither have every perfection, nor in a manner the most perfect; yet
   some creatures have a greater perfection than others; and the more of
   it they possess, the nearer are they to God, and the more like him.
   III. From this perfection of God, by means of some internal act, his
   blessedness has its existence; and by means of some relation of it ad
   extra, his glory exists. IV. Blessedness is an act of God, by which he
   enjoys his own perfection, that is fully known by his understanding,
   and supremely loved by his will, with a delightful satisfaction in it.
   It is, therefore, through the act of the understanding, and of the
   will; of the understanding, indeed, reaching to the essence of the
   object, but the act of which would not be an act of felicity, unless it
   had this, its being an act of felicicity[sic.], from the will which
   perpetually desires to behold the beatified object, and is delightfully
   satisfied in it. V. But this blessedness is so peculiar to God that it
   cannot be communicated to any creature. Yet he is, himself, with
   respect to the object, the beatified good of creatures endowed with
   understanding, and the effector of the act which tends to the effect,
   and which is delightfully satisfied in it. Of these, consists the
   blessedness of the creature. VI. Glory is the divine excellence above
   all things, which he makes manifest by external acts, in various ways.
   VII. But the modes of manifestation, which are declared to us in the
   Scriptures, are principally two -- the one, by an effulgence of unusual
   light and splendour, or by the opposite to it, a dense darkness and
   obscurity; the other, by the production of works which agree with his
   perfection and excellence. VIII. This description of the divine nature
   is the first foundation of all religion. For it is concluded, from this
   perfection and blessedness of God, that the act of religion can be
   worthily and usefully exhibited to God, to the knowledge of which
   matter, we are brought, through the manifestation of the divine glory.
   The candid reader will be able, in this place, to supply from the
   preceding public disputations, the theses on the Father and the Son,
   and those on the Holy Spirit, the Holy and undivided Trinity.

DISPUTATION XXIV ON CREATION

   We have treated on God, who is the first object of the Christian
   religion. And we would now treat on Christ, who, next to God, is
   another object of the same religion; but we must premise some things,
   without which, Christ would neither be an object of religion, nor would
   the necessity of the Christian religion be understood. Indeed, the
   cause must be First explained, on account of which God has a right to
   require any religion from man; THEN the religion, also, that is
   prescribed in virtue of this cause and right, and, LASTLY, the event
   ensuing, from which has arisen the necessity of constituting Christ our
   saviour, and the Christian religion, employed by God, through his own
   will, who hath not, by the sin of man, lost His right which he obtains
   over him by creation, nor has he entirely laid aside his affection for
   man, though a sinner, and miserable. II. And since God is the object of
   the Christian religion, not only as the Creator, but likewise as the
   Creator anew, (in which latter respect, Christ, also, as constituted by
   God to be the saviour, is the object of the Christian religion,) it is
   necessary for us first to treat about the primitive creation, and those
   things which are joined to it according to nature, and, after that,
   about those which resulted from the conduct of man, before we begin to
   treat on the new creation, in which the primary consideration is that
   of Christ as Mediator. III. Creation is an external act of God, by
   which he produced all things out of nothing, for himself, by his Word
   and Spirit. IV. The primary efficient cause is God the Father, by his
   Word and Spirit. The impelling cause, which we have indicated in the
   definition by the particle "for," is the goodness of God, according to
   which he is inclined to communicate his good. The ordainer is the
   divine wisdom; and the executrix, or performer, is the divine power,
   which the will of God employs through an inclination of goodness,
   according to the most equitable prescript of his wisdom. V. The matter
   from which God created all things, must be considered in three forms:
   (1.) The first of all is that from which all things in general were
   produced, into which, also, they may all, on this account, relapse and
   be reduced; it is nothing itself, that our mind, by the removal of all
   entity, considers as the first matter; for, that, alone, is capable of
   the first communication of God ad extra; because, God would neither
   have the right to introduce his own form into matter coeval [with
   himself], nor would he be capable of acting, as it would then be
   eternal matter, and, therefore, obnoxious to no change. (2.) The second
   matter is that from which all things corporeal are now distinguished,
   according to their own separate forms; and this is the rude chaos and
   undigested mass created at the beginning. (3.) The third consists both
   of these simple and secret elements, and of certain compound bodies,
   from which all the rest have been produced, as from the waters have
   proceeded creeping and flying things, and fishes -- from the earth, all
   other living things, trees, herbs and shrubs -- from the rib of. Adam,
   the woman, and from seeds, the perpetuation of the species. VI. The
   form is the production itself of all things out of nothing, which form
   pre existed ready framed, according to the archetype in the mind of
   God, without any proper entity, lest any one should feign an ideal
   world. VII. From an inspection of the matter and form, it is evident,
   First, that creation is the immediate act of God, alone, both because a
   creature, who is of a finite power is incapable of operating on
   nothing, and because such a creature cannot shape matter in substantial
   forms. Secondly. The creation was freely produced, not necessarily,
   because God was neither bound to nothing, nor destitute of forms. VIII.
   The end -- not that which moved God to create, for God is not moved by
   any thing external, but that which incessantly and immediately results
   from the very act of creation, and which is, in fact, contained in the
   essence of this act -- this end is the demonstration of the divine
   wisdom, goodness and power. For those divine properties which concur to
   act, shine forth and show themselves in their own nature action --
   goodness, in the very communication -- wisdom, in the mode, order and
   variety -- and power, in this circumstance, that so many and such great
   things are produced out of nothing. IX. The end, which is called "to
   what purpose," is the good of the Creatures themselves, and especially
   of man, to whom are referred most other creatures, as being useful to
   him, according to the institution of the divine creation. X. The effect
   of creation is this universal world, which, in the Scriptures, obtains
   the names of the heaven and the earth, sometimes, also, of the sea, as
   being the extremities within which all things are embraced. This world
   is an entire something, which is perfect and complete, having no defect
   of any form, that can bear relation to the whole or to its parts; nor
   is redundant in any form which has no relation to the whole and its
   parts. It is, also, a single, or a united something, not by an
   indivisible unity, but according to connection and co-ordination, and
   the affection of mutual relation, consisting of parts distinguished,
   not only according to place and situation, but likewise according to
   nature, essence and peculiar existence. This was necessary, not only to
   adumbrate, in some measure, the perfection of God in variety and
   multitude, but also to demonstrate that the Lord omnipotent did not
   create the world by a natural necessity, but by the freedom of his
   will. XI. But this entire universe is, according to the Scriptures,
   distributed in the best manner possible into three classes of objects,
   (1.) Into creatures purely spiritual and invisible; of this class are
   the angels. (2.) Into creatures merely corporeal. And (3.) Into natures
   that are, in one part of them, corporeal and visible, and in another
   part, spiritual and invisible; men are of this last class. XII. We
   think this was the order observed in creation: Spiritual creatures,
   that is, the angels, were first created. Corporeal creatures were next
   created, according to the series of six days, not together and in a
   single moment. Lastly, man was created, consisting both of body and
   spirit; his body was, indeed, first formed; and afterwards his soul was
   inspired by creating, and created by inspiring; that as God commenced
   the creation in a spirit, so he might finish it on a spirit, being
   himself the immeasurable and eternal Spirit. XIII. This creation is the
   foundation of that right by which God can require religion from man,
   which is a matter that will be more certainly and fully understood,
   when we come more specially to treat on the primeval creation of man;
   for he who is not the creator of all things, and who, therefore, has
   not all things under his command, cannot be believed, neither can any
   sure hope and confidence be placed in him, nor can he alone be feared.
   Yet all these are acts which belong to religion. COROLLARIES I. The
   world was neither created from all eternity, nor could it be so
   created; though God was, from eternity, furnished with that capability
   by which he could create the world, and afterwards did create it; and
   though no moment of time can be conceived by us, in which the world
   could not have been created. II. He who forms an accurate conception,
   in his mind, of creation, must, in addition to the plenitude of divine
   wisdom, goodness and power, or capability, conceive that there was a
   two-fold privation or vacuity -- the First, according to essence or
   form, which will bear some resemblance to an infinite nothing that is
   capable of infinite forms; the SECOND, according to place, which will
   be like an infinite vacuum that is capable of being the receptacle of
   numerous worlds. III. Hence, this, also, follows, that time and place
   are not Separate Creatures, but are created with things themselves, or,
   rather, that they exist together at the creation of things, not by an
   absolute but a relative entity, without which no created thing can be
   thought upon or conceived. IV. This creation is the first of all the
   divine external acts, both in the intention of the Creator, and
   actually or in reality; and it is an act perfect in itself, not serving
   another more primary one, as its medium; though God has made some
   creatures, which, in addition to the fact of their having been made by
   the act of creation, are fitted to be advanced still further, and to be
   elevated to a condition yet more excellent. V. If any thing be
   represented as the object of creation, it seems that nothing can be
   laid down more suitably than those things which, out of all things
   possible, have, by the act of creation, been produced from
   non-existence into existence.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXV ON ANGELS IN GENERAL AND IN PARTICULAR

   Angels are substances merely spiritual, created after the image of God,
   not only that they might acknowledge, love and worship their Creator,
   and might live in a state of happiness with him, but that they might
   likewise perform certain duties concerning the rest of the creatures
   according to the command of God. II. We call them "substances," against
   the Sadducees and others, who contend that angels are nothing more than
   the good or the evil motions of spirits, or else exercises of power to
   aid or to injure. But this is completely at variance with the whole
   Scripture, as the actions, (which are those of supposititious beings,)
   the appearances, and the names which they ascribe to them, more than
   sufficiently demonstrate. III. We add that they are "merely spiritual,"
   that we may separate them from men, the species opposite to them, and
   may intimate their nature. And though composition out of matter and
   form does not belong to angels, yet, we affirm that they are absolutely
   compound substances, and that they are composed, (1.) Of being and
   essence. (2.) Of act and power, or capability. (3.) Lastly, of subject
   and inhering accident. IV. But because they are creatures, they are
   finite, and we measure them by place, time, and number. (1.) By PLACE,
   not that they are in it corporeally, that is, not that they occupy and
   fill up a certain local space, commensurate with their substance; but
   they are in it intellectually, that is, they exist in a place without
   the occupying and repletion of any local space, which the schoolmen
   denominate by way of definition, "to be in a place." But, as they
   cannot be in several places at once, but are sometimes in one place,
   and sometimes in another, so they are not moved without time, though it
   is scarcely perceptible. (2.) We measure them by TIME, or by duration
   or age, because they have a commencement of being, and the whole age in
   which they continue they have in succession, by parts of past, present
   and future; but the whole of it is not present to them at the same
   moment and without any distance. (3.) Lastly. We measure them by
   NUMBER, though this number is not defined in the pages of the sacred
   volume, and, therefore, is unknown to us, but known to God; yet it is
   very great, for it is neither diminished nor increased, because the
   angels are neither begotten nor die. V. We say that they were "created
   after the image of God;" for they are denominated "the sons of God."
   This image, we say, consists partly in those things which belong to
   their natures, and partly in those things which are of supernatural
   endowment. (1.) To their nature, belong both their spiritual essence,
   and the faculty of understanding, of willing, and of powerfully acting.
   (2.) To supernatural endowment, belong the light of knowledge in the
   understanding, and, following it, the rectitude or holiness of the
   will. Immortality itself, is of supernatural endowment; but it is that
   which God has determined to preserve to them, in what manner soever
   they may conduct themselves towards him. VI. The end subjoined is
   two-fold -- that, standing around the throne of God as his apparitors
   or messengers, for the glory of the divine Majesty, the angels may
   perpetually laud and celebrate [the praises of] God, and that they may,
   with the utmost swiftness, execute, at the beck of God, the offices of
   ministration which he enjoins upon them. VII. We are informed in the
   Scriptures themselves, that there is a certain order among angels; for
   they mention angels and archangels,-and attribute even to the devil his
   angels. But we are willingly ignorant of that distinction into orders
   and various degrees, and what it is which constitutes such distinction.
   We also think that if [the existence of] certain orders of angels be
   granted, it is more probable that God employs angels of different
   orders for the same duties, than that he appoints distinct orders to
   each separate ministry; though we allow that those who hold other
   sentiments, think so with some reason. VIII. For the performance of the
   ministries enjoined on them, angels have frequently appeared clothed in
   bodies, which bodies they have not formed and assumed to themselves out
   of nothing, but out of pre-existing matter, by a union neither
   essential nor personal, but local, (because they were not then beyond
   those bodies,) and, according to an instrumental purpose, that they
   might use them for the due performance of the acts enjoined. IX. These
   bodies, therefore, have neither been alive, nor have the angels,
   through them, seen, heard, tasted, smelled, touched, conceived
   phantasms or imaginations, &c. through the organs of these bodies, they
   produced only such acts as could be performed by an angel inhabiting
   them, or, rather, existing in them, as the mover according to place. On
   this account, perhaps, it is not improperly affirmed, that bodies,
   truly human, which are inhabited by a living and directing spirit, can
   be discerned, by human judgment, from these assumed bodies. X. God
   likewise prescribed a certain law to angels, by which they might order
   their life according to God, and not according to themselves, and by
   the observance of which they might be blessed, or, by transgressing it,
   might be eternally miserable, without any hope of pardon. For it was
   the good pleasure of God to act towards angels according to strict
   justice, and not to display all his goodness in bringing them to
   salvation. XI. But we do not decide whether a single act of obedience
   was sufficient to obtain eternal blessedness, as one act of
   disobedience was deserving of eternal destruction. XII. Some of the
   angels transgressed the law under which they were placed; and this they
   did by their own fault, because by that grace with which they were
   furnished, and by which God assisted them, and was prepared to assist
   them, they were enabled to obey the law, and to remain in their
   integrity. XIII. Hence, is the division made of angels into the good
   and the evil. The former are so denominated, because they continued
   steadfast in the truth, and preserved "their own habitation." But the
   latter are called "evil angels," because they did not continue in the
   truth, and "deserted their own habitation." XIV. But the former are
   called "good angels," not only according to an infused habit, but
   likewise according to the act which they performed, and according to
   their confirmation in habitual goodness, the cause of which we place in
   the increase of grace, and in their holy purpose, which they conceived
   partly through beholding the punishment which was inflicted on the
   apostate angels, and partly through the perception of increased grace.
   [If it be asked,] Did they not also do this, through perfect
   blessedness, to which nothing could be added?, we do not deny it, on
   account of the agreement of learned men, though it seems possible to
   produce reasons to the contrary. XV. The latter (Thesis 13) are called
   "evil angels," First, by actual wickedness, and then by habitual
   wickedness and pertinacious obstinacy in it; hence, they take a delight
   in doing whatever they suppose can tend to the reproach of God and the
   destruction of their neighbour. But this fixed obstinacy in evil seems
   to derive its origin partly from an intuition of the wrath of God and
   from an evil conscience which springs out of that, and partly from
   their own wickedness. XVI. But, concerning the species of sin which the
   angels perpetrated, we dare not assert what it was. Yet we say, it may
   with some probability be affirmed, that it was the crime of pride, from
   that argument which solicited man to sin through the desire of
   excellence. XVII. When it is the will of God to employ the assistance
   of good angels, he may be said to employ not only those powers and
   faculties which he has conferred on them, but likewise those which are
   augmented by himself. But we think it is contradictory to truth, if God
   be said to furnish the devils, whose service he uses, with greater
   knowledge and power than they have through creation and their own
   experience. COROLLARIES I. We allow this to become a subject of
   discussion: Can good angels be said sometimes to contend among
   themselves, with a reservation of that charity which they owe to God,
   to each other, and to men? II. Do angels need a mediator? and is Christ
   the mediator of angels? We reply in the negative. III. Are all angels
   of one species? We think this to be more probable than its contrary.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXVI ON THE CREATION OF MAN AFTER THE IMAGE OF GOD

   Man is a creature of God; consisting of a body and a soul, rational,
   good, and created after the divine image -- according to his body,
   created from pre-existing matter, that is, earth mixed and besprinkled
   with aqueous and ethereal moisture, -- according to his soul, created
   out of nothing, by the breathing of breath into his nostrils. II. But
   that body would have been incorruptible, and, by the grace of God,
   would not have been liable to death, if men had not sinned, and had
   not, by that deed, procured for himself the necessity of dying. And
   because it was to be the future receptacle of the soul, it was
   furnished by the wise Creator with various and excellent organs. III.
   But the soul is entirely of an admirable nature, if you consider its
   origin, substance, faculties, and habits. (1.) Its origin; for it is
   from nothing, created by infusion, and infused by creation, a body
   being duly prepared for its reception, that it might fashion matter as
   with form, and, being united to the body by a native bond, might, with
   it, compose one ufisamenon, production. Created, I say, by God in time,
   as he still daily creates a new soul in each body. IV. Its substance,
   which is simple, immaterial, and immortal. Simple, I say, not with
   respect to God; for it consists of act and power or capability, of
   being and essence, of subject and accidents; but it is simple with
   respect to material and compound things. It is immaterial, because it
   can subsist by itself, and, when separated from the body, can operate
   alone. It is immortal, not indeed from itself, but by the sustaining
   grace of God. V. Its faculties, which are two, the understanding and
   the will, as in fact the object of the soul is two-fold. For the
   understanding apprehends eternity and truth both universal and
   particular, by a natural and necessary, and therefore by a uniform act.
   But the will has an inclination to good. Yet this is either, according
   to the mode of its nature, to universal good and to that which is the
   chief good; or, according to the mode of liberty, to all other [kinds
   of] good. VI. Lastly. In its habits, which are, First, wisdom, by which
   the intellect clearly and sufficiently understood the supernatural
   truth and goodness both of felicity and of righteousness. Secondly.
   Righteousness and the holiness of truth, by which the will was fitted
   and ready to follow what this wisdom commanded to be done, and what it
   showed to be desired. This righteousness and wisdom are called
   "original," both because man had them from his very origin, and
   because, if man had continued in his integrity, they would also have
   been communicated to his posterity. VII. In all these things, the image
   of God most wonderfully shone forth. We say that this is the likeness
   by which man resembled his Creator, and expressed it according to the
   mode of his capacity -- in his soul, according to its substance,
   faculties and habits -- in this body, though this cannot be properly
   said to have been created after the image of God who is pure spirit,
   yet it is something divine, both from the circumstance that, if man had
   not sinned, his body would never have died, and because it is capable
   of special incorruptibility and glory, of which the apostle treats in 1
   Corinthians 15, because it displays some excellence and majesty beyond
   the bodies of other living creatures, and, lastly, because it is an
   instrument well fitted for admirable actions and operations -- in his
   whole person, according to the excellence, integrity, and the dominion
   over the rest of the creatures, which were conferred upon him. VIII.
   The parts of this image may be thus distinguished: Some of them may be
   called natural to man, and others supernatural; some, essential to him,
   and others accidental. It is natural and essential to the soul to be a
   spirit, and to be endowed with the power of understanding and of
   willing, both according to nature and the mode of liberty. But the
   knowledge of God, and of things pertaining to eternal salvation, is
   supernatural and accidental, as are likewise the rectitude and holiness
   of the will, according to that knowledge. Immortality is so far
   essential to the soul, that it cannot die unless it cease to be; but it
   is on this account supernatural and accidental, because it is through
   grace and the aid of preservation, which God is not bound to bestow on
   the soul. IX. But the immortality of the body is entirely supernatural
   and accidental; for it can be taken away from the body, and the body
   can return to the dust, from which it was taken. Its excellence above
   other living creatures, and its peculiar fitness to produce various
   effects, are natural to it, and essential. Its dominion over the
   creatures which belongs to the whole man as consisting of body and
   soul, may he partly considered as belonging to it according to the
   excellence of nature, and partly as conferred upon it by gracious gift,
   of which dominion this seems to be an evidence, that it is never taken
   wholly away from the soul, although it be varied, and be augmented and
   diminished according to degrees and parts. X. Thus was man created,
   that he might know, love and worship his Creator, and might live with
   him for ever in a state of blessedness. By this act of creation, God
   most manifestly displayed the glory of his wisdom, goodness and power.
   XI. From this description of man, it appears, that he is both fitted to
   perform the act of religion to God, since such an act is required from
   him -- that he is capable of the reward which may be properly adjudged
   to those who perform [acts of] religion to God, and of the punishment
   which may be justly inflicted on those who neglect religion; and
   therefore that religion may, by a deserved right, be required from man
   according to this relation; and this is the principal relation,
   according to which we must, in sacred theology, treat about the
   creation of man after the image of God. XII. In addition to this image
   of God, and this reference to supernatural and spiritual things, comes
   under our consideration the state of the natural life, in which the
   first man was created and constituted, according to the apostle Paul,
   "that which is natural was first, and afterwards, that which is
   spiritual." (1 Cor. xv. 46.) This state is founded in the natural union
   of body and soul, and in the life which the soul naturally lives in the
   body; from which union and life it is that the soul procures for its
   body, things which are good for it; and, on the other hand, the body is
   ready for offices which are congruous to its nature and desires.
   According to this state or condition, there is a mutual relation
   between man and the good things of this world, the effect of which is,
   that man can desire them, and, in procuring them for himself, can
   bestow that labour which he deems to be necessary and convenient.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXVII ON THE LORDSHIP OR DOMINION OF GOD

   Through creation, dominion over all things which have been created by
   himself, belongs to the Creator. It is, therefore, primary, being
   dependent on no other dominion or on that of no other person; and it
   is, on this account, chief because there is none greater; and it is
   absolute, because it is over the entire creature, according to the
   whole, and according to all and each of its parts, and to all the
   relations which subsist between the Creator and the creature. It is,
   consequently, perpetual, that is, so long as the creature itself
   exists. II. But the dominion of God is the right of the Creator, and
   his power over the creatures; according to which he has them as his own
   property, and can command and use them, and do about them, whatever the
   relation of creation and the equity which rests upon it, permit. III.
   For the right cannot extend further than is allowed by that cause from
   which the whole of it arises, and on which it is dependent. For this
   reason, it is not agreeable to this right of God, either that he
   delivers up his creature to another who may domineer over such
   creature, at his arbitrary pleasure, so that he be not compelled to
   render to God an account of the exercise of his sovereignty, and be
   able, without any demerit on the part of the creature, to inflict every
   evil on a creature capable of injury, or, at least, not for any good of
   this creature; or that he [God] command an act to be done by the
   creature, for the performance of which he neither has, nor can have,
   sufficient and necessary powers; or that he employ the creature to
   introduce sin into the world, that he may, by punishing or by forgiving
   it, promote his own glory; or, lastly, to do concerning the creature
   whatever he is able, according to his absolute power, to do concerning
   him, that is eternally to punish or to afflict him, without [his having
   committed] sin. IV. As this is a power over rational creatures, (in
   reference to whom chiefly we treat on the dominion and power of God,)
   it may be considered in two views, either as despotic, or as kingly, or
   patriarchal. The former is that which he employs without any intention
   of good which may be useful or saving to the creature; that latter is
   that which he employs when he also intends the good of the creature
   itself. And this last is used by God through the abundance of his own
   goodness and sufficiency, until he considers the creature to be
   unworthy, on account of his perverseness, to have God presiding over
   him in his kingly and paternal authority. V. Hence, it is, that, when
   God is about to command some thing to his rational creature, he does
   not exact every thing which he justly might do, and he employs
   persuasions through arguments which have regard to the utility and
   necessity of those persuasions. VI. In addition to this, God enters
   into a contract or covenant with his creature; and he does this for the
   purpose that the creature may serve him, not so much "of debt," as from
   a spontaneous, free and liberal obedience, according to the nature of
   confederations which consist of stipulations and promises. On this
   account, God frequently distinguishes his law by the title of a
   COVENANT. VII. Yet this condition is always annexed to the
   confederation, that if man be unmindful of the covenant and a contemner
   of its pleasant rule, he may always be impelled or governed by that
   domination which is really lordly, strict and rigid, and into which, he
   who refuses to obey the other [species of rule], justly falls. VIII.
   Hence, arises a two-fold right of God over his rational creature. The
   First, which belongs to him through creation; the Second, through
   contract. The former rests on the good which the creature has received
   from his Creator; the latter rests on the still greater benefit which
   the creature will receive from God, his preserver, promoter and
   glorifier. IX. If the creature happen to sin against this two-fold
   right, by that very act, he gives to God, his Lord, King and Father,
   the right of treating him as a sinning creature, and of inflicting on
   him due punishment; and this is a THIRD right, which rests on the
   wicked act of the creature against God.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXVIII ON THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD

   Not only does the very nature of God, and of things themselves, but
   likewise the Scriptures and experience do, evidently, show that
   providence belongs to God. II. But providence denotes some property of
   God, not a quality, or a capability, or a habit; but it is an act,
   which is not ad intra nor internal, but which is ad extra and external,
   and which is about an object different from God, and that is not united
   to him from all eternity, in his understanding, but as separate and
   really existing. III. And it is an act of the practical understanding,
   or of the will employing the understanding, not completed in a single
   moment, but continued through the moments of the duration of things.
   IV. And it may be defined the solicitous, everywhere powerful, and
   continued inspection and oversight of God, according to which he
   exercises a general care over the whole world, and over each of the
   creatures and their actions and passions, in a manner that is befitting
   himself, and suitable for his creatures, for their benefit, especially
   for that of pious men, and for a declaration of the divine perfection.
   V. We have represented the object of it to be both the whole world as
   it is a single thing consisting of many parts which have a certain
   relation among themselves, and possessing order between each other, and
   each our the creatures, with its actions and passions. We preserve the
   distinction of the goodness which is in them, (1.) According to their
   nature, through creation; (2.) According to grace, through the
   communication of supernatural gifts, and elevation to dignities; (3.)
   According to the right use both of nature and grace; yet we ascribe the
   last two, also, to the act of providence. VI. The rule of providence,
   according to which it produces its acts, is the wisdom of God,
   demonstrating what is worthy of God, according to his goodness, His
   severity, or his love for justice or for the creature, but always
   according to equity. VII. The acts of providence which belong to its
   execution, are -- preservation, which appears to be occupied about
   essences, qualities and quantities -- and government, which presides
   over actions and passions, and of which the principal acts are motion,
   assistance, concurrence and permission. The three former of these acts
   extend themselves to good, whether natural or moral; and the last of
   them appertains to evil alone. VIII. The power of God serves
   universally, and at all times, to execute these acts, with the
   exception of permission; specially, and sometimes, these acts are
   executed by the creatures themselves. Hence, an act of providence is
   called either immediate or mediate. When it employs [the agency of] the
   creatures, then it permits them to conduct their motions agreeably to
   their own nature, unless it be his pleasure to do any thing out of the
   ordinary way. IX. Then, those acts which are performed according to
   some certain course of nature or of grace, are called ordinary; those
   which are employed either beyond, above, or also contrary to this
   order, are styled extraordinary; yet they are always concluded by the
   terms due fitness and suitableness, of which we have treated in the
   definition. (Thesis 4.) X. Degrees are laid down in providence, not
   according to intuition or oversight itself, neither according to
   presence or continuity, but according to solicitude and care, which yet
   are free from anxiety, but which are greater concerning a man than
   concerning bullocks, also greater concerning believers and pious
   persons, than concerning those who are impious. XI. The end of
   providence and of all its acts, is the declaration of the divine
   perfections, of wisdom, goodness, justice, severity and power, and the
   good of the whole, especially of those men who are chosen or elected.
   XII. But since God does nothing, or permits it to be done in time,
   which he has not decreed from all eternity, either to do or to permit
   that decree, therefore, is placed before providence and its acts as an
   internal act is before one that is external. XIII. The effect, or,
   rather, the consequence, which belongs to God himself, is his
   prescience; and it is partly called natural and necessary, and partly
   free -- FREE, because it follows the act of the divine free will,
   without which it would not be the object of it -- Natural and
   Necessary, so far as, (when this object is laid down by the act of the
   divine will,) it cannot be unknown by the divine understanding. XIV.
   Prediction sometimes follows this prescience, when it pleases God to
   give intimations to his creatures of the issues of things, before they
   come to pass. But neither prediction nor any prescience induces a
   necessity of any thing that is afterwards to be, since they are [in the
   divine mind.] posterior in nature and order to the thing that is
   future. For a thing does not come to pass because it has been foreknown
   or foretold; but it is foreknown and foretold because it is yet to come
   to pass. XV. Neither does the decree itself, by which the Lord
   administers providence and its acts, induce any necessity on things
   future; for, since it, the decree, (§ 12) is an internal act of God, it
   lays down nothing in the thing itself. But things come to pass and
   happen either necessarily or contingently, according to the mode of
   power, which it has pleased God. to employ in the administration of
   affairs.

DISPUTATION XXIX ON THE COVENANT INTO WHICH GOD ENTERED WITH OUR FIRST PARENTS

   Though, according to His right and power over man, whom he had created
   after his own image, God could prescribe obedience to him in all things
   for the performance of which he possessed suitable powers, or would, by
   the grace of God, have them in that state; yet, that he might elicit
   from man voluntary and free obedience, which, alone, is grateful to
   him, it was his will to enter into a contract and covenant with him, by
   which God required obedience, and, on the other hand, promised a
   reward, to which he added the denunciation of a punishment, that the
   transaction might not seem to be entirely one between equals, and as if
   man was not completely bound to God. II. On this account, the law of
   God is very often called a Covenant, because it consists of those two
   parts, that is, a work commanded, and a reward promised, to which is
   subjoined the denunciation of a punishment, to signify the right which
   God had over man and which he has not altogether surrendered, and to
   incite man to greater obedience. III. God prescribed this obedience,
   first, by a law placed in and imprinted on the mind of man, in which is
   contained his natural duty towards God and his neighbour, and,
   therefore, towards himself also; and it is that of love, with fear,
   honour and worship towards a superior. For, as true virtue consists in
   the government or right ordering of the affections, (of which the
   first, the chief, and that on which the rest depend, is Love,) the
   whole law is contained in the right ordering of love. And, as no
   obedience seems to be yielded in the case of a man who executes the
   whole of his own will without any, even the least resistance,
   therefore, to try his obedience, that thing was to be prescribed, to
   which, by a certain feeling, man had an abhorrence; and that was to be
   forbidden, towards which he was drawn by a certain inclination.
   Therefore the love of ourselves was to be regulated or rightly ordered,
   which is the first and proximate cause that man should live in society
   with his species, or according to humanity. IV. To this law, it was the
   pleasure of God to add another, which was a symbolical one. A
   symbolical law is one that prescribes or forbids some act, which, in
   itself, is neither agreeable nor disagreeable to God, that is, one that
   is indifferent; and it serves for this purpose that God may try whether
   man is willing to yield obedience to him, solely on this account,
   because it has been the pleasure of God to require such obedience, and
   though it were impossible to devise any other reason why God imposed
   that law. V. That symbolical law was, in this instance, prohibitive of
   some act, to which man was inclined by some natural propensity, (that
   is, to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and of evil,) though
   "it was pleasant to the eyes and good for food." By the commanding of
   an indifferent act, it does not seem to have been possible to try the
   obedience of man with equal advantage. VI. This seems to be the
   difference between each [of these kinds of] obedience, that the first
   (Thesis I) is true obedience and, in itself, pleasing to God; and the
   man who performs it is said truly to live according to godliness; but
   that the latter (Theses 4 and 5) is not so much obedience, itself, as
   the external profession of willingly yielding obedience; and it is
   therefore an acknowledgment, or the token of an acknowledgment, by
   which man professes himself to be subject to God, and declares that he
   is willingly subject. Exactly in the same manner, a vassal yields
   obedience to his lord, for having fought against his enemies, which
   obedience he confesses that he cheerfully performs to him, by
   presenting him annually with a gift of small value. VII. From this
   comparison, it appears that the obedience which is yielded to a
   symbolical law is far inferior to that which is yielded to a natural
   law, but that the disobedience manifested to a symbolical law is not
   the less serious, or that it is even more grievous; because, by this
   very act, man professes that he is unwilling to submit himself, and
   indeed not to yield obedience in other matters, and those of greater
   importance, and of more difficult labour. VIII. The reward that
   corresponds with obedience to this chief law, the performance of which
   is, of itself, pleasing to God, (the analogy and difference which exist
   between God and man being faithfully observed,) is life eternal, the
   complete satisfying of the whole of our will and desire. But the reward
   which answers to the observance of the symbolical law, is the free
   enjoyment of the fruits of Paradise, and the power to eat of the tree
   of life, by the eating of which man was always restored to his pristine
   strength. But this tree of life was a symbol of eternal life, which man
   would have enjoyed, if, by abstaining from eating the fruit, he had
   professed obedience, and had truly performed such obedience to the
   moral law. IX. We are of opinion that, if our first parents had
   remained in their integrity by obedience performed to both these laws,
   God would have acted with their posterity by the same compact, that is,
   by their yielding obedience to the moral law inscribed on their hearts,
   and to some symbolical or ceremonial law; though we dare not specially
   make a similar affirmation, respecting the tree of the knowledge of
   good and evil. X. So, likewise, if they had persisted in their
   obedience to both laws, we think it very probable that, at certain
   periods, men would have been translated from this natural life, by the
   intermediate change of the natural, mortal and corruptible body, into a
   body spiritual, immortal, and incorruptible, to pass a life of
   immortality and bliss in heaven. COROLLARY We allow this to be made a
   subject of discussion: Did Eve receive this symbolical command about
   the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, immediately from God, or
   through Adam?
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXX THE MANNER IN WHICH MAN CONDUCTED HIMSELF FOR FULFILLING THE
FIRST COVENANT, OR ON THE SIN OF OUR FIRST PARENTS

   When God had entered into this covenant with men, it was the part of
   man perpetually to form and direct his life according to the conditions
   and laws prescribed by this covenant, because he would then have
   obtained the rewards promised through the performance of both those
   conditions, and would not have incurred the punishment due and
   denounced to disobedience. We are ignorant of the length of time in
   which man fulfilled his part; but the Holy Scriptures testify that he
   did not persevere in this obedience. II. But we say the violation of
   this covenant was a transgression of the symbolical law imposed
   concerning his not eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of
   good and evil. III. The efficient cause of that transgression was man,
   determining his will to that forbidden object, and applying his power
   or capability to do it. But the external, moving, per se, and principal
   cause was the devil, who, having accosted the woman, (whom he
   considered weaker than the man, and who when persuaded herself, would
   easily persuade him,) employed false arguments for persuasion. One of
   his arguments was deduced from the usefulness of the good which would
   ensue from this act; another was deduced from the setting aside of Him
   who had prohibited it, that is, by a denial of the punishment which
   would follow. The instrumental cause was the serpent, whose tongue the
   devil abused to propose what arguments he chose. The accidental cause
   was the fruit itself, which seemed good for food, pleasant in its
   flavor, and desirable to the eyes. The occasional cause was the law of
   God, that circumscribed by its interdict an act which was indifferent
   in its nature, and for which man possessed inclination and powers, that
   it might be impossible for this offense to be perpetrated without sin.
   IV. The only moving or antecedent cause was a two-fold inclination in
   man, a superior one for the likeness of God, and an inferior one for
   the desirable fruit, "pleasant to the sight, and good for food." Both
   of them were implanted by God through creation; but they were to be
   used in a certain method, order and time. The immediate and proximate
   cause was the will of man, which applied itself to the act, the
   understanding preceding and showing the way; and these are the causes
   which concurred to effect this sin, and all of which, as, through the
   image of God, he was able to resist, so was it his duty, through the
   imposing of that law, to have resisted. Not one of these, therefore,
   nor others, if such be granted in the genus of causes, imposed any
   necessity on man [to commit that sin]. It was not an external cause,
   whether you consider God, or something from God, the devil, or man.
   5.(1.) It was not God; for since he is the chief good, he does nothing
   but what is good; and, therefore, he can be called neither the
   efficient cause of sin, nor the deficient cause, since he has employed
   whatever things were sufficient and necessary to avoid this sin. (2.)
   Neither was it something in God; it was neither His understanding nor
   his will, which commands those things which are just, performs those
   which are good, and permits those which are evil; and this permission
   is only a cessation from such an act as would in reality have hindered
   the act of man, by effecting nothing beyond itself, but by suspending
   some efficiency. This, therefore, cannot be the cause. (3.) Nor was the
   devil the cause; for he only infused counsel; he did not impel, or
   force by necessity. (4.) Eve was not the cause; for she was only able
   to precede by her example, and to entice by some argument, but not to
   compel. VI. It was not an internal cause -- whether you consider the
   common or general nature of man, which was inclined only to one good,
   or his particular nature, which exactly corresponded with that which is
   general; nor was it any thing in his particular nature, for this would
   have been the understanding; but it could act by persuasion and advice,
   not by necessity. Man, therefore, sinned by his free will, his own
   proper motion being allowed by God, and himself persuaded by the devil.
   VII. The matter of that sin was the eating of the fruit of the tree --
   an act indifferent, indeed, in its nature, but forbidden by the
   imposing of a law, and withdrawn from the power of man. lie could also
   have easily abstained from it without any loss of pleasure. In this, is
   apparent the admirable goodness of God, who tries whether man be
   willing to submit to the divine command in a matter which could so
   easily be avoided. VIII. The form was the transgression of the law
   imposed, or the act of eating as having been forbidden; for as it had
   been forbidden, it had gone beyond the order of lawful and good acts,
   and had been taken away from the [allowable] power of man, that it
   might not be exercised without sin. IX. There was no end for this sin;
   for it always assumed the shape or habit of good. An end, however, was
   proposed by man, (but it was not obtained, that he might satisfy both
   his superior propensity towards the image of God, and his inferior one
   towards the fruit of the tree. But the end of the devil was the
   aversion of man from his God, and, through this, his further seduction
   into exile, and the society of the evil one. But the permission of God
   had respect to the antecedent condition of creation, which had made men
   possessed of free will, and for [the performance of] acts glorious to
   God, which might arise from it. X. The serious enormity of that sin is
   principally manifest from the following particulars: (1.) Because it
   was a transgression of such a law as had been imposed to try whether
   man was willing to be subject to the law of God, and it carried with it
   numbers of other grievous sins. (2.) Because, after God had loaded man
   with such signal gifts, he had the audacity to perpetrate this sin.
   (3.) Because, when there was such great facility to abstain from sin,
   he suffered himself to be so easily induced, and did not satisfy his
   inclination in such a copious abundance of things. (4.) Became he
   committed that sin in a sanctified place which was a type of the
   heavenly Paradise, almost under the eyes of God himself, who convened
   with him in a familiar manner.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXXI ON THE EFFECTS OF THE SIN OF OUR FIRST PARENTS

   The first and immediate effect of the sin which Adam and Eve committed
   in eating of the forbidden fruit, was the offending of the Deity, and
   guilt -- Offense, which arose from the prohibition imposed -- Guilt,
   from the sanction added to it, through the denunciation of punishment,
   if they neglected the prohibition. II. From the offending of the Deity,
   arose his wrath on account of the violated commandment. In this
   violation, occur three causes of just anger: (1.) The disparagement of
   his power or right. (2.) A denial of that towards which God had an
   inclination. (3.) A contempt of the divine will intimated by the
   command. III. Punishment was consequent on guilt and the divine wrath;
   the equity of this punishment is from guilt, the infliction of it is by
   wrath. But it is preceded both by the wounding of the conscience, and
   by the fear of an angry God and the dread of punishment. Of these, man
   gave a token by his subsequent flight, and by "hiding himself from the
   presence of the Lord God, when he heard him walking in the garden in
   the cool of the day and calling unto Adam." IV. The assistant cause of
   this flight and hiding [of our first parents] was a consciousness of
   their own nakedness, and shame on account of that of which they had not
   been previously ashamed. This seems to have served for racking the
   conscience, and for exciting or augmenting that fear and dread. V. The
   Spirit of grace, whose abode was within man, could not consist with a
   consciousness of having offended God; and, therefore, on the
   perpetration of sin and the condemnation of their own hearts, the Holy
   Spirit departed. Wherefore, the Spirit of God likewise ceased to lead
   and direct man, and to bear inward testimony to his heart of the favour
   of God. This circumstance must be considered in the place of a heavy
   punishment, when the law, with a depraved conscience, accused, bore its
   testimony [against them], convicted and condemned them. VI. Beside this
   punishment, which was instantly inflicted, they rendered themselves
   liable to two other punishments; that is, to temporal death, which is
   the separation of the soul from the body; and to death eternal, which
   is the separation of the entire man from God, his chief good. VII. The
   indication of both these punishments was the ejectment of our first
   parents out of Paradise. It was a token of death temporal; because
   Paradise was a type and figure of the celestial abode, in which
   consummate and perfect bliss ever flourishes, with the translucent
   splendour of the divine Majesty. It was also a token of death eternal,
   because, in that garden was planted the tree of life, the fruit of
   which, when eaten, was suitable for continuing natural life to man
   without the intervention of death. This tree was both a symbol of the
   heavenly life of which man was bereft, and of death eternal, which was
   to follow. VIII. To these may be added the punishment peculiarly
   inflicted on the man and the woman -- on the former, that he must eat
   bread through "the sweat of his face," and that "the ground, cursed for
   his sake, should bring forth to him thorns and thistles;" on the
   latter, that she should be liable to various pains in conception and
   child-bearing. The punishment inflicted on the man had regard to his
   care to preserve the individuals of the species, and that on the woman,
   to the perpetuation of the species. IX. But because the condition of
   the covenant into which God entered with our first parents was this,
   that, if they continued in the favour and grace of God by an observance
   of this command and of others, the gifts conferred on them should be
   transmitted to their posterity, by the same divine grace which they
   had, themselves, received; but that, if by disobedience they rendered
   themselves unworthy of those blessings, their posterity, likewise,
   should not possess them, and should be liable to the contrary evils.
   This was the reason why all men, who were to be propagated from them in
   a natural way, became obnoxious to death temporal and death eternal,
   and devoid of this gift of the Holy Spirit or original righteousness.
   This punishment usually receives the appellation of "a privation of the
   image of God," and "original sin." X. But we permit this question to be
   made a subject of discussion: Must some contrary quality, beside the
   absence of original righteousness, be constituted as another part of
   original sin? though we think it much more probable, that this absence
   of original righteousness, only, is original sin, itself, as being that
   which alone is sufficient to commit and produce any actual sins
   whatsoever. XI. The discussion, whether original sin be propagated by
   the soul or by the body, appears to us to be useless; and therefore the
   other, whether or not the soul be through traduction, seems also
   scarcely to be necessary to this matter.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXXII ON THE NECESSITY OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION

   Without religion, man can have no union with God; and without the
   command and institution of God, no religion can subsist, which, since
   it appertains to himself, either by the right of creation, or by the
   additional right of restoration, he can vary it according to his own
   pleasure; so that, in whatever manner he may appoint religion,. he
   always obligates man to observe it, and through this obligation,
   imposes on him the necessity of observing it. II. But the mode of
   religion is not changed, except with a change of the relation between
   God and man, who must be united to him; and when this relation is
   changed, religion is varied, that is, on the previous supposition that
   man is yet to be united to God; for, as to its substance, (which
   consists in the knowledge of God, faith, love, &c.,) religion is always
   the same, except it seem to be referred to the substance, that Christ
   enters into the Christian religion as its object. III. The first
   relation, and that which was the first foundation of the primitive
   religion, was the relation between God and man -- between God as the
   Creator, and man as created after the image and in a state of
   innocency; wherefore the religion built upon that relation was that of
   rigid and strict righteousness and legal obedience. But that relation
   was changed, through the sin of man, who after this was no longer
   innocent and acceptable to God, but a transgressor and doomed to
   damnation. Therefore, after [the commission of] sin, either man could
   have had no hope of access to God and to a union with him, since he had
   violated and abrogated the divine worship; or a new relation of man to
   his Creator was to be founded by God, through his gracious restoration
   of man, and a new religion was to be instituted on that relation. This
   is that which God has done, to the praise of his own glorious grace.
   IV. But, as God is not the restorer of a sinner, except in a mediator,
   who expiates sins, appeases God, and sanctifies the sinner, I repeat
   it, except in that "one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
   Jesus," it was not the will of our most glorious and most gracious God,
   alone and without this Mediator, either that there should be any
   foundation between him and the sinner restored by him, or that there
   should be an object to the religion, which, to the honour of the
   restorer and to the eternal felicity of the restored, he would
   construct upon that relation. For it pleased the Father, through
   Christ, to reconcile all things to himself, and by him to restore both
   those things which are in heaven, and those on earth. It also pleased
   the Father "that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
   Father;" so that whosoever does not honour the Son, does not honour the
   Father. V. Wherefore, after the entrance of sin, there has been no
   salvation of men by God, except through Christ, and no saving worship
   of God, except in the name of Christ, and with regard to him who is the
   Anointed One for sinners, but the saviour of them who believe on him;
   so that whosoever is without God is without Christ; and he that is
   without Christ, is without the faith, the worship and the religion of
   Christ; and without the faith and hope of this Christ, either promised
   and shadowed forth in types, or exhibited and clearly announced,
   neither were the ancient patriarchs saved, nor can we be saved. VI. On
   this account, as the transgression of the first covenant contains the
   necessity of constituting another religion, and as this would not have
   occurred if that first covenant had not been made, it appears that.
   those things upon which the Scriptures treat, concerning the first
   covenant, and its transgression on the part of the first human beings,
   contain the occasion of the restoration which God was to make through
   Christ, and that they were, therefore, to be thus treated in the
   Christian religion. This conclusion is easily drawn from the very form
   of the narration given by Moses. VII. God is also the object of the
   Christian religion, both as Creator, and as Restorer in Christ, the Son
   of his love; and these titles contain the reason why God can demand
   religion from man, who has been formed by his CREATOR a creature, and
   by his Restorer a new creature. In this object, also, must be
   considered what is the will of the Glorifier of man, who leads him out
   from the demerit of sin, and from misery, to eternal felicity. These
   three names, Creator, Restorer, and Glorifier, contain the most
   powerful arguments by which man is persuaded to religion. VIII. But
   because it was the good pleasure of God to make this restoration
   through his Son, Jesus Christ, the Mediator, therefore, the Son of God,
   as constituted by the Father Christ and Lord, is likewise an object of
   the Christian religion subordinate to God; though he on earth, as the
   Word of his Father, both may be and ought to be considered as existing
   in the Father from all eternity.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXXIII ON THE RESTORATION OF MAN

   Since God is the object of the Christian religion, not only as the
   Creator, but also and properly as the Restorer, of the human race, and
   as we have finished our treatise on the creation, we will now proceed
   to treat on the restoration of mankind, because it is that which
   contains, in itself, another cause why God by deserved right can
   require religion from a man and a sinner. II. This restoration is the
   restitution, and the new or the second creation, of sinful man,
   obnoxious through sin to death temporal and eternal, and to the
   dominion of sin. III. The antecedent or only moving cause is the
   gracious mercy of God, by which it was his pleasure to pardon sin and
   to succour the misery of his creature. IV. The matter about which [it
   is exercised] is man, a sinner, and, on account of sin, obnoxious to
   the wrath of God and the servitude of sin. This matter contains in
   itself the outwardly moving cause of his gracious mercy, but
   accidentally, through this circumstance, that God delights in mercy;
   for in every other respect sin is per se and properly the external and
   meritorious cause of wrath and damnation. V. We may indeed conceive the
   form, under the general notion of restitution, reparation, or
   redemption; but we do not venture to give an explanation of it, except
   under two particular acts, the first of which is the remission of sins,
   or the being received into favour; the other is the renewal or
   sanctification of sinful man after the image of God, in which is
   contained his adoption into a son of God. VI. The first end is the
   praise of the glorious grace of God, which springs from, and exists at
   the same time with, the very act of restitution or redemption; the
   other end is, that, after men have been thus repaired, they "should
   live soberly, righteously and godly, in this present world," and should
   attain to a blissful felicity in the world to come. VII. But it has
   pleased God not to exercise this mercy in restoring man, without the
   declaration of his justice, by which he loves righteousness and hates
   sin; and he has, therefore, appointed that the mode of transacting this
   restoration should be through a mediator intervening between him and
   sinful man, and that this restoration should be so performed as to make
   it certain and evident that God hates sin and loves righteousness, and
   that it is his will to remit nothing of his own right, except after his
   justice had been satisfied. VIII. For the fulfilling of this mediation,
   God has constituted his only begotten Son the mediator between him and
   men, and indeed a mediator through his own blood and death; for it was
   not the will of God that, without the shedding of blood and the
   intervention of the death of the Testator himself, there should be any
   remission, or a confirmation of the New Testament, which promises
   remission and the inscribing of the law of God in the hearts [of
   believers]. IX. This is the reason why the second object of the
   Christian religion, in subordination to God, is Jesus Christ, the
   Mediator of this restoration, after the Father had made him Christ [the
   Anointed One] and had constituted him the Lord and the Head of the
   church, so that we must, through him, approach to God for the purpose
   of performing [acts of] religion to him; and the duty of religion must
   be rendered to him, with God the Father, from which duty we by no means
   exclude the Spirit of the Father and the Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXXIV ON THE PERSON OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

   Because our Lord Jesus Christ is the secondary object of the Christian
   religion, we must further treat on him, as such, in a few disputations.
   But we account it necessary, in the first place, to consider the
   person, of what kind he is, in himself. II. We say that this person is
   the Son of God and the son of man, consisting of two natures, the
   divine and the human, inseparably united without mixture or confusion,
   not only according to habitude or indwelling, but likewise by that
   union which the ancients have correctly denominated hypostatical. III.
   He has the same nature with the Father, by internal and external
   communication. IV. He has his human nature from the virgin Mary through
   the operation of the Holy Spirit, who came upon her and overshadowed
   her by fecundating her seed, so that from it the promised Messiah
   should, in a supernatural manner, be born. V. But, according to his
   human nature, he consists of a body truly organic, and of a soul truly
   human which quickened or animated his body. In this, he is similar to
   other persons or human beings, as well as in all the essential and
   natural properties both of body and soul. VI. From this personal union
   arises a communication of forms or properties; such communication,
   however, was not real, as though some things which are proper to the
   divine nature were effused into the human nature; but it was verbal,
   yet it rested on the truth of this union, and intimated the closest
   conjunction of both the natures. COROLLARY The word autoqeov "very
   God," so far as it signifies that the Son of God has the divine essence
   from himself, cannot be ascribed to the Son of God, according to the
   Scriptures and the sentiments of the Greek and Latin churches.

DISPUTATION XXXV ON THE PRIESTLY OFFICE OF CHRIST

   Though the person of Christ is, on account of its excellence, most
   worthy to be honoured and worshipped, yet, that he might be, according
   to God, the object of the Christian religion, two other things, through
   the will of God, were necessary: (1.) That he should undertake some
   offices for the sake of men, to obtain eternal salvation for them. (2.)
   That God should bestow on him dominion or lordship over all things, and
   full power to save and to damn, with an express command, "that all men
   should honour the Son even as they honour the Father," and that "every
   knee should bow to him, to the glory of God the Father." II. Both these
   things are comprehended together under the title of saviour and
   Mediator. He is a saviour, so far as that comprises the end of both,
   and a Mediator, as it denotes the method of performing the end of both.
   For the act of saving, so far as it is ascribed to Christ, denotes the
   acquisition and communication of salvation. But Christ is the Mediator
   of men before God in soliciting and obtaining salvation, and the
   Mediator of God with men in imparting it. We will now treat on the
   former of these. III. The Mediator of men before God, and their saviour
   through the soliciting and the acquisition of salvation, (which is also
   called, by the orthodox, "through the mode of merit,") has been
   constituted a priest, by God, not according to the order of Levi, but
   according to that of Melchisedec, who was "priest of the most high
   God," and at the same time "king of Salem." IV. Through the nature of a
   true and not of a typical priest was at once both priest and victim in
   one person, which [duty], therefore, he could not perform except
   through true and substantial obedience towards God who imposed the
   office on him. V. In the priesthood of Christ, must be considered the
   preparation for the office, and the discharge of it. (1.) The
   Preparation is that of the priest and of the victim; the Priest was
   prepared by vocation or the imposition of the office, by the
   sanctification and consecration of his person through the Holy Spirit,
   and through his obedience and sufferings, and even in some respect by
   his resuscitation from the dead. The victim was also prepared by
   separation, by obedience, (for it was necessary that the victim should
   likewise be holy,) and by being slain. 6.(2.) The Discharge of this
   office consists in the offering or presentation of the sacrifice of his
   body and blood, and in his intercession before God. Benediction or
   blessing, which, also, belonged to the sacerdotal office in the Old
   Testament, will, in this case, be more appropriately referred to the
   very communication of salvation, as we read in the Old Testament that
   kings, also, dispensed benedictions. VII. The results of the
   fulfillment of the sacerdotal office are, reconciliation with God, the
   obtaining of eternal redemption, the remission of sins, the Spirit of
   grace, and life eternal. VIII. Indeed, in this respect, the priesthood
   of Christ was propitiatory. But, because we, also, by his beneficence
   have been constituted priests to offer thanksgivings to God through
   Christ, therefore, he is also a eucharistical priest, so far as he
   offers our sacrifices to God the Father, that, when they are offered by
   his hands, the Father may receive them with acceptance. IX. It is
   evident, from those things which have been now advanced, that Christ,
   in his sacerdotal office, has neither any successor, vicar, nor
   associate, whether we consider the oblation, both of his propitiatory
   sacrifice which he offered of those things which were his own, and of
   his eucharistical sacrifice which he offered of those also, which
   belonged to us, or whether we consider his intercession. COROLLARIES I.
   We deny that the comparison between the priesthood of Christ and that
   of Melchisedec, consisted either principally or in any manner in this,
   that Melchisedec offered bread and wine when he met Abraham returning
   from the slaughter of the kings. II. That the propitiatory sacrifice of
   Christ is bloodless, implies a contradiction, according to the
   Scriptures. III. The living Christ is presented to the Father in no
   other place than in heaven. Therefore, he is not offered in the mass.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXXVI ON THE PROPHETICAL OFFICE OF CHRIST

   The prophetical office of Christ comes under consideration in two views
   -- either as he executed it in his own person while he was a sojourner
   on earth, or as he administered it when seated in heaven, at the right
   hand of the Father. In the present disputation, we shall treat upon it
   according to the former of these relations. II. The proper object of
   the prophetical office of Christ was not the law, though [he explained
   or] fulfilled that, and freed it from depraved corruptions; neither was
   it epaggelia the promise, though he confirmed that which had been made
   to the fathers; but it was the gospel and the New Testament itself, or
   "the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness. III. In this prophetical
   office of Christ are to be considered both the imposition of the
   office, and the discharge of it. 1. The imposition has sanctification,
   instruction or furnishing, inauguration, and the promise of assistance.
   IV. Sanctification is that by which the Father sanctified him to his
   office, from the very moment of his conception by the Holy Spirit,
   (whence, he says, "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I
   into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth,") and,
   indeed, in a manner far more excellent than that by which Jeremiah and
   John are said to have been sanctified. V. Instruction, or furnishing,
   is a conferring of those gifts which are necessary for discharging the
   duties of the prophetical office; and it consists in a most copious
   effusion of the Holy Spirit upon him, and in its abiding in him -- "the
   Spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and might, of knowledge
   and of the fear of the Lord;" by which Spirit it came to pass that it
   was his will to teach according to godliness all those things which
   were to be taught, and that he had the courage to teach them -- his
   mind and affections, both concupiscible and irascible, having been
   sufficiently and abundantly instructed or furnished against all
   impediments. VI. But the instruction in things necessary to be known is
   said, in the Scriptures, to be imparted by vision and hearing, by a
   familiar knowledge of the secrets of the Father, which is intimated in
   the phrase in which he is said to be in the bosom of the Father, and in
   heaven. VII. His inauguration was made by the baptism which John
   conferred on him, when a voice came from the Father in heaven, and the
   Spirit, "in a bodily shape, like a dove, descended upon him." These
   were like credential letters, by which the power of teaching was
   asserted and claimed for him as the ambassador of the Father. VIII. To
   this, must be subjoined the promised perpetual assistance of the Holy
   Spirit, resting and remaining upon him in this very token of a dove,
   that he might administer with spirit an office so arduous. IX. In the
   Discharge of this office, are to be considered the propounding of the
   doctrine, its confirmation and the result. X. The propounding of the
   doctrine was made in a manner suitable, both to the things themselves,
   and to persons -- to his own person, and to the persons of those whom
   he taught with grace and authority, by accepting the person of no man,
   of whatsoever state or condition he might be. XI. The confirmation was
   given both by the holiness which exactly answers to the doctrine, and
   by miracles, predictions of future things, the revealing of the
   thoughts of men and of other secrets, and by his most bitter and
   contumelious death. XII. The result was two-fold: The First was one
   that agreed with the nature of the doctrine itself -- the conversion of
   a few men to him, but without such a knowledge of him as the doctrine
   required; for their thoughts were engaged with the notion of restoring
   the external kingdom. The Second, which arose from the depraved
   wickedness of his auditors, was the rejection of the doctrine, and of
   him who taught it, his crucifixion and murder. Wherefore, he complains
   concerning himself, in Isa. xlix. 4 "I have laboured in vain, I have
   spent my strength for nought." XIII. As God foreknew that this would
   happen, it is certain that he willed this prophetical office to serve,
   for the consecration of Christ, through sufferings, to undertake and
   administer the sacerdotal and regal office. And thus the prophetical
   office of Christ, so far as it was administered by him through his
   apostles and others of his servants, was the means by which his church
   was brought to the faith, and was saved. COROLLARY We allow this
   question to become a subject of discussion: Did the soul of Christ
   receive any knowledge immediately from the Logos operating on it,
   without the intervention of the Holy Spirit, which is called the
   knowledge of union?
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXXVII ON THE REGAL OFFICE OF CHRIST

   As Christ, when consecrated by his sufferings, was made the author of
   salvation to all who obey him; and as for this end, not only the
   solicitation and the obtaining of blessings were required, (to which
   the sacerdotal office was devoted,) but also the communication of them,
   it was necessary for him to be invested with the regal dignity, and to
   be constituted Lord over. all things, with full power to bestow
   salvation, and whatever things are necessary for that purpose. II. The
   kingly office of Christ is a mediatorial function, by which, the Father
   having constituted him Lord over all things which are in heaven and in
   earth, and peculiarly the King and the head of his church, he governs
   all things and the church, to her salvation and the glory of God. We
   will view this office in accommodation to the church, because we are
   principally concerned in this consideration. III. The functions
   belonging to this office seem to be the following: Vocation to a
   participation in the kingdom of Christ, legislation, the conferring of
   the blessings in this life necessary to salvation, the averting of the
   evils opposed to them, and the last judgment and the circumstances
   connected with it. IV. Vocation is the first function of the regal
   office of Christ, by which he calls sinful men to repent and believe
   the gospel -- a reward being proposed concerning a participation of the
   kingdom, and a threatening added of eternal destruction from the
   presence of the Lord. V. Legislation is the second function of the
   regal office of Christ, by which he prescribes to believers their duty,
   that, as his subjects, they are bound to perform to him, as their Head
   and Prince -- a sanction being added through rewards and punishments,
   which properly agree with the state of this spiritual kingdom. VI.
   Among the blessings which the third function of the regal office of
   Christ serves to communicate, we number not only the remission of sins
   and the Spirit of grace inwardly witnessing with our hearts that we are
   the children of God, but likewise all those blessings which are
   necessary for the discharge of the office; as illumination, the
   inspiring of good thoughts and desires, strength against temptations,
   and, in brief, the inscribing of the law of God in our hearts, In
   addition to these, as many of the blessings of this natural life, as
   Christ knows will contribute to the salvation of those who believe in
   him. But the evils over the averting of which this function presides,
   must be understood as being contrary to these blessings. VII. Judgment
   is the last act of the regal office of Christ, by which, justly, and
   without respect of persons, he pronounces sentence concerning all the
   thoughts, words, deeds and omissions of all men, who have been
   previously summoned and placed before his tribunal; and by which he
   irresistibly executes that sentence through a just and gracious
   rendering of rewards, and through the due retribution of punishments,
   which consist in the bestowing of life eternal, and in the infliction
   of death eternal. VIII. The results or consequences which correspond
   with these functions, are, (1.) The collection or gathering together of
   the church, or the building of the temple of Jehovah; this gathering
   together consists of the calling of the gentiles, and the bringing back
   or the restoration of the Jews, through the faith which answers to the
   divine vocation. (2.) Obedience performed to the commands of Christ by
   those who have believed in the Lord, and who have, through faith, been
   made citizens of the kingdom of heaven. (3.) The obtaining of the
   remission of sins, and of the Holy Spirit, and of other blessings which
   conduce to salvation, as well as a deliverance from the evils which
   molest [believers] in the present life. (4.) Lastly. The resurrection
   from the dead, and a participation of life eternal. IX. The means by
   which Christ administers his kingdom, and which principally come under
   our observation in considering the church, are the word, and the Holy
   Spirit, which ought never to be separated from each other. For this
   Spirit ordinarily employs the word, or the meaning of the word, in its
   external preaching; and the word alone, without the illumination and
   the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, is insufficient. But Christ never
   separates these two things, except through the fault of those who
   reject the word and resist the Holy Spirit. X. The opposite results to
   these consequences are, the casting away of the yoke [of Christ], the
   imputation of sin, the denial or the withdrawing of the Holy Spirit,
   and the delivering over to the power of Satan to a reprobate mind, and
   to hardness of heart, with other temporal evils, and, lastly, death
   eternal. XI. From these things, it appears that the prophetical office,
   by which a church is collected through the word, ought to be a reserve
   or accessory to the regal office; and, therefore, that the
   administrators of it are rightly denominated "the apostles and the
   servants of Christ," as of him who sends them forth into the whole
   world, over which he has the power, and who puts words into their
   mouths, whose continued assistance is likewise necessary, that the word
   may produce such fruit as agrees with its nature. XII. This regal
   office is so peculiar to Christ, under God the Father, that he admits
   no man, even subordinately, into a participation of it, as if he would
   employ such an one for a ministerial head. For this reason, we say,
   that the Roman pontiff, who calls himself the head and spouse, though
   under Christ, is Antichrist.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXXVIII ON THE STATES OF CHRIST'S HUMILIATION AND EXALTATION

   Respecting the imposition and the execution of the offices which belong
   to Christ, two states of his usually come under consideration, both of
   them being required for this purpose - - that he may be able to bear
   the name of saviour according to the will of God, and, in reality, to
   perform the thing signified under this name. One of these states is
   that of his humiliation, and is, according to the flesh, natural; the
   other is that of glory, according to the Spirit, and is spiritual. II.
   To the first state, that of his humiliation, belong the following
   articles of our belief: "He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
   crucified, dead and buried; he descended into hell." To the latter
   state, that of his exaltation, belong these articles: "He arose again
   from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand
   of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the
   quick and the dead." III. The sufferings of Christ contain every kind
   of reproaches and torments, both of soul and body, which were inflicted
   on him partly by the fury of his enemies, and partly by the immediate
   chastisement of his Father. We say that these last are not contrary to
   the good of the natural life, but to that of the spiritual life. But we
   deduce the commencement of these sufferings from the time when he was
   taken into custody; for we consider those things which previously
   befell him, rather to have been forerunners of his sufferings, by which
   it might be put to the test, whether, with the prescience of those
   things which were to be endured, and, indeed, through an experimental
   knowledge, he would still be ready by voluntary obedience to endure
   other sufferings. IV. The crucifixion has the mode of murder, by which
   mode we are taught, that Christ was made a curse for us, that we,
   through his cross, might be delivered from the curse of the law; for
   this seems to have been the entire reason why God pronounced him
   accursed who hung on a tree or cross, that we might understand that
   Christ, having been crucified rather by divine appointment, than by
   human means, was reckoned accursed for our sake, by God himself. V. The
   death of Christ was a true separation of his soul from the body, both
   according to its effects and according to place. It would indeed have
   ensued from crucifixion, and especially from the breaking of his legs;
   on which account, he is justly said to have been killed by the Jews;
   but death was anticipated, or previously undertaken, by Christ himself,
   that he might declare himself to have received power from God the
   Father to lay down his soul and life, and that he died a voluntary
   death. The former of these seems to relate to the confirmation of the
   truth which had been announced by him as a prophet, and the latter, to
   the circumstances of his priestly office. VI. The burial of Christ has
   relation to his certain death; and his remaining in the grave
   signifies, that he was under the dominion of death till the hour of his
   resurrection. This state, we think, was denoted by the existence of
   Christ among the dead, of which his descent into hell [or hades] was
   the commencement, as his interment was that of his remaining in the
   tomb. This interpretation is confirmed, both by the second chapter of
   the Acts of the Apostles, and by the consent of the ancient church,
   who, in the symbol of her belief, had only the one or the other of
   these expressions, either "He descended into hell," or "He was buried."
   Yet if any man thinks the meaning of this article -- "He descended into
   hell" -- to be different from that which we have given, we will not
   contradict his opinion, provided it be agreeable to the Scriptures and
   to the analogy of faith. VII. This state [of humiliation] was
   necessary, both that he might yield obedience to his Father, and that,
   having been tempted in all things without sin, he might be able to
   sympathize with those who are tempted, and, lastly, that he might, by
   suffering, be consecrated as priest and king, and might enter into his
   own glory. VIII. But this state of glory and exhaltation contains three
   degrees -- his resurrection, ascension into heaven, and sitting at the
   right hand of the Father. IX. The commencement of his glory was his
   deliverance from the bonds of the grave, and his rising again from the
   dead, by which his body, that was dead and had been laid in the
   sepulcher, after the effects of death had been destroyed in it, was
   reunited to his soul, and brought back again to life, not to this
   natural, but to a spiritual life; though, from the overflowing force of
   natural life, he was able to perform its functions as long as it was
   necessary for him to remain with his disciples in the present life,
   after having "arisen again from the dead," to impart credibility to his
   resurrection. We ascribe this resurrection, not only to the Father
   through the Holy Spirit, but likewise to Christ himself, who had the
   power of taking up his life again. X. The assumption of Christ into
   heaven contains the progress of his exaltation. For, as he had
   finished, on earth, the office enjoined, and had received a body -- not
   a natural, earthly, corruptible, fleshly and ignominious body, but one
   spiritual, heavenly, incorruptible and glorious, and as other duties,
   necessary for procuring the salvation of men, were to be performed in
   and concerning heaven, it was right and proper that he should rise and
   be exalted to heaven, and should remain there until he comes to
   judgment. From these premises, the dogma of the papists concerning
   transubstantiation, and that of the Ubiguitarians concerning
   consubstantiation, or the bodily presence of Christ in, with and, under
   the bread, are refuted. XI. The exaltation of Christ to the right hand
   of the Father is the supreme degree of his exaltation; for it contains
   the consummate glory and power which have been communicated to Christ
   himself by the Father -- glory, in his being seated with the Father in
   the throne of majesty, both because the regal office has been conferred
   on him, with full command, and on earth above all and over all created
   things, and because the dignity was conferred on him of further
   discharging [the duties of] the sacerdotal office, in that action which
   was to be performed in heaven by a more sublime High Priest constituted
   in heaven itself. XII. In relation to the priesthood, the state of
   humiliation was necessary; because it was the part of Christ to appear
   in heaven before the face of his Father, sprinkled with his own blood,
   and to intercede for believers. It was also necessary, in relation to
   his regal office; because, (and in this behold the administration of
   the prophetical office placed in subordination to the regal!) because
   it was his duty to send the word and the Spirit from heaven, and to
   administer from the throne of his majesty all things in the name of his
   Father, and especially his church, by conferring on those who obey him,
   the blessings promised in his word and sealed by his Spirit, and by
   inflicting evils on the disobedient after they have abused the patience
   of God as long as his justice could bear it. Of this administration,
   the last act will be the universal judgment, for which we are now
   waiting. "Come, Lord Jesus!"
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XXXIX ON THE WILL, AND COMMAND OF GOD THE FATHER AND OF CHRIST, BY
WHICH THEY WILL AND COMMAND THAT RELIGION BE PERFORMED TO THEM BY SINFUL MAN

   In addition to the things that God has done in Christ, and Christ has
   done through the command of the Father, for the redemption of mankind,
   who were lost through sin, by which both of them have merited that
   religious homage should be performed to them by sinful man -- and in
   addition to the fact that the Father has constituted Christ the saviour
   and Head, with full power and capability of saving through the
   administration of his priestly and regal offices, on account of which
   power, Christ is worthy to be worshipped with religious honours, and
   able to reward his worshipers, that he may not be worshipped in vain,
   it was requisite that the will of God the Father and of Christ should
   be subjoined, by which they willed and commanded that religious worship
   should be offered to them, lest the performance of religion should be
   "will-worship," or superstition. II. It was the will of God that this
   command should be proposed through the mode of a covenant, that is,
   through the mutual stipulation and promise of the contracting parties
   -- of a covenant, indeed, which is never to be disannulled or to
   perish, which is, therefore, denominated "the new covenant," and is
   ratified by the blood of Jesus Christ as Mediator. III. On this
   account, and because Christ has been constituted by the Father, a
   prince and Lord, with the full possession of all the blessings
   necessary to salvation, it is also called "a Testament" or "Will;"
   therefore, he, also, as the Testator, is dead, and by his death, has
   confirmed the testamentary promise which had previously been made,
   concerning the obtaining of the eternal inheritance by the remission of
   sins. IV. The stipulation on the part of God and Christ is, that God
   shall be God and Father in Christ [to a believer] if in the name, and
   by the command of God, he acknowledges Christ as his Lord and saviour,
   that is, if he believe in God through Christ, and in Christ, and if he
   yield to both of them love, worship, honour, fear, and complete
   obedience as prescribed. V. The promise, on the part of God the Father,
   and of Christ, is, that God will be the God and Father, and that Christ
   will be the saviour, (through the administration of his sacerdotal and
   regal offices,) of those who have faith in God the Father, and in
   Christ, and who, through faith, yield obedience to them; that is, God
   the Father, and Christ, will account the performance of religious duty
   to be grateful, and will crown it with a reward. VI. On the other hand,
   the promise of sinful man is that he will believe in God and in Christ,
   and through faith will yield compliance or render obedience. But the
   stipulation is that God be willing to be mindful of his compact and
   holy declaration. VII. Christ intervenes between the two parties; on
   the part of God, he proposes the stipulation, and confirms the promise
   with his blood; he likewise works a persuasion in the hearts of
   believers, and affixes to it his attesting seal, that the promise will
   be ratified. But, on the part of sinful man, he promises [to the
   Father] that, by the efficacy of his Spirit he will cause man to
   perform the things which he has promised to his God; and, on the other
   hand, he requires of the Father, that, mindful of his own promise, he
   will deign to bestow on those who answer this description, or
   believers, the forgiveness of all their sins, and life eternal. He
   likewise intervenes, by presenting to God the service performed by man,
   and by rendering it grateful and acceptable to God through the odour of
   his own fragrance. VIII. External seals or tokens are also employed to
   which the ancient Latin fathers have given the appellation of
   "Sacraments," and which, on the part of God, seal the promise that has
   been made by himself; but, on the part of men, they are "the
   hand-writing," or bond of that obligation by which they had bound
   themselves that nothing may in any respect be wanting which seems to be
   at all capable of contributing to the nature and relation of the
   covenant and compact into which the parties have mutually entered. IX.
   From all these things, are apparent the most sufficient perfection of
   the Christian religion and its unparalleled excellence above all other
   religions, though they also be supposed to be true. Its sufficiency
   consists in this -- both that it demonstrates the necessity of that
   duty which is to be performed by sinful man, to be completely absolute,
   and on no account to be remissible, by which the way is closed against
   carnal security -- and that it most strongly fortifies against despair,
   not only sinners, that they may be led to repentance, but also those
   who perform the duty, that they may, through the certain hope of future
   blessings, persevere in the course of faith and of good works upon
   which they have entered. These two [despair and carnal security] are
   the greatest evils which are to be avoided in the whole of religion. X.
   This is the excellence of the Christian religion above every other,
   that all these things are transacted by the intervention of Christ our
   mediator, priest and king, in which, numerous arguments are proposed to
   us, both for the establishment of the necessity of its performance, and
   for the confirmation of hope, and for the removal of despair, that
   cannot be shown in any other religion. On this account, therefore, it
   is not wonderful that Christ is said to be the wisdom of God and the
   power of God, manifested in the gospel for the salvation of believers.
   COROLLARY No prayers and no duty, performed by a sinner, are grateful
   to God, except with reference to Christ; and yet, people have acted
   properly in desiring and in beseeching God, that he would be pleased to
   bless King Messiah and the progress of his kingdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XL ON THE PREDESTINATION OF BELIEVERS

   As we have hitherto treated on the object of the Christian religion,
   that is, on Christ and God, and on the formal reasons why religion may
   be usefully performed to them, and ought to be, among which reasons,
   the last is the will of God and his command that prescribes religion by
   the conditions of a covenant; and as it will be necessary now to
   subjoin to this a discourse on the vocation of men to a participation
   in that covenant, it will not be improper for us, in this place, to
   insert one on the Predestination, by which God determined to treat with
   men according to that prescript, and by which he decreed to administer
   that vocation, and the means to it. First, concerning the former of
   these. II. That predestination is the decree of the good pleasure of
   God, in Christ, by which he determined, within himself, from all
   eternity, to justify believers, to adopt them, and to endow them with
   eternal life, "to the praise of the glory of his grace," and even for
   the declaration of his justice. III. This predestination is
   evangelical, and, therefore, per- emptory and irrevocable; and, as the
   gospel is purely gracious, this predestination is also gracious,
   according to the benevolent inclination of God in Christ. But that
   grace excludes every cause which can possibly be imagined to be capable
   of having proceeded from man, and by which God may be moved to make
   this decree. IV. But we place Christ as the foundation of this
   predestination, and as the meritorious cause of those blessings which
   have been destined to believers by that decree. For the love with which
   God loves men absolutely to salvation, and according to which he
   absolutely intends to bestow on them eternal life, this love has no
   existence except in Jesus Christ, the Son of his love, who, both by his
   efficacious communication, and by his most worthy merits, is the cause
   of salvation, and not only the dispenser of recovered salvation, but
   likewise the solicitor, obtainer, and restorer of that salvation which
   was lost. Therefore, sufficient is not attributed to Christ, when he is
   called executor of the decree which had been previously made, and
   without the consideration of him as [the person] on whom that decree is
   founded. V. We lay down a two-fold matter for this predestination --
   divine things, and the persons to whom the communication of them has
   been predestinated. (1.) Those divine things are the spiritual
   blessings which usually receive the appellations of grace and glory.
   (2.) The persons are the faithful, or believers; that is, they believe
   in God who justifies the ungodly, and in Christ raised from the dead.
   But faith, that is, the faith which is on Christ, the mediator between
   God and men, presupposes sin, and likewise the knowledge or
   acknowledgment of it. VI. We place the form of this predestination in
   the internal act itself of God, who foreordains to believers this union
   with Christ their Head, and a participation in his benefits. But we
   place the end in "the praise of the glory of the grace of God;" and as
   this grace is the cause of that decree, it is equitable that it should
   be celebrated by glory, though God, by using it, has rendered it
   illustrious and glorious. In this place, too, occurs the mention of
   justice itself, as that by the intervention of which Christ was given
   as mediator, and faith in him was required; because, without this
   mediator, God has neither willed to shew mercy, nor to save men without
   faith in him. VII. But, as this decree of predestination is according
   to election, which necessarily includes reprobation, we must likewise
   advert to it. As opposed to election, therefore, we define reprobation
   to be the decree of God's anger or of his severe will, by which, from
   all eternity, he determined to condemn to eternal death all unbelievers
   and impenitent persons, for the declaration of his power and anger; yet
   so, that unbelievers are visited with this punishment, not only on
   account of unbelief, but likewise on account of other sins from which
   they might have been delivered through faith in Christ. VIII. To both
   these is severally subjoined the execution of each; the acts of which
   are performed in that order in which they have been ordained by God in
   the decree itself; and the objects, both of the decree and of its
   execution, are completely the same and uniform, or they are invested
   with the same formal reason, though they are considered in the decree,
   as in the mind of God, through the understanding, but, in the execution
   of it, as such, actually in existence. IX. This predestination is the
   foundation of Christianity, of salvation, and of the certainty of
   salvation; and St. Paul treats upon it in his epistle to the Romans,
   (viii, 28-30) in the ninth and following chapters of the same epistle,
   and in the first chapter of that to the Ephesians.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XLI ON THE PREDESTINATION OF THE MEANS TO THE END

   After we have finished our discussion on the predestination by which
   God has determined the necessity of faith in himself and in Christ, for
   the obtaining of salvation, according to which faith is prescribed to
   be performed as the bounden duty of man to God and Christ; it follows,
   that we treat on the predestination by which God determines to
   administer the means to faith. II. For, as that act of faith is not in
   the power of a natural, carnal, sensual, and sinful man, and as no one
   can perform this act except through the grace of God, but as all the
   grace of God is administered according to the will of God -- that will
   which he has had within himself from all eternity -- for it is an
   internal act, therefore, some certain predestination must be
   preconceived in the mind and will of God, according to which he
   dispenses that grace, or the means to it. III. But we can define this
   predestination, that it is the eternal decree of God, by which he has
   wisely and justly resolved, within himself, to administer those means
   which are necessary and sufficient to produce faith in [the hearts of]
   sinful men, in such a manner as he knows to be comportable with his
   mercy and with his severity, to the glory of his name and to the
   salvation of believers. IV. The object of this predestination is, both
   the means of producing this faith, and the sinful men to whom he has
   creed either to give or not to give this faith, as the object of the
   predestination discussed in the preceding disputation was faith itself,
   existing in the preconception of the mind of God. V. The antecedent, or
   only moving cause, impelling to make the decree, is not only the mercy
   of God, but also his severity. But his wisdom prescribes the mode which
   his justice administers, that what is justly due to mercy may be
   attributed to it, and that, in the mean time, regard may be had to
   severity, according to which God threatens that he will send a famine
   of the word on the earth. VI. The matter is the conceded or the denied
   dispensation of the means. The form is the ordained dispensation
   itself, according to which it is granted to some men and denied to
   others, or it is granted or denied on this and not on that condition.
   VII. The end for the sake of which, and the end which, are conjoined to
   the administration itself at the very same moment, and are the
   declaration of the mercy of God, and of his severity, wisdom and
   justice. The end for which it was intended, and which follows from the
   administration, is the salvation of believers. The results are, the
   condemnation of unbelievers, and the still more grievous condemnation
   of some men. VIII. But the proper and peculiar means destined, are the
   word and Spirit; to which, also, may be joined the good and the evil
   things of this natural life, which God employs for the same end, and of
   the nature and efficacy of which we shall treat in the disputation on
   Vocation, where they are used. IX. To these means, we attribute two
   epithets, "necessity" and "sufficiency," (§ 3,) which belong to them
   according to the will and nature of God, and which we also join
   together. (1.) Necessity is in them; because, without them, a sinner
   cannot conceive faith. (2.) Sufficiency also is in them; because they
   are employed in vain, if they be not sufficient; yet we do not account
   it necessary to place this sufficiency in the first moment in which
   they begin to be used, but in the entire progress and completion. X.
   God destines these means to no persons on account of, or according to,
   their own merits, but through mere grace alone; and he denies them to
   no one, except justly, on account of previous transgressions.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XLII ON THE VOCATION OF SINFUL MEN TO CHRIST, AND TO A PARTICIPATION
OF SALVATION IN HIM

   The vocation or calling to the communion of Christ and its benefits, is
   the gracious act of God, by which, through the word and His Spirit, he
   calls forth sinful men, subject to condemnation and placed under the
   dominion of sin, from the condition of natural life, and out of the
   defilements and corruptions of this world, to obtain a supernatural
   life in Christ through repentance and faith, that they may be united in
   him, as their head destined and ordained by God, and may enjoy the
   participation of his benefits, to the glory of God and to their own
   salvation. II. The efficient cause of this vocation is God and the
   Father in the Son; the Son, also, himself, as constituted Mediator and
   King by God the Father, calls men by the Holy Spirit, as he is the
   Spirit of God given to the mediator, and the Spirit of Christ, the King
   and the Head of His church, by whom the Father and the Son both "work
   hitherto." But this vocation is so administered by the Spirit, that he
   also, is properly denominated the author of it. For he appoints bishops
   in the church, he sends teachers, he furnishes them with gifts, he
   grants them divine aid, and imparts force and authority to the word.
   III. The antecedent or only moving cause is the grace, mercy and
   philanthropy of God, by which he is inclined to succour the misery of
   sinful men, and to bestow blessedness upon him. But the disposing cause
   is, the wisdom and the justice of God, by which he knows the method by
   which it is proper for this vocation to be administered, and by which
   he wills to dispense it as it is proper and fight. From this, arises
   the decree of his will concerning its administration and mode. IV. The
   instrumental cause of vocation is the word of God administered by the
   aid of man, either by preaching or by writing; and this is the ordinary
   instrument; or it is the divine word immediately proposed by God,
   inwardly to the mind and will, without human aid or endeavour; and this
   is extraordinary. The word employed, in both these cases, is that both
   of the law and of the gospel, subordinate to each other in their
   separate services. V. The matter of vocation is men constituted in
   their sensual life, as worldly, natural, sensual, and sinful. VI. The
   boundary from which they are called, is, both the state of sensual or
   natural life, and that of sin and of misery on account of sin; that is,
   from condemnation and guilt, and afterwards from the bondage and
   dominion of sin. VII. The boundary to which they are called, is, the
   communication of grace, or of supernatural good, and of every spiritual
   blessing, the plenitude of which resides in Christ -- also their power
   and force, as well as the inclination to communicate them. VIII. The
   proximate end of vocation is, that men may love, fear, honour and
   worship God and Christ -- may in righteousness and true holiness,
   according to the command of the word of God, render obedience to God
   who calls them, and may, by this means, make their calling and election
   sure. IX. The remote end is the salvation of those who are called, and
   the glory of God and of Christ who calls; both of which are placed in
   the union of God and man. For as God unites himself to man, and
   declares himself to be prepared to unite himself to him, he makes his
   own glory illustrious; and, as man is united to God, he obtains
   salvation. X. This vocation is both external and internal. The external
   vocation is by the ministry of men propounding the word. The internal
   vocation is through the operation of the Holy Spirit illuminating and
   affecting the heart, that attention may be paid to those things which
   are spoken, and that credence may be given to the word. From the
   concurrence of both these, arises the efficacy of vocation. XI. But
   that distribution is not of a genus into its species, but of a whole
   into its parts; that is, the distribution of the whole vocation into
   partial acts concurring together to one result, which is obedience
   yielded to the vocation. Hence, the company of those who are called and
   who answer to the call, is denominated "a Church." XII. The accidental
   issue of vocation is, the rejection of the doctrine of grace, contempt
   of the divine counsel, and resistance manifested against the Holy
   Spirit, of which the proper and per se cause is, the wickedness and
   hardness of the human heart; and to this not unfrequently is added the
   just judgment of God, avenging the contempt shown to his word, from
   which arise blindness of mind, hardening of the heart, and a delivering
   up to a reprobate mind, and to the power of Satan.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XLIII ON THE REPENTANCE BY WHICH MEN ANSWER TO THE DIVINE VOCATION

   As, in the matter of salvation, it has pleased God to treat with man by
   the method of a covenant, that is, by a stipulation, or a demand and a
   promise, and as even vocation has regard to a participation in the
   covenant; it is instituted on both sides and separately, that man may
   perform the requisition or command of God, by which he may obtain [the
   fulfillment of] his promise. But this is the mutual relation between
   these two -- the promise is tantamount to an argument, which God
   employs, that he may obtain from man that which he demands; and the
   compliance with the demand, on the other hand, is the condition,
   without which man cannot obtain what has been promised by God, and
   through [the performance of] which he most assuredly obtains the
   promise. II. Hence, it is apparent that the first of all which accepts
   this vocation is the faith, by which a man believes that, if he
   complies with the requisition, he will enjoy the promise, but that if
   he does not comply with it, he will not be put in possession of the
   things promised, nay, that the contrary evils will be inflicted on him,
   according to the nature of the divine covenant, in which there is no
   promise without a punishment opposed to it. This faith is the
   foundation on which rests the obedience that is to be yielded to God;
   and it is, therefore, the foundation of religion. III. But divines
   generally place three parts in this obedience. The first is repentance,
   for it is the calling of sinners to righteousness. The second is faith
   in Christ, and in God through Christ; for vocation is made through the
   gospel, which is the word of faith. The third is the observance of
   God's commands, in which consists holiness of life, to which believers
   are called, and without which no man shall see God. IV. Repentance is
   grief or sorrow on account of sins known and acknowledged, the debt of
   death contracted by sin, and on account of the slavery of sin, with a
   desire to be delivered. Hence, it is evident, that three things concur
   in penitence - - the first as an antecedent, the second as a
   consequence, and the third as properly and most fully comprising its
   nature. V. That which is tantamount to an antecedent is the knowledge
   or acknowledgment of sin. This consists of a two-fold knowledge: (1.) A
   general knowledge by which is known what is sin universally and
   according to the prescript of the law. (2.) A particular knowledge, by
   which it is acknowledged that sin had been committed, both from a
   recollection of the bad deeds perpetrated and of the good omitted, and
   from the examination of them according to the law. This acknowledgment,
   has, united with it, a consciousness of a two-fold demerit, of
   damnation or death, and of the slavery of sin; "for the wages of sin is
   death;" and "he who sins is the slave of sin." This acknowledgment is
   either internal, and made in the mind, or it is external, and receives
   the appellation of "confession." VI. That which intimately comprises
   the nature of repentance is, sorrow on account of sin committed, and of
   its demerit, which is so much the deeper, as the acknowledgment of sin
   is clearer, and more copious. It is also produced from this
   acknowledgment by means of a two-fold fear of punishment: (1.) A fear
   not only of bodily and temporal punishment, but likewise of that which
   is spiritual and eternal. (2.) The fear of God, by which men are afraid
   of the judgment of such a good and just being, whom they have offended
   by their sins. This fear may be correctly called "initial;" and we
   believe that it has some hope annexed to it. VII. That which follows as
   a consequence, is the desire of deliverance from sin, that is, from the
   condemnation of sin and from its dominion, which desire is so much the
   more intense, by how much the greater is the acknowledgment of misery
   and sorrow on account of sin. VIII. The cause of this repentance is,
   God by his word and Spirit in Christ. For it is a repentance tending
   not to despair, but to salvation; but such it cannot be, except with
   respect to Christ, in whom, alone, the sinner can obtain deliverance
   from the condemnation and dominion of sin. But the word which he uses
   at the beginning is the word of the law, yet not under the legal
   condition peculiar to the law, but under that which is annexed to the
   preaching of the gospel, of which the first word is, that deliverance
   is declared to penitents. The Spirit of God may, not improperly, be
   denominated "the Spirit of Christ," as he is Mediator; and it first
   urges a man by the word of the law, and then shows him the grace of the
   gospel. The connection of the word of the law and that of the gospel,
   which is thus skillfully made, removes all self-security, and forbids
   despair, which are the two pests of religion and of souls. IX. We do
   not acknowledge satisfaction, which the papists make to be the third
   part of repentance, though we do not deny that the man who is a real
   penitent will endeavour to make satisfaction to his neighbour against
   whom he owns that he has sinned, and to the church that he has injured
   by the offense. But satisfaction can by no means be rendered to God, on
   the part of man, by repentance, sorrow, contrition, almsgiving, or by
   the voluntary susception and infliction of punishments. If such a
   course were prescribed by God, the consciences of men must necessarily
   be tormented with the continual anguish of a threatening hell, not less
   than if no promise of grace had been made to sinners. But God considers
   this repentance, which we have described, if it be true, to be worthy
   of a gracious deliverance from sin and misery; and it has faith as a
   consequence, on which we will treat in the subsequent disputation.
   COROLLARY Repentance is not a sacrament, either with regard to itself,
   or with regard to its external tokens.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XLIV ON FAITH IN GOD AND CHRIST

   In the preceding disputation, we have treated on the first part of that
   obedience which is yielded to the vocation of God. The second part now
   follows, which is called "the obedience of faith." II. Faith,
   generally, is the assent given to truth; and divine faith is that which
   is given to truth divinely revealed. The foundation on which divine
   faith rests is two- fold -- the one external and out of or beyond the
   mind -- the other internal and in the mind. (1.) The external
   foundation of faith is the very veracity of God who makes the
   declaration, and who can declare nothing that is false. (2.) The
   internal foundation of faith is two-fold -- both the general idea by
   which we know that God is true -- and the knowledge by which we know
   that it is the word of God. Faith is also two-fold, according to the
   mode of revelation, being both legal and evangelical, of which the
   latter comes under our present consideration, and tends to God and
   Christ. III. Evangelical faith is an assent of the mind, produced by
   the Holy Spirit, through the gospel, in sinners, who, through the law,
   know and acknowledge their sins, and are penitent on account of them,
   by which they are not only fully persuaded within themselves that Jesus
   Christ has been constituted by God the author of salvation to those who
   obey him, and that he is their own saviour if they have believed in
   him, and by which they also believe in him as such, and through him on
   God as the benevolent Father in him, to the salvation of believers and
   to the glory of Christ and God. IV. The object of faith is not only the
   God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, but likewise Christ himself
   who is here constituted by God the author of salvation to those that
   obey him. V. The form is the assent that is given to an object of this
   description; which assent is not acquired by a course of reasoning from
   principles known by nature; but it is an assent infused above the order
   of nature, which, yet, is confirmed and increased by the daily
   exercises of prayers and mortification of the flesh, and by the
   practice of good works. Knowledge is antecedent to faith; for the Son
   of God is beheld before a sinner believes on him. But trust or
   confidence is consequent to it; for, through faith, confidence is
   placed in Christ, and through him in God. VI. The author of faith is
   the Holy Spirit, whom the Son sends from the Father, as his advocate
   and substitute, who may manage his cause in the world and against it.
   The instrument is the gospel, or the word of faith, containing the
   meaning concerning God and Christ which the Spirit proposes to the
   understanding, and of which he there works a persuasion. VII. The
   subject in which it resides, is the mind, not only as it acknowledges
   this object to be true, but likewise to be good, which the word of the
   gospel declares. Wherefore, it belongs not only to the theoretical
   understanding, but likewise to that of the affections, which is
   practical. VIII. The subject to which [it is directed], or the object
   about which [it is occupied], is sinful man, acknowledging his sins,
   and penitent on account of them. For this faith is necessary for
   salvation to him who believes; but it is unnecessary to one who is not
   a sinner; and, therefore, no one except a sinner, can know or
   acknowledge Christ for his saviour, for he is the saviour of sinners.
   The end, which we intend for our own benefit, is salvation in its
   nature. But the chief end is the glory of God through Jesus Christ.
   COROLLARY "Was the faith of the patriarchs under the covenants of
   promise, the same as ours under the New Testament, with regard to its
   substance?" We answer in the affirmative.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XLV ON THE UNION OF BELIEVERS WITH CHRIST

   As Christ is constituted by the Father the saviour of those that
   believe, who, being exalted. in heaven to the right hand of the Father,
   communicates to believers all those blessings which he has solicited
   from the Father, and which he has obtained by his obedience and
   pleading, but as the participation of blessings cannot be through
   communication, unless where there has previously been an orderly and
   suitable union between him who communicates and those to whom such
   communications are made, it is, therefore, necessary for us to treat,
   in the first place, upon the union of Christ with us, on account of its
   being the primary and immediate effect of that faith by which men
   believe in him as the only saviour. II. The truth of this thing, and
   the necessity of this union, are intimated by the names with which
   Christ is signally distinguished in a certain relation to believers.
   Such are the appellations of head, spouse, foundation, vine, and others
   of a similar kind; from which, on the other hand, believers are called
   members in his body, which is the entire church of believers, the
   spouse of Christ, lively stones built on him, and young shoots or
   branches. By these epithets, is signified the closest and most intimate
   union between Christ and believers. III. We may define or describe it
   to be that spiritual and most strict and therefore mystically essential
   conjunction, by which believers, being immediately connected, by God
   the Father and Jesus Christ through the Spirit of Christ and of God,
   with Christ himself, and through Christ with God, become one with him
   and with the Father, and are made partakers of all his blessings, to
   their own salvation and the glory of Christ and of God. IV. The author
   of this union is not only God the Father, who has constituted his Son
   the head of the church, endued him with the Spirit without measure, and
   unites believers to his Son; but also Christ, who communicates to
   believers that Spirit whom he obtained from the Father, that, cleaving
   to him by faith, they may be one Spirit. The administrators are
   prophets, apostles and other dispensers of the mysteries of God, who
   lay Christ as the foundation, and bring his spouse to him. V. The
   parties to be united are, (1.) Christ, whom God the Father has
   constituted the head, the spouse, the foundation, the vine, etc, and to
   whom he has given all perfection, with a plenary power and command to
   communicate it; (2.) And sinful man, and therefore destitute of the
   glory of God, yet a believer, and owning Christ for his saviour. VI.
   The bond of union must be considered both on the part of believers, and
   on the part of God and Christ. (1.) On the part of believers, it is
   faith in Christ and God, by which Christ is given to dwell in our
   hearts. (2.) On the part of God and Christ, it is the Spirit of both,
   who flows from Christ as the constituted head, into believers, that he
   may unite them to him as members. VII. The form of union is a
   compacting and joining together, which is orderly, harmonious, and in
   every part agreeing with itself by joints fitly supplied, according to
   the measure of the gifts of Christ. This conjunction receives various
   appellations, according to the various similitudes which we have
   already adduced. With respect to a foundation and a house built upon
   it, it is a being built up into [a spiritual house]. With respect to a
   husband and wife, it is a participation of flesh and bones; or, it is
   flesh of the flesh of Christ, and bone of his bones. With respect to a
   vine and its branches, or to an olive tree and its boughs, it is an
   engrafting and implanting. VIII. The proximate and immediate end is the
   communion of the parts united among themselves; this, also, is an
   effect consequent upon that union, but actively understood, as it flows
   from Christ, and positively, as it flows into believers, and is
   received by them. The cause of this is, that the relation is that of
   disquiparency, where the foundation is Christ, who possesses all
   things, and stands in need of nothing; the term, or boundary, is the
   believer in want of all things. The remote end is the external
   salvation of believers, and the glory of God and Christ. IX. But not
   only does Christ communicate his blessings to the believers, who are
   united to him, but he likewise considers, on account of this most
   intimate and close union, that the good things bestowed, and the evils
   inflicted on believers, are also done to himself. Hence, arise
   commiseration for his children, and certain succour, but anger against
   those who afflict, which abides upon them unless they repent, and
   beneficence towards those who have given even a draught of cold water,
   in the name of Christ, to one of his followers.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XLVI ON THE COMMUNION OF BELIEVERS WITH CHRIST, AND PARTICULARLY
WITH HIS DEATH

   The union of believers with Christ tends to communion with him, which
   contains, in itself, every end and fruit of union, and flows
   immediately from the union itself. II. Communion with Christ is that by
   which believers, when united to him, have, in common with himself all
   those things which belong to him; yet the distinction is preserved,
   which exists between the head and the members, between him who
   communicates, and them who are made partakers, between him who
   sanctifieth, and those who are sanctified. III. This communion must,
   according to the Scriptures, be considered in two views, for it is
   either a communion of his death, or of his life; because Christ must be
   thus considered in two relations, either according to the state in the
   body of his flesh, which was crucified, dead, and buried, or, according
   to his glorious state and the new life to which he was raised up again.
   IV. The communion of his death is that by which, being planted together
   in the likeness of his death, we participate of his power, and of all
   the benefits which flow from his death. V. This planting together is
   the crucifixion, the death and the burial of "our old man," or of "the
   body of sin," in and with the body of the flesh of Christ. These are
   the degrees by which the body of the flesh of Christ is abolished; that
   may also in its own measure, be called "the body of sin," so far as God
   has made Christ to be sin for us, and has given him to bear our sins,
   in his own body, on the tree. VI. The strength and efficacy of the
   death of Christ consist in the abolishing of sin and death, and of the
   law, which is "the hand-writing that is against us;" and the strength
   or force of sin is that by which sin kills us. VII. The efficacious
   benefits of the death of Christ which believers enjoy through communion
   with it, are principally the following: The First is the removal of the
   curse, which we had deserved through sin. This includes, or has
   connected with it, our reconciliation with God, perpetual redemption,
   remission of sins, and justification. VIII. The SECOND. is deliverance
   from the dominion and slavery of sin, that sin may no longer exercise
   its power in our crucified, dead and buried body of sin, to obtain its
   desires by the obedience which we have usually yielded to it in our
   body of sin, according to the old man. IX. The THIRD is deliverance
   from the law, both as it is "the hand-writing which was against us,"
   consisting of ceremonial institutions, and as it is the rigid exactor
   of what is due from us, and useless and inefficacious as it is on
   account of our flesh, and the body of sin, according to which we were
   carnal, though it was spiritual, and as sin, by its wickedness and
   perversity, abused the law itself to seduce and kill us.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XLVII THE COMMUNION OF BELIEVERS WITH CHRIST IN REGARD TO HIS LIFE

   Communion with the life of Christ is that by which, being engrafted
   into him by a conformity to his life, we become partakers of the whole
   power of his life, and of all the benefits which flow from it. II. Our
   conformity to the life of Christ, is either that of the present life,
   or of that which is future. (1.) That of the present life is the
   raising of us up into a new life, and our being seated, with regard to
   the Spirit, "in heavenly places" in Christ our head. (2.) That of the
   life to come is our resurrection into a new life according to the body,
   and our being elevated to heavenly places with regard to the entire
   man. III. Hence, our conformity to Christ is according to the same
   two-fold relation: in this life, it is our resurrection to newness of
   spiritual life, and our conversation in heaven according to the Spirit;
   after the present life, it is the resurrection of our, bodies, their
   conformity to the glorious body of Christ, and the fruition of
   celestial blessedness. IV. The blessings which flow from the life of
   Christ, fall partly within the limits of this life, and partly within
   the continued duration of the life to come. V. Those which fall within
   the limits of the present life are, adoption into sons of God, and the
   communication of the Holy Spirit. This communication composes within
   itself three particular benefits: First. Our regeneration, through the
   illumination of the mind and the renewal of the heart. Secondly. The
   perpetual aid of the Holy Spirit to excite and co-operate. Thirdly. The
   testimony of the same Spirit with our hearts, that we are the children
   of God, on which account he is called "the Spirit of adoption." VI.
   Those which fall within the boundless duration of the life to come, are
   our preservation from future wrath, and the bestowing of life eternal;'
   though this preservation from wrath may seem to be a continued act,
   begun and carried on in this world, but consummated at the period of
   the last judgment. VII. Under the preservation from wrath, also, is not
   unsuitably comprehended continued justification from sins through the
   intercession of Christ, who, in his own blood, is the propitiation for
   our sins, and our advocate before God.

DISPUTATION XLVIII ON JUSTIFICATION

   The spiritual benefits which believers enjoy in the present life, from
   their union with Christ through communion with his death and life, may
   be properly referred to that of justification and sanctification, as in
   those two is comprehended the whole promise of the new covenant, in
   which God promises that he will pardon sins, and will write his laws in
   the hearts of believers, who have entered into covenant with him. II.
   Justification is a just and gracious act of God as a judge, by which,
   from the throne of his grace and mercy, he absolves from his sins, man,
   a sinner, but who is a believer, on account of Christ, and the
   obedience and righteousness of Christ, and considers him righteous, to
   the salvation of the justified person, and to the glory of divine
   righteousness and grace. III. We say that "it is the act of God as a
   judge," who though as the supreme legislator he could have issued
   regulations concerning his law, and actually did issue them, yet has
   not administered this direction through the absolute plenitude of
   infinite power, but contained himself within the bounds of justice
   which he demonstrated by two methods, First, because God would not
   justify, except as justification was preceded by reconciliation and
   satisfaction made through Christ in his blood; Secondly, because he
   would not justify any except those who acknowledged their sins and
   believed in Christ. IV. We say that "it is a gracious and merciful act;
   "not with respect to Christ, as if the Father, through grace as
   distinguished from strict and rigid justice, had accepted the obedience
   of Christ for righteousness, but with respect to us, both because God,
   through his gracious mercy towards us, has made Christ to be sin for
   us, and righteousness to us, that we might be the righteousness of God
   in him, and because he has placed communion with Christ in the faith of
   the gospel, and has set forth Christ as a propitiation through faith.
   V. The meritorious cause of justification is Christ through his
   obedience and righteousness, who may, therefore, be justly called the
   principal or outwardly moving cause. In his obedience and
   righteousness, Christ is also the material cause of our justification,
   so far as God bestows Christ on us for righteousness, and imputes his
   righteousness and obedience to us. In regard to this two-fold cause,
   that is, the meritorious and the material, we are said to be
   constituted righteous through the obedience of Christ. VI. The object
   of justification is man, a sinner, acknowledging himself, with sorrow,
   to be such an one, and a believer, that is, believing in God who
   justifies the ungodly, and in Christ as having been delivered for our
   offenses, and raised again for our justification. As a sinner, man
   needs justification through grace, and, as a believer, he obtains
   justification through grace. VII. Faith is the instrumental cause, or
   act, by which we apprehend Christ proposed to us by God for a
   propitiation and for righteousness, according to the command and
   promise of the gospel, in which it is said, "He who believes shall be
   justified and saved, and he who believeth not shall be damned." VIII.
   The form is the gracious reckoning of God, by which he imputes to us
   the righteousness of Christ, and imputes faith to us for righteousness;
   that is, he remits our sins to us who are believers, on account of
   Christ apprehended by faith, and accounts us righteous in him. This
   estimation or reckoning, has, joined with it, adoption into sons, and
   the conferring of a right to the inheritance of life eternal. IX. The
   end, for the sake of which is the salvation of the justified person;
   for that act is performed for the good of the man himself who is
   justified. The end which flows from justification without any advantage
   to God who justifies, is the glorious demonstration of divine justice
   and grace. X. The most excellent effects of this justification are
   peace with God and tranquillity of conscience, rejoicing under
   afflictions in hope of the glory of God and in God himself, and an
   assured expectation of life eternal. XI. The external seal of
   justification is baptism; the internal seal is the Holy Spirit,
   testifying together with our spirits that we are the children of God,
   and crying in our hearts, Abba, Father! XII. But we have yet to
   consider justification, both about the beginning of conversion, when
   all preceding sins are for, given, and through the whole life, because
   God has promised remission of sins to believers, those who have entered
   into covenant with him, as often as they repent and flee by true faith
   to Christ their propitiator and expiator. But the end and completion of
   justification will be at the close of life, when God will grant to
   those who end their days in the faith of Christ, to find his mercy,
   absolving them from all the sins which had been perpetrated through the
   whole of their lives. The declaration and manifestation of
   justification will be in the future general judgment. XIII. The
   opposite to justification is condemnation, and this by an immediate
   contrariety, so that between these two no medium can be imagined.
   COROLLARIES I. That faith and works concur together to justification,
   is a thing impossible. II. Faith is not correctly denominated the
   formal cause of justification; and when it receives that appellation
   from some divines of our profession, it is then improperly so called.
   III. Christ has not obtained by his merits that we should be justified
   by the worthiness and merit of faith, and much less that we should be
   justified by the merit of works: But the merit of Christ is opposed to
   justification by works; and, in the Scriptures, faith and merit are
   placed in opposition to each other.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION XLIX ON THE SANCTIFICATION OF MAN

   The word "sanctification" denotes an act, by which any thing is
   separated from common use, and is consecrated to divine use. II. Common
   use, about the sanctification of which [to divine purposes] we are now
   treating, is either according to nature itself, by which man lives a
   natural life; or it is according to the corruption of sin, by which he
   lives to sin and obeys it in its lusts or desires. Divine use is when a
   man lives according to godliness, in a conformity to the holiness and
   righteousness in which he was created. III. Therefore, this
   sanctification, with respect to the boundary from which it proceeds, is
   either from the natural use, or from the use of sin; the boundary to
   which it tends, is the supernatural and divine use. IV. But when we
   treat about man, as a sinner, then sanctification is thus defined: It
   is a gracious act of God, by which he purifies man who is a sinner, and
   yet a believer, from the darkness of ignorance, from indwelling sin and
   from its lusts or desires, and imbues him with the Spirit of knowledge,
   righteousness and holiness, that, being separated from the life of the
   world and made conformable to God, man may live the life of God, to the
   praise of the righteousness and of the glorious grace of God, and to
   his own salvation. V. Therefore, this sanctification consists in these
   two things: In the death of: the old man" who is corrupt according to
   the deceitful lusts," and in the quickening or enlivening of "the new
   man, who, after God, is created in righteousness and the holiness of
   truth." VI. The author of sanctification is God, the Holy Father
   himself, in his Son who is the Holy of holies, through the Spirit of
   holiness. The external instrument is the word of God; the internal one
   is faith yielded to the word preached. For the word does not sanctify,
   only as it is preached, unless the faith be added by which the hearts
   of men are purified. VII. the object of sanctification is man, a
   sinner, and yet a believer -- a sinner, because, being contaminated
   through sin and addicted to a life of sin, he is unfit to serve the
   living God -- a believer, because he is united to Christ through faith
   in him, on whom our holiness is founded; and he is planted together
   with Christ and joined to him in a conformity with his death and
   resurrection. Hence, he dies to sin, and is excited or raised up to a
   new life. VIII. The subject is, properly, the soul of man. And, first,
   the mind, which is illuminated, the dark clouds of ignorance being
   driven away. Next, the inclination or the will, by which it is
   delivered from the dominion of indwelling sin, and is filled with the
   spirit of holiness. The body is not changed, either as to its essence
   or its inward qualifies; but as it is a part of the man, who is
   consecrated to God, and is an instrument united to the soul, having
   been removed by the sanctified soul which inhabits it from the purposes
   of sin, it is admitted to and employed in the service of God, "that our
   whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the day
   of our Lord Jesus Christ." IX. The form lies in the purification from
   sin, and in a conformity with God in the body of Christ through his
   Spirit. X. The end is, that a believing man, being consecrated to God
   as a priest and king, should serve him in newness of life, to the glory
   of his divine name, and to the salvation of man. XI. As, under the Old
   Testament, the priests, when approaching to render worship to God, were
   accustomed to be sprinkled with blood, so, likewise, the blood of Jesus
   Christ, which is the blood of the New Testament, serves for this
   purpose-to sprinkle us, who are constituted by him as priests, to serve
   the living God. In this respect, the sprinkling of the blood of Christ,
   which principally serves for the expiation of sins, and which is the
   cause of justification, belongs also to sanctification; for in
   justification, this sprinkling serves to wash away sins that have been
   committed; but in sanctification, it serves to sanctify men who have
   obtained remission of their sins, that they may further be enabled to
   offer worship and sacrifices to God, through Christ. XII. This
   sanctification is not completed in a single moment; but sin, from whose
   dominion we have been delivered through the cross and the death of
   Christ, is weakened more and more by daily losses, and the inner man is
   day by day renewed more and more, while we carry about with us in our
   bodies, the death of Christ, and the outward man is perishing.
   COROLLARY We permit this question to be made the subject of discussion:
   Does the death of the body bring the perfection and completion of
   sanctification -- and how is this effect produced?
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION L ON THE CHURCH OF GOD AND OF CHRIST: OR ON THE CHURCH IN GENERAL
AFTER THE FALL

   As, through faith, which is the first part of our duty towards God and
   Christ, we have obtained the blessings of justification and
   sanctification from our union and communion with Christ, by which
   benefits we are, from children of wrath and the slaves of sin, not only
   constituted the children of God and the servants of righteousness, (on
   which account it is fit that we should render obedience and worship to
   our Parent and our Lord,) and as we have likewise obtained power and
   confidence for the performance of such obedience and worship, it would
   follow that we should now treat on obedience and worship as on another
   part of our duty. II. But as there are multitudes of those who have,
   through these benefits, been made the sons and the servants of God, and
   who have been united, among themselves, by the same faith and the
   Spirit of Christ, as members in one body, which is called the church,
   and of which the Scriptures make frequent mention, it appears to be the
   most proper course to treat, First, upon this church, because, as she
   derives her origin from this faith, she comprehends within her embraces
   all those to whom the performance of worship to God and Christ is to be
   prescribed. III. And as it has pleased God to institute certain signs
   by which may be sealed or testified, both the communion of believers
   with Christ and among themselves, and a participation of these
   benefits, and, on the other hand, their service of gratitude towards
   God and Christ, we shall deem it proper, NEXT, to treat upon these
   signs or tokens, before we proceed to the worship, itself, which is due
   to God and Christ. First, then, let us consider the church. IV. This
   word, in its general acceptation, denotes a company or congregation of
   men who are called out, and not only the act and the command of him who
   calls them out, but likewise the obedient compliance of those who
   answer the call; so that the result or effect of that act is included
   in the word "church. " V. But it is thus defined: A company of persons
   called out from a state of natural life and of sin, by God and Christ,
   through the Spirit of both, to a supernatural life to be spent
   according to God and Christ in the knowledge and worship of both, that
   by a participation with both, they may be eternally blessed, to the
   glory of God through Christ, and of Christ in God. VI. The efficient
   cause of this evocation, or calling out, is God the Father, in his Son
   Jesus Christ, and Christ himself, through the Spirit, both of the
   Father and of the Son as he is Mediator and the Head of the church,
   sanctifying and regenerating her to a new life. The impulsive cause is
   the gracious good pleasure of God the Father, in Christ, and the love
   of Christ towards those whom he has acquired for himself by his own
   blood. VII. The executive cause of this gracious good pleasure of God
   in Christ, which may also, in this respect, according to its
   distribution, be called "the administrative cause," is the Spirit of
   God and of Christ by the word of both; by which he requires outwardly a
   life according to God and Christ, with the addition of the promise of a
   reward and the threatening of a punishment; and he inwardly illuminates
   the mind to a knowledge of this life, imparts to us the feelings of
   love and desire for this life, and bestows on the whole man strength
   and power to live such a life. VIII. The matter about which [it is
   occupied], or the object of the vocations, are natural and sinful men,
   who, indeed, according to nature, are capable of receiving instruction
   from the Spirit through the word, but who are, according to the life of
   the present world and the state of sin, darkened in their minds and
   alienated from the life of God. This state requires that the beginning
   of preaching be made from preaching the law as it reproves sin and
   convinces of sin, and thus that progress be made to the preaching of
   the gospel of grace. IX. The form of the church resides in the mutual
   relation of God and Christ who calls, and of the church who obeys that
   call, according to which, God in Christ, by the Spirit of both, infuses
   into her supernatural life, feeling or sensation, and motion; and she,
   on the other hand, being quickened and under the influence of feeling
   and motion, begins to live and to walk according to godliness, and in
   expectation of the blessings promised. X. The end of this evocation,
   which also contains the chief good of the church, is blessedness
   perfected and consummated through a union with God in Christ. From
   this, results the glory of God, who unites the church to himself and
   beatifies her, which glory is declared in the very act of union and
   beatification -- also the glory of the same blessed God, when the
   church in her triumphant songs ascribes to him praise, honour and glory
   forever and ever. XI. From the act of this evocation and from the form
   of the church arising out of it, it appears that a distinction must be
   made among the men or congregation, as they are men, and as they are
   called out and obey the call; and they must be so distinguished that
   the company to whom the name of "the church" at any time belonged, may
   so decline from that obedience as to lose the name of "the church," God
   "removing their candlestick out of its place," and sending a bill of
   divorce to his disobedient and adulterous wife. Hence it is evident
   that the glorying of the papists is vain on this point -- that the
   church of Rome cannot err and fall away
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LI ON THE CHURCH OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, OR UNDER THE PROMISE

   As Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, to-day, and ever -- as he is the
   chief or deepest corner-stone, upon which the superstructure of the
   church is raised, being built up both by prophets and apostles, and as
   he is the head of all those who will be partaken of salvation, the
   whole church, therefore, may, in this sense, be called "Christian,"
   though under this appellation, peculiarly, comes the church as she
   began to be collected together after the actual ascent of Christ into
   heaven. II. But though the church be one with respect to its
   foundation, and of those things which concern the substance itself yet,
   because it has pleased God to govern it according to different methods,
   in reference to this the church may, in the most suitable manner, be
   distinguished into the church which existed in the times of the Old
   Testament before Christ, and into that which flourished in the times of
   the New Testament and after Christ appeared on earth. III. "The church,
   prior to the advent of Christ, under the dispensation of the Old
   Testament," is that which was called out, (by the word of promise
   concerning the seed of the woman and the seed of Abraham, and
   concerning the Messiah who was subsequently to come,) from the state of
   sin and misery, to a participation of the righteousness of faith and
   salvation, and to the faith placed in that promise -- and by the word
   of the law, to render worship to God in confidence of obtaining mercy
   in this blessed Seed and the promised Messiah, in a manner suitable to
   the infantile age of the church herself. IV. The word of promise was
   propounded, in the beginning, in a very general manner and with much
   obscurity, but in succeeding ages, more specially and with greater
   distinctness, and still more so, as the times of the advent of the
   Messiah in the flesh drew nearer. V. The law which contributed to this
   calling, was both the moral and the ceremonial; (for, in this place,
   the forensic does not come under consideration;) and both of them as
   delivered orally, and as comprised and proposed in writing by Moses, in
   which last respect, the law is principally treated upon in the
   Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament. VI. The moral law serves
   this office in a two-fold manner: First, by demonstrating the necessity
   of the gracious promise, which it does by convincing [men] of sins
   against the law, and of the weakness [of man] to perform the law. To
   this purpose it has been rigidly and strictly propounded; and it is
   considered as so proposed, according to these passages: "The man that
   doeth them shall live in them," and "Cursed is every one that
   continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law
   to do them." Secondly, by ewieikwv moderately, or with clemency,
   requiring the observance of it from those who were parties to the
   covenant of promise. VII. Though the observance of the ceremonial law
   be not, of itself, and on account of itself, pleasing to God, yet the
   observance of it was prescribed for two purposes: (1.) That it might
   convince of the guilt of sins and of the curse, and might thus declare
   the necessity of the gracious promise. (2.) And that it might sustain
   believers by the hope of the promise, which hope was confirmed by the
   typical presignification of future things. In the former of these two
   respects, the ceremonial law was the seal of sins; but in the latter,
   it was the seal of grace and remission. VIII. The church of those times
   must, therefore, be considered, both as it is called the heir, and as
   called the infant, either according to its substance, or according to
   the dispensation and economy suitable to those times. According to the
   former of these respects, the church was under the promise or the
   covenant of promise; and according to the latter respect, she was under
   the law and under the Old Testament, in regard to which, that people is
   called servile, or in bondage, and the infant heir "differing in
   nothing from a servant," as, in regard to the promise, the same people
   are denominated free, born of a free woman, and according to Isaac
   "counted for the seed" to whom the promise was made. IX. According to
   the promise, the church was a willing people -- according to the Old
   Testament, a carnal people; according to the former relation, the heir
   of spiritual and heavenly blessings; according to the latter, the heir
   of spiritual and earthly blessings, especially of the land of Canaan
   and of its benefits. According to the former relation, the church was
   endowed with the Spirit of adoption; according to the latter, she had
   this Spirit intermixed with that of bondage as long as the promise
   continued. X. The open consideration of these relations, and a suitable
   comparison and opposition between the covenant of promise, and the law
   or the Old Testament, contributes much to the [correct] interpretation
   of several passages of Scripture, which, otherwise, can scarcely be at
   all explained, or at least with great difficulty COROLLARIES I. Because
   the Old Testament was forced to be abrogated, therefore it was to be
   confirmed, not by the blood of a testator or mediator, but of brute
   animals. II. "The Old Testament" is never used in the Scriptures for
   the covenant of grace. III. The confounding of the promise and of the
   Old Testament is productive of much obscurity in Christian theology,
   and is the cause of more than a single error.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LII ON THE CHURCH OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, OR UNDER THE GOSPEL

   The Church of the New Testament is that which, from the time when that
   Testament was confirmed by the blood of Christ the mediator of the New
   Testament, or from the period of his ascension into heaven, began to be
   called out from a state of sin which was plainly manifested by the word
   of the gospel, and by the Spirit that was suited to the heirs who had
   attained to the age of adults -- to a participation of the
   righteousness of faith and of salvation, through faith placed in the
   gospel, and to render worship to God and Christ in the unity of the
   same Spirit; and this church will continue to be called out in the same
   manner to the end of the world, to the praise of the glory of the grace
   of God and of Christ. II. The efficient cause is the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, who has now most plainly manifested himself to
   be Jehovah and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; and it is Christ
   himself, elevated to the right hand of the Father, invested with full
   power in heaven and on earth, and endowed with the word of the gospel
   and with the Spirit beyond measure. The antecedent or only moving cause
   is the grace and mercy of God the Father and of Christ, and even the
   justice of God, to which, through the good pleasure of the Father, the
   fullest satisfaction has now been made in Jesus Christ, and which is
   clearly manifested in the gospel. III. The Spirit of Christ is the
   administering cause, according to the economy, as he is the substitute
   of Christ and receives of that which is Christ's, to glorify Christ by
   this calling forth in his church, with only a full power to administer
   all things according to his own pleasure. The Spirit uses the word of
   the gospel placed in the mouth of his servants, which immediately
   executes this vocation, and the word of the law, whether written or
   implanted in the mind; the gospel serves both antecedently that a place
   may be made for this vocation, and consequently when it has been
   received by faith. IV. The object of this evocation is, not only Jews,
   but also gentiles, the middle wall of partition which formerly
   separated the gentiles from the Jews being taken away by the flesh and
   blood of Christ; that is, the object is all men generally and
   promiscuously without any difference, but it is all men actually
   sinners, whether they be those who acknowledge themselves as such and
   to whom the preaching of the gospel is constantly exhibited, or those
   who are yet to be brought to the acknowledgment of their sins. V.
   Because this church is of adult age, and because she no longer requires
   a tutor and governor, she is free from the economical bondage of the
   law, and is governed by the spirit of full liberty, which is, by no
   means, intermixed with the spirit of bondage; and, therefore, she is
   free from the use of the ceremonial law, so far as it served for
   testifying of sins, and as it was "the hand-writing which was against
   us." VI. This church, also, with unveiled or open face, beholds the
   glory of the Lord as in a glass, and has the very express image of
   heavenly things, and Christ, the image of the invisible God, the
   express image of the Father's person, and the brightness of his glory,
   and the very body of things to come which is of Christ. She, therefore,
   does not need the law, which has the shadow of good things to come; on
   which account, she is free from the same ceremonial law, by which it
   typically prefigured Christ and good things to come. VII. The church of
   the New Testament has not experienced, does not now experience, and
   will not, to the end of the world, experience, in the whole of its
   course, any change whatever with regard to the word itself or the
   spirit; For, in these last times, God has spoken to us in his Son, and
   by those who have heard him. VIII. This same church is called
   "catholic," in a peculiar and distinct sense in opposition to the
   church which was under the Old Testament, so far as she has been
   diffused through the whole world, and has embraced within her boundary
   all nations, tribes, people and tongues. This universality is not
   hinder, by the rejection of the greater part of the Jews, as they will
   also be added to the church, some time hence, in a great multitude, and
   like an army formed into columns. IX. We may denominate, not unaptly or
   inappropriately, the state of the church, as she existed from the time
   of John until the assent of Christ into heaven, "a temporary or
   intermediate one" between the state of the promise and of the gospel,
   or that of the Old Testament and of the New. X. On which account, we
   place the ministry of John between the ministry of the prophets and
   that of the apostles, and plainly, and in every respect, conformable to
   neither of them. Hence, also, John is called "a greater prophet," and
   is said to be "less than the least in the kingdom of heaven. COROLLARY
   The baptism of John was so far the same with that of Christ, that there
   was afterwards no need for it to be restored.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LIII ON THE HEAD AND THE MARKS OF THE CHURCH

   Though the head and the body be of one nature, and though, according to
   nature, they properly constitute one subsistence, yet he who, according
   to nature, is the head of the church, cannot have communion of nature
   with her, for she is his creature. II. But it has been the good
   pleasure of God, who is both the head of the church according to
   nature, and her creator, to bestow on his church his Son Jesus Christ,
   made man, as her head, by whom, likewise, it has been his will to
   create his church -- that is, a new creature, that the union between
   the church and her head might be closer, and the communication more
   free and confiding. III. But a three-fold relation exists between the
   church and her head: (1.) That the head contains in himself, in a
   manner the most perfect, all things which are necessary and sufficient
   for salvation. (2.) That he is fitly united to the church, his body, by
   "the joints and bands" of the Spirit and of faith. (3.) That the head
   can infuse the virtue of his own perfection into her, and she can
   receive it from him according to the order of preordination and
   subordination fitly corresponding with it according to the difference
   of both. IV. But these three things belong to Christ alone; nay, not
   one of the three agrees with any person or thing except with Christ.
   Wherefore, he, only, is the head of the church, to whom she immediately
   coheres according to her internal and real essence. V. But no one can,
   according to this relation, be vicar or substitute to him; neither the
   apostle Peter, nor any Roman pontiff; nay, Christ can have no one among
   men as his vicar, according to the external administration of the
   church; and, what is still more, he cannot have a universal minister,
   which term is less than that of vicar. VI. Yet we do not deny that
   those persons who are constituted by this head as his ministers,
   perform such functions as belong to the head; because it has been his
   pleasure to gather his church to himself, and to govern it by human
   means. VII. But, according to her internal essence, this church is
   known to no one except to her head. She is likewise made known to
   others by signs and indications which have their origin from her true
   internal essence itself, if they be real, and not counterfeit and
   deceptive in their appearance. VIII. These signs are, the profession of
   the true faith, and the institution or conducting of the life according
   to the direction and the instigation of the Spirit -- a matter that
   belongs to external acts, about which, alone, a judgment can be formed
   by mankind. IX. We say that these are the marks of a church which
   outwardly conducts herself with propriety. But it may come to pass,
   that a mere profession of faith may obtain in this church through the
   public preaching and hearing of the word, through the administration
   and use of the sacraments, and through prayers and Thanksgivings; and
   yet in her whole life she may degenerate from the profession; and,
   lastly, she may in her deeds deny Christ, whom she professes to know in
   word, in which case, she does not cease to be a church as long as it is
   the pleasure of God and Christ to bear with her ill manners, and not to
   send her a bill of divorcement. X. But it has happened that in her
   profession itself, she begins to intermix falsehoods with truth, and to
   worship, at the same time, Jehovah and Baal. Then, indeed, her
   condition is very bad, and "nigh to destruction," and all those who
   adhere to her are commanded to desert her, so far, at least, as not to
   become partakers of her abominations, and to contaminate themselves
   with the pollutions of her idolatry; nay, they are commanded to accuse
   their mother of being a harlot, and of having violated the marriage
   compact with her husband. XI. In such a defection as this, those who
   desert her are not the cause of the dissension, but she who is justly
   deserted, because she first declined from God and Christ, to whom all
   believers, and each of them in particular, must adhere by an
   inseparable connection. XII. The Roman pontiff is not the head of the
   church; and because he boasts himself of being that head, the name of
   "Antichrist" on this account most deservedly belongs to him. XIII. The
   marks of the church of which the papists boast -- antiquity,
   universality, duration, amplitude, the uninterrupted succession of
   teachers, and agreement in doctrine-have been invented beyond those
   which we have laid down, because they are accommodated to the present
   state of the church of Rome.

DISPUTATION LIV ON THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, HER PARTS AND RELATIONS

   The catholic church is the company of all believers, called out from
   every language, tribe, people, nation and calling, who have been, are
   now, and will be, called by the saving vocation of God from a state of
   corruption to the dignity of the children of God, through the word of
   the covenant of grace, and engrafted into Christ, as living members to
   their head through true faith, to the praise of the glory of the grace
   of God. From this, it appears that the catholic church differs from
   particular churches in nothing which appertains to the substance of a
   church, but solely in her amplitude. II. But as she is called "the
   catholic church" in reference to her matter, which embraces all those
   who have ever been, are now, and will yet be, made partakers of this
   vocation, and received into the family of God, so, likewise, is she
   denominated "the one and holy church," from her form, which consists in
   the mutual relation of the church, who by faith, embraces Christ as her
   head and spouse, and of Christ, who so closely unites the church to
   himself, as his body and spouse, by his Spirit, that the church lives
   by the life of Christ himself, and is made a partaker of him and of all
   his benefits. III. The Catholic Church is "ONE," because, under one God
   and Father, who is above all persons, and through all things, and in
   all of us, she has been united as one body to one head, Christ the
   Lord, through one Spirit, and through one faith placed in the same
   word, through a similar hope of the same inheritance, and through
   mutual charity, she has been "fitly framed and built for a holy temple,
   and a habitation of God through the Spirit." Wherefore, the whole of
   this unity is spiritual, though those who have been thus united
   together consist partly of body, and partly of spirit. IV. She is
   "HOLY;" because, by the blessing of the Holy of holies, she has been
   separated from the unclean world, washed from her sins by His blood,
   beautified with the presence and gracious indwelling of God, and
   adorned with true holiness by the sanctification of the Holy Spirit. V.
   But though this church is one, yet she is distinguished according to
   the acts of God towards her, so far as she has become the recipient of
   either of all of those acts, or of some of them. The church that has
   received only the act of her creation and preservation, is said to be
   in the way, and is called "the church militant," as being she that must
   yet contend with sin, the flesh, the world, and Satan. The church that,
   in addition to this, is made partaker of the consummation, is said to
   be in her native land, and is called "the church triumphant;" for,
   after having conquered all her enemies, she rests from her labours, and
   reigns with Christ in heaven. To that part which is still militant on
   earth, the title of "catholic" is likewise ascribed, so far as she
   embraces within her boundaries all particular militant churches. VI.
   But the catholic church is distributed, according to her parts, into
   many particular churches, since she consists of many congregations far
   distant from each other, with respect to place, and quite distinct. But
   as these particular churches have severally the name of "a church," so
   they have likewise the thing signified by the name and the entire
   definition like similar parts which participate in the name and
   definition of the whole; and the catholic church differs from each
   particular one solely in her universality, and in no other thing
   whatever which belongs to the essence of a church. Hence, is easily
   learned in what manner it may be understood that, as single, particular
   churches may err, yet the church universal cannot err; that is, in this
   sense, that there never will be a future time in which some believers
   will not exist who do not err in the foundation of religion. But from
   this interpretation, it is apparent that it cannot be concluded from
   the circumstance of the catholic church, being said to be in this
   sense, free from error, that any congregation, however numerous soever
   it may be, is exempt from error, unless there be in it one person, or
   more, who are so guided into all truth as to be incapable of erring.
   VII. Hence, since the evocation of the church is made inwardly by the
   Spirit, and outwardly by the word preached, and since they who are
   called, answer inwardly by faith, and outwardly by the profession of
   faith, as they who are called have the inward and the outward man,
   therefore, the church, in reference to these called persons, is
   distinguished into the visible and the invisible church, from the
   subjoined external accident -- invisible, as she "believes with the
   heart unto righteousness," and visible, as "confession is made with her
   mouth unto salvation." And this visibility or invisibility belongs
   neither more nor less to the whole catholic church, than to each church
   in particular. VIII. Then, since the church is collected out of this
   world, "which lieth in the wicked one," and often by ministers who,
   beside the word of God, preach another word, and since this church
   consists of men liable to be deceived and to fall, nay, of men who have
   been deceived and are fallen, therefore, the church is distinguished
   with respect to the doctrine of faith, into an orthodox and heretical
   church -- with respect to divine worship, into an idolatrous church,
   and into one that is a right worshiper of God and Christ, and with
   respect to the morals prescribed in the second table of the law, into a
   purer church or a more impure one. In all these, are also to be
   observed the degrees according to which one church is more heretical,
   idolatrous and impure than another; about all these things a correct
   judgment must be formed according to the Scriptures. Thus, likewise,
   the word "catholic" is used concerning those churches that neither
   labour under any destructive heresy, nor are idolatrous.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LV ON THE POWER OF THE CHURCH IN DELIVERING DOCTRINES

   The power of the church may be variously considered, according to
   various objects; for it is occupied either about the delivery of
   doctrines, the enactment of laws, the convening of assemblies, the
   appointment of ministers, or, lastly, about jurisdiction. II. In the
   institution of doctrines, or in the first delivery of them, the power
   of the church is a mere nullity, whether she be considered generally,
   or according to her parts; for she is the spouse of Christ, and,
   therefore, is bound to hear the voice of her husband. She cannot
   prescribe to herself the rule of willing, believing, doing and hoping.
   III. But the whole of her power, concerning doctrines, lies in the
   dispensation and administration of those which have been delivered by
   God and Christ -- necessarily previous to which is the humble and pious
   acceptance of the divine doctrines, the consequence of which is, that
   she justly preserve the name that has once been received. IV. As the
   acceptance and the preservation of doctrines may be considered either
   according to the words, or according to the right sense, so, likewise
   the delivery of the doctrines received and preserved must be
   distinguished either with respect to the words, or with respect to
   their correct meaning. V. The delivery or tradition of doctrines
   according to the words, is when the church declares or publishes the
   very words which she has received, (after they have been delivered to
   her by God, either in writing or orally,) without any addition,
   diminution, change or transposition, whether from the repositories in
   which she has concealed the divine writings, or from her own memory, in
   which she had carefully and faithfully preserved those things which had
   been orally delivered. At the same time, she solemnly testifies that
   those very things which she has received from above are [when
   transmitted through her] pure and unadulterated, (and is prepared even
   by death itself to confirm this her testimony,) as far as the
   variations of copies in the original languages permit a translator into
   other languages [thus to testify]; yet they do not concern the
   foundation so much as to be able to produce doubts concerning it on
   account of these variations. VI. The delivery or tradition according to
   the meaning, is the more ample explanation and application of the
   doctrines propounded and comprehended in the divine words, in which
   explanation, the church ought to contain herself within the terms of
   the very word which has been delivered, publishing no particular
   interpretation of a doctrine or of a passage, which does not rest on
   the entire foundation, and which cannot be fully proved from other
   passages. This she will most sedulously avoid if she adhere as much as
   possible to the expressions of the word delivered, and if she abstain,
   as far as she is capable, from the use of foreign words or phrases.
   VII. To this power, is annexed the right of examining and forming a
   judgment upon doctrines, as to the kind of spirit by which they have
   been proposed; in this, also she will employ the rule of the word which
   bears assured evidences that it is divine, and has been received as
   such; and indeed, they will employ the rule of this word alone, if she
   be desirous to institute a proper examination, and to form a correct
   judgment. But if she employ any human writings whatsoever, for a rule
   or guide, the morning light will not shine on her, and, therefore, she
   will grope about in darkness. VIII. But the church ought to be guarded
   against three things: (1.) To hide from no one the words which have
   been divinely delivered to her, or to interdict any man from reading
   them or meditating upon them. (2.) When, for certain reasons, she
   declares divine doctrines with her own words, not to compel any one to
   receive or to approve them, except on this condition, so far as they
   are. consentaneous with the meaning comprehended in the divine words.
   (3.) And not to prohibit any man who is desirous of examining, in a
   legitimate manner, the doctrines proposed in the words of the church.
   Whichsoever of these things she does, she cannot, in that case, evade
   the criminal charge of having arrogated a power to herself, and of
   abusing it beyond all law, right and equity. COROLLARY It is one of the
   fabulous stories of the papists that the Holy Spirit assists the church
   in such a manner, in forming her judgment on the authentic Scriptures,
   and in the right interpretation of the divine meanings, that she cannot
   err.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LVI ON THE POWER OF THE CHURCH IN ENACTING LAWS

   The laws which may be prescribed to the church, or which may be
   considered as having been prescribed, are of two kinds, distinguished
   from each other by a remarkable difference and by a notable doctrine --
   according to the matter, that is, the acts which are prescribed --
   according to the end for the sake of which they are prescribed, and,
   lastly, according to the force and necessity of obligation. 2. (1.) For
   some laws concern the very essence of ordering the life according to
   godliness and Christianity, and the necessary acts of faith, hope and
   charity; and these may be called the necessary and primary or principal
   laws, and are as the fundamental laws of the kingdom of God itself.
   (2.) But others of them have respect to certain secondary and
   substituted acts, and the circumstances of the principal acts, all of
   which conduce to the more commodious and easy observance of those first
   acts. On this account they deserve to be called positive and attendant
   laws. III. 1. The church neither has a right, nor is she bound by any
   necessity, to enact necessary laws, and those which essentially concern
   the acts of faith itself, of hope and of charity. For this belongs most
   properly to God and Christ; and it has been so fully exercised by
   Christ, that nothing can essentially belong to the acts of faith, hope
   and charity, which has not been prescribed by him in a manner the most
   copious. IV. The entire power, therefore, of the church is placed in
   enacting laws of the second kind; about the making and observing of
   which we must now make some observations. V. In prescribing laws of
   this kind, the church ought to turn her eyes, and to keep them fixed,
   on the following particulars: First. That the acts which she will
   command or forbid be of a middle or an indifferent kind, and in their
   own nature neither good nor evil; and yet that they may be useful, for
   the commodious observance of the acts [divinely] prescribed, according
   to the circumstance of persons, times and places. VI. Secondly. That
   laws of this description be not adverse to the word of God, but that
   they rather be conformable to it, whether they be deduced from those
   things which are, in a general manner, prescribed in the word of God,
   according to the circumstances already enumerated, or whether they be
   considered as suitable means for executing those things which have been
   prescribed in the word of God. VII. Thirdly. That these laws be
   principally referred to the good order and the decorous administration
   of the external polity of the church. For God is not the author of
   confusion; but he is both the author and the lover of order; and regard
   is in every place to be paid to decorum, but chiefly in the church,
   which is "the house of God," and in which it is exceedingly unbecoming
   to have any thing, or to do any thing, that is either indecorous or out
   of order. VIII. Fourthly. That she do not assume to herself the
   authority of binding, by her laws, the consciences of men to acts
   prescribed by herself; for she will thus invade the right of Christ, in
   prescribing things necessary, and will infringe Christian liberty,
   which ought to be free from snares of this description. IX. Fifthly.
   That, by any deed of her own, by a simple promise or by an oath, either
   orally or by the subscription of the hand, she do not take away from
   herself the power of abrogating, enlarging, diminishing or of changing
   the laws themselves. It would not be a useless labour if the church
   were to enter her protest, at the end of the laws, about the perpetual
   duration of this her power, in a subjoined clause, such as the civil
   magistrate is accustomed to employ in political positive laws. X. But
   with regard to the observance of these laws; as they are already
   enacted, all and every one of those who are in the church are bound by
   them so far, that it is not lawful to transgress them through contempt,
   and to the scandal of others; and the church herself will not estimate
   the observance of them at so low a value as to permit them to be
   violated through contempt and to the scandal of others; but she will
   mark, admonish, reprove and blame such transgressors, as behaving
   themselves in a disorderly and indecorous manner, and she will
   endeavour to bring them back to a better mind. COROLLARY Is it not
   useful, for the purpose of bearing testimony to the power and the
   liberty of the church, occasionally to make some change in the laws
   ecclesiastical, lest the observance of them becoming perpetual, and
   without any change, should produce an opinion of the [absolute]
   necessity of their being observed?
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LVII ON THE POWER OF THE CHURCH IN ADMINISTERING JUSTICE, OR ON
ECCLESIASTICAL DISCIPLINE

   As no society, however rightly constituted and furnished with good
   laws, can long keep together unless they who belong to it be restrained
   within their duty by a certain method of jurisdiction or discipline, or
   be compelled to the performance of their duty, so, in the church, which
   is the house, the city and the kingdom of God, discipline of the same
   kind must flourish and be exercised. II. But it is proper that this
   discipline be accommodated to the spiritual life, and not to that which
   is natural; and that it should be serviceable for edifying, confirming,
   amplifying and adorning the church as such, and for directing
   consciences, without [employing] any force hurtful in any part to the
   body or to the substance, and to the condition of the animal life;
   unless, perhaps, it be the pleasure of the magistrate, in virtue of the
   power granted to him by God, to force an offender to repentance by some
   other method. Such a proceeding, however, we do not prejudge. III. But
   ecclesiastical discipline is an act of the church, by which, according
   to the power instituted by God and Christ, and bestowed on her, and to
   be employed through a consciousness of the office imposed, she
   reprehends all and every one of those who belong to the church, if they
   have fallen into open sin, and admonishes them to repent; or, if they
   pertinaciously persevere in their sins, she excommunicates them, to the
   benefit of the whole church, the salvation of the sinner himself, to
   the profit of those who are without, and to the glory of God himself
   and Christ. IV. The object of this discipline is all and each of those
   who, having been engrafted into the church by baptism, are capable of
   this discipline for the correction of themselves. The cause or formal
   condition why discipline must be exercised on them is, the offenses
   committed by them, whether they concern the doctrine of faith, and are
   pernicious and destructive heresies, or whether they have respect to
   morals and to the rest of the acts of the Christian life. V. But it is
   requisite, that these sins be external and manifest, that is, known,
   and correctly known, to those by whom the discipline shall be
   administered; and that it be evident, that they are sins according to
   the laws imposed by Christ on the church, and that they have actually
   been committed. For God, alone, judges concerning inward sins. VI. Let
   the form of administering the laws be with all kindness and discretion,
   also with zeal, and occasionally with severity and some degree of
   rigor, if occasion require it to be employed. But the intention is, the
   salvation of him who has sinned, and that of the whole body of the
   church, to the glory of God and of Christ. VII. The execution of this
   discipline lies both in admonition and in castigation or punishment, or
   in censure, which is conveyed only in words, through reprehension,
   exhortation and communication, or which is given by the privation of
   some of those things which outwardly belong to the communion of saints,
   and to the saving edification or building up of every believer in the
   body of Christ. VIII. Admonitions are accommodated, First, to the
   persons who have sinned, in which must be observed the difference of
   age, sex and condition, with all prudence and discretion. Secondly.
   They are accommodated to those sins which have been committed; for some
   are more grievous than others. Thirdly. To the mode in which sins have
   been perpetrated, which mode comes now under our special consideration.
   IX. For some sins are clandestine, others are public, whether they are
   offenses only against God, or whether they have, in union with such
   offense, injury to a man's neighbour. According to this latter respect,
   it is called "a private sin," that is, an offense committed by one
   private individual against another-such as is intimated by the word of
   Christ, in Matt. xviii. 7-18, in which passage is likewise prescribed
   the mode of reproving an offense. X. A clandestine sin is that which is
   secretly perpetrated, and with the commission of which very few persons
   are acquainted; to this belongs a secret reprehension, to be inflicted
   by those who are acquainted with it. One of the principal ministers of
   the church, however, will be able to impart authority to the
   reprehension; yet he can, by no means, refer it to his colleagues; but
   it will be his duty to deliver this reproof in secret. XI. A public sin
   is that which is committed when several people are acquainted with it.
   We allow it to be made a subject of discussion, whether a sin ought to
   receive the appellation of a public one, when it has been secretly
   committed but has become known to many persons either through the fault
   of him who perpetrated it, or through the officiousness of those who
   divulged it without necessity. XII. But there is still some difference
   in public sins; for they are known either to some part of the church,
   or to the whole, or nearly to the whole of it; according to this
   difference, the admonition to be given ought to be varied. If the sin
   be known to part of the church, it is sufficient that the sinner be
   admonished and reproved before the consistory, or in the presence of
   more persons to whom it had been known. If it be known to the whole
   church, the sinner must be reprehended before all the members; for this
   practice conduces both to the shame of him who has sinned, and to deter
   others from sinning after his example. Some consideration, however, may
   be had to the shame of any offender, and a degree of moderation be
   shown; that is, if he is not deeply versed in sinful practices, but if
   a sin has taken him by surprise, or "he is overtaken in a fault." XIII.
   As this reproof has the tendency to induce the offender to desist from
   sinning, if this end is not obtained by the first admonition, it is
   necessary to repeat it occasionally, until the sinner stands corrected,
   or makes an open declaration of his contumacy. But some difference of
   opinion exists on this point among divines: "Is it useful to bring an
   offender to punishment, when, after having afforded hopes of amendment,
   he does not fulfill those hopes according to the judgment and the
   wishes of the church?" But it does not seem possible to determine this
   so much by settled rules, as by leaving the matter to the discretion of
   the governors of the church. XIV. But if the offender despise all
   admonitions, and contumaciously perseveres in his sins, after the
   church has exercised the necessary patience towards him, she must
   proceed to punishment; which is excommunication, that is, the exclusion
   of the contumacious person from the holy communion and even from the
   church herself. This public exclusion will be accompanied by the
   avoidance of all intercourse and familiarity with the person
   excommunicated, to [the observance of] which, each member of the church
   must pay attention as far as is permitted by the necessary relative
   duties which either all the members owe to him according to their
   general vocation, or some of them owe according to their particular
   obligation. [For a subject is not freed from his obligation toward his
   prince, on account of the excommunication of the prince; neither, in
   such circumstances, is a wife freed from the duty which she is bound to
   perform to her husband; nor are children freed from their duty to
   parents; and thus in other similar instances.] XV. Some persons
   suppose, that this excommunication is solely from the privilege of
   celebrating the Lord's supper. Others suppose it to be of two kinds,
   the less and the greater -- the less being a partial exclusion from
   attendance on some of the sacred offices of the church -- the greater,
   an exclusion from all of them together, and totally from the communion
   of believers. But others, rejecting the minor excommunication,
   acknowledge no other than the major; because it appears to them, that
   there is no cause why a contumacious sinner ought to be rejected from
   this communion more than from that, since he has rendered himself
   unworthy to obtain any place in the church and the assembly of saints.
   We do not interpose our opinion; but we leave this matter to be
   discussed by the judgment of learned and pious men, that by common
   consent it may be concluded from the Scriptures what is most agreeable
   to them, and best suited to the edification of the church. COROLLARIES
   Excommunication must be avoided, where a manifest fear of a schism
   exists. "Should not this also be done, where a fear exists of
   persecution being likely to ensue on account of excommunication?" We
   think, that, in this case, likewise, excommunication should be avoided.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LVIII ON COUNCILS

   An ecclesiastical council is an assembly of men gathered together in
   the name of God, consulting and defining or settling, according to the
   word of God, about those things which pertain to religion and the good
   of the church, for the glory of God and the salvation of the church.
   II. The power of appointing an assembly of this kind resides in the
   church herself. If she is under the sway of a Christian magistrate, who
   makes an open profession of religion, or who publicly tolerates it,
   then we transfer this power to such a magistrate, without whose
   convocation, those persons that protested to the church concerning the
   nullity of the Council of Trent have maintained that a council is
   illegitimate. But if the magistrate is neither a believer, nor publicly
   tolerates religion, but is an enemy and a persecutor, then those who
   preside in the church will discharge that office. III. An occasion will
   be afforded for convening an assembly of this kind, either by some evil
   men who are an annoyance to the church, whether they be in the church
   or out of it, or even the perpetual constitution of the church so long
   as she continues on earth. For as she is liable to error, corruption,
   and defection from the truth of doctrine, from the purity of divine
   worship, from moral probity and from Christian concord, to heresies,
   idolatry, corruption of manners, and schisms, it is useful for
   assemblies of this kind to be instituted. Yet may they be instituted,
   not only to correct any corruption if it manifestly appears that it has
   entered, but likewise to inquire whether something of the kind has not
   entered; because the enemy sows tares while the men sleep, to whom is
   entrusted the safe custody of the Lord's field. IV. We say that this is
   an assembly of men; for, "Let a woman. keep silence in the church,
   unless she has an extraordinary and divine call; and we say, these men
   ought to be distinguished by the following marks: First. That they be
   powerful in the Scriptures, and have their senses exercised in them.
   Secondly. That they be pious, grave, prudent, moderate, and-lovers of
   divine truth and of the peace of the church. Thirdly. That they be
   free, and bound down to no person, church, or confession written by
   men, but only to God and Christ, and to his word. V. They are men,
   whether of the ecclesiastical or of the political class -- in the first
   place, the supreme magistrate himself, and those persons who discharge
   any public office in the church and the republic. Then, also, private
   individuals, even those persons not being excluded who maintain some
   other [doctrine] than that which is the current opinion, provided they
   be furnished with the endowments which I have described. (Thesis 4.)
   And we are of opinion that such persons may deliver not only a
   deliberative but likewise a decisive sentence. VI. The object about
   which the council will be engaged is, the things appertaining to
   religion and to the good of the church as such. These are comprised
   under two chief heads-the primary, comprehending the doctrine, itself,
   of faith, hope, and charity, and the secondary, the order and polity of
   the church. VII. The rule, according to which deliberation must be
   instituted, and decision must be formed, is that single and sole one --
   the word of God, who holds absolute dominion in the church. But in
   things which belong to the good order and eutaxian the discipline of
   the church, it is allowable for the members attentively to consider the
   present state of the commonwealth and of the church, and to exercise
   deliberation and form decisions according to the circumstances of
   places, times and persons, provided one thing be guarded against-to
   determine nothing contrary to the word of God. VIII. But, because all
   things in assemblies of this kind ought to be done in order, it is
   requisite that some one preside over the whole council. If the chief
   magistrate be present, this office belongs to him; but he can devolve
   this charge on some other person, whether an ecclesiastic or layman;
   nay, he may commit this matter to the council itself, provided he take
   care that all and each of the members be restrained within the bounds
   of their duty, lest their judgments be concluded in a tumultuous
   manner. But it is useful that some bishop be appointed, who may perform
   the offices of prayer and thanksgiving, may propose the business to be
   transacted, and may inquire and collect the opinions and votes; indeed,
   so far, he, as an ecclesiastic, is the more suitable for fulfilling
   these duties. IX. A place must be appointed for assemblies of this
   kind, that they may be most commodious to all those who shall come to
   the synod, unless it be the pleasure of the chief magistrate to choose
   that place which will be the most convenient to himself. It ought to be
   a place secure from ambuscade or hostile surprise; and a safe conduct
   is necessary for all persons, that they may arrive and depart again,
   without personal detriment, as far as is allowable by the law of God
   itself, against which the authority of no council, however great, is of
   the least avail. X. The authority of councils is not absolute, but
   dependent on the authority of God; for this reason, no one is simply
   bound to assent to those things which have been decreed in a council,
   unless those persons be present, as members, who cannot err, and who
   have the undoubted marks and testimonies of the Holy Spirit to this
   fact. But every one may, nay, he is bound, to examine, by the word of
   God, those things which have been concluded in the council; and if he
   finds them to be agreeable to the divine word, then he may approve of
   them; but if they are not, then he may express his disapprobation. Yet
   he must be cautious not easily to reject that which has been determined
   by the unanimous consent of so many pious and learned men; but he ought
   diligently to consider, whether it has the Scriptures pronouncing in
   favour of it with sufficient clearness; and when this is the case, he
   may yield his assent, in the Lord, to their unanimous agreement. XI.
   The necessity of councils is not absolute, because the church can be
   instructed respecting necessary things without them. Yet their utility
   is very great, if, being instituted in the name of the Lord, they
   examine all things according to his word, and appoint that which, by
   common consent, according to that rule, the members have thought proper
   to pronounce as their decision. For, as many eyes see more than one
   eye, and as the Lord is accustomed to listen to the prayers of a number
   who agree together among themselves on earth, it is more probable that
   the truth will be discovered and confirmed from the Scriptures by some
   council consisting of many learned and pious men, than by the exertions
   of a single individual transacting the same business privately by
   himself. From these premises, we also say that the authority of any
   council is greater than that of any man who is present at such council,
   even that of the Roman pontiff, to whom we ascribe no other right in
   any council, than that which we give to any bishop, even at the time
   when he performed with fidelity the duties of a true bishop. So far,
   are we disinclined to believe, that no council can be convened and held
   without his command, presidency and direction. XIII. No council can
   prescribe to its successors, that they may not again deliberate about
   that which has been transacted and determined in preceding councils;
   because the matter of religion does not come under the denomination of
   a thing that is prejudged; neither can any council bind itself, by an
   oath, to the observance of any other word than that of God; much less
   can it make positive laws, to which it may bind either itself, or any
   man, by an oath. XIV. It is also allowable for a later ecumenical or
   general council to call in doubt that which had been decreed by a
   preceding general council, because it is possible even for general
   councils to err; nor yet does it follow from these premises that the
   catholic church errs; that is, that all the faithful universally err.

DISPUTATION LIX ON THE ECCLESIASTICAL MINISTRATIONS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT AND ON
THE VOCATION TO THEM

   By The word "ministry," we designate a public auxiliary office or duty,
   subservient to a superior, who, in this instance, is God and Christ as
   he is the Lord and Head of the church. It receives the appellation of
   "ecclesiastical" from its object, which is the church; and we
   distinguish it from a political ministry, which exercises itself in the
   civil affairs of the commonwealth. II. But it is the public duty which
   God has committed to certain men, to collect a church, to attend to it
   when collected, and to bring it to Christ, its Head, and through him to
   God, that [the members of] it may attain a life of happiness, to the
   glory of God and Christ. III. But as a church consists of men who live
   a natural life, and are called to live while in the body, a spiritual
   life, which is superior and ought to be as the end of the other, there
   is a two-fold office to be performed in the church according to the
   exigencies both of the natural and of the spiritual life: The First is
   that which is properly, per se, and immediately occupied about the
   spiritual life, its commencement, progress and confirmation; the Second
   is that by which the natural life is sustained, and, therefore, it
   belongs, only by accident and mediately, to the church. The First is
   always necessary per se. The Second is not necessary [in the church]
   except by hypothesis; because there are those who need a maintenance
   from others, and they do not obtain this through some order established
   in the community, in which case, it ought always to endure; but where
   any such order is established, it is unnecessary. On the former of
   these we are now treating; about the latter we have no further remarks
   to make. IV. The office accommodated to the spiritual life, consists of
   these three acts: The First is the teaching of the truth which is
   according to godliness; the Second is intercession before God; the
   Third is regimen or government accommodated to this institution or
   teaching. V. Institution or teaching consists in the proposing,
   explanation and confirmation of the truth, which contains the things
   that are to be believed, hoped for, and performed, in the refutation of
   falsehood, in exhortation, reprehension, consolation, and threatening,
   all of which is accomplished by the word both of the law and the
   gospel. To this function, we add the administration of the sacraments,
   which serve for the same purpose. VI. Intercession consists in prayers
   and Thanksgivings offered to God for the church and each of its
   members, through Christ our only advocate and intercessor. VII. The
   government of the church is used for this end, that, in the whole
   church, all things may be done decently, in order, and to edification;
   and that each of its members may be kept in their duty, the loiterers
   may be incited, the weak confirmed, those who have wandered out of the
   way brought back, the contumacious punished, and the penitents
   received. VIII. These offices are not always imposed in the same mode,
   nor administered by the same methods. For, at the commencement of the
   rising Christian church, they were imposed on some men immediately by
   God and Christ, and they were administered by those on whom they had
   been imposed, without binding them to certain churches; hence, also,
   the apostles were called "ministers," as being the ambassadors of
   Christ to every creature throughout the world. To these were added the
   evangelists, as fellow-labourers. Afterwards [the same offices were
   imposed] immediately on those who were called pastors and teachers,
   bishops and priests, and who were placed over certain churches. The
   former of these [the apostles and evangelists] continued only for a
   season, and had no successors. The latter [pastors, &c.] will remain in
   perpetual succession to the end of the world, though we do not deny
   that, when a church is first to be collected for any one, a man may
   traverse the whole earth in teaching. IX. These offices are so ordered,
   that one person can discharge all of them at the same time; though, if
   the utility of the church and the diversity of gifts so require, they
   can be variously distributed among different men. X. The vocation to
   such ecclesiastical offices is either immediate or mediate. Immediate
   vocation we will not now discuss. But that which is mediate is a divine
   act, administered by God and Christ through the church, by which he
   consecrates to himself a man separated from the occupations of the
   natural life and from those which are common, and removes him to the
   duties of the pastoral office, for the salvation of men and his own
   glory. In this vocation, we ought to consider the vocation itself, its
   efficient and its object. XI. The act of vocation consists of previous
   examination, election, and confirmation. (1.) Examination is a diligent
   inquiry and trial, whether the person about whom it is occupied be well
   suited for fulfilling the duties of the office. This fitness consists
   in the knowledge and approval of things true and necessary, in probity
   of life, and a facility of communicating to others those things which
   he knows himself, (which facility contains language and freedom in
   speaking,) in prudence, moderation of mind, patient endurance of
   labours, infirmities, injuries, &c. XII. Election, or choice, is the
   ordination of a person who is legitimately examined and found good and
   proper, by which is imposed on him the office to be discharged. To
   this, it is not unusual to add some public inauguration, by prayers and
   the laying on of hands, and also by previous fasting and is like an
   admission to the administration of the office itself, which is commonly
   denominated "confirmation." XIII. The primary efficient is God and
   Christ, and the Spirit of both as conducting the cause of Christ in the
   church, on which cause the whole authority of the vocation depends. The
   administrator is the church itself, in which we number the Christian
   magistrate, teachers, with the rest of the presbyters, and the people
   themselves. But in those places in which no magistrate resides who is
   willing to attend to this matter, there, bishops or presbyters, with
   the people, can and ought to perform this business. XIV. The object is
   the person to be called, in whom is required, for the sake of the
   church, that aptitude or suitableness about which we have already
   spoken, and on account of it, the testimony of a good conscience, by
   which he modestly approves the judgment of the church, and is conscious
   to himself that he enters on this office in the sincere fear of God,
   and with an intense desire only to edify the church. XV. The essential
   form of the vocation is that all things may be done according to the
   rule prescribed in the word of God. The accidental is, that they may
   all be done decently and suitably, according to the particular
   relations of persons, places, times, and other circumstances. XVI.
   Wheresoever all these conditions are observed, the call is legitimate,
   and on every part approved; but if some one be deficient, the act of
   vocation is then imperfect; yet the call is to be considered as
   ratified and firm, while the vocation of God is united by some outward
   testimony of it, which, because it is various, we cannot define
   COROLLARY The vocations or calls in the papal church have not been
   null, though contaminated and imperfect; and the first reformers had an
   ordinary and mediate call.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LX ON SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL

   We have thus far treated on the church, her power, and the ministry of
   the word; it follows that we now discuss those signs or marks which God
   appends to his word, and by which He seals and confirms the faith which
   has been produced in the minds of his covenant people. For these signs
   are commonly called "sacraments" -- a term, indeed, which is not
   employed in the Scriptures, but which, account of the agreement about
   it in the church, must not be rejected. I. But this word, "sacrament,"
   is transferred from military usage to that of sacred things; for, as
   soldiers were devoted to their general by an oath, as by a solemn
   attestation, so, likewise, those in covenant are bound to Christ by
   their reception of these signs, as by a public oath. But because the
   same word is either taken in a relative acceptation, (and this either
   properly for a sign, or by metonymy for the thing signified,) or in an
   absolute acceptation, (and this by synecdoche for both,) we will treat
   about its proper signification. II. A sacrament, therefore, is a sacred
   and visible sign or token and seal instituted by God, by which he
   ratifies to his covenant people the gracious promise proposed in his
   word, and binds them, on the other hand, to the performance of their
   duty. Therefore, no other promises are proposed to us by these signs
   than those which are manifested in the word. III. We call it "a sign or
   token, and a seal, both from the usage of Scripture in Gen. xvii. 11,
   and Rom. iv. 11, and from the nature of the thing itself, because these
   tokens, beside the external appearance which they present to our
   senses, cause something else to occur to the thoughts. Neither are they
   only naked significant tokens, but seals and pledges, which affect not
   only the mind, but likewise the heart itself. IV. We call it "sacred"
   in a two-fold respect: (1.) Because it has been given by God; and (2.)
   Because it is given to a sacred use. We call it "visible," because it
   is of the nature of a sign that it be perceptible to the senses; for
   that which is not such, cannot be called a sign. V. The author of these
   signs is God, who alone, is the lord and lawgiver of the church, and
   whose province it is to prescribe laws, to make promises, and to seal
   them with those tokens which have seemed good to himself; yet they are
   so accommodated to the grace to be sealed, as, by a certain analogy, to
   be significant of it. Therefore, they are not natural signs, which,
   from their own nature, signify all that of which they are significant;
   but they are voluntary signs, the whole signification of which depends
   on the will or option of him who institutes them. VI. The matter is the
   external element itself created by God, and, therefore, subject to his
   power, and made suitable to seal that which, according to his wisdom,
   God wills to be sealed by it. VII. As the internal form of the
   sacrament is ek twn prov ti of things to their relation, it consists in
   relation, and is that suitable analogy and similitude between the sign
   and the thing signified which has regard both to the representation,
   and to the sealing or witnessing, and the exhibition of the thing
   signified through the authority and the will of him who institutes it.
   From this most close analogy of the sign with the thing signified,
   various figurative expressions are employed in the Scriptures and in
   the sacraments: as, when the name of the thing signified is ascribed to
   the sign, thus, "And my covenant shall be in your flesh;" (Gen. xvii.
   13; ) and, on the contrary, in 1 Corinthians v. 7, "Christ, our
   passover, is sacrificed for us." Or, when the property of the thing is
   ascribed to the sign, as "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall
   give him, shall never thirst." (John iv. 14. ) And, on the contrary,
   "Take, eat: this is my body." (Matt. xxvi. 26.) VIII. The end of
   sacraments is two-fold, proximate and remote. The proximate end is the
   sealing of the promise made in the covenant. The remote end is, (1.)
   the confirmation of the faith of those who are in the covenant, and by
   consequence the salvation of the church that consists of those
   covenanted members; and (2.) the glory of God. IX. Those for whom the
   sacraments have been instituted by God, and by whom they are to be
   used, are those with whom God has entered into covenant, all of them,
   and they only. To them the use of the sacraments is to be conceded, as
   long as they are reckoned by God in the number of those who are in
   covenant; though by their sins they have deserved to be cast off and
   divorced. X. But these sacraments are to be considered according to the
   varied conditions of men; for they have either been instituted before
   the fall, and are of the covenant of works; or, after the fall, and are
   of the covenant of grace. There was only a single sacrament of the
   covenant of works, and that the tree of life. Those of the covenant of
   grace are either so far as they have regard to the promised covenant,
   and belong to the church while yet in her infancy and placed under
   pedagogy [the law being her schoolmaster] as were those of circumcision
   and of the passover; or so far as now they have regard to the covenant
   confirmed, and belong to the Christian church that is of adult age, as
   are those of baptism and the Lord's supper. The points of agreement and
   difference between each of these will be the more conveniently
   perceived in the discussion of each. COROLLARY Though in some things,
   sacrifices and sacraments agree together, yet they are by no means to
   be confounded; because in many respects the latter differ from the
   former.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXI ON THE SACRAMENTS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT, THE TREE OF LIFE,
CIRCUMCISION, AND THE PASCHAL LAMB

   The tree of life was created and instituted by God for this end -- that
   man, as long as he remained obedient to the divine law, might eat of
   its fruit, both for the preservation and continuance of this natural
   life against every defect which could happen to it through old age, or
   any other cause, and to designate or point out the promise of a better
   and more blissful life. It answered the former purpose, as an element
   created by God; and the latter, as a sacrament instituted by God. It
   was adapted to accomplish the former purpose by the natural force and
   capability which was imparted to it; it was fitted for the latter, on
   account of the similitude and analogy which subsist between natural and
   spiritual life. II. Circumcision is the sign of the covenant into which
   God entered with Abraham to seal or witness the promise about the
   blessed seed that should be born of him, about all nations which were
   to be blessed in him, and about constituting him the father of many
   nations, and the heir of the world through the righteousness of faith;
   and that God was willing to be his God and the God of his seed after
   him. This sign was to be administered in that member which is the
   ordained instrument of generation in the male sex, by a suitable
   analogy between the sign and the thing signified. III. By that sign all
   the male descendants from Abraham, were, at the express command of God,
   to be marked, on the eighth day after their nativity; and a threatening
   was added, that it should come to pass that the soul of him who was not
   circumcised on that day should be cut off from his people. IV. But
   though females were not circumcised in their bodies, yet they were in
   the mean time partakers of the same covenant and obligation, because
   they were reckoned among the men, and were considered by God as
   circumcised. It, therefore, was not necessary that God should institute
   any other remedy for taking away from females the native corruption of
   sin, as the papists have the audacity to affirm, beyond and contrary to
   the Scriptures. V. And this is the first relation of circumcision
   belonging to the promise. The other is, that the persons circumcised
   were bound to the observance of the whole law, delivered by God, and
   especially of the ceremonial law. For it was in the power of God to
   prescribe, to those who were in covenant with him, a law at his
   pleasure, and to seal the obligation of its observance by such a sign
   of the covenant as had been previously instituted and employed; and in
   this respect circumcision belongs to the Old Testament. VI. The paschal
   lamb was a sacrament, instituted by God to point out the deliverance
   from Egypt, and to renew the remembrance of it at a stated time in each
   year. VII. Beside this use, it served typically to adumbrate Christ,
   the true Lamb, who was to endure and bear away the sins of the world;
   on which account, also, its use was abrogated by the sufferings and
   [the sacrifice of Christ on the cross, as it relates to the right; but
   it was afterwards, in fact and reality, abrogated with the destruction
   of the city and the temple. VIII. The sacrament of the tree of life was
   a bloodless one; in the other two, there was shedding of blood -- both
   suitable to the diversity of the state of those who were in covenant
   with God. For the former was instituted before the entrance of sin into
   the world; but the two latter, after sin had entered, which, according
   to the decree of God, is not expiated except by blood; because the
   wages of sin is death, and natural life, according to the Scriptures,
   has its seat in the blood. IX. The passage under the cloud and through
   the sea, manna, and the water which gushed from the rock, were
   sacramental signs; but they were extraordinary, and as a sort of
   prelude to the sacraments of the New Testament, although of a
   signification and testification the most obscure, since the things
   signified and witnessed by them were not declared in express words.
   COROLLARIES I. It is probable that the church, from the primitive
   promise and reparation after the fall, until the times of Abraham, had
   her sacraments, though no express mention is made of them in the
   Scriptures. II. It would be an act of too great boldness to affirm what
   those sacraments were; yet if any one should say, that the first of
   them was the offering of the infant recently born before the Lord, on
   the very day on which the mother was purified from childbearing, and
   that another was, the eating of sacrifices and the sprinkling of the
   blood of the victims; his assertion would not be utterly devoid of
   probability.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXII ON THE SACRAMENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT IN GENERAL

   The sacraments of the New Testament are those which have been
   instituted for giving testimony to the covenant, or the New Testament
   confirmed by the death and blood of its mediator and testator. II.
   Wherefore, it was necessary that they should be such as were adapted to
   give significance and testimony to the confirmation already made; that
   is, that they should declare and testify that the blood had been shed,
   and that the death of the mediator had intervened. III. There ought,
   therefore, to be no shedding of blood in the sacraments of the New
   Testament; neither ought they to consist of any such thing as is or has
   been partaker of the life which is in the blood; for as sin has now
   been expiated, and remission fully obtained through the blood and death
   of the mediator, no further shedding of blood was necessary. IV. But
   they were to be instituted before the confirmation of the new covenant
   was made by the blood of the mediator and the death of the testator
   himself; both because the institution and the sealing o! the testament
   ought to precede even the death of the testator; and because the
   mediator himself ought to be a partaker of these sacraments, to
   consecrate them in his own person, and more strongly to seal the
   covenant which is between us and him. V. But as the communion of a
   sacrifice unto death, offered for sins, is signified and testified by
   nothing more appropriately than by the sprinkling of the blood and the
   eating of the sacrifice itself and the drinking of the blood, (if
   indeed it were allowable to drink blood,) hence, likewise, no signs
   were more appropriate than water, bread and wine, since the sprinkling
   of his very blood and the eating of his body could not be done, and,
   besides, the drinking of his blood ought not to be done. VI. The virtue
   and efficacy of the sacraments of the New Testament do not go beyond
   the act of signifying and testifying. There can neither actually be,
   nor be imagined, any exhibition of the thing signified through them,
   except such as is completed by these intermediate acts themselves. VII.
   And, therefore, the sacraments of the New Testament do not differ from
   those used in the Old Testament; because the former exhibit grace, but
   the latter typify or prefigure it. VIII. The sacraments of the New
   Testament have not the ratio of sacraments beyond that very use for the
   sake of which they were instituted, nor do they profit those who use
   them without faith and repentance; that is, those persons who are of
   adult age, and of whom faith and repentance are required. Respecting
   infants, the judgment is different, to whom it is sufficient that they
   are the offspring of believing parents, that they may be reckoned in
   the covenant. IX. The sacraments of the New Testament have been
   instituted, that they may endure to the end of time; and they will
   endure till the end of all things. COROLLARY The diversity of sects in
   the Christian religion does not excuse the omission of the use of the
   sacraments, though the vehemence of the leaders of any sect may afford
   a legitimate and sufficient cause to the people to abstain justly and
   without sin from the use of the sacraments of which such men have to
   become partakers with them.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXIII ON BAPTISM AND PAEDO-BAPTISM

   Baptism is the initial sacrament of the New Testament, by which the
   covenant people of God are sprinkled with water, by a minister of the
   church, in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost --
   to signify and to testify the spiritual ablution which is effected by
   the blood and Spirit of Christ. By this sacrament, those who are
   baptized to God the Father, and are consecrated to his Son by the Holy
   Spirit as a peculiar treasure, may have communion with both of them,
   and serve God all the days of their life. II. The author of the
   institution is God the Father, in his Son, the mediator of the New
   Testament, by the eternal Spirit of both. The first administrator of it
   was John; but Christ was the confirmer, both by receiving it from John,
   and by afterwards administering it through his disciples. III. But as
   baptism is two-fold with respect to the sign and the thing signified --
   one being of water, the other of blood and of the Spirit -- the first
   external, the second internal; so the matter and form ought also to be
   two-fold -- the external and earthy of the external baptism, the
   internal and heavenly of that which is internal. IV. The matter of
   external baptism is elementary water, suitable, according to nature, to
   purify that which is unclean. Hence, it is also suitable for the
   service of God to typify and witness the blood and the Spirit of
   Christ; and this blood and the Spirit of Christ is the thing signified
   in outward baptism, and the matter of that which is inward. But the
   application both of the blood and the Spirit of Christ, and the effect
   of both, are the thing signified by the application of this water, and
   the effect of the application. V. The form of external baptism is that
   ordained administration, according to the institution of God, which
   consists of these two things: (1.) That he who is baptized, be
   sprinkled with this water. (2.) That this sprinkling be made in the
   name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Analogous to
   this, is the inward sprinkling and communication both of the blood and
   the Spirit of Christ, which is done by Christ alone, and which may be
   called "the internal form of inward baptism." VI. The primary end of
   baptism is, that it may be a confirmation and sealing of the
   communication of grace in Christ, according to the new covenant, into
   which God the Father has entered with us in and on account of Christ.
   The secondary end is, that it may be the symbol of our initiation into
   the visible church, and an express mark of the obligation by which we
   have been bound to God the Father, and to Christ our Lord. VII. The
   object of this baptism is not real, but only personal; that is, all the
   covenanted people of God, whether they be adults or infants, provided
   the infants be born of parents who are themselves in the covenant, or
   if one of their parents be among the covenanted people of God, both
   because ablution in the blood of Christ has been promised to them; and
   because by the Spirit of Christ they are engrafted into the body of
   Christ. VIII. Because this baptism is an initiatory sacrament, it must
   be frequently repeated; because it is a sacrament of the New Testament,
   it must not be changed, but will continue to the end of the world; and
   because it is a sign confirming the promise, and sealing it, it is
   unwisely asserted that, through it, grace is conferred; that is, by
   some other act of conferring than that which is done through typifying
   and sealing: For grace cannot be immediately conferred by water.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXIV ON THE LORD'S SUPPER

   As in the preceding disputation, we have treated on baptism, the
   sacrament of initiation, it follows that we now discuss the Lord's
   supper, which is the sacrament of confirmation. II. We define it thus:
   The Lord's supper is a sacrament of the New Testament immediately
   instituted by Christ for the use of the church to the end of time, in
   which, by the legitimate external distribution, taking, and enjoyment
   of bread and wine, the Lord's death is announced, and the inward
   receiving and enjoyment of the body and blood of Christ are signified;
   and that most intimate and close union or fellowship, by which we are
   joined to Christ our Head, is sealed and confirmed on account of the
   institution of Christ, and the analogical relation of the sign to the
   thing signified. But by this, believers profess their gratitude and
   obligation to God, communion among themselves, and a marked difference
   from all other persons. III. We constitute Christ the author of this
   sacrament; for he alone is constituted, by the Father, the Lord and
   Head of the church, possessing the right of instituting sacraments, and
   of efficaciously performing this very thing which is signified and
   sealed by the sacraments. IV. The matter is, bread and wine; which,
   with regard to their essence, are not changed, but remain what they
   previously were; neither are they, with regard to place, joined
   together with the body or blood, so that the body is either in, under,
   or with the bread, &c.; nor in the use of the Lord's Supper can the
   bread and wine be separated, that, when the bread is held out to the
   laity, the cup be not denied to them. V. We lay down the form in the
   relation and the most strict union, which exist between the signs and
   the thing signified, and the reference of both to those believers who
   communicate, and by which they are made by analogy and similitude
   something united. From this conjunction of relation, arises a two-fold
   use of signs in this sacrament of the Lord's supper -- the first, that
   these signs are representative -- the second, that, while representing,
   they seal Christ to us with his benefits. VI. The end is two-fold: The
   first is, that our faith should be more and more strengthened towards
   the promise of grace which has been given by God, and concerning the
   truth and certainty of our being engrafted into Christ. The second is,
   (1.) that believers may, by the remembrance of the death of Christ,
   testify their gratitude and obligation to God; (2.) that they may
   cultivate charity among themselves; and (3.) that by this mark they may
   be distinguished from unbelievers.

DISPUTATION LXV ON THE POPISH MASS

   Omitting the various significations of the word "Mass" which may be
   adduced, we consider, on this occasion, that which the papists declare
   to be the external and properly called "expiatory sacrifice," in which
   the sacrificers offer Christ to his Father in behalf of the living and
   the dead, and which they affirm to have been celebrated and instituted
   by Christ himself when he celebrated and instituted his last supper.
   II. First. We say, this sacrifice is falsely ascribed to the
   institution of the Lord's supper; for Christ did not institute a
   sacrifice, but a sacrament, which is apparent from the institution
   itself, in which we are not commanded to offer any thing to God, at
   least nothing external. Yet we grant, that in the Lord's supper, as in
   all acts, is commanded, or ought to exist, that internal sacrifice by
   which believers offer to God prayers, praises and thanksgiving. In this
   view, the Lord's supper is called "the eucharist." III. Secondly. To
   this sacrifice are opposed the nature, truth and excellence of the
   sacrifice of Christ. For, as the sacrifice of Christ is single,
   expiatory, perfect, and of infinite value; and as Christ was once
   offered, and "hath by that one oblation perfected for ever them who
   were once sanctified," as the Scriptures testify, undoubtedly no place
   has been left either for any other sacrifice, or for a repetition of
   this sacrifice of Christ. IV. Thirdly. Besides, it is wrong to suppose
   that Christ can be or ought to be offered by men, or by any other
   person than by himself; for he, alone, is both the victim and the
   priest, as being the only one who is truly "holy, harmless, undefiled,
   and separate from sinners." V. From all these particulars it is
   sufficiently apparent, that it is not necessary, nay, that it is
   impious, for any expiatory sacrifice now to be offered by men for the
   living and the dead. Besides, it is a piece of foolish ignorance, to
   suppose either that the dead require some oblation; or that they can by
   it obtain remission of sins, who have not obtained pardon before death.
   VI. In addition to these three enormous errors committed in the mass,
   with respect to the sacrifice, to the priest, and to those for whom the
   sacrifice is offered, there is a fourth, which is one of the greatest
   turpitude of all, and is committed in conjunction with idolatry -- that
   this very sacrifice is adored by him who offers it, and by those for
   whom it is offered, and is carried about in solemn pomp. COROLLARY In
   these words, "the mass is an expiatory, representative and
   commemorative sacrifice," there is an opposition in the apposition and
   a manifest contradiction,
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXVI ON THE FIVE FALSE SACRAMENTS

   As three things are necessarily required to constitute the essence of a
   sacrament -- that is, divine institution, an outward and visible sign,
   and a promise of the invisible grace which belongs to eternal salvation
   -- it follows that the thing which is deficient in one of these
   requisites, or in which one of them is wanting, cannot come under the
   denomination of a sacrament. II. Therefore popish confirmation is not a
   sacrament, though the external signing of the cross in the forehead of
   the Christian, and the unction of the chrism, are employed; for these
   signs have not been instituted by Christ; neither have they been
   sanctified to typify or to seal any thing of saving grace; nor is
   promised grace annexed to the use or to the reception of these signs.
   III. Penitence, indeed, is an act prescribed, by the Lord, to all who
   have fallen into sin, and has the promise of remission of sins. But
   because there does not exist in it, through the divine command, any
   external sign, by which grace is intimated and sealed, it cannot, on
   this account, receive the appellation of "a sacrament." For the act of
   a priest, absolving a penitent, belongs to the announcement of the
   gospel; as does likewise the injunction of those works which are
   inaccurately styled by the papists satisfactory, that is, fasting,
   prayers, alms, afflicting the soul, &c. IV. That is called extreme
   unction, by the papists, which is bestowed on none except on those who
   are in their last moments; but it has then not the least power or
   virtue; nor was it ever instituted by Christ to signify the premise of
   spiritual grace. It cannot, therefore, obtain the appellation of "a
   sacrament." V. Neither can the order or institution, confirmation or
   inauguration of any person to the official discharge of some
   ecclesiastical duties, come under the denomination of a sacrament --
   both because it belongs to the particular and public vocation of some
   persons in the church, and not to the general vocation of all; and
   because, though it may have been instituted by Christ, yet, whatever
   external signs may be employed in it, they do not belong to the sealing
   of that grace which makes a man agreeable [to God] or which is saving,
   but only to that which is freely given, as they say by way of
   distinction. VI. Though matrimony between a husband and wife agree by a
   certain similitude with the spiritual espousals subsisting between
   Christ and the church; yet it was neither instituted by the Lord for
   signifying this, nor has it any promise of spiritual grace annexed to
   it.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXVII ON THE WORSHIP OF GOD IN GENERAL

   The first part of our duty to God and Christ was, the true meaning
   concerning God and Christ, or true faith in God and Christ; the second
   part is, the right worship to be rendered to both of them. II. This
   part receives various appellations. Among the Hebrews, it is called h r
   w k [ and µ y h w l a t a d y the honour or worship, and the fear of
   God. Among the Greek, it is called Eusebeia piety; Qesebeia godliness,
   or a worshipping of God; Qrhskeia religion; Latreia service rendered to
   God; Douleia religious homage; Qerapeia divine worship; Timh honour;
   Fobov fear; Agaph tou Qeou the love of God. Among the Romans it is
   called, pietas, cultus or cultura dei, veneratio, honos, observantia.
   III. It may be generally defined to be an observance which must be
   yielded to God and Christ from a true faith, a good conscience, and
   from charity unfeigned, according to the will of God which has been
   manifested and made known to us, to the glory of both of them, to the
   salvation of the worshiper, and the edification of others. IV. We
   express the genus by the word "observance," because it contains the
   express intention of our mind and of our will to God and to his will,
   which intention partly inspires life into this portion of our duty
   towards God. V. The object is the same as that of the whole of
   religion, and of the first part of it, which is faith; and this object
   is God and Christ, in which the same formal reasons come under
   consideration, as those which we explained when treating generally on
   religion. VI. In the efficient or the worshiper, whom we declare to be
   a Christian man, we require true faith in God and Christ, a good
   conscience, as having been sanctified and purified through faith by the
   blood and Spirit of Christ, and a sincere charity; for, without these,
   no worship which is rendered to God can be grateful and acceptable to
   him. VII. The matter is, those particular acts in which the worship of
   God consists; but the very will and command of God gives form to it;
   for it is not the will of God to be worshipped at the option of a
   creature, but according to the pleasure and prescript of his own will.
   VIII. The principal end is, the glory of God and Christ. The less
   principal is the salvation of the worshiper, and the edification of
   others, both that they may be won over to Christ, and that, having been
   brought to Christ, they may the more increase and grow in devotedness.
   IX. The form is the observance itself, which is framed from the
   suitable agreement of all these things to the dignity, excellence and
   merits of the object that is to be worshipped -- from such a
   disposition of the worshiper according to such prescript, and from the
   intention of this end. If one of these be wanting the observance is
   vitiated, and is, therefore, displeasing to God. X. Yet the worship
   which is prescribed by God must not, on this account, be omitted,
   though the man, to whom it is prescribed, cannot yet perform it, from
   such a mind, to this end.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXVIII ON THE PRECEPTS OF DIVINE WORSHIP IN GENERAL

   To those who are about to treat on the worship of God, the most
   commodious way and method seems to be this -- to follow the order of
   the commands of God in which this worship is prescribed, and to
   consider all and each of them. For they instruct and inform the
   worshiper, and they prescribe the matter, form and end of the worship.
   II. In the precepts which prescribe the worship of God, three things
   come generally under consideration: (1.) Their foundation, on which
   rest the right and authority of him who commands, and the equity of his
   command. (2.) The command itself. (3.) The sanction, through promises
   and threatenings. The first of these may be called "the preface to the
   command;" the third, "the appendix to it;" and the second is the very
   essence of the precept. III. The foundation or preface, containing the
   authority of Him who commands, and, through this, the equity of the
   precept, is the common foundation of all religion, and, on this
   account, also, it is the foundation of faith; for instance, "I am the
   Lord thy God," &c. "I, the God omnipotent or all sufficient, will be
   thy very great reward." "I am thy God, and the God of thy seed." From
   these expressions, not only may this conclusion be drawn -- "Therefore
   shalt thou love the Lord thy God," "Therefore walk before me, and be
   thou perfect" -- but likewise the following: "Therefore believe thou in
   me." But we must not treat on this subject on this occasion, as it has
   been discussed in the preceding pages. IV. I say that the other two
   are, the precept, and the sanction or appendix of the precept. For we
   must suppose that there are two parts of a precept, the first of which
   requires the performance or the omission of an act, and the second
   demands punishment. But we must consider that the latter part, which is
   called "the appendix," serves for this purpose, that, in the former,
   God enjoys the thing which he desired, dispensing blessings if he
   obtain his desire, and inflicting punishments if he does not obtain it.
   V. With regard to the precepts, before we come to each of them, we must
   first look generally at that which comes under consideration in every
   precept. VI. In the first place, the object of every precept is two-
   fold, the one formal, the other material; or the first formally
   required, the second materially,. Of these, the former is uniform in
   all circumstances and in every precept, but the latter is different or
   distinguishable. VII. The formal object, or that which is formally
   required, is pure obedience itself without respect of the particular
   thing or act in which, or about which, obedience must be performed. And
   we may be allowed to call such obedience "blind," with this exception,
   that it is preceded solely by the knowledge by which a man knows that
   this very thing had been prescribed by God. VIII. The material object,
   or that which is materially required, is the special or particular act
   itself, in the performance or omission of which obedience lies. IX.
   From the formal object, it is deduced that the act in which it is the
   will of God that obedience be yielded to him by its performance, is of
   such a nature that there is something in man which is abhorrent from
   its performance; and that the act, the omission of which is commanded
   by God, is of such a nature that there is something in man which is
   inclined to perform it. If it were otherwise, neither the performance
   of the former, nor the omission of the latter, could be called
   "obedience." X. From these premises, it further follows that the
   performance and the omission of this act proceed from a cause which
   overcomes and restrains the nature of man, that is inclined towards the
   forbidden act, and is abhorrent from that which is prescribed.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXIX ON OBEDIENCE, THE FORMAL OBJECT OF ALL THE DIVINE PRECEPTS

   The obedience which is the formal object of all the divine precepts,
   and which is prescribed in all of them, is properly and adequately
   prescribed to the will conducting itself according to the mode of
   liberty; that is, as it is free, that it may regulate the will
   conducting itself according to the mode of nature, that is, that it may
   regulate the inclination according to the prescribed obedience. II.
   This liberty is either that of contradiction or exercise, or that of
   contrariety or specification. According to the liberty of exercise, the
   will regulates the inclination, that it may perform some act rather
   than abstain from it, or the contrary. According to the liberty of
   specification, the will regulates the inclination, that, by such an
   act, it may tend towards this rather than towards that object. III.
   From this formal object of all precepts, and its relation thus
   considered, arises the first distribution and that a formal one, of all
   the precepts, into those which command, and those which forbid; that
   is, those in which the commission or the omission [of an act] is
   prescribed. IV. A precept which forbids is so binding, as not to allow
   a man to commit what is forbidden. For we must not perpetrate
   wickedness that good may come; yet this is the only reason why we might
   occasionally be allowed to perform what has been forbidden. V. A
   precept which commands is not equally rigidly binding, so as to require
   in every single moment of time the performance of what is commanded;
   for this cannot be done, though the period when man will or will not
   perform it, is not left to his option; but performance of it must be
   administered according to the occasions and exigencies which offer.
   Thus it was not lawful for Daniel to abstain for three days from
   calling upon his God. VI. When a precept which forbids, and one which
   commands, are directly contrary -- whether it be according to the act,
   "Thou shalt love God, and not hate him," "Thou shalt hate the world and
   not love it;" or, whether it be according to the object, "Thou shalt
   love God, and not love the world;" "Thou shalt hate the world, but
   shalt not hate God;" then the transgression of the law which forbids,
   is more grievous than that which commands, because it recedes further
   from obedience, and because the commission of an evil which has been
   forbidden includes in it the omission of a good which has been
   commanded.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXX ON OBEDIENCE TO THE COMMANDS OF GOD IN GENERAL

   Because the yielding of obedience is the duty of an inferior,
   therefore, for the performance of it, humility is requisite. This,
   generally considered, is a quality by which any one becomes ready to
   submit himself to another, to undertake his commands and to execute
   them; and, in this instance, to submit himself to God. II. Obedience
   has respect partly to an internal act, and partly to one that is
   external. The performance of both these is required for entire, true,
   and sincere obedience. For God is a Spirit, and the inspector of
   hearts, who demands the obedience of the whole man, both of the inward
   and the outward man -- obedience from the affections of the heart and
   from the members of the body. The external act without the internal is
   hypocrisy; the internal, without the external, is incomplete, unless
   man be hindered from the performance of the external act without his
   own immediate fault. III. With this, nearly coincides the expression of
   the scholastic divines "to perform a command either according to the
   substance of the act only, or also according to the required quality
   and mode," in which sense, likewise, Luther seems to have uttered that
   expression -- "Adverbs save and damn." IV. The grace and special
   concurrence of God are required for the performance of entire, true,
   and sincere obedience, even for that of the inner man, of the
   affections of the heart, and of a lawful mode. But we allow it to be
   made a subject of discussion, whether revelation, and that assistance
   of God which is called "general," and which is opposed to this special
   aid, and is distinguished from it, be sufficient only to perform the
   external act of the body and the substance of the act. V. Though that
   special grace which moves, excites, impels and urges to obey,
   physically moves the understanding and the inclination of man, so that
   he cannot be otherwise than affected with the perception of it, yet it
   does not effect or elicit the consent except morally, that is, by the
   mode of suasion, and by the intervention of the free volition of man,
   which free volition not only excludes coaction, but likewise all
   antecedent necessity and determination. VI. But that special
   concurrence or assistance of grace, which is also called "co-operating
   and accompanying grace" differs neither in kind nor efficacy from that
   exciting and moving grace which is called preventing and operating, but
   it is the same grace continued. It is styled "co-operating" or
   "concomitant," only on account of the concurrence of the human will
   which operating and preventing grace has elicited from the will of man.
   This concurrence is not denied to him to whom exciting grace is
   applied, unless the man offers resistance to the grace exciting. VII.
   From these premises, we conclude that a regenerated man is capable of
   performing more good than he actually performs, and can omit more evil
   than he omits; and, therefore, that neither in the sense in which it is
   received by St. Augustine, nor in that in which some of our divines
   understand it, is efficacious grace necessary for the performance of
   obedience -- a circumstance which is highly agreeable with the doctrine
   of St. Augustine. COROLLARY Coaction only circumscribes the liberty of
   an agent, it does not destroy or take it away; and such circumscription
   is not made, except through the medium or intervention of the natural
   inclination; the natural inclination, therefore, is more opposed to
   liberty than coaction is.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXI ON THE MATERIAL OBJECT OF THE PRECEPTS OF THE LAW IN GENERAL

   As mere obedience, considered in the abstract, is the formal object of
   all the precepts of the divine law, so the acts in which the obedience
   that must be performed is prescribed, are the material objects of the
   same precepts. II. For this reason, these acts will at length be said
   to be conformable to law, and performed according to law, when
   obedience has given form to them; that when they have been performed
   from obedience, or through the intention and desire of obeying. This
   desire to obey is necessarily preceded by a certain knowledge that
   those acts have been prescribed by God, according to this expression of
   the apostle: "Whatsoever is not of faith, is sin." III. Hence, it is
   apparent that a good intention does not suffice to justify an act,
   unless it be preceded by a command of God and a knowledge of such
   command; though, without a good intention, no act, even when commanded
   by God, can of itself be pleasing to him. But it is our wish that,
   under the term "actions," omission is also understood to be
   comprehended. IV. A good work, therefore, universally requires these
   conditions: (1.) That it be prescribed by God. (2.) That man certainly
   knows it to have been commanded by God. (3.) That it be performed with
   the intention and desire of obeying God, which cannot be done without
   faith in God. To these ought to be added a special condition, which
   belongs to Christ and to his gospel -- that it be done through faith in
   Christ, because no work is agreeable to God after the commission of sin
   in a state of grace, except in Christ, and through faith in him. V. But
   the acts which are prescribed in the law, are either of themselves and
   in their own nature indifferent; or they have in them. something why
   they are pleasing or displeasing to God -- why they are prescribed by
   him or forbidden. The law, which prescribes the former of these, [the
   indifferent acts,] is called "positive," "symbolical," and
   "ceremonial." That which prescribes the latter is styled "the moral
   law" and "the decalogue;" it is also called "the law of nature." On
   these last, we shall afterwards treat at greater length. VI. The
   material acts, in which obedience is prescribed to be performed by the
   moral law, are either general, and belonging to the observance of the
   whole law and of all and each of its precepts; or they are special, and
   peculiarly prescribed in each of the precepts of the decalogue. VII.
   The general acts are the love, honour and fear of God, and trust in
   him. The special acts will be treated in the particular explanation of
   each of the precepts.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXII THE LOVE, FEAR, TRUST, AND honour WHICH ARE DUE FROM MAN TO
GOD

   These general acts may be considered either in the first act or in the
   second. In the first, they come under the denomination of affections;
   in the second, they retain to themselves the appropriate name of acts.
   But in consequence of the close union and agreement of nature between
   an affection and a second act, love, fear, trust and honour, receive
   the same denomination of "an affection," and "an act." II. The love of
   God is a dutiful act of man, by which he knowingly and willingly
   prefers, before all other things, the union of himself with God and
   obedience to the divine law, to which is subjoined a hatred of
   separation and of disobedience. III. The fear of God is a dutiful act
   of man, by which he knowingly and willingly dreads before all things
   and avoids the displeasing of God, (which is placed in the
   transgression of his commands,) his wrath and reprehension and any
   [sinister] inauspicious estimation of him lest he be separated from
   God. IV. Trust in God is a dutiful act of man, by which he knowingly
   and willingly reposes on God alone, assuredly hoping for and expecting
   from him all things which are salutary or saving to himself; in which
   we also comprehend the removal of evils. V. The honour of God is a
   dutiful act of man, by which he knowingly and willingly repays to God
   the reward due for his excellent virtues and acts. VI. The primary
   object of all these acts, as they are prescribed by law and are man's
   duty, is God himself; because, for whatever other things these acts are
   to be performed, they must be performed on account of God and through
   his command, otherwise no one can truly call them "good." VII. The
   formal reason of the object, that is, why these acts may and ought to
   be performed to God, is, the wisdom, goodness, justice, and power of
   God, and the acts performed by him according to and through them. But
   we permit this to be made the subject of a pious discussion, Which of
   these, in requiring simple acts, obtain the precedence, and which of
   them follow? VIII. The immediate cause of these acts is man, according
   to his understanding and inclination, and the freedom of his will, not
   as man is, natural, but as he is spiritual, and formed again after the
   life of God. IX. The principal cause is the Holy Spirit, who infuses
   into man, by the act of regeneration, the affections of love, fear,
   trust, and honour; by exciting grace, excites, moves and incites him to
   second acts, and by co-operating grace, concurs with man himself to
   produce such second acts. X. The form of these acts is that they be
   done through faith, and according to the law of God. Their end is, that
   they be performed to the salvation of the workers themselves, to the
   glory of God, and to the benefit and confirmation of others.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXIII ON PARTICULAR ACTS OF OBEDIENCE, OR THOSE WHICH ARE
PRESCRIBED IN EACH PRECEPT, OR CONCERNING THE DECALOGUE IN GENERAL

   The special acts of obedience are prescribed in the decalogue, and in
   each of the commandments. The decalogue, therefore, itself, must be
   considered by us in order. II. A convenient distribution of the
   decalogue is that into a preface and precepts. The preface is contained
   in these words: "I am the Lord thy God, who have brought thee up from
   the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." For we are of opinion
   that this preface belongs to the entire decalogue, rather than to the
   first commandment; though we do not consider it advisable to contend
   about a matter so small and unimportant. III. The preface contains a
   general argument of suasion, why the children of Israel ought to yield
   obedience to Jehovah -- and this two-fold -- the first drawn from the
   right of confederation or covenant -- the second, from a particular and
   signal benefit recently conferred on him. The former of these is
   contained in the words, "the Lord thy God;" the latter, in the
   expression, "who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt," of which
   benefit a high commendation is given in the description which is added
   -- that Egypt was to the Israelites "the house of bondage" that by
   amplifying the misery of that servitude, they might be able to call to
   mind those things which had happened to them. IV. Though this argument,
   "thy God," may likewise have respect to creation, and may comprise that
   benefit, yet it is more probable that it has a special reference to the
   concluding of a covenant with this people. V. From this preface, may
   conveniently be deduced those general acts about which we have treated
   in the preceding disputation -- the love, fear, trust, and honour of
   God; for, as Jehovah is their God, who delivered them out of Egypt,
   therefore, most justly, as well as profitably, must he be loved, feared
   and honoured, and trust must be reposed in him. VI. But some things
   generally must be observed for the correct performance of all the
   precepts together. Such are, VII. The law of God requires the entire
   obedience of the mouth, heart and work, that is, inward and outward
   obedience -- for God is the God of the whole man, of the soul and body,
   and looks principally upon the heart. VIII. The explanation of the
   precepts of the decalogue must be sought from Moses and the prophets,
   from Christ and his apostles; and it may be procured in sufficient
   abundance, so that nothing necessary can be imagined, which may not be
   drawn from the writings of the Old and the New Testament. IX. The
   meaning of each precept must be taken from the end on account of which
   it was given; and all those things must be considered as included in
   it, without which the precept cannot be performed. Therefore, one and
   the same work may be referred to different precepts, so far as it has
   respect to different ends. X. In affirmation, its opposite negative
   seems to be comprised; and, in a negative, the affirmation which is
   opposed to it; because God not only requires a refraining from evil,
   but likewise a performance of good, though a reason may be given why
   God declared some things negatively, and others affirmatively. XI.
   Homogeneous and cognate acts are commanded or are forbidden in the same
   precept; and a genus comprehends its species; and a species comprises,
   in the same command, other species allied to it, unless a just law
   exists why it must be otherwise determined. XII. An effect in its
   cause, or a cause in its effect, (if the conversion be necessary and
   according to nature,) is not commanded and prohibited through accident.
   XIII. When of those things which have a relation to each other, one is
   prescribed or forbidden, the other is also commanded or forbidden,
   because they mutually lay themselves down and remove themselves. XIV.
   If it happen that the observance of two precepts cannot be paid at the
   same time to both of them, regard must be had to that which is of the
   greater moment, and for the performance of which more and juster causes
   exist.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXIV ON THE FIRST COMMAND IN THE DECALOGUE

   The ten precepts of the decalogue are conveniently distributed into
   those of the first and those of the second table. To the first table
   are attributed those precepts which immediately prescribe our duty
   towards God himself; of this kind, there are four. The second table
   claims those precepts which contain the duties of men towards their
   fellow-men; and to it are attributed the last six. II. This is the
   relation which subsists between the commands of each table -- that,
   from love to God and in reference to him, we manifest love, and the
   offices of love towards our neighbour; and if it should happen that we
   must of necessity relinquish either our duty to God or our neighbour,
   God should be preferred to our neighbour. Let this relation, however,
   be understood as concerning those precepts only which are not of the
   ceremonial worship; otherwise, [respecting ceremonies] this declaration
   holds good: "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice." III. The first
   commandment is, "Thou shalt have no other god before my face," or
   "against my face." IV. It is very certain that, in this negative
   precept, the subjoined affirmative one is included or presupposed as
   something preceding and prerequisite: "Thou shalt have me, who am
   Jehovah, for thy God." This is likewise immediately consequent upon the
   preface, "I am the Lord thy God;" therefore, "Let me be the Lord thy
   God;" or, which is the same, "Therefore, have thou me, the Lord, for
   thy God." V. But "to have the Lord for our God, is the part both of the
   understanding and of the inclination or the will; and, lastly, of an
   effect proceeding from both or from each of them. VI. "Another god" is
   whatever the human mind invents, to which it attributes the divinity
   that is suitable and appropriate to the true God alone -- whether such
   divinity be essence and life, or properties, works, or glory. VII. Or
   whether the thing to which man attributes divinity be something
   existing or created, or whether it be something non-existent and merely
   imaginary and a figment of the brain, it is equally "another god" for
   the entire divinity of that other god lies radically, essentially and
   virtually in human ascription, and by no means in that to which such
   divinity is ascribed. Hence is the origin of this phrase, in Scripture,
   "To go a whoring after their own heart." VIII. But this "other God" may
   be conceived under a three- fold difference, according to the
   Scriptures. For those who have him, have (1.) either themselves been
   the first inventors of him, (2.) have received him from their parents,
   or (3.) from other nations, when neither they nor their fathers knew
   him; and this last is done either by force, by persuasion, or by the
   free and spontaneous choice of the will. IX. For this reason, that
   "other god" is truly called "an idol;" and the act by which he is
   accounted another god, is idolatry; whether this be committed in the
   mind, by estimation, acknowledgment, and belief, or by the affections,
   love, fear, trust and hope, or by some external effect of honour,
   worship, adoration and invocation. X. The enormity of this sin is
   apparent from the fact of its being called "a defection from God," "a
   forsaking of the living fountain," and "a digging of broken cisterns
   that hold no water," "a perfidious desertion of holy matrimony," and "a
   violation of the connubial compact." Nay, the gentiles are said to
   sacrifice to devils whatsoever they suppose that they offer to God, in
   this ignorance of God and alienation from the life of God. XI. The
   cause why men are said to do service unto devils, although they have
   themselves other thoughts, is this: because Satan is the fountain head,
   and origin of all idolatry; and is the author, persuader, impeller,
   approver and defender of all the worship which is expended on another
   god. Hence, likewise, it is the highest degree of idolatry when any one
   accounts divine or ascribes divinity to Satan as Satan, displaying
   himself as Satan and vaunting himself for God. XII. But though the
   gentiles worshipped angels or devils, not as the supreme God, but as
   minor deities and his ministers, by whose intervention they might have
   communication with the supreme God; yet the worship which they paid to
   them was idolatry, because this worship was due to no one except to the
   true God. But it does not belong to the definition of idolatry, that
   any one should pay to another, as to God, that worship which is due to
   the true God alone; for it is sufficient if he account him as God, by
   ascribing divine worship to him, though, in his mind, he may account
   him not to be the supreme God. It is no palliation of the crime, but an
   aggravation, if any one knowingly performs divine worship to him whom
   he knows not to be God. XIII. And since Christ must be honoured as the
   Father is, because he has been constituted by his Father KING and LORD,
   and has received all judgment, since every knee must bow to him, and
   since he is to be invoked as Mediator and the Head of his church, so
   that the church can pay this honour to no one except him, without
   incurring the crime of idolatry; therefore, the papists, who adore
   Mary, the angels, or holy men, and who invoke them as the donors and
   administrators of gifts, or as intercessors through their own merits,
   are guilty of the crime of idolatry. XIV. Besides, when they adore the
   bread in the Lord's supper, and receive and account the pope for that
   personage whom he boasts himself to be, they commit the sin of
   idolatry.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXV ON THE SECOND COMMAND IN THE DECALOGUE

   The second precept consists of a command and its sanction, from a
   description of God, who is prompt and powerful to punish the
   transgressor, and who is greatly inclined to bless him that is
   obedient. In this are consequently included a threat of punishment and
   a promise of reward. II. This command is negative: A deed which is
   displeasing to God is forbidden in these words: "Thou shalt not make
   unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in the
   earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; thou shalt not
   bow down thyself to them, nor serve them." III. The sum of the precept
   is, that no one should adore or offer divine worship to any sculptured,
   molten or painted image, or one made in any other way, whether it has
   for its archetype a thing really existing or something fictitious, God
   or a creature, or whether it resemble its archetype according to some
   real conformity, or only by institution and opinion, or, which is the
   same thing, that he do not in or to any image adore or worship that
   which he considers in the place of a deity and worships as such,
   whether this be truly or falsely. IV. As, from a comparison of this
   precept, with other passages of Scripture in which God commands certain
   images to be made, it appears that the mere formation of every kind of
   image whatsoever is not forbidden, provided that they be not
   prostituted to worship; so, from a comparison of this same precept with
   others which are analogous to it or collateral, it is evident that no
   image ought to be made to represent God, because this very act is
   nothing else but a changing of the glory of the incorruptible God into
   the image or likeness of a corruptible thing. For whatever can be
   fashioned or framed is visible, therefore corruptible. We are not
   afraid of making this general affirmation under the sanction of the
   Scriptures, though with them and from them we know, that now, according
   to the body, Christ is incorruptible. V. A double distinction is here
   employed by the papists, of an archetype and its image; and also of an
   image itself as it is formed of such materials, and as it is an image,
   that is, calculated and fitted to represent the archetype. From these,
   they further deduce the distinction of the intention in worshipping; by
   which the worshiper looks upon either the archetype alone, not its
   image; or, if he even looks on the image, does not behold it as it is
   made of such materials, neither on it principally, but in reference to
   its archetype. We do not attempt to deny that the mind of man can frame
   a distinction of this kind. VI. But when those who fall down before an
   image attempt, by such a distinction, to excuse themselves from the
   transgression of this precept, they accuse God himself of a falsehood,
   and deride his command. (1.) They charge him with falsehood; because,
   when God declares that he who falls down before an image, says to the
   wood and to the stone, "Thou art my Father!" they assert, that the
   prostrated person does not say this to the wood and the stone, but to
   their archetype, that is, to God. (2.) They mock God and his command;
   because by this distinction it comes to pass, that no man at any time,
   though paying adoration to any kind of images, can be brought in guilty
   of having violated this precept, unless, according to his own opinion,
   he has judged that wood really to be God, and therefore that he has
   himself truly and in reality formed a god, which cannot possibly enter
   into the conception of one who uses his reason. VII. But they partly
   annihilate their own excuse which rests on this distinction, when they
   say that the same honour and worship (whether it be that of latria, of
   dulia, or of hyperdulia,) must be given to an image as to its
   archetype. Neither does this prolong its existence by such distinction,
   when they represent God himself by an image, because that is simply
   forbidden to be done. VIII. We assert, therefore, that, according to
   the judgment of God, and express passages of Scripture, the papists are
   correctly charged with giving a portraiture of the essence of God, when
   they represent him in the form of an old man, graced with an ample gray
   beard, and seated on a throne -- though in express words they say, that
   they know God has not a body, and though they protest that they had
   fashioned this form, not for the purpose of representing his essence,
   but that they had instituted this similitude to represent the
   appearance which he occasionally made to his prophets, and to signify
   his presence. For the protestation is contrary to facts; since facts
   are, by nature, not what we feign them to be, but what God, the
   legislator, declares them to be. But he says those facts are, that he
   has been assimilated, that a [supposed] likeness of himself has been
   formed, and that he has been [falsely] set up in a gold or silver
   graven image. IX. We assert that all those images of which we have
   spoken - - both those of God, placed only for representation, and those
   of other things (whether true or fictitious,) exposed for adoration --
   are correctly called "idols," not only according to the etymology of
   the word, but likewise according to the usage of the Scriptures, and
   that the distinction which is employed by the papists between idols and
   resemblances or images has been produced from the dark cave of horrid
   idolatry. X. In the same precept in which it is forbidden to fashion or
   make any images for divine worship, it is likewise commanded to remove
   others, if they have been previously made and exposed for worship,
   these two cautions being always observed, (1.) That it be done, when
   preceded by a suitable and sufficient teaching. (2.) That it be the
   work of those who are in possession of the supreme authority in the
   commonwealth and the church. XI. Though the honour exhibited to such
   images, or to the deity through such images, be reproachful to the true
   God himself; yet he, also, who pours contumely on the images which he
   considers to be correctly formed, and lawfully proposed for worship,
   pours contumely on the deity himself, whom he presumes to worship, and
   declares himself to be an atheist. XII. The affirmation seems here to
   be strictly and directly opposed to the whole negative precept, that we
   may worship God, because he is a Spirit, with a pure cogitation of mind
   and abstracted from every imagination. XIII. The sanction of the
   precept, which includes the threatening, is this: "For I, the Lord thy
   God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
   children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;"
   that is, unless you obey this, my precept, you shall feel that I am
   jealous of mine honour, and that I will not, with impunity, suffer it
   to be given to another, or my glory to be communicated to graven
   images. XIV. The other part of the sanction contains a promise in these
   words: "I am the Lord thy God, showing mercy unto thousands of them
   that love me and keep my commandments;" [That is, if you obey this my
   precept, you shall feel that I will display mercy towards you, and
   towards your children to the thousandth generation, provided that they
   also love me.] XV. But mention is made of posterity, that men may be
   thus the more incited to obedience, since their future compliance with
   the precept will prove beneficial, not only to themselves, but to their
   posterity, or their future transgression will be injurious to them and
   their offspring. XVI. From a comparison of the preceding command with
   this, it appears that there is a two-fold idolatry -- one, by which a
   false and fictitious deity is worshipped; another, by which a true or
   false deity is worshipped in an image, by an image, or at an image. Yet
   this very image is sometimes called "a false and another god," which
   the Lord God also seems to intimate in this place, when he endeavours
   to deter men from a violation of this precept by an argument drawn from
   his jealousy. COROLLARY Without any exaggeration, the idolatry of the
   papists may be placed on an equality with that of the Jews and
   gentiles. If it be urged as an exception, that they have neither made
   their children pass through the fire, nor have offered living men in
   sacrifice -- we reply, The horrid tyranny which the papists have
   exercised in the murder of so many thousand martyrs, with the design of
   confirming the idolatry that flourishes among them, may be equitably
   compared to making their children pass through the fire, and the
   oblation of living men in sacrifice, if not according to the appearance
   of the deed, at least according to the grievous nature of the crime.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXVI ON THE THIRD PRECEPT OF THE DECALOGUE

   This precept, as well as its predecessor, consists of a command, and of
   its sanction through the threatening of a punishment. The precept is a
   negative one, and prohibits a deed which is displeasing to God, in
   these words: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
   vain." II. The reason, and end of the precept is this: Because God is
   entirely holy, and because his name is full of majesty, we must use it
   in a holy and reverend manner, and must, by no means, account it common
   or contaminate it. III. "The name of God" is here received in its most
   general notion, for every word which, according to the purpose God, is
   used to signify God and divine things. IV. "To assume" or "to take the
   name of God," properly, to take that word into our mouth and pronounce
   it with our tongue. If, under this phrase, any one, by a synecdoche, is
   desirous, likewise, of comprehending the deeds, in which God and divine
   things are less religiously treated, he has our full permission; and,
   we think, he does not depart from the sense of the precept. But we
   still continue in the explanation of the proper acceptation. V. The
   particle, "in vain," is variously received -- for that which is done
   rashly and without just cause -- for what is done in vain and with no
   useful end -- for what is done with mendacity, dissimulation, falsely,
   inadvertently, &c. Hence, this prohibition likewise diffuses itself
   extensively in every direction. VI. But, perhaps with some propriety,
   every "taking of the name of the Lord in vain" may be reduced to two
   principal heads or kinds: The First genus comprehends the use of the
   name of God when no mention of it, whatever, should be made; that is,
   in a word or deed, in which, it has been the will of God that the
   mention of his name shall not intervene, either because the word or
   deed is not lawful, or because it is of minor moment. VII. But the
   Second genus comprises the incorrect use of the name of God; that is,
   when it is not truly used in any of our duties in which it may be
   lawfully used, or in which it ought also to be dutifully used according
   to the divine direction. VIII. The duties of this class are, the
   adoration and invocation of God, the narration and preaching of his
   word or of divine things, oaths, &c. in these, the name of God is taken
   in vain, in three ways: (1.) Hypocritically, when it is not used
   sincerely from the whole heart. (2.) With a doubting conscience, when
   it is used with an uncertain belief that it is lawful to be used in
   that duty. (3.) Against conscience, as when it is employed to bear
   testimony to a falsehood. IX. The threatening is expressed in these
   words: "For the Lord will not leave him unpunished that taketh his name
   in vain." By this he endeavours to persuade men, that no one should
   dare to use his name; of which persuasion there is so much the greater
   necessity, as the heinousness of this offense is not sufficiently
   considered among men.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXVII ON THE FOURTH COMMAND IN THE DECALOGUE

   This precept contains two parts, a command and a reason for it. But the
   command is first proposed in few words; it is afterwards more amply
   explained. The proposition is in these words: "Remember the Sabbath
   day, to keep it holy." The explanation is thus expressed: "Six days
   shalt thou labour, and do all thy work," &c. But the reason is
   comprehended in the following words: "For in six days the Lord made
   heaven and earth, the seas," &c. II. In the proposition of the precept,
   three things are worthy of observation: (1.) The act prescribed, which
   is sanctification. (2.) An anxious and solicitous care about not
   omitting this act, which is expressed in the words, "remember," and "do
   not forget." (3.) The object, which is called "the Sabbath," or "the
   seventh day;" that is, the seventh in the order of the days in which
   the creation was commenced and perfected. It is also called "the
   Sabbath," from the circumstance of God having rested at that period,
   and man was required to repose. III. The explanation contains two
   things: (1.) A concession or grant, that men may spend six days in
   labours belonging to the natural life and its sustenance; this
   concession contains the equity of the command. (2.) A command about
   resting from those works on the seventh day, with an enumeration of the
   persons whose duty it is to rest: "Not only thou, but also thy son, thy
   man servant, thy maid servant, thy cattle, and thy stranger shall
   rest;" that is, thou shalt cause as many persons to rest as are under
   thy power. IV. The reason contains, in itself, two arguments: The First
   is the example of God himself, who rested from his works on the seventh
   day. The Second is the benediction and sanctification of God, by which
   it was his pleasure that the seventh should be separated from the rest
   of the days, and devoted to himself and to his worship. V. "To sanctify
   the seventh day," is to separate it from common use, and from such as
   belong to the natural life, and to consecrate it to God, and to acts
   which belong to God, to things divine, and to the spiritual life. This
   sanctification consists of various acts. VI. We think that it may be
   made a most useful point of consideration, how far must abstinence from
   those works which belong to the natural life be extended? And though we
   prescribe nothing absolutely, yet we should wish that the liberty of
   performing such labour should be restricted as much as possible, and
   confined to exceedingly few necessary things. For we have no doubt that
   the Sabbath is in various ways violated among Christians, by not
   abstaining from such things as are lawful to be done on other days.
   VII. We think that the acts which belong to the sanctification of the
   Sabbath may be included in two classes: (1.) Some per se and primarily
   belong to the worship of God, and are in themselves grateful and
   acceptable to God. (2.) Others are subordinate to those acts which are
   to be performed, and they answer the purpose, that those acts may, in
   the best possible manner, be performed to God by men; such are those
   which belong to the instruction of believers in their duty. VIII. But
   this kind of sanctification ought not only to be private and domestic,
   but also public and ecclesiastical. For it is the will of God, not only
   that he should be acknowledged, worshipped, invoked and praised by each
   individual in private, but likewise by all united together in the great
   church; that he may, by this means, be owned to be the God and Lord not
   only of each individual, but likewise of the whole of his universal
   family. IX. But because the neglect of God and of things divine easily
   creeps upon man, who is too closely intent on this natural life, it
   was, therefore, necessary that men's memories should be refreshed by
   this word "Remember," &c. X. But now, with regard to the seventh day,
   which is commanded to be sanctified. In it, this is moral and perpetual
   -- that the seventh day, that is, one out of the seven, be devoted to
   divine worship, and that it be unlawful for any man, at any time, after
   having expended six days in the labours of the natural life, to
   continue the seventh day in all the same labours, or in the same
   manner. XI. But with regard to that day among the seven which followed
   the six days in which God completed the creation, its sanctification is
   not of perpetual institution and necessity; but it might be changed
   into another day, and in its own time it was lawful for it to be
   changed, that is, into the day which is called "the Lord's day;"
   because the new creation was then perfected in Christ our head, by his
   resurrection from the dead; and it was equitable and right that the new
   people should enter on a new method of keeping the Sabbath. XII. That
   reason which was taken from the example of God who rested on the
   seventh day, (that is, when the creation was completed,) endured to the
   time of the new creation; and, therefore, when it ceased, or at least
   when a second reason was added to it from the new creation, it was no
   subject of wonder that the apostles changed it into the following day,
   on which the resurrection of Christ occurred. For when Christ no longer
   walks in the flesh, and is not known after the flesh, all things become
   new. XIII. But the benediction and the sanctification of God are
   understood to be transferred from the Sabbath to the Lord's day;
   because all the sanctification which pertains to the new earth, is
   perfected in Jesus Christ, who is truly the Holy of holies, and in whom
   all things are sanctified for ever. XIV. Because the reason, by which
   God afterwards persuaded the people to observe the Sabbath, was for a
   sign between him and His people that God would engage in the act of
   sanctifying them; it may likewise be accommodated to the times of the
   New Testament, and may persuade men to the observance of the [new]
   Sabbath. XV. If any one supposes that the Lord's day is by no means to
   be distinguished from the rest of the days [of the week]; or if, for
   the sake of declaring evangelical liberty, this person has changed it
   into another day, either into Monday or Tuesday; we think he ought at
   least to be considered a schismatic in the church of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXVIII ON THE FIFTH COMMAND IN THE DECALOGUE

   I. This precept is the first of the second table. It contains the
   precept itself, and the promise attached to it. The end of the precept
   is, that a certain order should exist among men, according to which
   some are superiors and others inferiors, and which consists in the
   mutual performance of the duties of commanding and obeying that are
   necessary for the defense of society. II. The precept prescribes an
   act, and adds an object to which that act must be performed. The act is
   contained in the word "honour;" the object in these words: "thy father
   and thy mother." From this, it appears, according to the nature of
   relations, that this law is prescribed to all those who are relatively
   opposed to father and mother [as are sons and daughters]. III. The word
   "honour" is not appropriately employed to signify eminence; for honour
   is the reward of excellence, and its performance is a sign of
   recognition; and this word comprehends, either in the wide compass of
   its signification, all the duties which are due from an inferior to a
   superior; or, as an end, it comprehends all things necessary to the
   rendering of such honour. IV. Three things principally are contained in
   this word: (1.) That reverence be shown to the persons of our parents.
   (2.) That obedience be performed to their commands. (3.) That gratitude
   be evinced, in conferring on them all things necessary to the
   preservation of the present life, with respect to the dignity of their
   persons and of their office. V. Reverence consists both in the
   performance of those acts which contain, [on our part] a confession of
   their pre- eminence and of our submission under them, and in the
   endurance of their faults and manners, in a connivance at them, in a
   modest concealment of them, and in kind excuses for them. VI. Obedience
   lies in the prompt and free performance of those things which they
   prescribe, and in the omission of those which they prohibit. This
   obedience must be performed not only "for wrath," or the fear of
   punishment, but also "for conscience' sake," and this, not so much that
   we may obey them, as God himself, whose vicegerents they are. VII.
   Gratitude, which contains the conferring of things necessary for them
   to the uses of life according to their dignity, ought to extend itself
   not only to the time when they discharge this duty, but likewise
   through the whole life -- though it may happen that, through old age or
   some other cause, they are rendered unfit to discharge the parental
   office. VIII. The duties of superiors are analogous to those of
   inferiors -- that they conduct themselves with moderation, seriousness,
   and decorum, in the whole of their life, public as well as private --
   that they observe justice and equity in issuing their commands, and
   that, in requiring gratitude, they do not transgress the bounds of
   moderation. But these points will be more particularly discussed in the
   disputation on the magistracy. IX. The object is enunciated in the
   words "father," and "mother," in which, likewise, are comprehended all
   those who are placed above us in human society, whether it be
   political, ecclesiastical, scholastic or domestic society -- whether in
   the time of peace or in that of war -- whether such persons discharge
   the duties of an ordinary or an extraordinary office, or whether they
   be invested with this power either constantly, or only for a season,
   however short. X. But all these persons in authority are, in this
   commandment, fitly, and not without just cause, expressed under the
   name of "parents," which is an endearing and delightful appellation,
   and most appropriate both to signify the feeling which it is right for
   superiors to indulge towards inferiors, and most efficaciously to
   effect a persuasion in inferiors of the equity of performing their duty
   towards their superiors. It may be added that the first association
   among men is that of domestic society, and from this follow the rest by
   the increase of mankind. XI. Superiors lose no degree of this eminence
   by any sin, or by any corruption of their own; therefore, this duty of
   honour, reverence, obedience and gratitude must be performed to
   superiors, even when they are evil, and abusing their power; provided
   caution be used that the interest of God be always the more powerful
   with us, and lest, while that which is Caesar's is given to Caesar,
   that which belongs to God, be taken from him, or be not given. XII. To
   this, must necessarily be subjoined another threefold caution -- (l.)
   That no one commit an error in judgment, by which he persuades himself
   this or that belongs to God, and not to Caesar. (2.) That he discern
   correctly between that which he is commanded to do or to tolerate; and,
   if he must do it, whether or not it be an act about a thing or object
   which is subject to his power. (3.) That under the name of liberty, no
   one arrogate to himself the right of a superior, of not obeying in this
   thing or that, or the power of rising against his superior, either for
   the purpose of taking away his life, or only his rule and dominion.
   XIII. The promise which is added to this precept is contained in the
   following words: "that thy days maybe long upon the land which the Lord
   thy God will give thee" in which are promised, (1,) to the Jewish
   believers who perform this precept, length of days in the land of
   Canaan; (2,) and also to the gentile believers who perform this
   command, the duration of the present life; (3,) typically, to such
   persons are promised the eternal or heavenly life, of which the land of
   Canaan was a type.
     __________________________________________________________________

DISPUTATION LXXIX ON THE SIXTH PRECEPT

   Order in human society being appointed by the fifth commandment,
   through the mutual duties of superiors and inferiors in commanding and
   obeying, God now manifests his care for all those things which, in
   order to pass one's life in this society, are necessary for the life of
   each person, for the propagation of the species, for the blessings
   necessary to life, and for reputation, at the end of which God adds the
   tenth commandment, in which the coveting of certain things is
   prohibited. II. By these words, "thou shalt not kill," the sixth
   precept provides for the preservation of the natural life, and designs
   the safety of men's bodies that it may be preserved inviolate. III. The
   sum of the precept is neither in reality to injure the life of another
   person, and to endanger his safety, nay not even our own, whether we
   use fraud or violence, nor to wish his injury by our will, to which
   must be added that we do not intimate this kind of wish by any external
   token. IV. From this, it appears that the accident must not receive the
   appellation of "homicide," if, as the Scripture phrase is, any one
   going into a wood with his neighbour to cut down timber, and the head
   of his ax slips from the handle and strikes his neighbour so that he
   dies, nor, if, for the defense of his own life, any one be compelled,
   at the peril of his life, to repel the force employed against him by
   another. V. But in this precept, we are commanded to endeavour by all
   legitimate means and methods, to save the life of our neighbour, as
   well as our own, and to defend them from all injury. VI. But the cause
   of this precept, which is universal and always, and in every place,
   valid, is the following: because man was created after the image of
   God, which, in this place, principally denotes immortality. To this,
   may be added similitude of nature, and because all of us derive our
   origin from one blood. But several particular causes may be adduced,
   which agree with the spiritual state of men, such as because they have
   been redeemed by Christ with a price -- because their bodies are a
   habitation for the Holy Spirit -- because they are all members of one
   mystical body under one head, &c. VII. But, in the mean time, God
   reserves to himself the right of disposing of the life of every man
   according to his own pleasure. Hence, commands have been issued to
   magistrates concerning killing transgressors, and a command was
   delivered to Abraham about slaying his son.

  DEDICATION.

   TO THE MOST HONOUR ABLE AND NOBLE WILLIAM BARDESIUS, LIEUTENANT OF
   WARMENHUYSEN, A NOBLEMAN WHO IS OUR PATRON, AND WHO, ON MANY ACCOUNTS,
   IS TO BE HONOUR ED BY US. MOST HONOUR ABLE AND NOBLE SIR:

   THAT expression of the apostle Paul, by which he designates the
   doctrine of the gospel as "the truth which is according to godliness,"
   (Tit. i. 1) is very remarkable and worthy of perpetual consideration.
   From this sentiment, with the leave of all good men, we may collect
   that this "truth" neither consists in naked theory and inane
   speculation, nor in those things which, belonging to mere abstract
   knowledge, only play about the brain of man, and which never extend to
   the reformation of their will and affections. But it consists in those
   things which imbue the mind with a sincere fear of God, and with a true
   love of solid piety, and which render men "zealous of good works."
   Another passage, not less famous and remarkable, in the same epistle
   and by the same apostle, tends greatly to confirm and illustrate this
   view of the matter; it is thus expressed: "For the grace of God that
   bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and
   godly in this present world." (Tit. ii. 11,19.) Whosoever they be,
   therefore, that profess themselves the heralds of this divine "truth,"
   they ought to give additional diligence that, casting aside all curious
   and thorny questions, and those idle subtilities which derive their
   origin from human vanity, they commend to their hearers this one and
   only "godliness," and that they seriously instruct them in faith, hope
   and charity. And, in return, those of their auditors who are enamored
   with this "truth," are bound strenuously to conform themselves to this
   course of conduct--to pass by and to slight all other things which may
   come across their path, and constantly to aim at this "godliness"
   alone, and keep their eyes intent upon it. For both clergy and laity
   may receive this as a principle, that they are yet rude and complete
   strangers in true theology, unless they have learned so to theologize,
   that theology may bear the torch before them to that piety and holiness
   which they sedulously and earnestly pursue. If this admonition ever was
   necessary, it is undoubtedly the more necessary at this time; because
   we see impiety overflowing in every direction, like a sea raging and
   agitated by whirlwinds. Yet, amidst all this storm, such are the stupor
   and insensibility of men, that not a few who remain exactly the same
   persons as they formerly were, and who, indeed, have not changed the
   least particle of the manner of their impure life, still imagine
   themselves to be in the class of prime Christians, and promise
   themselves the favour of the supreme God, the possessing of heaven and
   of life eternal, and of the company of Christ and of the blessed
   angels, with such great and presumptuous confidence, and with such
   security of mind, that they consider themselves to be atrociously
   injured by those who, judging them to be deceived in this their
   self-persuasion, desire them in any wise to entertain doubts about it.
   In a condition of affairs thus deplorable, no endeavour appears to be
   more laudable, than to institute a diligent inquiry into the causes of
   such a pernicious evil, and, by employing a saving remedy, to arouse
   erring souls from this diabolical lethargy, and induce them to alter
   their lives, under the felicitous auspices of the gospel and the Spirit
   of Christ, to devote their energies to a solid amendment of manners,
   and thus, at length, from the divine word, to promise themselves, when
   answering this description, grace with God and eternal glory. The
   causes of this evil are various, and most of them consist in certain
   erroneous and false conceptions which, being impressed on their minds,
   some men carry about with them, being either their own inventions, or
   furnished to them from some other quarter; yet, either in general or in
   particular, either directly or indirectly, such erroneous conceptions
   lay a stumbling-block and an impediment before the true and serious
   study of piety and the pursuit of virtue. We will not, in this place,
   introduce any mention of the impious conceptions of some men who do not
   believe either that there is a life eternal, or that, if it really
   exists, it is of such great and sublime excellence as it is described
   to be in the Holy Scriptures--who either despair of the mercy of God
   towards repentant sinners, or who consider it to be impossible to enter
   on that way of piety and new obedience which has been prescribed by the
   prince of our salvation. We say nothing about these persons, because
   they not only relax the asseverations and the promises of God, which
   are the true foundations of the Christian religion, but they likewise
   entirely overturn them, and thus, with one effort, they pluck up, by
   the roots, all piety, and all desire and love of it, from the hearts of
   men. We now begin to make some observations on those hypotheses,
   whether secret or avowed, which are injurious to piety, and which
   obtain among Christians themselves, whether they be publicly defended
   or otherwise. Among them, the first which comes under enumeration, is
   the dogma of unconditional predestination, with those which depend on
   it by a necessary connection; and, in particular, the so highly
   extolled perseverance of the saints, in a confidence in which such
   things are uttered by some persons as we dread to recite, for they are
   utterly unworthy of entering into the ear of Christians. It is no small
   impediment which these dogmas place in the way of piety. When, after a
   diligent and often- repeated perusal of the Holy Scriptures, after long
   meditations and ardent prayers to God, with fasting, our father, of
   blessed memory, thought that he had made a sure discovery of the
   baneful tendency of these dogmas, and had reflected upon them within
   his own breast, and that, however strenuously they might be urged by
   certain divines, and generally instilled into the minds of students by
   scholastic exercises, yet neither the ancient church nor the modern,
   after a previous lawful examination of them, ever received them or
   allowed them to pass into matters that had obtained mature
   adjudication. When he perceived these things, he began by degrees, to
   propose his difficulties about them, and his objections against them,
   for the purpose of shewing that they were not so firmly founded in the
   Scriptures as they are generally supposed to be; and, in process of
   time, being still more strongly confirmed in the knowledge of the
   truth, especially after the conference which he had with Doctor Francis
   Junius, and in which he had seen the weakness of his replies, he began
   to attack those dogmas with greater boldness; yet on no occasion was he
   forgetful of the modesty which so eminently became him. But, of the
   arguments with which he attacked those dogmas, this [on the seventh
   chapter of St. Paul's epistle to the Romans] in which we have now
   engaged, was not the last--that is, such was the nature of these
   doctrines that they were calculated to relax the study of piety, and
   thus to extinguish it. In that labour he also occasionally employed
   subtilities. and such reasons as are not at once obvious to the
   multitude; but they were subtle distinctions, necessary for overturning
   dogmas which, in his judgment, were very baneful. And, undoubtedly, as
   love is not conquered except by another love, so that subtlety, which
   is the inventor and establisher of falsehood, can scarcely be conquered
   and overturned without the subtlety which is the assertor of the truth
   and the convictor of falsehood. Therefore, the subtilities which he
   employed on that occasion, [his conference with Junius,] were useful
   and necessary--not insignificant, trifling, and invented for pleasure,
   ostentation or display. But with regard to other things, it is known to
   all those who were on terms of familiarity with him--especially during
   the last years of his life, when he was much engaged in the schools, in
   which it is an established custom principally to pursue
   subtilities--what a rigid enemy he was of all subtilities and of lofty
   language; and even those whom he had among his students that differed
   on some other points from him, could testify, if they would
   conscientiously relate the truth, that he referred all things to use
   and to the practice of a Christian life; and thus that piety and the
   fear of the divine Majesty uniformly breathed in his lectures, in his
   disputations, (both public and private,) in his sermons, discourses and
   writings. But it is not necessary for us, in this place, to rehearse
   the method by which he proved the genius of unconditional
   predestination and its annexed dogmas to be adverse to godliness;
   because his writings on this subject are partly extant, and the
   remainder, under the divine auspices, will soon be published. It is
   better that prudent readers should listen to him uttering his own
   words, than to us who are but stammerers about him. The water is
   sweeter which we taste at the fountain, than that which we drink at a
   distance from the spring. Various are the other hypotheses which
   operate as hindrances to piety, and the whole of which we are not able
   now to mention; but we will briefly discuss a Jew of those which occur,
   that we may not produce weariness in you, most noble sir, by our
   prolixity. A capital error which first offers itself, and which closely
   adheres to the inmost core and fibers of nearly all mankind, is that by
   which they silently imagine in their own minds that illimitable mercy
   exists in God; and from this they opine that they will not be rejected,
   though they have indulged themselves a little too much in vicious
   pursuits, but that, on the contrary, they will continue to be dear to
   God and beloved. This error is in reality joined with notorious
   incredulity, and, in a great measure destroys the Christian religion,
   which is founded on the blood of Christ. For, in this way, is removed
   all necessity for a pious life, and a manifest contradiction is given
   to the declaration of the apostle, in which he affirms that "without
   holiness no man shall see God." (Heb. xii. 14) Alas for the insanity of
   men, who have the audacity to bless themselves when they are cursed by
   God! This is succeeded by the false hypothesis of others, who,
   revolving in their minds the designs, the morals, and the life of
   mortals, and reflecting on the multitude, among men of all orders, of
   those who are wandering in error, conclude that the mercy of God will
   not permit eternally to perish so many and such infinite myriads of
   rational creatures, formed after the divine image. The consequence is,
   that, instead of performing their duty according to the tenor of
   Christianity, by opposing the torrent of impiety, they, on the
   contrary, suffer themselves to be carried away by the impulse of such
   views, and associate with the multitudes of those who are devious in
   error. They seem to forget that the many walk in the broad way, whose
   end, according to the truth of God, will be "destruction from the
   presence of the Lord." A multitude will preserve no man from perdition.
   Unhappy and most miserable solace, to have many companions in enduring
   everlasting punishment! Let the force of this deception, likewise, be
   considered, that vices are dignified with the names of virtues, and, on
   the other hand, virtues receive the defiling appellation of vices. The
   effect of this is, that men, who are of themselves, prone to vicious
   indulgences, pursue them with the greater avidity when they are
   concealed under the mask of virtues, and, on the contrary, are
   terrified at virtues, in the attainment of which any difficulty is
   involved, as though they were clothed in the monstrous garb of the most
   horrid vices. Thus, among mankind, drunkenness obtains the name of
   hilarity; and filthy talking, that of cheerful freedom; while sobriety
   in food and drink, and simplicity in dress, are opprobiously styled
   hypocrisy. This is really to "call good evil, and evil good," and to
   seek an occasion, by which a man may cease from the practice of virtue,
   and devote himself to vicious courses, not only without any reluctance
   of conscience, but likewise at the impulse and instigation of his
   [seared] conscience. Into this enumeration, must come that shameful and
   false reasoning by which unwise men infer, from those passages in
   Scripture in which we are said to be justified by faith without works,
   that it is not, therefore, necessary to attend to good works, they
   being of such a nature that without them we may be justified, and,
   therefore, saved. They never advert to the fact that, in other
   passages, it is recorded--True faith, that is, the faith by which we
   are justified, must be efficacious through charity; and that faith,
   without works, is dead, and resembles a lifeless carcass. This vain
   idea also, in no trifling degree, consoles the men who try to flatter
   themselves in those vices to which they have a constitutional
   propensity--that they are not given up to all vices, they have not run
   into every excess of wickedness, but, though addicted to certain vices
   peculiar to themselves, they feel an abhorrence for all others. As men
   are most ingenious in the invention of excuses for themselves, in
   support of this incorrect view are generally cited these common
   phrases: "No man lives without sin;" "Every man is captivated by that
   which he finds to be pleasing to himself." Such men, therefore,
   consider themselves to be true Christians, and that, on this account,
   it will be eternally well with them, when, as they foolishly persuade
   themselves, they abstain from most evils, and, as for the rest, they
   cherish only some one vice, a single Herodias alone. A most absurd
   invention! since no one is, no one can be, addicted to all vices at
   once; because some among them are diametrically opposed to others, and
   are mutual expellers. If this conceit be allowed, no mortal man either
   will or can be impious. The subjoined passage in the epistle of St.
   James ought to recur to the remembrance of these persons: "Whosoever
   shall offend in one point, he is guilty of all." (ii, 10.) We are also
   commanded to "lay aside," not some one, but "all malice, guile, and
   hypocrisy," (1 Pet. ii. 1,)that we may thus the more fully devote
   ourselves to God. Others suppose that, if in some degree their
   affections be partly drawn out towards God and goodness, they have
   adequately discharged their duty, though in some other part of their
   affections they are devoted to the service of the prince of this world
   and of sin. These men assuredly have forgotten, that God must be adored
   and loved with the whole affections of the heart--that the Lord God of
   Heaven, and the prince of this world, are opposing masters, and,
   therefore, that it is impossible to render service to both of them at
   once, as our saviour has most expressly declared. Not very dissimilar
   from this is that invention by which some persons divide their time
   into portions, and when they have marked off one part for God and
   Christ, and another part for the flesh and the affections, they imagine
   that they have most excellently performed their duty. But these men,
   whosoever they be, never reflect that our whole lives, and all the time
   of which they are composed, must be consecrated to God, and that we
   must persevere in the ways of piety and obedience to the close of life;
   and for this brief obedience of a time which is short at the longest,
   God has, of grace, covenanted to bestow on the obedient, that great
   reward of life eternal. Undoubtedly, if at any time a man falls, he
   cannot return into favour with God until he has not only deplored that
   fall by a sincere repentance, and is again converted in his heart to
   God, with this determinations--that he will devote the remaining days
   of his life to God. Those men must not be forgotten who are in this
   heresy--that all those things which are not joined with blasphemy to
   God, and with notorious injury and violence to one's neighbour, and
   which, with regard to other things, bear the semblance of charity and
   benevolence, are not to be reckoned among the multitude of sins.
   According to their doctrine, they are at liberty to indulge their
   natural relish for earthly things, to serve their belly, to take
   especial care of themselves, to gratify their sensual and drunken
   propensities, to live the short and merry life which Epicurus
   recommends, and to do whatsoever a heart which is inclined to pleasure
   shall command; provided they abstain from anger, hatred, the desire of
   revenge, bitterness and malice, and the other passions which are armed
   for force and injury. If we follow these masters, we shall assuredly
   discover a far more easy and expeditious way to heaven, than that which
   has been taught us by the divine ambassador of the great God, whose
   sole business it was to point out the way to heaven. Occasion is also
   afforded to unjust conceptions respecting the extreme of piety, by the
   mode in which some theological subjects are treated, and by some
   ecclesiastical phrases which are either not sufficiently conformable to
   the Scriptures, or which are not correctly understood. We must briefly,
   and without much regard to order, animadvert on a few of these, for the
   sake of example. When our good works are invested with the relation of
   gratitude towards God, it is a well ascertained fact, that men collect
   from this that they are now the heirs and proprietors of life eternal,
   and are in a state of grace and everlasting salvation, before they ever
   begin to perform good works. This delusion makes them think it
   expedient also to follow the hypothesis that the performance of good
   works is not absolutely necessary. In this case, it must be maintained
   from the Scriptures, that a true conversion and the performance of good
   works form a prerequisite condition before justification, according to
   this passage from St. John, "But if we walk in the light, as he is in
   the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus
   Christ, his Son cleanseth us from all sin." (1 John i. 7) This is
   consonant with that celebrated passage in Isaiah, in which the Lord
   promises to the Jews the cleansing and the destruction of all their
   sins, even those which were of the most aggravated kind, after they
   turned themselves to him, and corrected their ways. (Isa. i. 15-20.)
   When the sacraments are considered only in the light of sealing to us
   the promises and the grace of God, but not as binding us to the
   performance of our duty and admonishing us of it, the discussion of
   them is not only defective, but it may also, through such defect, be
   accounted injurious to the work of personal piety. "Believers and the
   regenerate are still prone and inclined to every evil;" and "the most
   holy among them have only the small beginnings of the obedience which
   is required." These are phrases which describe, in a manner far too low
   and weak, the efficacy of the new creation, and they are, therefore,
   kata ton rhton in reality exceedingly dangerous. For the former of
   these phrases seems entirely to remove all distinction between the
   regenerate and the, while the latter seems to place such minutiae of
   obedience in the regenerate, as will induce a man, who has been
   accustomed to bless himself if he perceives even the slightest thought
   or motion about the performance of obedience, immediately to conclude
   himself to be a partaker of true regeneration. When the continued
   imperfection of the regenerate, and the impossibility of keeping the
   law in this life, are urged unseasonably and beyond measure, without
   the addition of what may be done by holy men through faith and the
   Spirit of Christ, the thought is apt to suggest itself to the mind even
   of the most pious of their hearers, that they can do nothing which is
   at all good. Through this erroneous view, it happens that sometimes far
   less is attributed to the regenerate than the unregenerate are
   themselves able to perform. The ancient church did not reckon the
   question about the impossibility of performing the law among those
   which are capital: This is apparent from St. Augustine himself, who
   expresses a wish that Pelagius would acknowledge it possible to be
   performed by the grace of Christ, and declares that peace would then be
   concluded. The apostles of Christ were themselves occupied in
   endeavouring to convince men, when placed out of the influence of
   grace, of their incapability to perform obedience. But about the
   imperfection and impotency of the regenerate, you will scarcely find
   them employing a single expression. On the contrary, they attribute to
   believers the crucifying of the flesh and the affections, the
   mortification of the works of the flesh, a resurrection to a new life,
   and walking according to the Spirit; and they are not afraid openly to
   protest, that by faith they overcome the world. The acknowledgment of
   their imperfection was but a small matter, because that was a thing
   previous to Christianity. But the glory of Christians lies in
   this--that they know the power of the resurrection of Christ, and,
   being led by the Spirit of God, they live according to the purest light
   of the gospel. The distribution of theology into God, and the acts of
   God, introduces to us a speculative religion, and is not sufficiently
   well calculated to urge men to the performance of their duty. To this
   may be added that too subtle disquisition, which is an invention
   unsanctioned by Scripture, about the relations of those acts which are
   performed by us. As unsuitable for the promotion of piety, seems
   likewise that deduction or dispensation of our religion, by which all
   things are directed to the assurance of special mercy as the principal
   part of our duty, and to the consolation which is elicited from it
   against the despair that is opposed to it, but in which all things are
   not directed to the necessary performance of obedience in opposition to
   security. It derives its origin from the idea that greater fear ought
   to be entertained respecting despair than respecting security, when the
   contrary to this is the truth. For in the whole history of the Old and
   New Testament, which comprises a period of so many thousand years, only
   a single instance occurs of a person in despair, and that was Judas
   Iscariot, the perfidious betrayer of his saviour--the case of Cain
   being entirely out of the question; while, on the contrary, as the
   world was formerly, so is it now, very full of persons in a state of
   security, and negligent of the duty divinely imposed on them; yet these
   men, in the mean time, sweetly bless their souls, and promise
   themselves grace and peace from God in full measure. To proceed
   further: To these and all other delusions of a similar nature, we ought
   to oppose a soul truly pious, and most firmly rooted in the faith of
   God and Christ, exercising much solicitous caution about this--not to
   be called off from the serious and solid study of piety, and not to
   yield ourselves up to sins or to take delight in them, either through
   the deceptive force of any conceits, such as have now been enumerated
   or any others, or by the incautious use of any phrases and the sinister
   distortion of particular subjects; but, on the contrary, denying all
   ungodliness, let us sedulously and constantly walk in the paths of
   virtue; and let us always bear in mind the very serious admonition
   which the apostle Paul propounds to the Ephesians; having dehorted them
   from indulging in impurity and other crimes, he says: "Let no man
   deceive you with vain words" or reasons; "for, because of these things
   cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience." (Verse 6)
   It is worthy of observation, how significantly the hypothesis and
   arguments on which men depend when they bless themselves in their
   vices, are designated as "vain speeches;" For "vain" they truly are;
   that is, false and deceitful are those reasons with which men are
   deceived while they are in bondage to their lusts, and persuade
   themselves that they are in a state of grace and salvation, when, on
   the contrary, they are in a state of wrath and eternal perdition; than
   which, no other more capital imposture or deception can be produced.
   But, beside those things of which we have made previous mention, and
   which place obstructions to the progress of piety, another also occurs,
   which particularly belongs to the subject on which we are now treating;
   that is, the depraved and perverted interpretation of certain passages
   of Scripture, by which, in general, either all attention to good works
   is superseded, or in particular some part of it is weakened. This kind
   of hindrance ought undoubtedly to be reckoned among those which are the
   greatest; for thus either evil itself seems to be established by divine
   authority, or a more remiss pursuit of good, which, of the two, is
   without exception the greater evil. Wherefore, as all those persons
   deserve praise who endeavour to overturn every kind of hypothesis that
   is injurious to piety, so those among them are worthy of the highest
   commendation who try to give a correct interpretation, and such as is
   agreeable to "the form of sound words," of those passages which are,
   through common abuse, generally so explained as, by such exposition,
   either directly or indirectly to countenance a disorderly course of
   life--to free them from such a depraved interpretation, and to act as
   torch-bearers, in a thing so useful and necessary to Christian people
   and chiefly to the pastors of the church. Many are those passages which
   are usually distorted to the injury of godliness; and from which we
   shall in this place select only the three following. (1.) In the
   Proverbs of Solomon it is said, "A just man falleth seven times." This
   sentence is in the mouth of every one, with this gloss superadded, "in
   a day," which is an interpolation to be found in the Latin Vulgate.
   This passage ought to be understood of falling into misfortune; yet it
   is most perversely interpreted to signify a fall into sin, and thus
   contributes to nourish vices. (2.) In the prophecy of Isaiah, when the
   Jewish church, after having been defiled by manifold idolatries, by her
   defection from God, and by other innumerable crimes, was severely
   punished for all these her foul transgressions; in a tone of
   lamentation, complaining of the heaviness of her punishment, and at the
   same time making humble confession of her sins, she acknowledges,
   amongst other things, that "her righteousnesses are as the cloth of a
   menstruous woman," designating by this phrase the best of those works
   which she had performed during her public defection. This passage, by a
   pernicious contortion, is commonly corrupted; for it is very constantly
   quoted, as if the sense to be inferred from it was, that each of the
   excellent works of the most eminent Christians, and therefore that the
   most ardent prayers poured forth in the name of Christ, deeds of
   charity performed from a heart truly and inwardly moved with mercy, and
   the flowing of the blood of martyrs even unto death for the sake of
   Christ--that all these are as the cloth of a menstruous woman, filthy,
   detestable and horrid things, and thus mere abominations in the sight
   of God. And as this name is, in the Scriptures, bestowed only on
   flagitous crimes and the greatest transgressions, it further follows
   [from this mode of reasoning] that the best and most excellent works
   differ in no respect from the most dreadful wickedness. When a man has
   once thoroughly imbibed this conceit, will he not east away all care
   and regard for piety? Will he not consider it of no great consequence
   whether he leads a bad or a good life? And will he not, in the mean
   time, indulge in the persuasion, that he can, notwithstanding all this,
   be a true disciple of Christ Jesus? The reason, undoubtedly, seems to
   be evident, since, according to this hypothesis, the best works are
   equally filthy with the worst crimes in the sight of God. (3.) In this
   number of abused passages is included the seventh chapter of the
   epistle of Paul to the Romans, from the fourteenth verse to the end of
   the chapter; that is, if the apostle be understood, in that chapter, to
   be speaking about a man who is regenerated. For then it will follow
   that a renewed man is still "carnal, and sold under sin," that is, the
   slave of sin; that "he wills to do good, but does it not; but the evil
   which he wills not, that he does;" nay, that he is conquered, and
   "brought into captivity to the law of sin," that is, under the power
   and efficacy of sin. From this view it is further deduced, that, if any
   one be regenerate, it is sufficient for him "to will that which is
   good," though with a will that is incomplete, and that is not followed
   by action; and "not to will that which is evil," though he actually
   perpetrates it. If this view of that chapter be correct, then all
   attention to piety, the whole of new obedience, and thus the entire new
   creation, will be reduced to such narrow limits as to consist not in
   effects, but only in affections or feelings. Every man, at first sight,
   perceives how languid, cold and remiss such a belief will render all of
   us, both in our abstaining from evil, and in the performance of that
   which is good. Those, indeed, who defend this opinion, have their
   subterfuges and palliatives; but they are of such a kind, that the
   comment is generally repugnant to the text on which it is founded. With
   respect to the exercise of piety, it is dangerous for men to have this
   conceit previously impressed on their minds: "This chapter must be
   understood about regenerate persons;" for they who hold it as a
   foundation, in other things wander wherever they are led by their
   feelings, and never recollect the glosses proposed by their teachers.
   This effect was observed by St. Augustine, and being afraid of giving
   offense, in the more early period of his Christian career, he
   interpreted the passage as applicable to a man under the law, but in
   his latter days he applied it to a man under grace; but he held this
   opinion in a much milder form than it is now maintained, and almost
   without any injury to godliness. For "the good" which the apostle says
   "he willed but did not," St. Augustine interprets into "a refraining
   from concupiscence;" and "the evil" which the apostle declares "he
   willed not and yet did," he interprets as "an indulgence in
   concupiscence;"--though this novel interpretation involves a wonderful
   mixture of the preceptive and prohibitive parts of the law. Modern
   interpreters [among the Calvinists] understand it as relating to actual
   good and evil--a most notable distinction! But as our venerated father
   laboured with all diligence in removing the other hindrances of piety,
   so did he principally expend much toil and unwearied study in searching
   out the true meaning of such passages of Scripture as were imperfectly
   understood, particularly if they placed a stumbling-block in the way of
   those who were studious of piety. If, in that species of labour, he
   ever had eminent success, it must undoubtedly be confessed that it was
   in his attempts on this seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans;
   for he wrote a commentary on it of great length, which, with the
   greatest accuracy, he prepared and finished, and which we now publish.
   When he returned from Geneva to his native country, he understood this
   very chapter as it is now commonly explained; having been instructed in
   that view of it by his teachers, whose authority was so great among the
   students, that not one of the latter durst even inquire about any thing
   which they uttered. But when, in the exercise of his ministry in the
   church of Amsterdam, he had afterwards taken epistle to the Romans as
   the subject of a series of discourses from the pulpit, and when he had
   come to the explication of the seventh chapter, concerning the received
   interpretation of which he had then begun to conceive scruples in his
   mind, because it seemed both to undervalue the grace of regeneration
   and to diminish all zeal and attention to piety; he diligently
   considered the chapter from the beginning to the conclusion with a good
   conscience, as it was proper that he should do, and as the nature of
   his public function required; he collated it with those passages which
   preceded it and followed; he revolved all of them, in their several
   particulars, as in the presence of God; he read all the various
   commentators upon it which he could procure, whether among the
   ancients, those of the middle ages, or among the moderns; and, at
   length, after having frequently invoked the name and aid of Almighty
   God, and having derived his chief human assistance from the
   commentaries of Bucer and Musculus on that part of Holy Writ, he
   discovered that the received interpretation could not bear the scrutiny
   of truth, but that the passage was to be entirely understood in
   reference to a man living under the law, in whom the law has discharged
   its office, and who, therefore, feeling true contrition in his soul on
   account of sins, and being convinced of the incapability of the law to
   save him, inquires after a deliverer, and is not, in fact, a
   regenerated man, but stands in the nearest grade to regeneration. This
   explanation of the chapter he publicly delivered from the pulpit;
   because he thought that such a course was allowable by the liberty of
   prophesying, which ought always to have a place in the church of
   Christ. Though this diligence in elucidating the Scriptures, and the
   candour which he displayed, deserved singular praise and commendation,
   especially from all persons of the ecclesiastical order, yet, by some
   zealots, in whom such a conduct was the least becoming, it was received
   in a manner which shewed that the author ranked no higher with them
   than as one who, instead of receiving a reward, ought to be charged
   with mischief and insanity. Such is the result of employing a sedulous
   care in the investigation of the Scriptures, and of cultivating the
   liberty of prophesying; and it is esteemed a preferable service, to
   render the servants of Christ the slaves of certain men who lived only
   a short time before ourselves, and almost to canonize their
   interpretation of the Scriptures as the only rule and guide for us in
   our interpretation. When our father perceived these things, he began to
   write this commentary, which at length he brought to a conclusion. If
   God had granted him longer life, he would have corrected his production
   with greater accuracy, as he had already begun to do; but as he was
   prevented by death, and thus rendered incapable of giving it a final
   polish, and yet as, in the judgment of many great men, it is a work
   that is worthy to see the light, we have now ventured to publish it.
   Here then, Firstly, the author proposes his own sentiments, and proves
   them by deductions from the entire chapter, as well as from the
   connection in which it stands with the preceding and following
   chapters. Secondly. He shows that this interpretation has never been
   condemned, but has always had the greatest number of supporters.
   Thirdly. He defends it from the black charge of Pelagianism, and
   demonstrates that it is directly opposed to that error. Fourthly. He
   contends that the interpretation now generally received is quite new,
   and was never embraced by any of the ancients, but rejected by many of
   them. Lastly. And that it is injurious to grace and hurtful to good
   morals. He then enters into a comparison of the opinion of St.
   Augustine, and of that which is now generally received with his own
   interpretation; and concludes the work with a friendly address to his
   fellow-ministers. It was our wish, most noble Bardesius, to dedicate
   and address this work to your mightiness; for this desire, we had
   several reasons. From the first entrance on his ministry, a sacred
   friendship subsisted between our revered father and that nobleman of
   honoured memory, your excellent father--a friendship which continued
   till our venerable parent came down to the grave, full of years and
   loaded with honours. You, as the lawful inheritor of your father's
   possessions, have also succeeded in his place as the heir of his
   friendships; and this is the reason why the closest intimacy was formed
   between you and our good father, immediately after your return from
   your travels, which you had undertaken for the purpose of prosecuting
   your studies and visiting foreign nations. You were accustomed to place
   a high estimate on his endowments, and frequently consulted him on
   questions of theology, and very often acted upon his advice--as he did,
   also, upon yours. But after he had reflected in his mind, that he was
   not the slave of men, but the servant of Jesus Christ, and that he was
   under an oath [to the observance of] his words alone, when, on this
   account, he had begun freely to inquire into the sentiments invented by
   men, and into their truth and necessity, and, after comparing them with
   the Scriptures, had also occasionally proposed, with great modesty, his
   doubts concerning them, and His animadversions on them--when for this
   reason, many of those who were formerly his acquaintances and intimate
   friends, became alienated from him as from one who had removed the
   ancient land-marks out of their places; and when some of them, by
   degrees, both in public and private, began either to take an occasion
   or to make one, to circulate sinister reports concerning him, while
   others, with sufficient plainness, openly renounced all friendship with
   him; and when the whole chorus of ecclesiastical zealots had excited
   each other to rise up against him; yet, amidst all these things, you
   took no offense, but, having weighed the matter in the just balance of
   your judgment, you persisted to cherish a constant love for him. When
   he was debilitated by a slow and constant malady, as soon as the
   mildness of the weather and the intervals in his disorder would permit
   his removal, you invited him to your house in a manner the most
   friendly, and, on his arrival, you received him as the angel of the
   Lord; and a friendship, thus pure and refined, you cultivated with him,
   until he departed out of this life, and ascended to Christ, his Lord
   and Master. Besides, after his decease, by your conduct to our
   afflicted family, you shewed yourself such a one as it became that man
   to be who was not a pretended friend to the survivors of his departed
   friend--affording, by words and deeds, such substantial proofs of your
   kindness and beneficence towards his sorrowing widow and distressed
   orphans, as far exceed the feebleness of our expressions. Therefore,
   unless we wished not only to be the most ungrateful of mortals, but
   likewise to be generally depicted as such, it was exceedingly proper in
   us, while the posthumous writings of our revered parent are
   occasionally issuing from the press, to inscribe some portion of them
   to your very honourable and most friendly name, and by this method, as
   by a public document, to testify at once before the whole world our
   gratitude to you as well as our vast obligations. To these
   considerations, we may add that our father had determined within
   himself, if God had granted him life and leisure, to write a system of
   the whole Christian religion, not drawing it out of the stagnant lakes
   of Egypt, but out of the pure fountains of Israel, and to inscribe it
   to your mightiness. As he was unable to execute his purpose, partly
   through the multiplicity of his engagements, and partly through the
   lingering nature of his disorder, you have here, in the place of the
   other world, the present commentary; for in no other way than this, can
   the design of our father now be fulfilled. We hope the subject itself,
   which is treated in this commentary, will not be disagreeable to you;
   for it is one which is excellently accordant with your genius and
   disposition. It is a fact which is well known to all those who are
   acquainted with you and which you do not wish to be regarded as a
   secret, but which you openly profess, as often as occasion demands,
   that you take no delight in those thorny disputations and discussions
   which contribute nothing to the practice of the Christian life; but
   that you place the chief part of religion in the pursuit of real and
   solid piety. As our honoured father also shows in this work that his
   wishes and purposes were in this respect similar to yours, we have
   thought that nothing could be more appropriate than to dedicate to a
   man of extensive learning, who is likewise deeply attached to the
   interests of religion, a work which is highly conducive to the
   promotion of piety. Accept, therefore, with a cheerful heart and a
   serene countenance, this small gift, which we and our dear mother are
   desirous to commit to posterity, that it may perpetually remain as an
   endless monument of that sacred friendship which subsisted between you
   and James Arminius, our venerated parent, and, at the same time, of our
   own great obligations to you. To you, who have been under the influence
   of mercy towards our afflicted family, may the Lord God in return shew
   mercy; and may he enrich you and your very honourable family with every
   kind of heavenly blessings, to the glory of his name and to the
   salvation of all of us! Amen. So pray those who are most attached to
   your mightiness,

  A DISSERTATION ON THE TRUE AND GENUINE SENSE OF THE SEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE
  EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS. BY JAMES ARMINIUS, D.D.

   INTRODUCTION 1. What is the subject of inquiry concerning the meaning
   of this chapter? 2. The manner in which this question is made a subject
   of dispute; formerly, a latitude of sentiment respecting it, was
   permitted. 3. Those who explain this passage as relating to a man under
   the law, are rashly charged with having some affinity With the Pelagian
   heresy. 4. Distribution of the subjects to be discussed in this
   Commentary. 1. The subject of inquiry concerning the meaning of the
   seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans, and particularly of the
   latter part of it, which is treated upon from the beginning of the
   fourteenth or fifteenth verse to the end of the chapter, is this: "Does
   the apostle there treat of himself, such as he then was?" Or, which is
   almost the same question, "Under his own person, does he treat about a
   man living in the possession of the grace of Christ, or does he there
   personate a man placed under the law?" This question is also usually
   proposed in other words, thus: "Does the apostle there treat about a
   man who is still unregenerate, or about one who is already regenerated
   through the Spirit of Christ?" The latter question differs a little in
   its meaning from the former, (1.) because the word "unregenerate" has a
   more extensive signification, embracing even those who are under the
   law, and at whose state the apostle has also briefly glanced in the
   ninth verse of this chapter, and (2.) because the same word, with some
   persons, denotes not only the mere absence of regeneration, but
   likewise of all those things which are necessarily previous to
   regeneration; and these previous things are so far from being excluded
   by the words, "under the law," that, on the contrary, a great part of
   them is necessarily comprehended in the ample compass of that state
   which these words describe. This ought not to be passed over without
   some animadversion; because this notion about the word "unregenerate"
   which many persons have previously formed, is no small cause why they
   think they must reject the opinion, which declares that this passage of
   Scripture relates to an unregenerate man, that is, to one not only
   devoid of regeneration, but likewise of all those things which usually
   precede regeneration; and why they suppose that they ought to approve
   of the one contrary to this, without any further attentive
   consideration of the words and of the things signified. 2. But this
   question has now become a subject of dispute, not as one of those about
   which the writers who treat on Catholic doctrine may be allowed to
   maintain different sentiments, but as if it was one of such importance
   and weight to the truth of faith, that, without great detriment to
   truth and manifest heresy, no determination can be made concerning it
   except in one way, which is the affirmation that the apostle is there
   treating about a man who lives under grace and is regenerate. This
   judgment about the question seems new to me, and is one which was never
   heard in the church before these our times. In those better days,
   liberty was granted to the divines of the church to maintain an opinion
   on the one part of this question or on the other, provided they did not
   produce an explanation of their meaning that was at variance with the
   articles and doctrines of faith. The thing itself will shew that it is
   possible to do so in this matter, and such was the persuasion which was
   entertained on the subject by those who granted this liberty of
   sentiment, because no man ever supposed that any opinion was to be
   tolerated in the church which could not admit of an explanation that
   was agreeable to the doctrines and articles of belief. 3. Those who
   explain this passage in reference to a man living under the law, are
   charged with holding a doctrine which has some affinity to the two-fold
   heresy of Pelagius, and are said to ascribe to man, without the grace
   of Christ, some true and saving good, and, taking away the contest
   between the flesh and the spirit which is carried on in the regenerate,
   are said to maintain a perfection of righteousness in the present life.
   But I ingenuously confess that I detest, from my heart, the
   consequences which are here deduced; in the mean time, I do not
   perceive how they can flow from such an opinion. If any one will deign
   to prove this, I will instantly abjure an opinion thus conducting to
   heresy; knowing that nothing can be true, from which a falsehood may,
   by good consequence, be concluded. But if this cannot be demonstrated,
   and if I can make it evident that neither these heresies, nor any
   other, are derived from this opinion when it is properly explained,
   then, under these circumstances, it seems that I may require, in my own
   right, that no molestation shall be offered to me, or to any one else,
   on account of this opinion. If I shall confirm this opinion by
   arguments which are not only probable, but likewise incapable of
   refutation, or which at least have a greater semblance of probability
   than those by which the contrary opinion is supported, then let me be
   allowed to request that, by at least an equal right, this sentiment may
   obtain a place with the other in the church. If, lastly, I shall prove
   that the other opinion as it is in these days explained by most
   divines, cannot, without the greatest difficulty, be reconciled to many
   of the plainest passages of Scripture, that it is in no small degree
   injurious to the grace of the indwelling Spirit, that it has a hurtful
   effect on good morals, and that it was never approved by any of the
   ancient fathers of the church, but, on the contrary, disapproved by
   some of them, and even to St. Augustine himself; then may I be
   permitted by a most deserved right to admonish the defenders of that
   other sentiment, that they reflect frequently and seriously, whether
   they be wishful to excite the wrath of God against themselves by an
   unjust condemnation of this better opinion and of those who are its
   defenders. 4. Having premised these things, let us now enter on the
   matter itself, which shall be treated by us after being distributed in
   the following parts: I. I will show that, in this passage, the apostle
   does not speak about himself, nor about a man living under grace, but
   that he has transferred to himself the person of a man placed under the
   law. II. I will make it evident that this opinion has never been
   condemned in the church as heretical, but that it has always had some
   defenders among the divines of the church. III. I will show that no
   heresy, neither that of Pelagius, nor any other, can be derived from
   this opinion, but that it is most evidently opposed to Pelagianism, and
   that in a most distinguished manner and designedly, it refutes the
   grand falsehood of Pelagius. Confining myself within the bounds of
   necessary defense, I might, after having explained these three heads,
   conclude this treatise, unless it might seem to some one advisable and
   useful to confute by equal arguments the contrary opinion, especially
   as it is explained in these days. This I will attempt in other two
   chapters, subjoined to the preceding three, which will then be
   analogous and appear as parallels to the last two. IV. Therefore, I
   will prove that the meaning which some of our modern divines attribute
   to the apostle in this was not approved by any of the ancient fathers
   of the church, not even by St. Augustine himself, but that it was
   repudiated and confuted by him and some others. V. And, lastly, I will
   demonstrate, that this opinion, as explained in these days by many
   persons, is not only injurious to grace, but likewise adverse to good
   morals. God grant that I may meditate and write nothing but what is
   agreeable to his sacred truth. If, however, any thing of a contrary
   kind should escape from me, which is a fault of easy occurrence to one
   who "knows but in part, and prophesies in part;" I wish that neither to
   be [considered as] spoken nor written. I make this previous
   protestation against any such thing; and will, in reality, declare
   those things which possess greater truth and certainty, when any one
   has taught them to me.

FIRST PART
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. THE THESIS TO BE PROVED

   A description of the terms contained in the Thesis. 2. The reason why
   the description of the apostle is here omitted. 3. What is meant by
   "being under the law. 4. What it is to be "under grace." 5. What is
   meant by "a regenerate man?" 6. Who is "an unregenerate?" THE apostle,
   in this passage, is treating neither about himself, such as he then
   was, nor about a man living under grace; but he has transferred to
   himself the person of a man placed under the law. Or as some other
   persons express it : The apostle, in this passage, is not treating
   about a man who is already regenerate through the Spirit of Christ, but
   has assumed the person of a man who is not yet regenerate. 1. To the
   proof of the thesis, must be premised and prefixed definitions or
   descriptions of the subjects which it comprises. The subjects are--the
   apostle himself, a man placed under grace, a man placed under the law,
   a man regenerate by the Spirit of Christ, and a man not yet regenerate.
   2. I have set the apostle apart from those who are regenerate and
   placed under grace, not because I would take him away from the number
   of regenerate persons, among whom he holds a conspicuous station, but
   because some people have thought proper to deduce, from the description
   of the apostolical perfection, arguments by which they prove, that the
   apostle could not, in this passage, be speaking concerning himself, as
   he then was; because those things which he here ascribes to himself are
   at variance with some things that, in other passages, he writes about
   himself, and because they are a disgrace to his eminent state of grace,
   and to his progress in faith and newness of life. But since it is
   certain, that the apostle has not, in this chapter, treated of himself
   personally, as distinguished from all other men of whatsoever condition
   or order they may be, but that he, under his own person, described a
   certain kind and order of men, whether they be those who are under the
   law and not yet regenerate, or those who are regenerate and placed
   under grace, omitting the description of the apostle, we will first see
   what is meant by being under grace and under the law, and what by being
   regenerate, and not yet regenerate or unregenerate; yet we will do this
   in such a man--that, in the subsequent establishment of our own
   opinion, we may produce arguments drawn from the description given by
   the apostle. 3. The expression, therefore, to be under the law, does
   not signify merely that the man is liable to perform it, or that he is
   bound to obey the commands of the law; in which sense all men
   generally, both those who are said in the ninth verse of this chapter
   to be "without law," are reckoned to be under the law by right of
   creation, and those also who are under grace, are considered to be
   under the law by the further fight of redemption and sanctification,
   and yet in such a manner as not to be under its rigor, because they are
   under the law to Christ, who makes his people free from the rigor of
   the law. But because the office of the law concerning sinners is
   two-fold--the one, to conclude sinners under the guilt of that
   punishment which is denounced by the law against transgressors, and to
   condemn them by its sentence--the other, first to instruct sinners and
   to give them assurance about its equity, justice and holiness, and
   afterwards to accuse them of sin, to urge them to obedience, to
   convince them of their own weakness, to terrify them by a dread of
   punishment, to compel them to seek deliverance, and, generally, to
   lead, govern and actuate sinners according to its efficacy. Therefore,
   with regard to the first office of the law, all sinners universally are
   said to be under it, even those who are without law and have sinned
   without it; "for they shall also perish without law (Rom. ii. 12) yet
   they are not to be condemned without a just sentence of the law. In
   relation to the second office of the law, they are said to be under its
   dominion, government, lordship and (pedagogy) tutelage, who are ruled
   and actuated by the efficacy and guidance of the law, in whom it exerts
   its power, and exercises these its operations, whether some of them or
   all, whether more or less, in which respect there may be, and really
   are, different degrees and orders of those persons who are said, in
   this second view, to be under the law. But in this passage, we define a
   man under the law to be "one who is under its entire efficacy and all
   its operations;" the design of the apostle requiring this, as we shall
   afterwards perceive. 4. This phrase "to be under grace," answers in
   opposition to the other of being "under the law," since the effect of
   this grace is two-fold. The first is, to absolve a sinful man from the
   guilt of sin and from condemnation; the second is, to endow man with
   the Spirit of adoption and of regeneration, and by that Spirit to
   vivify or quicken, to lead, actuate and govern him. Hence, not only are
   they said to be "under grace" who are free from guilt and condemnation,
   but likewise they who are governed and actuated by the guidance of
   grace and of the Holy Spirit. But since we are in this place
   discussing, not properly the condemnation of sin, but the tyranny and
   dominion which it violently exercises over those who are its subjects,
   by compelling them with its own force to yield it complete obedience,
   and to which are opposed in vain the efficacy and power of the law; and
   since we are now treating, not about the remission of sins, but about
   that grace which inhibits or restrains the force of this tyrant and
   lord, and which leads men to yield it due obedience; therefore we must
   restrict the expressions, "to be under the law," and "to be under
   grace," to the latter signification--that he is "under the law" who is
   governed and actuated by the guidance of the law, and that he is "under
   grace" who is governed and actuated by the guidance of grace. This will
   be rendered evident from the fourteenth verse of the sixth chapter,
   when accurately compared with the preceding and following verses of the
   same chapter, and from the 17th and 18th verses of the fifth chapter of
   the epistle to the Galatians, when they are properly applied to this
   matter. Yet if any one be desirous of extending these passages to the
   two-fold signification of each of the expressions, he has my free
   permission for such extension; for it cannot prove the least hindrance
   in the inquiry and discovery of the truth of the matter which is the
   subject of our present discussion. 5. LET us now see about the
   regenerate and the unregenerate man. That we may define him with
   strictness, as it is proper to do in oppositions and distinctions, we
   say that a regenerate man is one who is so called, not from the
   commenced act or operation of the Holy Spirit, though this is
   regeneration, but from the same act or operation when it is perfected
   with respect to its essential parts, though not with respect to its
   quantity and degree; he is not one "who was once enlightened, and has
   tasted of the heavenly gift, and was made partaker of the Holy Ghost,
   and who has tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
   come;" (Heb. vi. 4,5) because the explanation given by most of our
   divines to this passage, applies only to unregenerate persons. Neither
   is he one who "has escaped the pollutions of the world through the
   knowledge of the Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, and who has known the
   way of righteousness;" (2 Pet. ii. 20,21) or they explain this passage
   also as applicable solely to the unregenerate. Nor is it a man who
   "heareth the law, and has the work of the law written in his heart,
   whose thoughts mutually accuse or else excuse themselves, who rests in
   the law, makes his boast of God, knows his will, and approves the
   things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law." (Rom.
   ii. 13-18.) Neither is he one who "has prophesied in the name of the
   Lord, and in his name cast out devils;" (Matt. vii. 22) and who "has
   all faith, so that he could remove mountains." (1 Cor. xiii. 2) Nor is
   he one who acknowledges himself to be a sinner, mourns on account of
   sin, and is affected with godly sorrow, and who is fatigued and "heavy
   laden" under the burden of his sins; (Matt. xi. 28) for such persons as
   these Christ came to call, and this call precedes justification and
   sanctification, that is, regeneration. (Rom. viii. 30.) Neither is it
   he who "knows himself to be wretched, and miserable, and poor, and
   blind, and naked;" for this is the man whom Christ "counsels to buy" of
   him the things necessary for himself. (Rev. iii. 17,18.) This
   interpretation is not invalidated by the fact that the church of
   Laodicea is said not to know herself; for the "counsel" or advice
   bestowed will never persuade her to buy those things of Christ, unless
   she have previously known herself to be such a one as is there
   described. Nor is he one who knows that a man cannot be justified by
   the works of the law, and who, from this very circumstance, is
   compelled to flee to Christ, that in him he may obtain justification.
   (Gal. ii. 16) Nor is he a man, who, acknowledging himself as being
   unworthy even to lift up his eyes to heaven, and who, smiting on his
   breast, has exclaimed, God be merciful to me a sinner! This has been
   well observed by Beza in his Refutation of the calumnies of Tilman
   Heshusius, where he makes a beautiful distinction between "the things
   which precede regeneration" and "regeneration itself" and thus
   expresses himself: "It is one thing to inquire by what methods God
   prepares for repentance or newness of life, and it is another to treat
   on repentance itself. Let, therefore, the acknowledgment of sin and
   godly sorrow be the beginning of repentance, but so far as God begins
   in this way to prepare us for newness of life, in which respect it was
   the practice of Calvin deservedly to call this fear initial. Besides,
   in the description of penitence we are not so accustomed as some people
   are, to call these dreadful qualms of conscience the mortification of
   the flesh or of the old man; though we know that the word of God is
   compared to a sword, which, in some manner, slays us, that we may offer
   ourselves for a sacrifice to God; and St. Paul somewhere calls
   afflictions the death of Christ which we carry about with us in the
   body. For it is very evident that, by the mortification or death of the
   flesh and of the old man, or of our members, St. Paul means something
   far different: He means not that efficacy of the Spirit of Christ which
   may terrify us, but that which may sanctify us, by destroying in us
   that corrupt nature which brought forth fruit unto death. Besides, we
   also differ from some persons on this point, not with respect to the
   thing itself, but in the method or form of teaching it, that they wish
   faith to be the second part of penitence, but we say that metanoia [a
   change of mind for the better,] by which term we understand, according
   to Scripture usage, renovation of life or newness of living, is the
   effect of faith," &c. (Opuscula, tom. I, fol. 328.) Such are the
   sentiments of Beza; but how exactly they agree with those things which
   I have advanced, will be rendered very apparent to any man who will
   compare the one with the other. Consonant with these is that which John
   Calvin says about initial fear, in the following words: "They have
   probably been deceived by this--that some persons are tamed by the
   qualms or terrors of conscience, or are prepared by them for obedience,
   before they have been imbued with the knowledge of grace, nay, before
   they have tasted it. And this is that initial fear which some persons
   reckon among the virtues, because they discern that it approaches
   nearly to a true and just obedience. But this is not the place for
   discussing the various ways by which Christ draws us to himself, or
   prepares us for the pursuit of piety," &c. But a regenerate man is one
   who comprises within himself all the particulars which I shall here
   enumerate: "has put off the old man with his deeds, and has put on the
   new man, who is renewed in knowledge, which agrees with the image of
   him who created him." (Col. iii. 9,10.) has received from God "the
   Spirit of wisdom and revelation through the knowledge of Him, the eyes
   of his understanding being illuminated" or opened. (Ephes. i. 18.) He
   has put off, "concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is
   corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and he is renewed in the
   spirit of his mind, and has put on the new man, which, after God, is
   created in righteousness and true holiness." (Ephes. iv. 22- 24) He,
   "with open face, beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, is
   changed into the same image from glory to glory, even us by the Spirit
   of the Lord." (2 Cor. iii. 18) He is "dead to sin; his old man is
   crucified with Christ, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that
   henceforth he should not serve sin; he is freed from sin, and is alive
   unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord?" (Rom. vi. 2,6, 7,11) "he is
   crucified with Christ; nevertheless he lives, yet not he; but Christ
   liveth in him; and the life which he now lives in the flesh, he lives
   by the faith of the Son of God." (Gal. ii. 20.) Being one of Christ's
   followers, "he has crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts,
   and now lives in the Spirit." (v. 24,25) "By our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   world is crucified unto him, and he unto the world." (vi, 14) "In
   Christ Jesus the Lord, he is also circumcised with the circumcision
   made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by
   the circumcision of Christ." (Col. ii. 11.) "In him, God worketh both
   to will and to do." (Phil. ii. 13.) "He is not in the flesh, but in the
   Spirit; the Spirit of Christ dwelleth in him; through the Spirit, he
   mortifies the deeds of the body; he is led by the Spirit of God, and
   does not walk after the flesh, but after the Spirit." (Rom. viii.
   4,9,13,14) Uniting in a brief manner, all the parts and fruits of
   generation into one summary--A regenerate man is he who has a mind
   freed from the darkness and vanity of the world, and illuminated with
   the true and saving knowledge of Christ, and with faith, who has
   affections that are mortified, and delivered from the dominion and
   slavery of sin, that are inflamed with such new desires as agree with
   the divine nature, and as are prepared and fitted for newness of
   living, who has a will reduced to order, and conformed to the will of
   God, who has powers and faculties able, through the assistance of the
   Holy Spirit, to contend against sin, the world and Satan, and to gain
   the victory over them, and to bring forth fruit unto God, such as is
   meet for repentance--who also actually fights against sin, and, having
   obtained the victory over it, no longer does those things which are
   pleasing to the flesh and to unlawful desires, but does those which are
   grateful to God; that is, he actually desists from evil and does
   good--not indeed perfectly, but according to the measure of faith and
   of the gift of Christ, according to the small degree of regeneration,
   which, begun in the present life, must be gradually improved or
   increased, till at length it is perfected after this short life is
   ended--not with respect to essential parts, but with respect to
   quantity, as we have already declared--not always without interruption,
   (for he sometimes stumbles, falls, wanders astray, commits sin, grieves
   the Holy Spirit, ac.,) but generally, and for the most part, he does
   good. 6. But an unregenerate man is, not only he who is entirely blind,
   ignorant of the will of God, knowingly and willingly contaminating
   himself by sins without any remorse of conscience, affected with no
   sense of the wrath of God, terrified with no compunctions visits of
   conscience, not oppressed with the burden of sin, and inflamed with no
   desire of deliverance--but it is also he who knows the will of God but
   does it not, who is acquainted with the way of righteousness, but
   departs from it--who has the law of God written in his heart, and has
   thoughts mutually accusing and excusing each other--who receives the
   word of the gospel with gladness, and for a season rejoices in its
   light--who comes to baptism, but either does not receive the word
   itself in a good heart, or, at least, does not bring forth fruit--who
   is affected with a painful sense of sin, is oppressed with its burden,
   and who sorrows after a godly sort--who knows that righteousness cannot
   be acquired by the law, and who is, therefore, compelled to flee to
   Christ. For all these particulars, in what manner soever they be taken,
   do not belong to the essence and the essential parts of regeneration,
   penitence, or repentance, which are mortification and vivification and
   quickening; but they are only things preceding, and may have some place
   among the beginnings, and, if such be the pleasure of any one, they may
   be reckoned the causes of penitence and regeneration, as Calvin has
   learnedly and nervously explained them in his Christian Institutes.
   (Lib. 3, cap. 3.) Besides, even true and living faith in Christ
   precedes regeneration strictly taken, and consisting of the
   mortification or death of the old man, and the vivification of the new
   man, as Calvin has, in the same passage of his Institutes, openly
   declared, and in a manner which agrees with the Scriptures and the
   nature of faith. For Christ becomes ours by faith, and we are engrafted
   into Christ, are made members of his body, of his flesh and of his
   bones, and, being thus planted with him, we coalesce or are united
   together, that we may draw from him the vivifying power of the Holy
   Spirit, by which power the old man is mortified and we rise again into
   a new life. All these things cohere together with each other in a
   certain order, and must thus also be considered, if any one be desirous
   of knowing them not confusedly but distinctly, and of explaining them
   well to others. But we are not, in this place, treating about all the
   unregenerate in general, but only about those in whom the law has
   exerted all its efficacy, and who are, on this account, reciprocally
   said to be under the law. II.

  THE CONNECTION OF THE SEVENTH CHAPTER WITH THE SIXTH

   1. The design of the Apostle in the sixth chapter. 2. A short
   disposition of this argument. 3. Four enunciations of it. 4. This
   distribution is treated in order [in the seventh chapter]. 5. The two
   former enunciations are contained in conjunction. 6. What therefore is
   proved by them. 7. The third and fourth enunciations are proposed in
   the fifth and sixth verses. 8. In the third enunciation lies the
   principal part of the controversy; its deduction consists of the
   proposition of the enunciation and of its method of being treated. 9.
   The proposition of the enunciation. 10. The investigation of the
   proposition, consisting of a larger explanation, and the rendering of
   the cause. 11. A larger explanation of the seventh chapter, from the
   seventh verse to the fourteenth. 12. The rendering of the cause, from
   the fourteenth verse to the end of the seventh chapter. 13. The
   fourteenth verse contains the rendering of a two-fold reason. 14. The
   proof of this is contained in the fifteenth verse. 15. And a more ample
   explanation of it. 16. From which two consectaries are deduced--the
   first in the sixteenth verse, and the second in the seventeenth. 17.
   From this, the apostle returns to the rendering of the cause, in the
   eighteenth verse, and to the proof of it. 18. Its more ample
   explanation follows in the nineteenth verse, from which is deduced the
   second consectary in the twentieth verse. 19. The conclusion of the
   thing intended, in the twenty-first verse, and the proof of it is given
   in the twenty-second and twenty- third verses. 20. A votive exclamation
   for the deliverance of a man who is under the law, occurs in the
   twenty-fourth verse. 21. An answer or a thanksgiving reference to that
   exclamation, is given in the former part of the twenty-fifth verse, and
   the conclusion of the whole investigation, in which the state of a man
   who is under the law is briefly defined in the latter part of the
   twenty-fifth verse. 22. A brief recapitulation of the second part. 1.
   Having, from necessity of the thing and of order, thus premised these
   things, let us now proceed to treat on the question and the thesis
   itself. But it will be useful, briefly to place before our eyes the sum
   of the whole chapter, its disposition and distribution; that, after
   having considered the design of the apostle, and those things which
   conduce to that design, and which have been brought forward by the
   apostle as subservient to his purpose, his mind and intention, may the
   more plainly be made known to us. That this may the more appropriately
   be done, the matter must be traced a little further backward. In the
   12th and 13th verses, as well as in the preceding verses of the sixth
   chapter of the epistle to the Romans, the apostle had exhorted all the
   believers at Rome to contend strenuously against sin, and not to suffer
   sin to domineer or rule over them, or to exercise authority in their
   mortal body; but to devote themselves to God, and to yield their
   members as the instruments of righteousness unto God; and he
   demonstrated and confirmed the equity of his exhortation by many
   arguments, especially by those which are deduced from the communion of
   believers with Christ. But, in order to animate them the more
   powerfully to this spiritual contest--the persuasion to enter on which
   was to be wrought not only by a demonstration of its equity, but also
   by a promise of its felicitous and successful issue--in the 14th verse
   of the same chapter, he proposed to them the certain hope of victory,
   declaring "sin shall not have dominion over you." For nothing can so
   strongly incite men to engage manfully and with spirit in this warfare,
   as that certain confidence of obtaining the victory which the apostle
   promises in these words. But he grounds his promise, in the 14th verse,
   on a reason drawn from it, and on the power and ability of that [grace]
   under the guidance and auspices of which they were about to contend
   against sin, or from that state in which they were then placed it, and
   through Christ, when he says, "For ye are not under the law but under
   grace," thus extolling the powers of grace at the expense of the
   contrary weakness of the law, as though he had said, "I employ these
   continual exhortations to induce you strenuously to engage in the
   conflict against sin; and I do this, not only because I consider it
   most equitable that you should enter into that warfare, while I have
   regard to your communion with Christ, but also because I arrive at an
   assured hope, while I view your present condition, that you will at
   length enjoy the victory over sin, through that under whose auspices
   you fight; and it can by no means come to pass, that sin shall have
   dominion over you, as it formerly had; for you are under grace, under
   the government and guidance of the Spirit of Christ, and no longer
   under the law. if you were still in that state in which you were before
   faith in Christ, that is, if you were yet under the law, I might
   indulge in despair about declaring a victory for you, as placed under
   the dominion of sin. Such a victory over the power of sin contending
   within you, you would not be able to obtain by the strength or power of
   the law, which knows how to command, but affords no aid for the
   performance of the things commanded, how great soever might be the
   exertions which you made to gain the battle under the auspices of the
   law." But this reasoning, in the first place, possessed validity to
   prove the necessity of the grace which was offered and to be obtained
   in Christ alone, in opposition to those who were the patrons of the
   cause of the law against the gospel, and who urged that covenant, the
   law of works, against the covenant of grace and the law of faith. This
   reasoning also contributed greatly to the design which the apostle
   proposed to himself in the principal part of this epistle. His design
   was to teach that, not the law, but "the gospel is the power of God to
   salvation to every one that believeth," both because by the law, and by
   the works of the law, no man can be justified from the sins which he
   has committed, and because, by the power and aid of the same law no one
   can oppose himself to the power of sin to shake off its yoke, and,
   alter having been freed from its yoke, to serve God, since he
   immediately falls in the conflict. But in Christ Jesus, as he is
   offered to us through the gospel, and apprehended by faith we can
   obtain both these blessings--the forgiveness of sins through faith in
   his blood, and the power of the Spirit of Christ, by which, being
   delivered from the dominion of sin, we may, through the same Spirit, be
   able to resist sin, to gain the victory over it, and to serve God "in
   newness of life." These things in the sixth chapter may be perceived at
   one glance when placed before the eyes in the following order:
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE PROPOSITION OF THE APOSTLE Dehortatory.--"

   Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto
   sin." Hortatory.--"But yield your members as instruments of
   righteousness unto God." THE REASON "For sin shall not have dominion
   over you." Hence, an enthymeme, whose Antecedent is--"Sin shall not
   have dominion over you." Its consequent--"Therefore, neither yield your
   members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield
   yourselves unto God," &c.

   THE PROOF OF THE ANTECEDENT OR OF THE REASON "For ye are under grace;
   therefore, sin shall not have dominion over you." AN ILLUSTRATION CF
   THE PROOF FROM ITS CONTRARY For ye are not under the law." A BRIEF
   EXPLICATION OF THE PROOF, AND OF ITS ILLUSTRATION "If, indeed, you were
   yet under the law, as you formerly were, sin would have the dominion
   over you as it once had; and, having followed its commands and
   impulses, you would not be able to do any other than yield your members
   as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. "But as you are now no
   longer under the law, but under grace, sin shall not in any wise have
   the dominion over you, but by the power of grace you shall easily
   resist sin, and yield your members as instruments of righteousness unto
   God." From the 14th verse, the apostle perseveres in the same
   exhortation throughout the remainder of the sixth chapter, with a
   slight intermission of this argument, yet having previously refuted the
   objection which might be deduced from it; being about to resume the
   same argument, and to treat it more at large, in the whole of the
   seventh chapter, and in the former part of the eighth, since, as we
   have already perceived, the prosecution of this argument contributes
   very materially to his design. 2. But the apostle treats this subject
   in the order and method which was demanded by reason itself, and by the
   necessity of its discussion. For he had said, "Sin shall not have
   dominion over you, for ye are not under the law, but under grace." 3.
   In these words, are contained the four following enunciations: (1.)
   Christians are not under the law. (2.) Christians are under grace. (3.)
   Sin shall have dominion over those who are under the law. (4.) Sin
   shall not have dominion over those who are under grace. Of these four
   enunciations, the second and the fourth are necessary and sufficient to
   persuade in favour of this exhortation; but the first and the third are
   adduced, both for the sake of illustration, and because they were
   required by the principal design of the entire epistle. The former of
   these [pairs of conjoint enunciations] is well known to all who
   understand the nature of a separated axiom and the mutual relation
   which exists between its parts; but the latter of them will he rendered
   very apparent by the deduction of the epistle itself, and on a diligent
   inspection of its conformation. 4. The apostle, therefore, thought that
   these four axioms ought to be treated by him in order, and indeed
   always with the mention of the conclusion which he was desirous to
   infer from them as from premises; and in which the sum of the
   exhortation consisted. 5. But the apostle treats those two former
   enunciations conjointly, such a course being required by their nature.
   For he gives one thing to those from which he takes another away, and
   this very properly; because there exists one and the same cause why the
   one should be attributed and the other taken away, why they are under
   grace and not under the law. This cause is expressed in the fourth
   verse of the seventh chapter, in the following words: "Ye, also, are
   become dead to the law in the body of Christ, that ye should be married
   to another." 6. But in the first four verses, the apostle proves that
   Christians or believers are not under the law, but under grace; which
   proof may be comprised in this syllogism: They who are dead to the law,
   and this in the body of Christ, that they may be married to another,
   even to Christ, are no longer under the law, but are now under grace;
   But Christians are dead to the law, that they should he married to
   another, even to Christ; Therefore, Christians are no longer under the
   law, but under grace. The first part of the proposition--"They who are
   dead to the law, are no longer under the law," is expressed in the
   first verse of the seventh chapter in these words: "The law hath
   dominion over a man as long as he liveth." The latter part of it, "They
   who are made Christ's are under grace, -- is included in the fourth
   verse, from which it may be deduced. But a confirmation of the first
   part of the proposition is added, in the first verse, from the
   testimony of the consciences of those who are expert in the knowledge
   of the law; and the same part of the proposition is illustrated, in the
   second and third verses, by a simile, that of marriage, in which the
   woman is no longer liable to the law of her husband than "so long as he
   liveth;" but when he is dead, she is free from the law of her husband,
   so that she may be allowed to transfer herself to another man without
   committing the crime of adultery. The application of this comparison is
   evident, the difference only being observed, that the apostle has
   declared, by a change in the mode of speaking, that Christians are
   become dead to the law, and not that the law is become dead to them.
   This change of speech is attributed by some persons to the prudence of
   the apostle, who wished to avoid the use of a phrase which he
   previously knew would be offensive to the Jews. By others it is
   transferred to the nature of the thing, in which they say that sin, and
   not the law, sustained the part or person of the husband, because in
   the sixth verse sin is said to be dead; but this makes nothing to our
   present purpose. The assumption, in the fourth verse, is in these
   words: "we also are become dead to the law in the body of Christ, that
   ye should be married to another, even to Christ." This assumption is
   illustrated, First, by the efficient cause of that mortification or
   death, which is the crucifixion and the resurrection of the body of
   Christ, and the communion of believers with Christ in that crucifixion
   and in the rising again of His body. Secondly. This assumption is
   illustrated by the final cause of deliverance, which contains the scope
   or design of the apostolical exhortation, that is, "to bring forth
   fruit unto God." But he perseveres in the same end in the two
   subsequent verses, the sixth and seventh, by treating it through a
   comparison of things similar, as he had also done in the nineteenth
   verse of the sixth chapter. The parallel is, that we serve God, and
   since we are not now in the oldness of the letter, but in the newness
   of Spirit, and are delivered from the law, that thing being dead in
   which we were held, it is equitable that we bring forth fruit unto God;
   because when we were in the flesh, the motion of sins, existing through
   the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. The
   conclusion is not openly inferred, but is understood, which is a mode
   of frequent occurrence, because the proposition, or question to be
   treated, does not differ from the conclusion in the matter, but only in
   the mode of position. 7. But though these two verses, the fifth and
   sixth, have such a relation to those things which preceded as has been
   already explained, yet they are likewise to be referred to those which
   follow. For the third and fourth enunciations are proposed in these two
   verses--the third in the fifth verse, and the fourth in the sixth. For,
   this expression, "The motions of sins, which are by the law, are
   vigourous, or operate in the members of men who are yet in the flesh,"
   (verse 5) is tantamount in meaning to these words: "Sin has the
   dominion over those who are under the law." These words likewise, "But
   now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were
   held, wse so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the
   oldness of the letter," (verse sixth,) agree well with the following:
   "Sin shall not have the dominion over those who are under grace." This
   will be rendered evident if any one translates the particle wse as an
   ancient interpreter has done, by the words "so that," and understands
   it not of the end or intention, but of the issue or event, as the
   almost perpetual use of that particle requires. For the sense is this:
   "When we were yet in the oldness of the letter and under the law, then
   we were held under sin; and when we are now delivered from the law and
   placed in newness of spirit, we are able to serve God in righteousness
   and true holiness," agreeably to this state of our newness of living.
   8. But let us now more closely inspect how this third enunciation is
   treated, since in it is laid the principal part of the controversy. The
   exposition of the whole matter consists of the proposing of the
   enunciation, and of its investigation, the latter of which is partly an
   explanation, and partly an application of the cause. Both of these are
   briefly joined to the proposition, as it is laid down in the fifth
   verse of this chapter; wherefore they are more copious, and better
   accommodated to the more prolix investigation, than as they are
   proposed from the fourteenth verse of the sixth chapter. 9. For that
   proposition is, "sin," or, as it is more energetically expressed, "The
   motions of sins have the dominion over those who are under the law."
   This attribute is likewise more nervously expressed by this method of
   speech, by which the motions of sins are said to have existence by the
   law itself. Two effects of this dominion, therefore, are added to the
   proposition for the sake of explication. One is, its vigour, and its
   working in the members; the other is, its bringing forth fruits unto
   death. The cause why, in men under the law, "the motions of sins work
   in their members to bring forth fruit unto death," is rendered in these
   words, "when we were in the flesh." For the reference to the time
   preceding is taken from the carnal state, which state comprises the
   cause why, in times past, "the motions of sins did work in our
   members." As if the apostle had said, "It is not wonderful that the
   motions of sins have had the dominion over us, and have worked in our
   members to bring forth fruit unto death; for we are in the flesh; and
   the law itself is so far from being able to hinder this dominion and to
   restrain the vigourous growth of sin, that these motions are by the law
   far more fervid and vehement, not through the fault of the law, but
   through the wickedness and obstinacy of sin that holds the dominion and
   abuses its power." 10. This proposition, therefore, is more largely
   explained, from the seventh verse to the fourteenth; and its cause is
   fully treated from the fourteenth verse inclusive, to the end of the
   chapter. The explanation is occupied about this two- fold effect--the
   working of sin, and its fructification by which it brings forth fruit
   unto death. The rendering of the cause is continually intent upon what
   is said in the fifth verse, "When we were in the flesh." But on both
   these points, we must carefully guard against bringing the law under
   the suspicion of blame, as though it were of itself the cause of
   depraved desires in us, and of death; when it is only the occasion,
   upon which sin violently seizes, and uses it to produce these effects
   in men who live under the law. In the explanation, both these effects
   are removed from the law, and they are attributed to sin as to their
   proper cause; yet this is done in such a way, that it is at the same
   time added, that sin abuses the law to produce these effects. 11. (i)
   The former of these effects is removed from the law, in the seventh
   verse, by these words: "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God
   forbid." That is, as if he had said, "Can it, therefore, be attributed
   to the law that it is itself, or the cause of depraved desires in us,
   because it is called in the fifth verse, the motions of sin which are
   by the law?" The apostle replies, that it is very wrong to entertain
   even the bare thought of such a thing concerning the law. He subjoins a
   proof of this removal of the first effect, from the contrary effect
   which the law has; for the law is the index of sin, or that which
   points it out; therefore, it is neither sin nor the cause of sin. He
   then illustrates this proof by a special example: "For I should not
   have known concupiscence, unless the law had said, Thou shaft not
   desire or covet." But the same effect is, in the eighth verse,
   attributed to sin, in these words: "But sin wrought in me all manner of
   concupiscence," yet so that it abuses the law as an occasion to produce
   this effect. This is intimated in the words which immediately follow:.
   "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me," &c. The
   latter effect [the fructification of sin] is proved in the next verse,
   in these words: "For, without the law, sin was dead; but, on the
   approach of the law, sin revived," which is illustrated by its opposite
   privatives, "For I was alive when sin was dead; but when sin revived
   then I died;" but, as this was done by the law, it is evident that sin
   abused the law to produce this effect. But the apostle here joins the
   second effect to the first, (because they cohere together by nature,
   and the former is the cause of the latter,) and thus in the tenth and
   eleventh verses, ascribes death to sin, which abuses the law, yet so as
   to excuse the law also from the effect of death, as it is expressed in
   the tenth verse, "the commandment which was unto life;" the cause of
   death being transferred to sin, in the expression, "for sin, taking
   occasion by the commandment," &c. But he follows up his exculpation of
   the law, in the twelfth verse, by a description of the nature of the
   law, that it "is holy, and just, and good," and, therefore, by no means
   the cause of death--an insinuation against the law which he indignantly
   repels in the former part of the thirteenth verse, by saying, "God
   forbid that that which is good, should be made death unto me." But in
   the latter part of this verse, he ascribes the same effect to sin, with
   the addition of a two-fold end, both of them inclining to the
   disparagement of sin itself, in these words: "That sin might appear
   sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin, by the
   commandment, might become exceedingly sinful." As though he had
   said--"Sin, by this abuse of the law to seduce and kill us, has
   produced the effect, that. in return, its own depravity and
   perverseness be made manifest by the law. This perverse depravity
   consists in sin working death by the law which is good, and in being
   made exceedingly sinful by the commandment which is just and holy, and
   that it might only become as it were a sinner above measure by its own
   wickedness, but also might be declared to be such by the indication of
   the law, which it has so shamefully abused to produce these effects."
   But it is apparent from the whole of this explanation, that the apostle
   has so attempered his style as to draw a conclusion of the necessity of
   the grace of Christ, from the efficacy of sin, and from the weakness of
   the law. This will be still more perspicuous, if we briefly comprise
   this explanation of the apostle in the following form: "Sin has the
   dominion over those who are under the law, by working in them all
   manner of concupiscence through the law itself, and also by killing
   them through it, yet so that the law is free from all blame in both
   cases, since, it is holy and good, the index of sin, and was given for
   life. But sin is so powerful in men who are still under the law, that
   it abuses the law to produce those effects in a man who is under
   subjection to it; by which abuse of the law, sin, on the other hand,
   takes away the reward from the law, that its own perverse and noxious
   disposition and tendency may be manifested by the indication of the
   law. From these circumstances a man who is under the law is compelled
   to flee to grace, that he may by its beneficent aid be delivered from
   the tyranny of such a wicked and injurious master." 12. The rendering
   of the cause follows from the fourteenth verse to the end of the
   chapter; in which, as we have already observed, the utmost care is
   evinced not to impose any ignominy on the law, or to ascribe any blame
   to it; and the entire mischief is attributed to the power of sin, and
   to the weakness of that man who is under the law. But the cause is
   briefly given in the fourteenth verse, in these words: "For we know
   that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin." But in
   order that this rendering of the cause may be accurately understood, we
   must again consider that proposition, the cause of which the apostle
   determines in this place to explain, and which is this: "Sin has
   dominion over those who are under the law;" or, "The motions of sins,
   which are by the law, work in men who are under the law." 13. That the
   cause of this may be fully and perfectly rendered, it must be shown why
   the law cannot weaken the force and tyranny of sin in those who are
   under the law, and why sin holds those who are under the law bound and
   obnoxious to itself as by some right of its own. Therefore, this
   rendering of the cause consists of two parts: The first is contained in
   these words: "For truly the law is spiritual; but I am carnal." That
   the particle "indeed" or "truly" must be added, is proved both by its
   relative de, "but," as well as by the very subject. The second is
   contained in these words: "For I am sold under sin;" that is, I am
   under the dominion of sin, as one who is constituted a purchased
   servant by the right of sale, and like one who becomes the bond-slave
   of sin. As though the apostle had said, "That the law is incapable of
   hindering the strength and operation of sin in men who are under the
   law, arises from this, that men under the law are carnal; in whom
   therefore the law, though it is spiritual, does not possess so much
   power as to enable it to restrain the strong inclination of the flesh
   to things which are evil and contrary to the law. And since sin, by a
   certain right of its own, exercises dominion over those men who are
   under the law, therefore it comes to pass that they have been made
   bond-slaves to sin, and are bound and "fettered like a purchased
   menial." 14. The apostle immediately subjoins a proof, in the fifteenth
   verse, not so much of the fact that a man under the law is carnal, as
   that he is the slave of sin. But the proof is taken from the peculiar
   adjunct or effect of a purchased servant, in these words: "For that
   which I do I allow not." For a servant does not do that which seems
   good to himself, but that which his master is pleased to prescribe to
   him; because thus is the word "I allow" used in this passage, for "I
   approve." But if any one thinks that it is here used in its proper
   signification, the argument will be the same, and equal its validity;
   "for," as Christ has told us, "the servant knoweth not what his Lord
   doeth;" (John xv. 15;) neither is his Lord bound, nor is he accustomed,
   to make known to his servant all his will, except so far as it seems
   proper to himself to employ the services of his menial through the
   knowledge of that will. 15. But the first signification of the word is
   better accommodated to this passage, and seems to be required by those
   things which follow; for a more ample explanation of this argument is
   produced in the following words: "For what I would, that do I not; but
   what I hate, that do I;" which is an evident token of a will that is
   subjugated, and subject to the will of another; that is, to the will of
   sin. Therefore he is the servant and the slave of sin. 16. The apostle
   now deduces two consectaries from this, by the first of which he
   excuses the law, and by the second, he throws on sin all the blame
   respecting this matter, as he had also done in a previous part of the
   chapter. The first consectary is, "if, then, I do that which I would
   not, I consent unto the law that it is good." (16.) That is, "if I
   unwillingly do that which sin prescribes to me, now, indeed, I consent
   unto the law that it is good, as being that against which sin is
   committed. I assent to the law that commands, though, while placed
   under the dominion of sin, I am unable to perform what it prescribes."
   The second consectary is, "Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin
   that dwelleth in me." (17.) That is, "therefore, because I reluctantly
   do what I do, not at my own option but at that of another, that Is, of
   my master, who is sin; it follows from this, that it is not I who do
   it, but sin which dwells in me, has the dominion over me, and impels me
   to do it." 17. Having treated upon these subjects in the manner now
   stated, the apostle returns to the same rendering of the cause and the
   proof of it. The eighteenth verse contains the rendering of the cause,
   in these words: "For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth
   no good thing:" Wherefore it is not surprising that the law, though it
   be spiritual, is not able to break the power of sin in a man who is
   under the law; for that which is good does not dwell, that is, has not
   the dominion, in a carnal man who is under the law. The proof of this
   is subjoined in the same verse: "For to will is present with me; but
   how to perform that which is good I find not." Or, "I do not find how I
   can perform any thing good." 18. The more ample explanation of it is
   given in the nineteenth verse, "For the good that I would, I do not;
   but the evil that I would not, that I do;" which is an evident token
   that no good thing dwelleth in my flesh. For if any good thing dwelt in
   my flesh, I should then be actually capable of performing that to which
   my mind and will are inclined. He then deduces once more the second
   consectary, in the twentieth verse: "Now if I do that I would not, it
   is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me." 19. But from all
   these arguments, in the twenty-first verse he concludes the thing
   intended: "I find then a law, [which is imposed in this way,] that,
   when I would do good, evil is present with me." That is, In reality,
   therefore, I find from the circumstance of "to will being present with
   me," but of not being capable of performing what is good, that evil or
   sin is present with me, and not only has it a place in me but it
   likewise prevails. This conclusion does not differ in meaning from the
   rendering of the cause which is comprised in the fourteenth verse, in
   this expression: "But I am carnal, sold under sin." But in the two
   subsequent verses, the twenty-second and twenty-third, the apostle
   proves the conclusion which immediately preceded; and, in proving it,
   he more clearly explains whence and how it happens, that a man who is
   under the law cannot have dominion over sin, and that, whether willing
   or unwilling, such a person is compelled to fulfill the lusts of sin;
   and he says, "for I delight in the law of God after the inward man; but
   I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind,
   and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my
   members." 20. At the close, from a consideration of the miserable state
   of those men who are under the law, a votive exclamation is raised for
   their deliverance from this tyranny and servitude of sin, in the
   following terms: "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver (or
   snatch) me from the body of this death?" That is, not from this mortal
   body, but from the dominion of sin, which he here calls the body of
   death, as he calls it also in other passages the body of sin. 21. To
   this exclamation he subjoins a reply--"the grace of God, through Jesus
   Christ our Lord, will deliver thee"--or a thanksgiving, in which the
   apostle intimates, in his own person, whence deliverance must be sought
   and expected. In the last place, a conclusion is annexed to the whole
   investigation, in the latter part of the twenty-fifth verse, in which
   is briefly defined the entire condition of a man under the law, that
   had been previously and at great length described; "so then, with the
   mind, I myself, serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of
   sin." And in this manner is concluded the seventh chapter. 22. But in
   order that these arguments, after having been reduced to a small
   compass, may be perceived at a single glance, let us briefly
   recapitulate this second part likewise, in the following manner: "We
   have already declared, that sin has dominion over those men who are
   under the law: But the cause of this is, that, though the law itself is
   spiritual, and though the men who are under it consent unto it that it
   is good, and though they will what is good and delight in the law of
   God after the inward man; yet these very men who are under the law are
   carnal, sold under sin, have no good thing dwelling in their flesh, but
   have sin dwelling in them, and evil is present with them; they have
   likewise a law in their members which not only wars against the law of
   their mind, but which also renders them captives to the law of sin
   which is in their members. Of this matter it is a certain and evident
   token, that the good which such men would, they do not; but the evil
   which they hate, that they do; and that when they will to do good, they
   do not obtain the ability. Hence it is undoubtedly evident, that they
   are not themselves the masters of their own acts, but sin which
   dwelleth in them; to which is also chiefly to be ascribed the
   culpability of the evil which is committed by these men who are like
   the reluctant perpetrators of it. But on this account, these persons,
   from the shewing of the law, having become acquainted with their
   misery, are compelled to cry out, and to implore the grace of Jesus
   Christ."

  VERSE THE FOURTEENTH 1.

   A closer investigation of this question and a demonstration taken from
   the text itself, that the apostle is here treating about a man paced
   under the law, and not under grace. 2. The manner in which Carnal and
   spiritual are opposed to each other in the scriptures. 3. An objection
   taken from 1 Corinthians iii. 1,2; and a reply to it. 4. The meaning of
   the phrase, sold under sin. The views of Calvin and Beza on this verse.
   1. Having, in the preceding manner, considered the disposition and
   economy of the whole chapter, let us now somewhat more strictly
   investigate the question proposed by us, which is this: "Are those
   things which are recorded, from the fourteenth verse to the end of the
   seventh chapter, to be understood concerning a man who is under the
   law, or concerning one who is under grace?" First of all, let some
   attention be bestowed on the connection of the fourteenth verse with
   those which preceded it; for the rational particle gar "for," indicates
   its connection with the preceding. This connection shows, that the same
   subject is discussed in this verse, as in those before it; and the
   pronoun egw I, must be understood as relating to the same man, as had
   been signified in the previous verses by the same pronoun. But the
   investigation in the former part of the chapter was respecting a man
   who is under the law, and the pronoun "I" had previously denoted the
   man who was under the law: Therefore, in this fourteenth verse also, in
   which a, cause is given of that which had been before explained, a man
   under the law is still the subject. If it be otherwise, the whole of it
   is nothing less than loose reasoning; nor, in this case, have we ever
   been able to perceive even any probable connection, according to which
   these consequences that follow can be in coherence with the matters
   preceding, and which has been adduced by those who suppose that, in the
   first thirteen verses of this seventh chapter, the discourse refers to
   a man under the law, but that in the fourteenth verse and those which
   follow, the subject of the discourse is a man under grace. If any one
   denies this, let him attempt to make out the connection [between the
   two portions of the chapter which have just been specified]. Some of
   those who have entertained that opinion, perceiving the difficulty of
   such an undertaking, interpret this fourteenth verse as well as those
   which preceded it, as relating to a man under the law, but the
   fifteenth and following verses as applicable to a man under grace.
   This, also, we shall hereafter perceive. Secondly. In the same
   fourteenth verse, that man about whom the apostle treats under his own
   person, is said to be carnal; but a man who is regenerate and placed
   under grace is not carnal, but spiritual. Therefore, it is a matter of
   the greatest certainty, that the subject of the apostle in this verse
   is not a man placed under grace. But a man who is under the law is
   carnal; therefore, it is plain that the subject of discourse in this
   verse is a man under the law. I prove that a regenerate man, one who is
   placed under grace, is neither carnal, nor so designated in the
   Scriptures. In Romans viii. 9, it is said "but ye are not in the flesh,
   but in the Spirit." And in the verse preceding, it is said, "so then
   they that are in the flesh cannot please God:" But a regenerate man,
   one who is placed under grace, pleases God. In Romans viii. 5, it is
   said "They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh,"
   but [as it is expressed in the same verse] a man under grace "minds the
   things of the Spirit." In Gal. v. 24, it is said, "They that are
   Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts;" and
   they that "have crucified the flesh" are not carnal. But men who are
   regenerate and placed under grace "are Christ's and have crucified the
   flesh." Therefore, such men as answer this description are not carnal.
   In Romans viii. 14, it is said, "As many as are led by the Spirit of
   God, they are the sons of God." Therefore, they are "led by the Spirit
   of God;" but such persons are spiritual. 2. But it is here objected,
   "the same man may, in a different respect, be called carnal and
   spiritual--spiritual,' so far as he is regenerate through the
   Spirit--carnal' so far as he is unregenerate; for, as long as man is in
   this mortal body, he is not fully regenerate. From this arises a
   two-fold signification of the work carnal': one denotes a man purely
   carnal, in whom sin has the dominion; the other denotes a man partly
   carnal and partly spiritual." Answer: I grant, according to the
   Scriptures, that man is not fully and perfectly regenerate so long as
   he is in the present life. But this admission must be correctly
   apprehended, that is, that such perfection be understood as relating
   not to the essence and essential parts of regeneration itself, but to
   the degree and measure of the quantity. For the business of
   regeneration is not carried on in such a manner, that a man is
   regenerate or renewed with regard to some of his faculties, but remains
   with regard to others of them altogether in the oldness of depraved
   nature. But this second birth is ordered in the same manner as our
   first nativity, by which we are born human beings--that is, partaking
   entirely of human nature, but not in the perfection of adult manhood.
   Thus also, does the power of regeneration pervade all the faculties of
   man, none of them excepted; but it does not pervade them perfectly at
   the first moment; for it is carried on gradually, and by daily
   advances, until it is expanded or drawn out to a full and mature age in
   Christ Hence, the whole man is said to be regenerated, according to all
   his faculties, mind, affections and will; and he is, therefore, with
   regard to these, his regenerated faculties, a spiritual person. But as
   in the Scripture, a spiritual man and a carnal man are opposed to each
   other in their entire definitions, [for the former of them is one who
   walks according to the Spirit, and the latter is he that walks after
   the flesh, and as the one is mentioned for the opposite of the other,)
   in this respect indeed, the same man cannot be said to be at once both
   spiritual and carnal. And thus I reject, according to the Scriptures,
   this distinction of carnal persons, by which some of them are called
   carnal, in whom sin has dominion on the predominant part, and by which
   others receive the appellation of carnal men, in whom the flesh
   contends against the Spirit on the part which is less powerful; for the
   rejection of this distinction, I have the permission of Scripture,
   which is not accustomed to reckon the latter of these two classes in
   the number of carnal persons. This is expressed in a very significant
   manner by Leo, on the resurrection of our Lord, in the following words:
   "Though we are saved by hope, and still bear about with us corruption
   and mortal flesh, yet we are correctly said not to be in the flesh if
   carnal affections have not dominion over us, and we deservedly lay
   aside and discard the name of that thing whose will we no longer
   follow."' But were this, their distinction, allowed, still, that is not
   yet proved which they attempt, unless it be demonstrated that this man
   is called carnal, not in the first of these respects or senses, but in
   the second--not because sin has the dominion in him, but because the
   flesh contends against the Spirit, which is a result that can never be
   deduced from the text itself: For It is evident that, in the man whom
   the apostle here calls carnal, sin has the dominion, and the party of
   the flesh is more powerful in him than that of the Spirit. Because "sin
   dwelleth in him, he does the evil that he would not, and he does not
   the good which he would; to perform what is good, finds not; but sin,
   which dwelleth in him, perpetrates that which is evil; he is brought
   into captivity to the law of sin, or he is a captive under the law of
   sin." All these are certain and manifest tokens of sin, which has the
   dominion. Nor is it any valid objection, that the man is compelled,
   though unwilling and reluctant, to obey sin; for the dominion of sin is
   two fold--either with the consent of him who sins, or against his
   conscience, and his consent arising from his conscience. For whether a
   servant obeys his Lord willingly or unwillingly, he is still the
   servant of him to whom he yields obedience. This is such a certain
   truth, that no one is able to come from the servitude of sin to
   liberty, except through this way--the way of this hatred of servitude,
   and of this desire of obtaining deliverance. 3. But some one will say,
   "Even those who are under grace are called carnal in" 1 Corinthians
   iii. 1,2. I reply, The question does not relate to the word itself; but
   to its true meaning and the thing signified by it. We must try,
   therefore, whether this word has the same signification in this passage
   as it has in the seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans. But they
   [at Corinth] are called carnal with respect to knowledge, and in
   reference to feeling or inclination. In this sense, being unskillful
   and inexperienced in the doctrine of piety, and the knowledge of the
   gospel, they are called carnal in opposition to those who are
   spiritual, who know how to "judge all things," (1 Cor. ii. 15,) and who
   are also called "who are perfect," in (1 Cor. ii. 6,) and, in this
   sense, "babes in Christ," and those who have need to be fed with milk
   are called carnal. But with respect to feeling or inclination, those
   men are called carnal in whom human and carnal affections have the
   dominion and prevail, and who are said, in other passages, to be in the
   flesh, and to walk according to the flesh, in opposition to those who
   are spiritual, who, "through the Spirit, have mortified the deeds of
   the flesh and have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts."
   But the apostle seems here to bestow this appellation on the
   Corinthians, or on some of them, with this two-fold reference; for he
   says that, with respect to knowledge, they are "babes in Christ," that
   is, unskillful and inexperienced in the doctrine of piety, who had to
   be "fed with milk, and who were not able to bear solid food." But with
   respect to affections, he says that they "are carnal, and walk as men,"
   on account of the contentions and divisions which prevailed among them,
   from which it was evident that, in them, the flesh had the predominance
   over the Spirit. But in whatever sense or manner the word is used in
   this passage, it brings no advantage to the cause of those who declare
   that the apostle calls himself a carnal man in Romans vii. 14. For if
   the same word is not used in 1 Corinthians iii. 1, in a sense similar
   to that which it bears in Romans vii. 14, then it is adduced in an
   unlearned and useless manner in elucidation of this question; for
   equivocation is the fruitful parent of error. If the word is to be
   received in the same sense in both passages, then I am at liberty
   firmly to conclude from this, in favour of my opinion, that the apostle
   cannot be called carnal in Romans 7, for under that appellation he
   severely reprehends the Corinthians because he "was not able to speak
   unto them as unto spiritual persons," since they were such as were
   still carnal; which he would have done without any just cause, if he
   were himself also comprehended under that title when understood in the
   same signification. 4. Thirdly. The same man about whom the apostle is
   here treating, is also said, in this, the fourteenth verse, to be sold
   under sin, or, (which is the same thing,) the slave of sin, and become
   its servant by purchase, which title can, in no sense whatsoever, be
   adapted to men placed under grace--a misappropriation of epithet,
   against which the Scriptures openly reclaim in many passages: "If the
   Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed." (John
   viii. 36.) "For he that is dead" is justified, that is, he "is freed
   from sin" (Rom. vi. 7.) "But God be thanked that ye were the servants
   of sin; being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of
   righteousness," or those who are completely subject to it. (Rom. vi.
   17,18.) But that the two things here specified [the service of sin, and
   that of righteousness] are so opposed to each other, as not to be able
   to meet together at once in the same individual, is evident from the
   twentieth verse of the same chapter: "For when ye were the servants of
   sin, ye were free from righteousness." But that the same remark applies
   to a man who is under the law, is apparent from a comparison of 2
   Corinthians iii. 17, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
   liberty," with Gal. v. 18, "But if ye be led of Spirit, ye are not
   under the law;" therefore, they who are of the Spirit are free. But
   such persons are not under the law; therefore, those who are under the
   law are not free, but are the servants of sin. For, whether any one
   unwillingly, and compelled by the force of sin, obeys it, or whether it
   willingly--whether anyone becomes the slave of sin by the deed of his
   first parents, or whether, in addition to this, "he has sold himself to
   work evil in the sight of the Lord," as it is related concerning Ahab
   in 1 Kings xxi. 20. In each of these cases is the man truly and
   deservedly called the servant of sin. "For of whom a man is overcome,
   of the same is he brought into bondage." (2 Pet. ii. 19.) And
   "whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." (John viii. 34.)
   "Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his
   servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of
   obedience unto righteousness?" (Rom. vi. 16.) For the different mode of
   servitude does not exempt or discharge [the subject of it] from
   servitude, but is conclusive that he is under it. Should any one reply,
   concerning the man mentioned in Romans vii. 14, "that he is not simply
   called the servant of sin, but that he is so denominated with this
   restriction--that he is the servant of sin with respect to the flesh,
   and not with respect to the mind, as is apparent from the last verse of
   the same chapter, which is an explanation of this verse," I rejoin that
   this man is simply called the servant of sin, but of the description of
   those who unwillingly and with a reluctant conscience serve sin. But
   with respect to the manner in which the last verse of the chapter is to
   be understood, we shall perceive what it is when we arrive at that
   part. But the greater part of the divines of our profession acknowledge
   that this fourteenth verse must be understood as relating to an
   unregenerate man, to one who is not placed under grace. Thus Calvin
   observes on verse, "The apostle now begins to bring the law and the
   nature of man a little more closely into hostile contact with each
   other." And on the subsequent verse he says, "He now descends to the
   more particular example of a man already regenerate." Thus also, Beza,
   against Castellio, in the refutation of the first argument to the
   thirteenth and fourteenth calumny, (fol. 413,) says, "St. Paul exclaims
   that he is not sufficient even to think that which is good; and in
   another passage, considering himself not within the boundaries of
   grace, he says, But I am carnal, sold under sin."

  VERSE THE FIFTEENTH

   1. He does not approve of that which he does, neither does he do that
   which he would, but he does that which he hates. 2. The nature of the
   contest carried on in man. 3. The opinion of St. Augustine and Peter
   Martyr, respecting the conflict in men who are not born again. 1. The
   fifteenth verse contains a proof of the affirmation in the preceding
   verse, which is, that the man about whom the apostle is treating, is
   "sold under sin" or is the bond-slave of sin. For the argument is taken
   from the office and proper effect of a purchased servant, and of one
   who has no legal control over himself, but who is subjected to the
   power of another. For it is the property of a servant, not to execute
   his own will, but that of his lord, whether he does this willingly and
   with full consent, or he does it with the judgment of his own mind
   exclaiming against it, and with his will resisting it. This is
   expressed in no unskillful manner by St. Augustine, in his Retractions
   (lib. I, cap. i, ) "he who by the flesh that lusteth against the
   Spirit, does those things which he would not, lusteth indeed
   unwillingly; and in this he does not that which he would; but if he be
   overcome [by the flesh lusting against the Spirit] he willingly
   consents to his lusts--and in this he does nothing but what he has
   willed, that is, devoid of righteousness and the servant of sin." This
   is confirmed by Zanchius, on the works of Redemption: (lib. I, cap.
   iii, ) "Undoubtedly Peter, therefore, denied Christ because he would,
   though he did not that with a full will, but reluctantly." But the
   proof [which the apostle adduces in the fifteenth verse] is
   accommodated to the condition of the man about whom he is treating,
   that is, of a man who is under the law, and who is the servant of sin
   just so far as to serve it not with full consent, but with a conscience
   crying out against it. For these are the words of the apostle: "For
   that which I do, I allow not," that is, I do not approve of it. This
   sentiment, he explains and proves more at large in the words which
   immediately follow in the same verse: "For what I would, that do I not;
   but what I hate, that I do," from which we frame this syllogism. He who
   approves not of that which he does, nor does that which he would, is
   the slave of another, that is, of sin; But the man about whom the
   apostle is treating, approves not of that which he does, nor does what
   he would, but he does that which he hates: Therefore, the man who is in
   this place the subject of discussion, is the slave of another, that is,
   of sin; and therefore the same man is unregenerate, and not placed
   under grace. 2. But perhaps you will say, "In this passage is described
   a contest in the man about whom the apostle is treating, which contest
   cannot take place in a man who is unregenerate." Answer. In this
   passage, the contest between this man and sin is not described; but the
   dominion of sin, and the servitude of the man himself under sin, are
   demonstrated from the proper effect of a servant by purchase, which
   effect, in reality, is not produced by this man without much reluctance
   of conscience and great mental struggles, which precede the very
   production of the act; but this deed is not committed except by a mind
   which is conquered and overcome by the force of sin. Then I deny the
   preceding affirmation that, in an unregenerate man, of what description
   soever he may be, there is discovered no contest of the mind or
   conscience with the inclinations and desires of the flesh and of sin.
   Nay, I further assert and affirm, that, in a man who is under the law,
   there is necessarily a conflict between the mind and conscience on the
   one part, that prescribe those things which are just and honest, and
   the inclinations or motions of sin, on the other, which impel the man
   to things that are unlawful and forbidden. For the Scriptures describe
   to us a two-fold conflict against sin--the First, that of the flesh,
   and of the mind or the conscience-the Second, that of the flesh, or
   sin, and of the Spirit. The former of these obtains in all those who
   have a knowledge of what is righteous and iniquitous, of what is just
   and unjust, "in whose hearts is written the work of the law, and whose
   thoughts, in the mean while, either accuse or excuse one another," as
   it is recorded in Romans ii. 15, "who hold the truth in
   unrighteousness," (i, 18) whose consciences are not yet seared as with
   a hot iron, who are not yet "past all feeling," (Ephes. iv. 19,) and
   who know the will of their Lord, but do it not. (Luke xii. 47) 3. This
   view of the matter is confirmed to us by St. Augustine, in his book
   "The Exposition of certain propositions in the Epistle to the
   Romans,"(cap. 3) in which he says, "Before the law, that is, in the
   state or degree before the law, we do not fight; because we not only
   lust and sin, but sins have also our approval. Under the law we fight,
   but are overcome; for we confess that those things which we do, are
   evil; and, by making such confession, we intimate that we would not do
   them. But, because we have not yet any grace we are conquered. In this
   condition it is shown to us, in what situation we be; and while we are
   desirous of rising up, and still fall down, we are the more grievously
   afflicted," &c. This is likewise acknowledged by Peter Martyr, who
   observes, on Romans v. 8, "We do not deny that there is occasionally
   some contest of this kind in unregenerate men; not because their minds
   are not carnal and inclined to vicious pursuits, but because in them
   are still engraven the laws of nature, and because in them shines some
   illumination of the Spirit of God, though it be not such as can justify
   them, or can produce a saving change." The latter contest, that between
   the flesh and the Spirit, obtains in the regenerate alone. For in that
   heart in which the Spirit of God neither is nor dwells, there can be no
   contest--though some persons are said to "resist the Holy Spirit," and,
   to "sin against the Holy Ghost," which expressions have another
   meaning. The difference between these two contests is very manifest
   from the diversity of the issue or consequence of each: For, in the
   first, the flesh overcomes; but, in the latter, the Spirit usually
   gains the victory and becomes the conqueror. This may be seen by a
   comparison of this passage with Gal. v. 16,17 -- a comparison which we
   will afterwards undertake. But from the proper effects of the law
   itself, it may be most certainly demonstrated that a contest against
   sin is carried on within a man who is so under the law as that it has
   discharged all its office towards him, and has exerted all its powers
   in him. For it is the effect of the law to convict a man, already
   convicted of sin, of the righteousness of God, to incite him to
   obedience, to convince him of his own weakness, to inflame him with a
   desire to be delivered, and to compel him to seek for deliverance. It
   is well known, however, that these effects cannot be completed without
   a contest against indwelling sin. But we have already said that about
   such a man as this the apostle treats in this passage - - one who is in
   this manner under the law. If any man will yet obstinately maintain,
   that all unregenerate persons in general perpetrate that to the
   commission of which, sin and the flesh persuade, with full consent and
   without any reluctance, let him not view it as a grievance if I demand
   proof for his assertion, since it is made against express testimonies
   of Scripture, and since many examples may be adduced in proof of the
   contrary, such as that of Balsam, who, against his own conscience,
   obeyed the king of Moab--that of Saul, who, against his own conscience,
   persecuted David--that of the Pharisees, who, through obstinate malice,
   resisted the Holy Spirit, &c. But even that very common distinction,
   which sins are distinguished into those of ignorance, infirmity and
   malice, is likewise by this method destroyed, if all unregenerate
   persons commit sin with full assent and without any struggle or
   reluctance. I am desirous also, on this occasion, to bring to the
   recollection of the adverse party, the steps or degrees by which God is
   accustomed to convert his children to himself from wickedness of life,
   and which, if they will diligently and without prejudice consider, they
   will perceive that the contest between the mind and the flesh, which is
   excited by the law, must of necessity be placed among the beginnings
   and the precursors of regeneration.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VERSE THE SIXTEENTH.

   1. He consents to the law that it is good; a consectary deduced. 2. An
   objection answered. 3. A second objection. 1. From what has preceded, a
   consectary or consequence is deduced for the excuse of the law, in the
   following words: "If then, I do that which I would not, I consent unto
   the law that it is good." In this verse nothing is said, which may not,
   in the best possible manner and without any controversy, agree with one
   who is under the law. For unless a man under the law yields his assent
   to it that it is good, he is not at all under the law: For this is the
   first effect of the law in those whom it will subject to itself--to
   convince them of its equity and justice; and when this is done, such
   consent necessarily arises. It is also apparent from the first and
   second chapters of the epistle to the Romans, and from the tenth
   chapter, in which "a zeal of God touching the law" is attributed to the
   Jews, that this consent is not peculiar to a regenerate man, nor is it
   the proper effect of the regenerating Spirit. 2. If any one say, "The
   subject in this passage is that assent by which a man assents to the
   whole law of God, and which cannot be in those who do not understand
   the whole law, but none among the unregenerate understands the entire
   law of God," I reply, FIRST, it can never be affirmed with truth, that
   "none among the unregenerate understands the entire law" while the
   following passages exclaim against such an assertion: "That servant who
   knew his Lord's will and did not according to it, shall be beaten with
   many stripes." (Luke xii. 47) "Though I have the gift of prophecy, and
   understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all
   faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, it
   profiteth me nothing;" (1 Cor. xiii. 2 ) "Knowledge puffeth up, but
   charity edifieth;" (1 Cor. viii. 1) "For it had been better for them
   not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known
   it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them." (2 Pet. ii.
   21.) Secondly. Neither can this affirmation be truly made in every
   case: "No man assents to the entire law unless he understands the whole
   of it;" for he assents to the whole law who knows it to be from God and
   to be good, though he may not particularly understand all things which
   are prescribed and forbidden in the law. And where, among the
   regenerate, is that man to be found who dares to claim for himself such
   a knowledge of the whole law? Thirdly. That which is appropriately
   subservient to this purpose, is, a denial that this passage has any
   reference to that consent by which a man assents to all the precepts Of
   the law as being specially understood; for neither do the words
   themselves indicate any such thing, nor does the analogy of the
   connection permit it. Because it is concluded from the circumstance of
   his doing what he would not, that he "consents unto the law that it is
   good "which conclusion cannot be deduced from this deed if it be said,
   that this expression relates to the consent which arises from a special
   acquaintance with and an understanding of all the precepts of the law.
   For that which this man here says that he does, is a particular deed;
   it is, therefore, prohibited by some special precept of the law, the
   knowledge and approval of which is the cause why he who does that deed
   does it with reluctance. Hence, as from a consequent, it is concluded
   from this deed thus performed, (that Is committed with a mind crying
   out and striving against it,) that he who commits the deed in this
   manner, consents to the law that it is good. 3. But some one will
   perhaps rejoin and say, "This passage does not relate to the consent of
   general estimation, which may be possessed, and is so, in reality, by
   many of the unregenerate. But it has reference to the consent of
   particular approbation, which is the peculiar act of the regenerating
   Spirit." Such an objector ought to know that those things which are
   confidently uttered without any attempt at proof, may, with equal
   freedom, be rejected without offering the smallest reason. The thing
   itself, however, evinces the contrary; for, to consent to the law that
   it is good, is not to approve in particular a deed which has been
   prescribed by the law; for this consent of particular approbation
   cannot consist with the perpetration of a deed which is particularly
   disapproved. But the commission of such an act agrees well with the
   consent about which the apostle here treats.

  VERSE THE SEVENTEENTH

   1. He no longer himself perpetrates this evil, but it is done by sin
   that dwelleth in him, a second Consectary deduced. 2. From this verse
   are drawn two arguments for the contrary opinion, both of which are
   refuted--the first argument, and a reply to it. 3. The second argument
   and a reply. 4. An argument from this verse in favour of true opinion.
   5. On the word dwelling, or inhabiting, according to its signification,
   and the usage of Scripture, with quotations from Zanchius, Bucer, Peter
   Martyr, and Musculus. 1. From the preceding verses is deduced another
   consectary, by which this man transfers to sin all the blame of this
   matter--not to excuse himself, that be far from him, for the law has
   been given and written on his heart, that "his thoughts may accuse or
   else excuse one another, but to point out his servile condition under
   the dominion of sin. In this consectary, therefore, nothing can be
   contained which does not agree with a man who is under the law. If it
   were otherwise, the consectary would contain more than was to be found
   in the premises, which, it has been demonstrated, agree extremely well
   with a man who is under the law. 2. But let us see the words of the
   consectary: "Now then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that
   dwelleth in me," that is, sin that dwelleth in me, does this." From
   these words, the opposite party seem capable of eliciting two arguments
   in support of the opinion which affirms that the apostle is here
   treating about a regenerate man and one who is placed under grace. The
   First of these arguments is of this kind: -- "It cannot be said of
   unregenerate men when they sin, that they do not commit it themselves,
   but that it is committed by sin which dwells in them. But this is most
   appropriately said about the regenerate: Therefore, the man about whom
   the apostle here treats, is "not an unregenerate man, but one who is
   regenerate." Answer. The antecedent must be examined; for, when it is
   either granted or denied, the consequence is also granted or denied.
   (1.) It is evident, that it cannot simply be affirmed concerning any
   man, whatever his condition may be, that he does of himself commit the
   sin which he commits; for this is a contradiction in the adjunct; and
   the apostle declares, that this man "does evil." Therefore, if this can
   be said with truth, the expression must be understood relatively and in
   a certain respect. But this relation or respect ought to be founded
   either in the man himself who perpetrates the offense, or in the
   perpetration itself. (i.) If this respect be founded in the man
   himself, it must be thus generally explained and enunciated--"The sin
   which this man commits, he does as he is such a one; and he does not as
   he is such a one." (ii.) If the respect be founded in the perpetration
   and the effecting of the sin, then it must be taken from the varied
   relation of causes of the same kind to the effect. But in this passage,
   the apostle is treating on the efficient cause of sin, which is here
   allowed to be two-fold--The man, and sin dwelling in him, but so as
   this may be said to be effected by indwelling sin, and not by the man.
   Wherefore, this effect must be taken from the distribution of the
   efficient cause, by which it is distributed into that which is primary
   and principal, and that which is secondary and less principal. (2.) It
   can by no means be said by him who is inspired with a sincere love of
   truth, that this two-fold respect is applicable only to a man who is
   regenerate and placed under grace, but that it does not at all
   appertain to a man placed under the law or does not in the least agree
   with him. For as this respect or relation is two-fold in the
   regenerate, On account of the imperfection of regeneration in this
   life, and the remains of "the old man," according to which respect it
   may be said concerning a regenerate man, that "as he is regenerate he
   does this, and as he is not regenerate he does it not or does not do it
   perfectly;" so, likewise, in a man under the law, the respect is
   two-fold on account of the coming in of the law; for he is "carnal" and
   "the servant of sin," and is under the law, that is, "he consents to
   the law that it is good," which consent is neither of the flesh nor
   according to the flesh, that is, it is not from depraved nature.
   Wherefore, it may be said concerning a man under the law, that he
   commits sin, not as he is under the taw, nor as he consents to the law
   that it is good, but as he is carnal and the servant of sin. (3.) The
   second respect (according to which the effect, that has simply
   proceeded from two concurrent causes, is taken away from one of them
   and ascribed to the other) seems to hold the chief place in this
   passage, as it does also in this saying of the apostle, "I laboured
   more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which
   was with me." (1 Cor. xv. 10.) For it is well known to be a very
   general practice to ascribe the effect to the principal and primary of
   two concurrent causes, at the same time taking away the same effect
   from the secondary cause; especially if by some means, either beyond
   nature, or against the will and by the force of the superior cause, the
   secondary one has been drawn forth to efficiency. Thus, an ambassador
   who manages the cause of his prince, is not said himself to act, but
   his prince, who makes use of his services. Thus, much more
   appropriately, if a servant, who is oppressed by a tyrannical lord,
   does something against his own will at the command and through the
   compulsion of his lord, he will not himself be said to do this, but his
   lord who has the dominion over him. And it is most manifest, to every
   one who will look upon these words of the apostle with unjaundiced
   eyes, that they convey this meaning; as is apparent from the epithet
   which is attributed to sin, the perpetrator of this evil, and by which
   the dominion of sin is denoted, that is, "sin that dwelleth in me does
   it." (4.) It is no matter of wonder, that "he does it not, but sin does
   it;" for "when the law came, sin revived and he died." (Rom. vii. 9)
   Therefore, the cause of actions, is that which lives, and not that
   which is dead. It is apparent, then, that the first part of the
   antecedent in this argument is false, and on this account the second
   part is not reciprocal; therefore, the conclusion cannot be deduced
   from it by good consequence, which consequence concludes [that the
   apostle is here treating] about a regenerate man, to the exclusion of
   the unregenerate, 3. The second argument is drawn from the adverbs of
   time, "now," and "no more," which are used in this verse; and from
   which a conclusion is thus drawn in favour of the same opinion: "These
   adverbs have respect to time antecedent; but the time antecedent is the
   time when the man was not regenerate. As though he had said, Formerly,
   when I was not yet regenerated, I committed sin; but now I no longer do
   this, because I am regenerated. Therefore, it is apparent that this
   present time, which is signified by the adverb "now," must be
   understood concerning the state of regeneration, since it cannot be
   said concerning an unregenerate man, that "though he formerly committed
   sin, he commits it no more." Answer.--I grant it to be a great truth,
   that these adverbs denote relation to time antecedent, and that in fact
   the passage is thus commodiously explained: Formerly indeed perpetrated
   evil, but now I no longer do this. But I deny that the time antecedent
   embraces the entire state before regenerations; for the state of
   unregeneracy, or that which is prior to regeneration, is distinguished
   by our author, the apostle himself, into another twofold state--before
   or without the law, and under the law, as it is expressed in the ninth
   verse of this very chapter. And the antecedent time, in reference to
   which it is said "now" and "no more," comprises the state without the
   law; but the present time [described by the two adverbs] comprises the
   state under the law. As if he had said, "Formerly, when I was without
   the law, I committed sin, but now, when I am under the law, I no longer
   commit it, but sin that dwelleth in me." This is in unison with what is
   said in the ninth verse: "For I was alive without the law once," or
   formerly; "but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died."
   For, while "he was alive without the law," he committed evil without
   any reluctance of mind or of will. Therefore, at that time, he did
   evil; but now, being placed under the law, he undoubtedly commits sin,
   but he does it against his conscience and not without resistance on the
   part of his will. Wherefore, the cause and culpability of sin must be
   ascribed, not so much to the man himself, as to the violent impulse of
   sin. 4. Thus far we have perceived, that this verse contains nothing
   which can afford support to the opposite opinion. Let us further see
   whether an argument may not be elicited from it, for establishing the
   truth of the other opinion, which declares that it must be understood
   concerning an unregenerate man, and one who is placed under the law:
   The apostle says that "sin dwelleth in this man." But sin does not
   dwell in those who are regenerate. Therefore, the apostle is not, in
   this passage, treating about the regenerate or those who are placed
   under grace, but about the unregenerate and those who are under the
   law. One of the premises of this syllogism is in the text: the other
   must be demonstrated by us. I am aware indeed, that this seems
   wonderful to those who are accustomed to the distinction of sin, by
   which one kind is called ruling or governing, and another receives the
   appellation of sin existing within us, or of indwelling and inhabiting
   sin, and who suppose that the former of these epithets is peculiar to
   the unregenerate, and the latter to the regenerate. But if any one
   require a proof of this distinction, those who ought to give it will
   evince a degree of hesitation. But is not one kind of sin ruling or
   reigning, and another existing within and not reigning, and is not the
   former peculiar to the unregenerate, and the latter to the regenerate?
   Who can deny, when the Scriptures affirm, that there are in us the
   remains of sin and of the old man as long as we survive in this mortal
   life? But what man, conversant with the Scriptures, shall distinguish
   reigning from indwelling or inhabiting sin, and will account indwelling
   sin to be the same as the sin existing within? Indeed, indwelling sin
   is reigning sin, and reigning is indwelling, and therefore sin does not
   dwell in the regenerate, because it does not domineer or rule in them.
   I prove the first part of this, both from the very signification of the
   word to inhabit or dwell, and from the familiar usage of the
   Scriptures. 5. Concerning the signification of the word, Zanchius
   observes, in his treatise On the Attributes of God, "God is not said to
   dwell in the wicked, but he dwells in the pious. For what is it to
   dwell in any place? It is not simply to be there, as people are at inns
   and places of entertainment during journeys; but it is to reign and
   have the dominion at his pleasure as if in his own residence." (Lib. 2,
   cap. 6, quest. 3.) On Ephes. iii. 17, the same Zanchius says, "In this
   proposition, Christ dwells in your heart by faith, the word to dwell is
   undoubtedly put metaphorically; the metaphor being taken, not from
   those persons who, as tenants or lodgers, and as strangers or
   travelers, tarry for a season in the house or inn belonging to another;
   but it is taken from masters of families, who, in their own proper
   dwelling houses live at liberty, work, govern the family, and exercise
   dominion." Bucer observes, on the very passage which is the subject of
   our meditation, "He says that this destructive force or power dwells in
   him, that is, it entirely occupies him and has the dominion, as is the
   manner of those who are at their own house, in their proper dwelling
   and domicile. The apostle Paul, and all Scripture, frequently employ
   this metaphor of inhabitation or residing; and by it they usually
   signify the dominion and the certain presence, almost perpetually, of
   that which is said to inhabit." And this is one of his subsequent
   remarks: "When, in this manner, sin resides in us, it completely and
   more powerfully besieges us and exercises dominion." Peter Martyr says,
   on Romans viii. 9, "The metaphor of habitation, or indwelling, is taken
   from this circumstance--that they who inhabit a house, not only occupy
   it, but also govern in it and order [all things in it] at their own
   option." The subjoined remark is from Musculus on this passage: "And
   that he may evidently express this tyranny and violence of sin, he does
   not say, Sin exists in me,' but Sin dwells in me.' For by the word to
   dwell or inhabit, he shows that the dominion of sin is complete in him;
   and that sin has, as it were, fixed his seat, or taken up his
   residence, in him. Evil reigns in no place with greater power than in
   the place where it has fixed its seat; that is what we see in the case
   of tyrants. Thus, in a contrary manner, God is said to have dwelt in
   the midst of the children of Israel; because among no other people did
   he declare his goodness with such strong evidence, as he did among
   them, according to this expression of the Psalmist--He hath not dealt
   so with any nation. (cxlvii, 20) In this sense, the word to inhabit or
   to dwell, is very often used in the Scriptures. When, therefore, the
   apostle wished to declare the power and tyranny of sin in him, he said
   that it dwelt in him, as in its proper domicile, and thus fully
   reigned." Calvin, in his Institutes, says (lib. iv, cap. 6, sec. 11,)
   that we are circumcised in Christ, with a circumcision not made by
   hands, having laid aside the body of sin which dwelt in our flesh;
   which he calls the circumcision of Christ. (2.) What I have said, in
   accordance with Bucer, about the usage of Scripture, is plain from the
   following passages: "My Father and I will come unto him, and make our
   abode with him." (John xiv. 23.) "But if the Spirit of him that raised
   up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the
   dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth
   in you." (Rom. viii. 11.) "For ye are the temple of the living God; as
   God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be
   their God, and they shall be my people." (2 Cor. vi. 16.) "That Christ
   may dwell in your hearts by faith." (Ephes. iii. 17.) "When I call to
   remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in
   thy grand-mother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in
   thee also." (2 Thess. i. 5.) "That good thing which was committed unto
   thee, keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us." (i, 14.) "Do ye
   think that the Scripture saith in vain, The Spirit that dwelleth in us
   lusteth to envy? (James iv. 5.) "Nevertheless, we, according to his
   promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
   righteousness?' (2 Pet. iii. 13.) "Thou has not denied my faith, even
   in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain
   among you where Satan dwelleth." (Rev. ii. 13.) According to this
   usage, the saints are said to be "a habitation of God through the
   Spirit." (Ephes. ii. 22.) It is manifest, therefore, from the
   signification of the word and its most frequent usage in the Holy
   Scriptures, that indwelling sin is exactly the same as reigning sin.
   But it is easy now, likewise, to demonstrate the second premise in the
   syllogism, (p. 53,) which is, "Sin does not dwell in those who are
   regenerate." For [according to the passages of Scripture quoted in the
   preceding paragraph] the Holy Spirit dwells in them. Christ, also,
   dwells in their hearts by faith; and they are said to be "a habitation
   of God through the Spirit;" therefore, sin does not dwell in them;
   because no man can be inhabited by both God and sin at the same time;
   and when Christ has "overcome the strong man armed," he binds him hand
   and foot and casts him out, and thus occupies his house and dwells in
   it. Sin does not dwell in those who are "dead to sin," and "in whom
   Christ liveth." But the regenerate "do not live in sin," but are "dead
   to it;"(Rom. vi. 2) and in them Christ dwelleth and liveth; (Gal. ii.
   20) therefore, sin does not dwell in the regenerate. Let the two
   subjoined passages of Scripture be compared together: "Now then it is
   no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me:" (Rom. vii. 17) "I
   live; yet no more I, but Christ liveth in me." (Gal. ii. 20.) We shall
   be able by this comparison most fully to demonstrate, that in this
   verse the apostle has not been speaking about himself, but has taken
   upon himself to personate the character of a man who lives to sin, and
   in whom sin lives, dwells and operates. Yet it does not follow from
   this, that no sin is in the regenerate; for it has already been shown,
   that to be in any place, and there to dwell, to have the dominion, and
   to reign, are two different things.

  THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH VERSES

   1. "In this man, (that is, in his flesh,) dwelleth no good thing," &c.
   2. An argument for the contrary opinion is proposed from the eighteenth
   verse--the answer to it. 3. A reply and its rejoinder. 4. Another reply
   and its rejoinder. 5. An argument from the same words in favour of the
   true opinion. 6. The second part of the eighteenth verse, "To will is
   present with this man, but how to perform that which is good, he finds
   not." 7. An argument for the contrary opinion from the second part of
   this verse--the answer to it, with distinctions between each kind of
   willing and nilling, with extracts from St. Augustine, Zanchius and
   Bucer. 8. An argument for the true opinion, from the eighteenth and
   nineteenth verses--the proof of the major proposition, which alone can
   be called in question. 9. An objection and the answer to it. 10.
   Another reply and its rejoinder--not only some other things, but
   likewise those which precede things, that are saving, have a place in
   some of the unregenerate, with extracts in confirmation from St.
   Augustine, and references to Calvin, Beza and Zanchius. 11. The
   dissimilar appellations by which the Scriptures distinguish those who
   are under constraint through the law, from those who are renewed or
   regenerated by the grace of the gospel. 1. Let the 18th verse now be
   brought under consideration, in which the apostle follows up the same
   rendering of a cause, and the proof of it. The rendering of the cause
   is, "For I know that in me, (that is, in my flesh,)dwelleth no good
   thing;" by which words the same thing is signified, as by the
   following: "I am carnal." For he is carnal, in whom no good thing
   dwelleth. The proof is contained in these words: "For to will is
   present with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not." 2.
   From this rendering of the cause, some persons have instituted an
   argument for the support of their opinion, in the following terms: "In
   this man, about whom the apostle is treating, are the flesh, and some
   other thing either distinct or differing from flesh; otherwise, the
   apostle would not have corrected himself by saying, In me, that is, in
   my flesh. "But in unregenerate persons, there is nothing else but the
   flesh; Therefore, the man about whom the apostle here treats, is a
   regenerate person. Answer. I grant, that, "in this man is some other
   thing diverse or distinct from the flesh;" for this is to be seen in
   the apostolical correction. But I deny, that "in unregenerate persons
   is nothing else beside the flesh"--in those unregenerate persons, I
   say, who are under the law, and about whom we are engaged in this
   controversy. I adduce this reason for the justness of my negation;
   because in men who are under the law is a mind which knows some truth
   concerning God and "that which may be known of God," (Rom. i. 18,19)
   which has a knowledge of that which is just and unjust, and whose
   "thoughts accuse or else excuse one another," (ii, 1-15,) which knows
   that the indulgence of carnal desires is sinful, (vii, 7) which says
   that "men must neither steal nor commit adultery," (2, 21,22)&c., &c.
   To certain of the unregenerate, also is attributed some illumination of
   the Holy Ghost, (Heb. vi. 4,) a "knowledge of the Lord and saviour
   Jesus Christ,", a "knowledge of the way of righteousness," (2 Pet. 2,
   20,21) some acquaintance with the will of the Lord, (Luke xii. 47,) the
   gift of prophecy, &c., &c. (1 Cor. 13.) That man who is bold enough to
   style such things as these "the flesh," inflicts a signal injury on God
   and his Spirit. And indeed how, under the appellation of "the flesh"
   can be comprehended that which accuses sin, convinces men of sin, and
   compels them to seek deliverance? There is, then, in men who are under
   the law, "the flesh, and something beside the flesh," that Is a mind
   imbued with a knowledge of the law and consenting to it that it is
   good; and in some unregenerate persons there Is beside the flesh, a
   mind enlightened by a knowledge of the gospel. But to the "other thing
   which is distinct from the flesh," the apostle does not, in this
   chapter, give the title of the Spirit, but that of the mind. The remark
   of Musculus on this passage is as follows: "Behold how cautiously the
   apostle again employs the word to dwell. He does not say, "I know that
   in me is no good thing;' for, whence could he otherwise approve of good
   things and detest those which are evil, consenting to the law of God,
   that is holy, and just, and good,' if he had in himself nothing of
   good? But he say, I know that in me dwelleth no good thing;' that Is,
   it does not reign in me, does not possess the dominion, since it has
   seized upon sin for itself, and since the will earnestly desires that
   which is good, though it is not free, but weak and under restraint,
   enduring the power of a tyrant." 3. But some one will here reply, "Not
   only is something different from the flesh attributed to this man, but
   the inhabitation or residence of good is likewise attributed to that
   which is different from the flesh; for, otherwise, that part of the
   verse in which the apostle corrects himself, would not have been
   necessary; but in an unregenerate man, or one who is under the law,
   there is nothing in which good may reside. Therefore, this is a
   regenerate man," &c. Rejoinder. While I concede the first of these
   premises, I deny the second which affirms, "In an unregenerate man, or
   one who is under the law, there is nothing in which good may dwell or
   reside." For in the mind of such a man dwells some good thing, that is,
   some truth and knowledge of the law. The signs of habitation or
   residence are the works which this knowledge and truth in the mind
   unfold or disclose. For instance--a conscience not only accusing a man
   of sin, but also convincing him of it--the delivering of a sentence of
   condemnation against the man himself--the enacting of good
   laws--careful attention to public discipline--the punishment of
   crimes--the defense of good people--despair of obtaining righteousness
   by the law and by legal works the impelling necessity to desire
   deliverance and to seek for it. These works, indeed, are most certain
   signs of the law dwelling and reigning in the mind of such a man as has
   been described. On this point, I intreat, that no one will condemn as
   heresy that which he has yet either not heard, or not sufficiently
   considered. For I do not assert that good dwells and reigns in a man
   under the law, or in any of the unregenerate. For to reign in the mind,
   and, simply, to reign in the man, are not the same thing. Because, if
   this knowledge were simply to dwell and reign in the man, this very man
   would then live in a manner agreeable to his knowledge, the resistance
   of the flesh being repelled by that which would simply obtain the first
   and principal place in a man. If any one closely considers this
   rendering of the cause, and accommodates it to the design of the
   apostle, he will understand that the apostolical correction was both
   necessary and produced for this purpose--that, notwithstanding the
   indwelling of something good in the mind of a man who is under the law,
   a proper and adequate cause might be given why, in such a man as this,
   "the motions of sins" flourish, and work all concupiscence; which cause
   is this: In the flesh of this man dwelleth no good thing. For if any
   good thing dwelt in his flesh, he would then not only know and will
   what is good, but would also complete it in actual operation, his
   passions or desires being tamed and subdued, and subjected to the law
   of God. In reference to this, it is appositely observed by Thomas
   Aquinas on this very passage--"And by this, it is rendered manifest
   that the good thing [or blessing] of grace does not dwell in the flesh;
   because if it dwelt in the flesh, as I have the faculty of willing that
   which is good through the grace that dwells in my mind, so I should
   then that of perfecting or fulfilling what is good through the grace
   that would dwell in my mind." 4. But some one will object--"In the
   Scriptures, the whole unregenerate man is styled flesh. Thus, For that
   he also is flesh. (Gen. vi. 3.) That which is born of the fish, is
   flesh. (John iii. 6.)" REPLY.--First. This mode of speaking is
   metonymical, and the word carnal "flesh," is used instead of carnal, by
   a usage peculiar to the Hebrews, who employ the abstract for the
   concrete. This is clearly pointed out by Beza, on the passage just
   quoted, (John iii, 6,) on which he observes--"Flesh is here put for
   carnal, as, among the Hebrews, appellatives are frequently employed as
   adjectives. This was also a practice among the Greeks and Romans, as in
   the words, kaqarma &c. Secondly. Though the word flesh, in the
   abstract, be urged, yet the whole man may be called flesh, but not the
   whole of man; for the mind which condemns sin and justifies the law, is
   not flesh. But this very same mind may in some degree be called carnal,
   because it is in a man who is carnal, and because the flesh, which
   fights against the mind, brings the whole man into captivity to the law
   of sin, and by this means has the predominance in that man. 5. But from
   these remarks may be constructed an argument in confirmation of the
   true sentiment, in the following manner: In the flesh of a regenerate
   man dwells that which is good; therefore, the man about whom the
   apostle discourses is unregenerate. I prove the proposition from the
   proper effect of the indwelling Spirit; for the Holy Spirit crucifies
   the flesh with its affections and lusts, mortifies the flesh and its
   deeds, subdues the flesh to Himself, and weakens the body of the flesh
   of sin: And He performs all these operations by his indwelling.
   Therefore, good dwelleth in the flesh of a regenerate man. The
   assumption is in the text itself; therefore, the conclusion follows
   from it. 6. Let us now examine the proof of the affirmation--that in
   the flesh of this man "dwelleth no good thing." This is contained in
   the words subjoined: "For to will is present with me; but how to
   perform that which is good, I find not." From a comparison of the
   question to be proved, and the argument produced to prove it, it is
   apparent that the argument is contained in these words: "For I find not
   to perform that which is good," that is, I attain not to the
   performance of that which is good. This proof is taken from the effect;
   for as, from the indwelling in the flesh of that which is good, would
   follow the performance of good; so, from "no good thing dwelling in the
   flesh," arises the impossibility of performing that which is good. For
   these words, "for to will is present with me," are employed through a
   comparison of things that differ; which was necessary in this place,
   because the proof was to be accommodated to the man about whom the
   apostle was treating: And this is the way in which the proof is
   accommodated--"To will is indeed present" with a man who is under the
   law; but the same man "does not find to perform that which is good,"
   because he is carnal. From this it is apparent, that "he is carnal,"
   and that "in his flesh dwelleth no good thing." If any good thing
   resided in his flesh, it would in that case restrain the strong force
   and desires of the flesh, and prevent their being able to hinder the
   performance of the good which he might will. But let the whole proof be
   stated in the following syllogism: In the flesh of him who has the
   power to will, but who "does not find to perform that which is good,"
   dwelleth no good thing; But the man about whom the apostle is treating,
   has indeed the power of willing, but "does not find to perform that
   which is good; " Therefore, in the flesh of such a man as this,
   "dwelleth no good thing." It will not be denied by any one who is in
   the least degree acquainted with logic, and who has accurately
   considered the eighteenth verse, that this is the syllogism of the
   apostle. But from this proposition I may conclude the proposition of
   the syllogism which I have already adduced for confirming my opinion,
   and which is, "In the flesh of a regenerate man dwelleth some good
   thing," by this argument, "Because a regenerate man finds to perform
   that which is good." For the contrary would be a consequence from
   things contrary. That this may the more plainly appear, let us now see
   this proposition, with others which are deduced from it by inversion.
   The proposition is, "No man who is incapable of performing that which
   is good, has any good thing dwelling in his flesh;" therefore, by
   inversion, "No man who has that which is good dwelling in his flesh, is
   incapable of performing what is good." To this, is equivalent the
   following: "Every man who has any thing good dwelling in his flesh, is
   capable of performing what is good; in fact he is capable, because he
   has good dwelling within him," therefore, by simple Inversion in a
   necessary and reciprocal matter, "Every one who is capable of
   performing what is good, has good dwelling in his flesh." This is the
   major, from which I assume, "But a regenerate man can perform that
   which is good." (Phil. 2.) "Therefore, a regenerate man has good
   dwelling in his flesh;" which was the major of the syllogism that I had
   previously adduced. 7. But the defenders of the contrary opinion seem
   to think, that, from this proof, they are able, for the confirmation of
   their own opinion, to deduce an argument, which they frame thus: He is
   a regenerate man, with whom to will that which is good is present: But
   to will that which is good, is present with this man; Therefore, this
   man is regenerate. Answer. Before I reply to each part of this
   syllogism, I must remove the ambiguity which is in this phrase, "to
   will that which is good," or the equivocation in the word "to will."
   For it is certain, that there are two kinds of this volition or
   willing; since it is here asserted of one and the same man, that he is
   occupied both in willing and in not willing that which is good,
   concerning one and the same object; in willing it, as he [merely]
   wills, it but in not willing it as he does not perform it; for this is
   the reason why he does not perform it, because he does not will it,
   though [he acts thus] with a will which is, as it were, the servant of
   sin and compelled not to will [that which is good]. Again, he is
   occupied both in not willing and in willing that which is evil
   concerning one and the same object--in not willing it, as he does not
   will it and hates it--in willing it, as he performs the very same
   [evil] thing; for he would not do it, unless he willed it, though [he
   acts thus] with a will which is impelled to will by sin that dwelleth
   in him. St. Augustine gives his testimony to the expressions which I
   have here employed, in his Retractions. (Lib. I, cap. 13.) The remarks
   of Bucer on this passage are: "Hence it came to pass that David did,
   not only that which he willed, but also that which he willed not. He
   did that which he willed not, not indeed when he committed the offense,
   but when the consideration of the divine law still remained, and when
   it was restored. He did that which he willed, just at the time when he
   actually concluded and determined about the woman presented to his
   view. So Peter," &c. (Fol. 368.) Zanchius, also, in his book, On the
   Works of Redemption, observes--"This was undoubtedly the reason why
   Peter denied Christ, because he willed so to do, though not with a full
   will, neither did he willingly deny Him." (Lib. I, cap. 3, fol. 25)
   Wherefore, since it is impossible that there should be only a single
   genus of volition and nolition, or one mode of willing and not willing,
   by which a man wills the good and does not will the same good, and by
   which he does not will the evil and wills the same evil; this phrase,
   "to will that which is good" and "not to will that which is evil," must
   have a twofold meaning, which we will endeavour now to explain. (1.)
   Because every volition and every nolition follows the judgment of the
   man respecting the thing presented as an object, each of them,
   therefore, is also different according to the diversity of the
   judgment. But the judgment itself, with reference to its cause, is
   two-fold: For it either proceeds from the mind and reason approving the
   law that it is good, and highly esteeming the good which the law
   prescribes, and hating the evil which it forbids; or, it proceeds from
   the senses and affections, and (as the expression is) from sensible
   knowledge, or that which is derived from the senses, and which approves
   of that which is useful, pleasant and delightful, though it be
   forbidden; but which disapproves of that which is hurtful, useless, and
   unpleasant, though it be prescribed. The former of these is called "'
   the judgment of general estimation," the latter "the judgment of
   particular approbation or operation." Hence, one volition is from the
   judgment of general estimation; the other is from the judgment of
   particular approbation, and thus becomes a nolition. On this account,
   the will which follows the judgment of general estimation wills that
   which the law prescribes, and does not will that which the law forbids.
   But the same will, when it follows the judgment of particular
   approbation, wills the delectable or useful evil which the law forbids,
   and does not will the troublesome and hurtful good which the law
   prescribes. (2.) This distinction, when considered with respect to one
   and the same object contemplated in various ways, will be still further
   illustrated. For that object which is presented to the will, is
   considered either under a general form, or under one that is
   particular. Thus adultery is considered either in general, or in
   particular; considered in general, adultery is condemned by reason as
   an evil and as that which has been forbidden by the law; considered in
   particular, it is approved, by the knowledge which is derived from the
   senses, as something good and delectable. Bucer, when treating on this
   subject, in his remarks on the same verse, says: "But there is in man a
   two-fold will--one, that by which he consents to the law--another, that
   by which he does what he detests. The one follows the knowledge of the
   law by which it is known to be good; The other follows the knowledge
   which is derived from the senses, and which is concerning things
   present." (3.) This volition and nolition may likewise be distinguished
   in another manner. There is one volition and nolition which follow the
   last judgment formed concerning the object; and another volition and
   nolition which follow not the last but the antecedent judgment. In
   reference to the former of these, volition will be concerning good; in
   reference to the latter, volition will be concerning the evil opposed
   to it, and contrariwise. Thus, likewise, concerning nolition. And with
   respect to the former, it will be volition; in respect to the latter,
   it will be nolition, concerning the same object, and the contrary. But
   the volition and nolition which follow not the last judgment, cannot so
   well be simply and absolutely called "volition" and "nolition," as
   velicity and nolicity. Those, however, which follow the last judgment,
   are simply and absolutely called efficacious volition and nolition, to
   which the effect succeeds. (4.) Thomas Aquinas, on this very passage in
   Romans 7, says, that the former is not a full will, the latter is a
   complete will. But let this same distinction be considered as it is
   employed concerning God. For God is said to will some things
   approvingly as being good in themselves, but to will other things
   efficaciously, as simply conducing to his glory. We must now consider
   the kind of willing and nilling about which the apostle is here
   treating. He is treating, not about the volition and nolition of
   particular approbation, but about those of general estimation--not
   about the volition and nolition which are occupied concerning an object
   considered in particular, but concerning one generally considered--not
   about the volition and nolition which follow the last judgment, but
   about those which follow the antecedent judgment--not about simple,
   absolute and complete volition, but about that which is incomplete, and
   which rather deserves to be called velicity. "For the good that he
   would, he does not; but the evil which he would not, that he does." If
   he willed the good prescribed by the law, with the will of particular
   approbation, which follows the last judgment, he would then also
   perform the good which he had thus willed. If, in the same manner, he
   did not will the evil forbidden by the law, he would then abstain from
   it. This is explained, in a learned and prolix manner, by Bucer on this
   passage. (1.) I now come specially to each part of the syllogism, in
   which the Major Proposition seems to me to be reprehensible on two
   accounts: (1.) Because "to will that which is good, "which is here the
   subject of the apostle's argument, is not peculiar to the regenerate;
   for it also appertains to the unregenerate--for instance, to those who
   are under the law, and who have in themselves all those things which
   God usually effects by the law; (2.) Because, even when used in that
   other sense, [as applicable to the regenerate,] it does not contain a
   full definition of a regenerate man; for a regenerate man not only
   wills that which is good, but he also performs it; because "it is God
   who worketh in" the regenerate "both to will and to do." (Phil. ii.
   13.) And "God hath prepared good works," that the regenerate "might
   walk in them;" or, "he hath created them in Christ Jesus unto good
   works." (Ephes. ii. 10.) They are "new creatures;" (2 Cor. v. 17) are
   endued with that "faith which worketh by love;" (Gal. v. 6) and to them
   is attributed the observance, or "keeping of the commandments of God;"
   (1 Cor. vii. 19; ) they "do the will of God from the heart;" (Ephes.
   vi. 6) "have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which they
   were delivered." (Rom. vi. 17) etc, &c. From these observations, it is
   apparent that the particle "only" must be added to the proposition; for
   when this is appended, it will, at first sight, betray the falsehood
   and insufficiency of the proposition in this manner: "He is a
   regenerate man, with whom only to will that which is good is present."
   (2.) To the assumption, I reply that it is proposed in a mutilated
   form. For this, "to will is present with me," is not the entire
   sentence of the apostle; but it is one part separated from another.
   without which it is not consistent. For this is a single discrete
   axiom: "To will is present with me; but how to perform that which is
   good, I find not." But nothing can be solidly concluded from a passage
   of Scripture proposed in a form that is mutilated. I add that, when
   this latter part of the apostle's sentence is omitted, the reader is
   left in doubt concerning the kind of volition and nolition which is
   here the subject of investigation. But when the omission is supplied
   from the text of the apostle, it plainly signifies that the subject of
   discussion is inefficacious volition and that of general estimation,
   but, as has already been observed, this kind of volition is not
   peculiar to the regenerate. But the assumption may be simply denied, as
   not having been constructed from the context of the apostle. For St.
   Paul does not attribute to the man about whom he is treating, that he
   wills that which is good and does not will that which is evil, but that
   he does that which is evil, and does not perform that which is good, to
   which attributes, something tantamount to a description is added--"That
   which I would not," and "that which I would." This description is added
   in accommodation to the state of the man about whom the apostle is
   treating, and it is required by the method of demonstrative
   investigation. For he had determined to produce the proper and
   reciprocal cause, why the man about whom he is treating "does not find
   to perform that which is good;" and therefore all other causes were to
   be removed, among which were the nolition of good and the volition of
   evil, also ignorance of that which is good and that which is evil, &c.
   Thus, in that other disjunctive axiom, "to will is present with me; but
   how to perform that which is good I find not," the principal thing
   which is attributed to the man about whom the apostle is treating, or
   that which is predicated concerning him, is that "he does not find to
   perform that which is good;" for the illustration of which, is produced
   that differing attribute, "to will indeed is present with me." This is
   a remark which must be diligently observed by every one who engages in
   the inquiry, about the most correct manner in which this very difficult
   passage is to be understood. 8. But the preceding observations make it
   evident that a contrary conclusion may be drawn from these two verses
   in the following manner: He is not a regenerate man, with whom to will
   is indeed present, but not to perform, and who does not perform the
   good which he would, but who commits the evil which he would not; (this
   is from the description of regeneration and its parts; ) But to will is
   present with this man, but not to perform; and the same man does not
   perform the good which he would, but commits the evil which he would
   not; Therefore, the man about whom the apostle is treating, is
   unregenerate. The assumption is in the text of the apostle; the
   proposition alone, therefore, remains to be proved. Regeneration not
   only illuminates the mind and conforms the will, but it likewise
   restrains and regulates the affections, and directs the external and
   the internal members to obedience to the divine law. It is not he who
   wills, but he who performs the will of the Father, that enters into the
   kingdom of heaven. (Matt. vii. 21.) And, at the close of the same
   chapter, he is called a wise or prudent man "who doeth the sayings of
   Christ," not he who only wills them. Consult what has already been
   remarked in the negation of the proposition in that syllogism which was
   produced for the establishment of the contrary opinion; And, Those
   persons who fulfill the will of the flesh in its desires, are
   unregenerate; But this man fulfills the will of the flesh; Therefore,
   he is unregenerate. But these [attributes] agree most appropriately
   with a man who is under the law--to will that which is good and not to
   will evil, as agreeing with one who "consents to the law that it is
   good," but not to do that which is good and to do evil, as agreeing
   with one who is "carnal and the servant of sin." 9. But perhaps some
   one will here reply, "From this man is not simply taken away the
   performing of that which is good, but the completion of it, that is,
   the perfect performance of it--a view of the matter which has the
   sanction of St. Augustine, who gives this explanation of the word."
   Answer. Omitting all reference to the manner in which the opinion of
   these persons agrees with that of St. Augustine, which we shall
   afterwards examine, I affirm that this is a mere evasion. For the Greek
   verb katergazomai does not signify to do any thing perfectly, but
   simply to do, to perform, to dispatch, as is very evident from the verb
   poiw "to do," which follows, and from this word itself as it is used in
   the fifteenth verse, where, according to their opinion, this verb
   cannot signify completion or perfect performance--for the regenerate,
   to whom, as they understand it, this clause in the fifteenth verse
   applies, do not perfectly perform that which is evil. Let those
   passages of the sacred writings be consulted in which this word occurs,
   and its true meaning will be easily understood from Scripture usage. I
   add that, in this sense, "the completion," that is, "the perfect
   performance" of that which is good, can no more be taken away from a
   regenerate man, than "the willing" of that which is good. For while the
   regenerate continue in this state of mortality, they do not "perfectly
   will" that which is good. 10. But some one will further insist, that
   "to will good" and "not to will evil," in what mode and sense soever
   these expressions are taken, is "some good thing;" and that, to an
   unregenerate man can be attributed nothing at all which can be called
   GOOD, without bringing contumely on grace and the Holy Spirit. To this
   I reply, We have already understood the quality and the quantity of
   this "good thing." But I am desirous to have proof given to me, that
   nothing at all which is good can be attributed to an unregenerate man,
   of what description soever he may be. According to the judgment which I
   have formed, the Scriptures in no passage, openly affirm this; neither
   do I think that, by good consequence from them, it can be asserted. But
   the contrary assertion may be most evidently proved: "The truth" which
   is mentioned in Romans i. 18, is good, as being opposed to
   "unrighteousness;" but this "truth" is in some unregenerate persons.
   "The work of the law," which is mentioned in Romans ii. 15, is a good
   thing; but it is: written in the hearts" of heathens, and that by God.
   "The taste of the heavenly gift, of the good word of God, and of the
   powers of the world to come," (Heb. vi. 4,5,) is good; and yet it is in
   the unregenerate. "To have escaped the pollutions of the world through
   the knowledge of the Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, and to have known
   the way of righteousness," (2 Pet. ii. 20,21) are good things; yet they
   belong to the unregenerate. "To receive the word of God with joy,"
   (Matt. xiii. 20, is good; and it appertains to the unregenerate. And,
   in general, all those gifts of the Holy Spirit which are for the
   edification of the church, and which are attributed to several of the
   reprobate, are good things. (1 Cor. 12 & 13.) To acknowledge themselves
   to be sinners, to mourn and lament on account of personal
   transgressions, and to seek deliverance from sin, are good things; and
   they belong to some who are unregenerate. Nay, no man can be made
   partaker of regeneration, unless he have previously had within him such
   things as these. From these passages, it is evident that it cannot be
   said with truth, that nothing of good can be attributed to the
   unregenerate, what kind of men soever they may be. If any one reply,
   "But these good things are not saving in their nature, neither are they
   such as they ought to be "I acknowledge the justness of the remark. Yet
   some of them are necessarily previous to those which are of a saving
   nature; besides, they are themselves in a certain degree saving. That
   which has not yet come up to the point toward which it aims, does not
   immediately lose the name of "a good thing" The dread of punishment,
   and slavish fear are not that dread and fear which are required from
   the children of God; yet they are, in the mean time, reckoned by St.
   Augustine among those good things which precede conversion. In his
   thirteenth sermon on these words of the apostle, have not received the
   spirit of bondage again unto fear, (Rom. viii. 15) he says, "What is
   this word again? It is the manner in which this most troublesome
   schoolmaster terrifies. What is this word again? It is as ye received
   the spirit of bondage in Mount Sinai. Some man will say, The Spirit of
   Bondage is one, the spirit of liberty another. If they were not the
   same, the apostle would not use the word again. Therefore, the spirit
   [in both cases] is the same; but, in the one case, it is on tables of
   stone in fear, in the other, it is on the fleshly tables of the heart
   in love," &c. In a subsequent passage he says, "You are now, therefore,
   not in fear, but in love, that you may be sons, and not servants. For
   that man whose reason for still doing well is his fear of punishment,
   and who does not love God, is not yet among the children of God. My
   wish, however, is that he may continue even to fear punishment. Fear is
   a bond-servant, love is a free man; and, if we may thus express
   ourselves, fear is the servant of love. Therefore, lest the devil take
   possession of the heart, let this servant have the precedence in it,
   and preserve a place within for his Lord and Master, who will soon
   arrive. Do this, act thus, even from fear of punishment, if you are not
   yet able to do it from a love of righteousness. The master will come
   and the servant will depart; because, when love is perfected, it casts
   out fear." Calvin likewise numbers initial fear among good things; and
   Beza, from the meaning attached to it by Calvin and himself, makes it
   to be preliminary to regeneration, as we have already perceived. But
   these things, and others, (if any such there be,) are attributed to the
   unregenerate, without any injury to grace and the Holy Spirit; because
   they are believed to be, in those in whom they are found, through the
   operation of grace and of the Holy Spirit. For there are certain acts
   which precede conversion, and they proceed from the Holy Spirit, who
   prepares the will; as it is said by Zanchius, in his Judgment on the
   First and Second Tome of the objections and answers of Pezelius, which
   judgment is subjoined to the second tome. Consult likewise what we have
   cited in a preceding page from Beza against Tilman. Heshusius. 11. What
   man is there who possesses but a moderate acquaintance with theological
   matters, and does not know, that the Holy Spirit employs the preaching
   of the word in this order, that he may first convict us of sin, by the
   law, of whose equity and righteousness he convinces the mind--may
   accuse us of being obnoxious to condemnation--may place before our eyes
   our own impotency and weakness--may teach us that it is impossible to
   be justified through the law, (Rom. iii. 19-21) -- that he may compel
   us to flee to Christ, using "the law as a schoolmaster, to lead us by
   the hand to Christ," who is "the end of the law for righteousness to
   every one that believeth"? (Gal. ii. 16-21; iii, 1-29.) On this
   account, also, the unregenerate receive certain names or appellations,
   in the Scriptures: They are called sinners, as they are
   contra-distinguished from the righteous that boasted themselves of
   their righteousness, which sinners Christ came to call--labouring and
   Heavy-Laden, to whom Christ came to afford refreshment and rest--sick
   and infirm, and such as stand in need of a Physician's aid, that they
   may be distinguished from those who supposed themselves to be "whole,"
   and not to require the services of a Physician--poor and needy, to whom
   Christ came to preach the gospel--captives and prisoners in bonds, who
   acknowledge their sad condition, and whom Christ came to
   deliver--contrite in spirit and broken hearted, whom Christ came to
   bind up, &c. Secondly. Having completed these effects by the law, the
   same Spirit begins to use the preaching of the gospel, by which he
   manifests and reveals Christ, infuses faith, unites believers together
   into one body with Christ, leads them to a participation of the
   blessings of Christ, that, remission of sins being solicited and
   obtained through his name, they may begin further to live in him and
   from him. On this account likewise, the very same persons are
   distinguished by certain other appellations in the Scriptures. They are
   called believers, justified, redeemed, sanctified, regenerated, and
   liberated persons, grafted into Christ, concorporate with him, bones of
   his bones, flesh of his flesh, &c. From this order, it appears that
   some acts of the Holy Spirit are occupied concerning those who are
   unregenerate, but who are to be born again, and that some operations
   arise from them in the minds of those who are not yet regenerate, but
   who are to be born again. But I do not attempt to determine whether
   these be the operations of the Spirit as He is the regenerator. I know
   that, in Romans viii. 15-17, the apostle distinguishes between the
   Spirit of adoption and the spirit of bondage. I know that, in 2
   Corinthians iii. 6-11, he distinguishes between the ministration of the
   law and of death, and the ministration of the gospel and of the Spirit.
   I know the apostle said, when he was writing to the Galatians, that the
   Spirit is not received by the works of the law, but by the faith of the
   gospel of Christ. And I think that we must make a distinction between
   the Spirit as he prepares a temple for himself, and the same Spirit as
   He inhabits that temple when it is sanctified. Yet I am unwilling to
   contend with any earnestness about this point--whether these acts and
   operations may be attributed to the Spirit, the regenerator, not as He
   regenerates, but as He prepares the hearts of men to admit the
   efficiency of regeneration and renovation. Hence, I think it is once
   generally clear, that this opinion is not contumelious to the Holy
   Spirit, nor can it take away from the Spirit any thing which is
   attributed to Him in the Scriptures; but that it only indicates the
   order according to which the Holy Spirit disposes and distributes his
   acts. I am not certain whether, on the contrary, it be not contumelious
   to the Spirit of adoption who dwells in the hearts of the regenerate,
   if he be said to effect in them a volition of this description from
   which no effect follows, but which fails or becomes defective in the
   very attempt, being conquered by the tyranny of sin that dwelleth
   within--and this in opposition to the declaration in 1 John iv. 4,
   "Greater is HE that is in you, than he that is in the world." Neither
   do I think it to flow as a consequence from this, that in Romans vii.
   18,19, the subject under investigation is a man faced under grace; for
   it is one thing to feel or perceive some effect of preparing grace; and
   it is another to be under grace, or to be ruled, led and influenced by
   grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VERSE THE TWENTIETH

   If he does that which he would not, then it is no more he that does it,
   but sin that dwelleth in him. We have already taken the twentieth verse
   into consideration. But I here briefly remind the reader, that in this
   passage, likewise, is manifestly discovered the truth of our exposition
   which has been adduced; because, in this verse, he says, both that he
   does what he would not, and yet that he does not do it himself, but sin
   that dwelleth in him. He does it, therefore, and he does it not;
   because he does it as a servant who is under compulsion by his master,
   and who does not execute his own will so much as that of his master,
   though it is also his own, otherwise he would not perform it; for he
   consents to the will of his master before he performs it, because he
   does it without co-action or force; for the will cannot be forced.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VERSE THE TWENTY-FIRST

   He finds that, where he would do good, evil is present with him. The
   twenty-first verse contains a conclusion from the preceding,
   accommodated to the purpose of the apostle upon which he is here
   treating. For, from the circumstance of this man knowing that "to will
   is present with him" but not to perform it, he concludes, that "when he
   would do good, evil is present with him." But it must be observed,
   that, in the eighteenth verse, the apostle employs the same phrase
   about willing, as he here uses about evil; and thus he says, that both
   to will good, and to will evil, are present with him, or lie close to
   him. And as "to will that which is good is present with him" through
   his inclination for the law, and through his mind which approves of it
   as "just and good," so "to will evil is likewise present with him"
   through a certain law of sin, that is, by the force and tyranny of sin,
   assuming to itself the power, and usurping the right or jurisdiction
   over this man. We must now consider whether the essence and adjacency
   of each (if I may employ such a word) are of equal power; or whether
   the one prevails over the other, and which of them it is that acquires
   this ascendancy. It is manifest that the two are not equally potent,
   but that the one prevails over the other, and that, in fact, "evil is
   present" in a more powerful and vehement manner: For that obtains and
   prevails in a man, through the command, instigation and impulse of
   which he is found to act and to cease from acting. But I wish to see it
   explained from the Scriptures, how such an assertion as this can be
   made with truth concerning a regenerate man who is placed under grace;
   for, in every passage, the sacred records seem to me to affirm the
   contrary.

  THE TWENTY-SECOND AND TWENTY-THIRD VERSES

   1. HE delights in the law of God, or he finds a kind of con,
   delectation with it, after the inward man; but he sees another law in
   his members, warring against the law of his mind, &c. 2. An argument,
   from the twenty-second verse, for the contrary opinion. 3. An answer to
   the PROPOSITION in this argument. The inward man signifies the MIND, as
   the OUTWARD Man signifies the BODY. (1.) This is shown from the
   etymology of the word, and from the usage of Scriptures, especially in
   2 Corinthians iv. 16, and in Ephes. iii. 16,17. (2.) Proofs of this are
   given at great length from the ancient Christian fathers. (3.) Similar
   proofs are adduced from modern divines 4. The meaning of the phrase,
   "to delight in the law of God after the inward man." 5. An answer to
   the assumption, which is shown to be proposed in a mutilated form, by
   the omission of those things which are mentioned in the twenty-third
   verse. 6. An argument, from the twenty-third verse, for the contrary
   opinion. (1.) An answer to the proposition in it. (2.) And to the
   assumption. 7. A most irrefragable argument deduced from these two
   verses. (1.) To the refutation of the contrary opinion. (2.) To the
   establishment of the true one, which at first is proposed in an ample
   manner, and afterwards in an abridged form. (3.) The proposition is
   proved by three reasons, which are confirmed against all objections.
   (4.) It is proved from the Scriptures, that, in the conflict against
   sin, the regenerate usually obtain the conquest 8. A special
   consideration of the text, Gal. v. 16-18, and a collation of it with
   this passage. 9. An objection, and a reply to it. 10. An objection to
   the third reason, and a reply. 11. A consideration of Isaiah lxiv. 10.
   1. In the twenty-second and twenty-third verses is adduced a clearer
   explanation and proof of the conclusion which had been drawn in the
   twenty-first verse, and which agrees with the very topic that the
   apostle had, in this part, proposed to himself for investigation. But
   the proof is, properly, contained in the twenty-third verse; because
   that verse corresponds with these words, "When I would do good, evil is
   present with me," an affirmation which was to be proved. The proof is
   taken from the effect of the evil which is present with the man, and it
   is the warfare against the law of his mind, the victory obtained over
   him, and, after such victory, the captivity of the man to the law of
   sin. The twenty-second verse has reference to these words, "When I
   would do good;" and it contains a more ample explanation of this
   willing, from the proper cause, and an illustration of the following
   verse from things diverse and disjunctive. But in these two verses is
   contained one axiom, which is appropriately called a discrete or
   disjunctive axiom; as is apparent from the use of the particle, de
   "but," in the twenty-third verse, which is the relative of men though
   the latter is omitted in the twenty-third verse. It is likewise
   apparent from the very form of opposition. The antecedent and less
   principal part of this axiom is contained in the twenty-second verse;
   the consequent and principal part, in the twenty-third. For the
   antecedent is employed for the illustration of the consequent, as is
   very manifest in all axioms. Thus, as in many similar instances, "I
   indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after
   me, shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with life." (Matt. ii.
   11.) "Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day
   by day." (2 Cor. iv. 16.) For the particles, indeed, though, since,
   when, &c., denote the antecedent and less principal part of the axiom;
   while the particles, but, yet, then, &c., denote the consequent and
   principal part. "To delight in the law of God," or, "to find a sort of
   condelectation in it," "after the inward man," is the cause that to
   will is present with this man. "The evil which is present with him," is
   "the law of sin in his members." The effect, by which the presence of
   this evil is proved, is contained in these words, "Warring against the
   law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which
   is in my members." I have considered it proper to offer these remarks
   to assist in forming a right judgment about a discrete or disjunctive
   axiom, lest any one should separate the one part from the other, and
   should account the less principal to be the principal one. Let us now
   further see what conclusion can be drawn from these two verses, in
   proof of the one opinion or of the other. 2. Those who hold sentiments
   contrary to mine, draw the following conclusion, from the twenty-second
   verse, for the establishment of their view of the subject: He who
   delights in the law of God after the inward man, is regenerate and
   placed under grace; But this man about whom the apostle is treating
   delights in the law of God after the inward man; Therefore, this man is
   regenerate and placed under grace. They suppose that, in the
   proposition, they have a two-fold foundation for their opinion: (1.)
   Because "the inward man" is attributed to this person. (2.) Because
   that same individual is said "to delight in the law of God after the
   inward man? For, they say, both these adjuncts can appertain to
   regenerate persons alone. The First agrees with them only, because, in
   the Scriptures, "the inward man" has the same signification as that of
   "the new man and the regenerate;" the Second, because it is declared
   concerning the pious, that "they meditate in the law of the Lord, and
   that their delight is in it, day and night? 3. To the proposition, I
   reply, first, that the inward man is not the same as the new man or the
   regenerate, either from the etymology of the word, or from the usage of
   Scripture; and the inward man is not peculiar to the regenerate, but
   that it also belongs to the unregenerate. Secondly, that to delight in
   the law of God, or, rather, to find a sort of condelectation in the law
   of God after the inward man, is not a property peculiar to the
   regenerate and to those who are placed under grace, but that it
   appertains to a man placed under the law. (1.) With regard to the
   first, I say, from the etymology of the epithet, he is called the
   inward man, relatively and oppositely to the outward man. For there are
   two men in the same individual, the one existing within the other, and
   the one having the other first within himself. The first of these is
   the hidden man of the heart, (1 Peter iii. 4,) the second is the
   outward man of the body; the former is he who inhabits or dwells in,
   the latter, he who is inhabited; the former is calculated or adapted to
   invisible and incorporeal blessings, the latter, to those which are
   earthly and visible; the former is immortal, the latter is mortal and
   liable to death. In these two words, not a single syllable occurs which
   can afford even the least indication of regeneration, and of the
   newness arising from regeneration. But these three epithets, the inward
   man, the regenerate Man, and the new man, hold the following order
   among each other, which the words themselves indicate at the first
   sight of them. The inward man denotes the subject, the regenerate man
   denotes the act, of the Holy Spirit who regenerates; and the new man
   denotes the quality which exists in the inward man through the act of
   regeneration. (2.) The sense and usage of Scripture are not adverse to
   this signification, but, on the contrary, are very consentaneous to it.
   This will be apparent from a diligent consideration of those passages
   in which mention is made of "the inward man." One of them is the text
   now under discussion; the second is 2 Corinthians iv. 16; and the third
   is Ephes. iii. 16,17. Let us at present take into consideration the
   last two passages. 2 CORINTHIANS iv, 16. The former of the two is thus
   expressed: "for which cause we faint not; but though our outward man
   perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." From this verse
   itself, I shew that the inward and the outward man are not in this
   passage taken for the new and the old man; but that the inward man is
   to be understood as that which is incorporeal and inhabiting, so
   denominated from the interior of man, that is, his mind or soul; and
   that the outward man is here taken for that which is corporeal and
   inhibited, so denominated from the body, the exterior part of man. This
   I shew, First. Because, if the outward and the inward man were to be
   taken for the old and the new man, then this disjunctive mode of speech
   could not attain in this verse. For these two could not then be
   distinguished in this following manner from each other: "Though our old
   man perish, yet the new man is renewed day by day;" for [as there
   stated] they are necessarily cohering, and mutually consequent on each
   other; because whatever is taken away from the old man, is so much
   added to the new. The absurdity of such a distinction will be still
   more manifest, if the same thing be thus proposed: "Though our old man
   be crucified, destroyed and buried, yet the new man rises again, is
   quickened or vivified, and is renewed still more and more." And,
   "Though we lay aside our former oldness, yet we make greater and still
   greater proficiency in newness of life." Let any one that pleases
   render himself ridiculous by employing the following language: "Though
   this youth unlearns and lays aside his ignorance, yet he daily makes a
   greater proficiency in the knowledge of necessary things." Secondly.
   The solace which the apostle produces, in opposition to those
   oppressions and distresses to which holy people are liable, while they
   remain in this world, consists in the following words: "The inward man
   is renewed day by day;" and not in these, "though our outward man
   perish." This is shown by the mode of speech adopted by the apostle,
   indicating that this very "perishing of the outward man," which is
   effected through oppressions and distresses, is that against which the
   consolation, comprehended in the following words, is produced by the
   apostle. The afflicted person says, "But our outward man is perishing."
   The apostle replies to him, "Do not grieve on this account; for our
   inward man is renewed day by day, in the renewal of which consists our
   salvation. For we must not have regard to external and visible
   blessings, which conduce to the life of the outward man; because they
   are liable to perish. But we must highly estimate and regard internal
   and invisible things, which appertain to the life of the inward man;
   because these are eternal, and will never perish." But if, by this
   word, "the outward man" were to be understood "the old man," then the
   apostle must have produced this in the place of consolation, in the
   following manner: "Do not lament that you are liable to many
   afflictions and oppressions, for those are the very things by which
   your old man perishes, and by which the inward man is the more
   renewed." But that the perishing of the outward man, and that of the
   old man, are not the same, is evident from this circumstance, that the
   former of these is against the very nature of man and the good of
   natural life, but that the latter is against depraved nature, and is
   contrary to the life of sin in man. Thirdly. From the word "renewed,"
   it is apparent that "the inward man" is the subject of renovation or
   renewal, and of the act of the Holy Spirit. I confess indeed, that it
   may be correctly said, "The new man is daily renewed more and more,"
   both because it is needful that this newness, which has been produced
   in a man by the act of the regenerating Spirit, should increase and be
   augmented day by day, and because the remains of the old man ought by
   degrees to be taken away and weakened yet more and more. But even in
   this case the subject is the inward man, that is called new from the
   newness which now begins to be effected in him by the regenerating
   Spirit; for the subject of increasing and progressive renovation, and
   that of commencing renovation, are the same. But the subject of
   incipient or commencing renovation is not the new man, (for he is not
   called new before the act of renovation, and prior to the quality
   impressed by that act,) but it is the inward man. Therefore, though the
   new man be said to be renewed, (a phrase which I am not aware that the
   Scriptures employ,) yet the subject is the inward man, which subject
   may receive the appellation of the new man from the quality impressed.
   As we say that a white man becomes whiter every day, whiteness being
   communicated to a white man not as he is white, but as he is a man who
   has still some dark shades remaining, and who has not yet attained to
   that degree of whiteness which he desires. ConsonantIy with this view,
   the Scriptures themselves use these words: "Be renewed in the spirit of
   your mind, and put on the new man, which after God is created in
   righteousness and true holiness," (Ephes. iv. 23,24.) In this passage
   the subject of renovation is called "the spirit of our mind," that is,
   the inward man, or the mind; and "the new man," in the same passage, is
   not the subject itself, but it is the quality which the subject ought
   to induce: This quality is there called "righteousness and true
   holiness." I have said that I am not quite certain whether the
   Scriptures use this phrase in any passage: I have felt this hesitation
   on account of Col. iii. 10, in which it seems to be so used; the
   apostle saying, "and ye have put on the new man, which is renewed in
   knowledge after the image of Him who created him." But it will be
   obvious to every one who consider, the passage with diligence, that
   these words, "which is renewed," or ton anakainoumenon must be joined
   with what preceded, "and ye have put on the new man," that is, "that
   which is renewed," or, "the renewed," "in knowledge," &c., so as to be
   a description of the new man, not some new attribute of this new man.
   But to this criticism no great importance is attached; and I have said,
   I do not deny that the new man is renewed more and more. The same thing
   is manifest from the rest of this passage. (2 Cor. iv. 16.) For, "the
   outward man," (16,) "an earthen vessel," (7,) "our body," (10,) "our
   mortal flesh," (11,) are all synonymous terms; as are also, "troubled,"
   "perplexed," "persecuted," "bearing about in the body the dying of the
   Lord Jesus," "delivered unto death," and "perishing." This may be
   rendered very clear to the studious inquirer after the truth, who will
   compare the preceding and the succeeding verses with the 16th.
   EPHESIANS iii, 16,17. The latter of the two passages is thus expressed:
   "That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be
   strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may
   dwell in your hearts by faith." From these verses, it is plain, that by
   the inner man is denoted the subject about which the Holy Spirit is
   occupied in his act and operation; and this operation is here
   denominated "a corroboration," or "a being strengthened." This is also
   plain from the synonym mentioned in the following verse, "that Christ
   may dwell in your hearts by faith;" for "the heart," and "the inner
   man," are taken from the same thing. In this view of the subject I am
   supported by the very learned Zanchius, who writes in the following
   manner upon this passage: "We have asserted, and from 2 Corinthians iv.
   16, we have demonstrated, that by the term inner man is signified the
   principal part of man, that is, the mind, which consists of the
   understanding and the will, and which is usually denoted by the word
   heart, in which the affections or passions flourish; as, on the
   contrary, by the term outward man, no other thing can be understood
   than the corporeal part of man, which grows, possesses senses,
   locomotion," &c. And in a subsequent passage, he says, "Therefore, by
   this particle, in the inner man, the apostle teaches, that as the gift
   of might or strength, so likewise the other virtues of the Spirit, have
   not their seat in the vegetative or growing part Of man, but in his
   mind, heart, spirit," &c. (2.) Because it is not only held for a
   certainty by some persons, that "the inward man" is the same with the
   new and the regenerate man, from which they venture to assert, "that
   the regenerate alone possess the inward man;" but because this is also
   urged as an article of belief, let us therefore see what a great
   portion of the divines of the Christian church here understood by the
   epithet, "the inward man."

  THE ANCIENT FATHERS CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA.

   The apostle gives two appellations to the man--his person and his mind.
   (Strom. lib. 3, fol. 194.) TERTULLIAN "BUT," says the apostle, "though
   our outward man be destroyed," that is, the flesh, by the force of
   persecutions, "yet the inward man is renewed day by day," that is, the
   mind, by the hope of the promises. (Against the Gnostics, cap. 15.)
   Having, therefore, obtained the two men mentioned by the apostle--the
   inward man, that is, the mind, and the outward man, that is, the
   flesh--the heretics have in fact adjudged salvation to the mind, that
   is, to the inward man, but destruction to the flesh, that is, to the
   outward man; because it is recorded 2 Corinthians iv. 16, "for though
   our outward man perish," &c. (On the resurrection of the Body, cap.
   40.) From without, wars that overcome the body; inwardly, fear that
   afflicts the mind. So, "though our outward man perish," perishing will
   not be understood as losing our resurrection, but as sustaining
   vexation; and this, not without the inward man. Thus it will be the
   part of both of them to be glorified together, as well as to be
   fellow-sufferers. (lbid.) For though the apostle calls the flesh "an
   earthen vessel," which he commands to be honourably treated; yet it is
   also called, by the same apostle, "the outward man," that is, the clay
   which was first impressed and engraved under the title of man, not of a
   cup, of a sword, or of any small vessel; for it was called "a vessel"
   on account of its capacity, which holds and contains the mind. But this
   flesh is called "man," from community of nature, which renders it not
   an instrument in operations, but a minister or assistant, (Ibid. cap.
   16.) AMBROSE. "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man."
   he says that his mind delights in those things which are delivered by
   the law; and thus it is the inward man. (On Rom. vii. 22.) "Though our
   outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." The
   flesh perishes or wastes away by afflictions, stripes, famine, thirst,
   cold and nakedness; but the mind is renewed by the hope of a future
   reward, because it is purified by incessant tribulations. For the mind
   is profited in afflictions, and does not perish; so that when
   additional temptations occur, it makes daily advances in worthiness;
   because this "perishing" is profitable also to the body for its
   immortality through the excellence of the mind. (On 2 Corinthians iv.
   16.) "I delight in the law of God after the inward man." Our inward man
   is that which was made after the image and likeness of God; the outward
   man is that which was formed and shaped from clay. As therefore there
   are two men, there is likewise a two-fold course of conduct--one is
   that of the inward man, the other that of the outward man. And, indeed,
   most of the acts of the inward man extend to the outward man. As the
   chasteness of the inward man also passes to the chastity of the body.
   For he who is ignorant of the adultery of the heart, is likewise
   unacquainted with the adultery of the body, &c. It is, therefore, the
   circumcision of the inward man; for he who is circumcised has stripped
   off the enticements of his whole flesh, as his foreskin, that he may be
   in the Spirit, and not in the flesh; and that in the Spirit he may
   mortify the deeds of his body, &c., &c. When our inward man is in the
   flesh, he is in the foreskin. (Letter 77th, to Constantius.) BASIL THE
   GREAT "Let us make man according to our image." He means the inward
   man, when he says, "Let us make man," &c., &c. Listen to the apostle,
   who says, "Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed
   day by day." How do I know the two men? One of them is apparent; the
   other is hidden in him who appears, it is the invisible, the inward
   man. We have then a man within us; and we are twofold; and what is said
   is very true, that we are inward. (Homily 10th, on the six days of
   Creation.) "Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me." God made the
   inward man, and fashioned the outward man. For "the fashioning" belongs
   to clay; but "the making" appertains to that which is after his own
   image. Wherefore the thing which was fashioned is the flesh, but that
   which was made is the mind. (Ibid. Homily 11.) Since there are, indeed,
   two men, as the apostle declares, the one outward and the other inward,
   we must also, in like manner, receive the age in both, according to him
   whom we behold, and according to him whom we understand in secret.
   (Discourse on the beginning of the Proverbs of Solomon.) CYRIL OF
   ALEXANDRIA "But though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is
   renewed day by day." If any one, therefore, says that our inward man
   dwells in the outward man, he repeats an important truth; yet he will
   not on this account seem to divide the unity of man. (On the
   incarnation, of the only begotten Son, cap. 12.) MACARIUS The true
   death consists in the heart, and is hidden, when our inward man is
   dead. If therefore any one has passed over from death to the hidden
   life, he in reality lives forever, and dies no more, &c., &c. Sin acts
   secretly upon the inward man and the mind, and commences a conflict
   with the thoughts. (Homily 15.) The members of the soul are many: such
   as the mind, the conscience, the will, the thoughts which accuse or
   else defend. But all these have been collected together into one
   reason; yet they are the members of the soul. But the soul is single,
   that is, the inward man. (Homily 7.) "The inward man" and "the soul"
   are taken for the same thing, in his 27th Homily. CHRYSOSTOM "But
   though our outward man perish," &c. How does it perish? While it is
   beaten with stripes, is driven away, and endures innumerable evils.
   "Yet the inward man is renewed day by day." How is it renewed? By
   faith, hope and alacrity, that it may have the courage to oppose itself
   to evils. For, the more the evils which the body endures, the greater
   is the hope which the inward man entertains, and the more bright and
   resplendent does it become, as gold which is examined or tested by much
   fire. (On 2 Corinthians iv. 16.) Let us now see what is said by one who
   stands higher than many: AUGUSTINE But who, except the greatest mad
   man, will say that in the body we are, or shall afterwards be, like
   God, That likeness, therefore, exists in the inward man, "which is
   renewed in the knowledge of God, after the image of him that created
   him." (Tom. 2, Epist. 6.) By this grace, righteousness is written in
   the inward man, when renewed, which transgression had destroyed. (On
   the Spirit and the Letter, cap. 27.) As he called him the inward man
   when coming into this world, because the outward man is corporeal as
   this world is. (On the Demerits and Remission of Sin, lib.1, cap. 25;
   Tom. 7.) As the eyes of the body derive no aid from the light, that
   they may depart from it with eyelids closed and turned in another
   direction, but in order to see, they are assisted by the light, (nor
   can this be done at all, unless the light lends its aid,) so God, who
   is the light of the inward man, assists the drowsiness of our mind,
   that we may perform something that is good, not according to our
   righteousness, but according to his own. (Ibid. lib. 2, cap. 5.) If, in
   the mind itself, which is "the inward man," perfect newness were formed
   in baptism, the apostle would not declare, "Though our outward man
   perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." (Ibid. cap. 7.) As
   that tree of life was placed in the corporeal Paradise, so this wisdom
   is in the spiritual Paradise, the former of them affording vital vigour
   to the senses of the outward man, the latter to those of the inward
   man, without any change of time for the worse. (Ibid. cap. 21.) Behold,
   then, of how many things are we ignorant--not only such as are past,
   but also of those which are present, concerning our nature, and not
   only in reference to the body, but likewise I, reference to the inward
   man; yet we are not compared to the beasts. (Tom. 7. 0n the Soul and
   its Origin, lib. 4, cap. 8.) Because the thing is either the foot
   itself, the body, or the man, who hobbles along with a lame foot; yet
   the man cannot avoid a lame foot, unless he have it healed. This can
   also be done in the inward man, but it must be by the grace of God
   through Jesus Christ. (On Perfection against Caelestius, fol. I, letter
   f.) Thus also the mind is the thing of the inward man, robbery is an
   act, avarice is a vice, that is, a quality, according to which the mind
   is evil, even when it does nothing by which it can render any service
   to avarice or robbery. (Ibid.) Beside the inward and the outward man, I
   do not indeed perceive that the apostle makes another inward of the
   inward man, that is, the innermost of the whole man. (On the Mind and
   its Origins, lib. 4, cap. 4.) He confesses in the same passage, that
   the mind is the inward man to the body, but he denies that the spirit
   is the inward man to the mind. Some persons have also made this
   supposition, that now the inward man was made, but the body of the man
   afterwards, when the Scripture says, "And God formed man of the dust of
   the ground." (Tom. 3. On Genesis according to the letter, l. 3, c. 22.)
   The apostle Paul wishes "the inward man" to be understood by the spirit
   of the mind, "the outward man" in the body and this mortal life. Yet it
   is sometimes read in his epistles, that he has not called both of these
   together "two men," but one entire man whom God made, that is, both
   that which is the inward man, and that which is the outward. But he
   does not make him after his own image, except with regard to that which
   is inward, not only what is incorporeal, but also what is rational, and
   which is not within beasts. (Tom. 6. Against Faustus the Manichee, lib.
   24, cap. 1.) Behold God is likewise proclaimed, by the same apostle, as
   former of the outward man. "But now hath God set the members every one
   in the body as it hath pleased him."(Ibid.) The apostle says that "the
   old man" is nothing more than the old [course of] life, which is in
   sin, and in which men live according to the first Adam, concerning whom
   he declares, "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin,
   and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Therefore,
   the whole of that man, both in his outward and inward part; has become
   old on account of sin, and is sentenced to the punishment of mortality,
   &c. (Ibid.) And therefore, by such a cross, the body of sin is emptied,
   that we may "not now yield our members as instruments of
   unrighteousness unto sin;" because this inward man also, if he be
   really renewed day by day, is certainly old before he is renewed. For
   that is an inward act of which the apostle speaks thus: "Put off the
   old man, and put on the new man." (Tom. 3. On the Trinity, lib. 4, cap.
   3.) But now the death of the flesh of our Lord belongs to the example
   of the death of our outward man, &c. And the resurrection of the body
   of the Lord is found to appertain to the example of the resurrection of
   our outward man." (Ibid.) Come now, let us see where is that which
   bears some resemblance to the confines of the man, both the outward and
   the inward; for, whatever we have in the mind in common with the
   beasts, is correctly said still to belong to the outward man; For not
   only will the body be accounted as "the outward man," but likewise
   certain things united to its life, by which the joints of the body and
   all the senses flourish and grow, and with which it is furnished for
   entering upon outward things. When the images of these perceptions,
   infixed in the memory, are revisited by recollection, the matter is
   still a transaction which belongs to the outward man. And in all these
   things we are at no great distance from the cattle, except that in the
   shape of our bodies we are not bending downwards, but erect. (On the
   Trinity, lib. 12, cap. 1.) While ascending, therefore, inwardly by
   certain degrees of consideration through the parts of the mind, another
   thing begins from this to occur to us, which is not common to us with
   the beasts; thence reason has its commencement, that the inward man may
   not be known. (Ibid. cap. 8.) Both believers and unbelievers are well
   acquainted with the nature of man, whose outward part, that is, the
   body, they have learned the lights of the body; but they have learned
   the inward part, that is, the mind, within themselves. (Ibid. lib. 13,
   cap. 1.) Besides, the Scriptures thus attest it to us in this that,
   when these two things also are joined together and the man lives, and
   when likewise they bestow on each of them the appellation of man,
   calling the mind "the inward man," but the body "the outward man," as
   though they were two men, while both of them together are only one man.
   (Tom. 5. On the City of God, lib. 13, cap. 24. See also lib. 11, cap.
   27 & 3.) As this outward and visible world nourishes and contains the
   outward man, so that invisible world contains the inward man. (Tom. 8.
   On the First Psalm.) He who believes in Him, eats and is invisibly
   fattened, because he is also invisibly born again. The infant is
   within, the new man is within; where young and tender vines are
   planted, there are they filled and satiated. (On John, Tract 26.)
   THEOPHYLACT Moreover, "the outward man," that is, the body, "perishes."
   How is this? While it is beaten with stripes, while it is driven about.
   "But the inward man," that is, the spirit and the mind, "is renewed."
   By what means? When it hopes well, and freely acts, as though suffering
   and rejoicing on account of God. (On 2 Corinthians iv. 16.) VIGILIUS
   Let us spiritually advert to the spiritual expressions of the apostle,
   by which he testifies, that he has seen and handled the word of God,
   not with his bodily eyes and hands, but with the members of the inner
   man. (Against Eutychus, lib. 4.) PROCOPIUS OF GAZA The substance of
   man, if you consider his inward man, is this image of God; if you take
   his outward man into consideration, his substance will be the earth, or
   the dust of the ground. Yet one and the same is the man in the
   composition which is completed from both of them. (0n Genesis, cap. 1.)
   BERNARD As the outward man is recognized by his countenance, so is the
   inward man pointed out by his will. (Sermon 3, On Ascension Day.) LEO
   THE GREAT When the outward man is slightly afflicted, let the inward
   man be refreshed; and withdrawing corporeal fullness from the flesh,
   let the mind be strengthened by spiritual delights. (Sermon 4, On
   Quadragesima Sunday.) GREGORY NAZIANZEN But in this, our nature, every
   care is towards the inward man of the heart, and every desire is
   directed to it. (Apology for his flight.) GREGORY NYSSEN Let us make
   man in our image, after our likeness. God speaks thus respecting the
   inward man. "But," you will say, "you are giving a dissertation upon
   reason. Shew us man after the image of God. Is reason the man?" Listen
   to the apostle: Though your outward man perish, yet the inward man is
   renewed day by day. By what means? I own that man is two-fold, one who
   is seen, another who is hidden, and whom he that is seen does not
   perceive. We have, therefore, an inward man, and in some degree are
   two-fold. For I am that man who is inward; but I am not those things
   which are outward; but they are mine. Neither am I the hand, but I am
   the reason which is in the mind; but the hand is a part of the outward
   man. (On Genesis, i, 26.) Thus, when the inward man, whom God
   denominates the heart, has wiped off the rusty filth which, on account
   of his depraved thirst, had grown up with his form; he will once more
   recover the likeness [of God] with his original and principal form,
   when he will become good. (On the Beatitudes.) (3.) MODERN DIVINES Let
   us now see the opinions of certain divines of our own age and religious
   profession, on the inward man. CALVIN Though the reprobate do not
   proceed so far with the children of God, as, after the casting down of
   the flesh, to be renewed in the inner man, and to flourish again.
   (Instit. lib. 2, cap. 7, sect. 9.) But the reprobate are terrified, not
   because their inward mind is moved or affected, but because, as by a
   bridle cast upon them, they refrain less from outward work, and
   inwardly curb their own depravity, which they would otherwise have shed
   abroad. (Ibid. sect. 10.) Besides, since we have already laid down a
   two-fold regimen in man, and as we have, in another place, said enough
   about the other, which is placed in the mind, or the inward man, and
   which has reference to life eternal, &c. (Ibid. lib. 4, cap. 20, sect.
   1.) Though the glory of God shines forth in the outward man, yet the
   proper seat of it is undoubtedly in the mind. (Ibid. lib. I, cap. 15,
   sect. 3.) Some persons perversely and unskillfully confound the outward
   man with the old man. For the old man, about whom the apostle treats in
   Romans vi. 6, is something far different. In the reprobate, also, the
   outward man perishes, but without any counterbalancing compensation.
   (On 2 Corinthians iv. 16.) BEZA - Is renewed, that is, acquires fresh
   strength, lest the outward man, who is sustained by the strength of the
   inward man, should be broken when assaulted with fresh evils, for which
   reason, the apostle said, in the 12th verse, "So, then, death worketh
   in us." (On 2 Corinthians iv. 16.) BUCER In holy persons, likewise,
   there are two men, an inward and an outward one. St. Paul says, "Though
   our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day." As,
   therefore, man is two-fold, so, likewise, are his judgment and his will
   two-fold--a fact which our Lord himself was not ashamed to confess,
   when he said to his Father, "nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be
   done." By saying this, "not what I will, but what thou willest, be
   done," he undoubtedly shewed that he willed what the Father willed; and
   yet, at the same time, he acknowledges that this was his will: "Remove
   this cup from me." Our Lord, therefore, acknowledges the existence
   within himself of two wills, one of which was apparently at variance
   with the other. (On Romans 5. Fol. 261.) FRANCIS JUNIUS The outward man
   hears the word of God outwardly, but the inward man hears it inwardly.
   (On the Three Verities, lib. 3, cap. 2. fol. 182.) But then, as in
   ecclesiastical administration, not only the inward man is informed in
   the knowledge of God, but as aids and services are also sought by the
   outward man, so far as the external signs of the communion of saints
   are required to feed and promote the inward communion, in this cause,
   likewise, we acknowledge that God has delegated his authority to the
   magistrate. (On Ecclesiast. lib. 3, cap. 5.) PISCATOR The outward man,
   that is, the body, as he had previously called it. The inward man, that
   is, the soul or mind. (On 2 Corinthians iv. 16.) THE CHURCH OF HOLLAND
   When, indeed, from the depraved heart, and from the inward man, evil
   fruits do proceed, a necessary consequence of this is that he who is
   desirous of boasting that he is pure, must demonstrate the truth of his
   assertion by a spontaneous approval of the commands of Christ, and by a
   willing obedience to them. (A pamphlet, in which they give a reason for
   the excommunication of Koolhaes. Fol. 93.) JOHN DRIEDO The inward man
   is the rational mind unfolded in its powers, which never perishes. But
   the body, adorned with its senses, is called "the outward man," or "our
   man who is outward and corruptible," as the apostle says in 2
   Corinthians iv. 16," though our outward man perish, yet the inward man
   is renewed day by day." Again, he says, in Romans vii. 22, "I delight
   in the law of God after the inward man." (On Grace and Free Will. Fol.
   262.) The apostle Paul frequently does not understand the same thing by
   "the old man" and by "the outward man," nor has he signified the same
   thing by "the new man" and by "the inward man;" but in the inward man
   are found both the old and the new man. For, in the mind, oldness of
   this kind is formed at the same time as newness. In it, the likeness is
   either heavenly or earthly, that is, either a carnal will, living
   according to the exciting feel of Sin, or a Spiritual will, living
   according to the Spirit of God. (Ibid.) I AM aware that the divines of
   our profession frequently take "the inward man" for the regenerate and
   this new man; but then they do not consider "the inward man," except
   with a certain quality infused into it by the Holy and Regenerating
   Spirit, with which quality, when the inward man is considered, he is
   then correctly called regenerate and a new man. If any one urges that
   the very designation of "the inward man" possesses, of itself, as great
   a value with those divines as do the titles of "the regenerate" and
   "the new man," I shall desire him to demonstrate, by sure and stable
   arguments, that the meaning adopted by those divines is conformable to
   truth. 4. Let us now approach to the other foundation, which is that
   this man, to whom it is attributed that "he delights in the law of
   God," is regenerate; and that this attribute can agree with no other
   than a regenerate person. That we may be able to clear up this matter
   in a satisfactory manner, we must see what is meant by this phrase, "to
   delight in the law of God;" or "to feel a joint delight with the law of
   God," as it appears the Greek text is capable of being rendered, and as
   an ancient version has it; for the verb, sunhdomai seems to signify the
   mutual pleasure which subsists between this man and the law, and by
   which not only this man feels a joint delight in the law, but the law
   also feels a similar delight in him. "I feel a joint delight with the
   law of God," that is, I delight with the law: the same things are
   pleasing to me as are pleasing to the law. This interpretation may be
   illustrated and confirmed by a comparison of similar phrases, which
   frequently occur in other passages of the New Testament; Sunagwnisasqai
   moi "that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for
   me"--Sunanapauswmai umin "that I may with you be refreshed, (Rom. xv.
   30,32) -- Sunhqlhsan moi "those women who laboured with me in the
   gospel," (Phil. iv. 3) -- Summarturei tw pneumati umwn "the Spirit
   itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of
   God," (Rom. viii. 16,) from which St. Chrysostom not inappropriately
   explains, "I feel a joint delight with the law," by this paraphrase, "I
   assent to the law that it is well applied, as the law, also, in return,
   assents to me, that it is a good thing for a man to will to do it." He
   takes this explanation of the phrase from the text itself, which kind
   of interpretation not only may obtain, but likewise ought to be
   employed, in this passage, since there is no other in the whole of the
   Scriptures in which this same phrase is used. If any one wishes to
   attach the same meaning to the phrase as to that which is used in Psalm
   i. 2, "But his delight is in the law of the Lord;" let him who says
   this, know that it is incumbent on him to produce proof for his
   assertion. This is not unreasonably required of him, because the
   antecedents and the consequences which are attributed to the man who is
   denoted in the first Psalm and described as being blessed, are not only
   vastly different from those things which are attributed to the man on
   whom we are now treating, but are likewise quite contrary to them.
   Conceding, however, this for the sake of argument, but by no means
   absolutely granting it, (which I am far from doing,) we must observe,
   that this man [in Romans vii. 22] is said, not simply "to delight in
   the law of God," or "to feel a joint delight with the law of God," but
   he does so with restriction and relatively, that is "according to the
   inward man." This restriction intimates that "the inward man" has not
   obtained the pre-eminence in this man, but that it is weaker than the
   flesh; as the latter is that which hinders it from being able, in
   operation and reality, to perform the law, to which it consents, and in
   which it delights. He who will compare the following verse with this
   will perceive that the cause of that restriction is the one which we
   have here assigned. For in the subsequent verse, (the 23rd,) it is not
   said, "But I see another law in my members, according to which I do not
   delight in the law of God," such as the opposition ought to have been,
   it, by that restriction, the apostle wished only to ascribe this
   "delighting" to the man according to one part of him, and to take it
   away according to the other part of him. But since the apostle not only
   takes this "delighting" from the other part of him, but likewise
   attributes it to the power of warring against that inward man and
   overcoming him, it is evident that the restriction has been added on
   this account - - to shew that, in the man who is now the subject of
   discussion, "the inward man" has not the dominion, but is, in fact, the
   inferior. Let him who is desirous to contradict these remarks, shew us,
   in any passage in which regenerate persons are made the subject of
   investigation, a similar restriction employed, and adduced for another
   purpose. From these observations, therefore, it appears that the
   proposition is most deservedly denied. Let us now attend to the
   assumption. 5. l say that the assumption is proposed in a mutilated
   form, as it was previously in the argument produced from the eighteenth
   verse. For with it, the apostle joins the following verse, in such a
   manner that the twenty-third verse may be the principal part of a
   compound and discrete axiom, employed for the purpose of proving what
   the apostle intended. But that which is now placed in the assumption,
   is a less principal part, conducing to the illustration of the other by
   separation. From this, it follows that the conclusion cannot be deduced
   From the premises, because the proposition is destitute of truth, the
   assumption mutilated, and the conclusion itself, beyond the purpose of
   the apostle and contrary to his design. 6. Let us see whether any thing
   further can be brought from the twenty-third verse for the
   demonstration of the contrary opinion. The man who has within him,
   beside the law of his members, the law of his mind, which is contrary
   to the other, is a regenerate man. Such a man is the one mentioned in
   this passage; Therefore, he is a regenerate man. (1.) The defenders of
   the contrary opinion believe the proposition in this syllogism to be
   true, because "the law of the mind" is opposed to "the law of the
   members," as it consents to the law of God--a quality which they
   suppose to belong only to the regenerate. This, they think, is
   confirmed from the circumstance that the same apostle expressly calls a
   certain mind, in Col. ii. 18, "a fleshly mind," which he likewise calls
   in Romans viii. 7, "the carnal mind." But the proposition cannot be
   supported by these passages; for it is simply false, and those
   arguments which are produced in proof of it are inappropriate. For to
   some of the regenerate also, (that is, to those who are under the law,
   who have some knowledge of the law, who have thoughts accusing or else
   excusing them, and who know that concupiscence is sin,) belongs
   something beside "the law of the members," "a fleshly mind," and one
   that is "carnal," which is opposite and repugnant to these: And this is
   "the work of the law written in their hearts;" which is neither "the
   law of the members," "a fleshly mind," nor one that is "carnal," but it
   contends with them. For a conscience or consciousness of good and evil,
   which compels a man, though in vain, to good, and deters him from evil,
   is directly opposed to "the law of the members" impelling to evil, and
   "to the carnal affections which cannot be subject to the law of God."
   For this conscience consents to the law of God, and is the instrument
   of the same law even in an unregenerate man to accuse and convict him.
   We may, therefore, be permitted to deny that proposition, and to demand
   stronger proofs for it. (2.) With regard to the assumption, we may say
   the same as we did about the assumption in the previous syllogism--that
   it is not fully proposed, as it ought to have been, and it omits those
   things which were joined together in the text of the apostle. But those
   things are of such a description, as, when added to the assumption,
   will easily point out the falsity of the proposition; that is, such is
   the opposition in this man between this law of the members and that of
   the mind, that the former not only "wars against" the latter, but
   likewise obtains the conquest in the fight; that is, "it brings man
   into captivity under the law of sin." From these observations also it
   is evident, that no good consequence can ensue from the assumption. 7.
   But let us now try, whether something cannot be deduced from these two
   verses for the establishment of our opinion. It appeals indeed to me,
   that I can from them deduce an invincible argument for the refutation
   of the contrary opinion, and for the confirmation of my own. (1.) The
   argument in refutation of the contrary opinion may be stated in the
   following manner: The law of the mind which wars against the law of the
   members, is conquered by the law of the members, so that the man "is
   brought into captivity to the law of sin which is in his members;" (as
   it occurs in this very passage; ) But the law of the Spirit of life in
   Christ Jesus, when warring against the law of the members, overcomes
   the latter; so that it liberates the man, who had been brought into
   captivity under the law of sin, from the law of sin and death: (Rom.
   viii. 2.) Therefore, the law of the Spirit is not the law of the mind;
   neither is the law of the mind, the law of the Spirit. This is evident
   from simple inversion, and from this very syllogism, the premises being
   so transposed, as for the assumption to take the place of the
   proposition, and vice versa: and, therefore, the word "mind" is not
   used in this passage for "the Spirit." This argument is irrefragable.
   Let him who is desirous of proving the contrary, make the experiment,
   and he will find this to be the result. But its peculiar force will be
   more correctly understood towards the close of this investigation, in
   which is more fully explained the whole of the matter about which the
   apostle is here treating. (2.) For the confirmation of my own opinion,
   I deduce the following argument from these verses: That man, who
   delights indeed in the law of God after the inward man, but who, with
   the law of his mind warring against the law of his members, not only
   cannot prevail against the latter, but is also conquered by it and
   brought into captivity under the law of sin, while the law of his mind
   fruitlessly contends against it, is an unregenerate man, and placed,
   not under grace, but under the law; But though this man delights in the
   law of God after the inward man, and though with the law of his mind he
   wars against the law of His members; yet not only is he unable to
   prevail against the law of his members, but he is likewise brought into
   captivity under the law of sin by the law of his members, the law of
   his mind maintaining a strong but useless contest; Therefore, the man
   [described] in this passage is unregenerate, and placed, not under
   grace, but under the law; Or, to state the argument in a shorter form,
   omitting whatever it is possible to omit--That man in whom the law of
   the members so wages war against the law of the mind, as, when the
   latter is overcome, or at least while it offers a vain resistance, to
   bring the man himself into captivity under the law of sin, is
   unregenerate, and placed under the law; But in this man, about whom the
   apostle is treating, the law of the members so wages war with the law
   of the mind, as, when the latter is overcome, or at least while it
   offers a vain resistance, to bring the man himself into captivity under
   the law of sin; Therefore, this man is unregenerate and placed under
   the law. (3.) The truth of the proposition rests on these three
   reasons: I. Because a regenerate man not only with the law of his mind
   wages war against the law of his members, but he does this principally
   with the law of the Spirit, that is, by the strength and power of the
   Holy Spirit; for it is said in Gal. v. 17: "The flesh lusteth against
   the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh." II. Because far
   different is the result of that contest which, by the strength and
   power of the Spirit, or by "the law of the Spirit," a regenerate man
   maintains against the law of the members and against the flesh. For the
   law of the Spirit always obtains the victory, except when the man
   ceases from employing it in the battle, and from defending himself with
   it against the invading temptations of the flesh, Satan, and the world.
   III. Because it is not an attribute of a regenerate man, of one who is
   placed under grace, to be brought into captivity under the law of sin;
   but that, rather, is his which is ascribed to him in the second verse
   of the following chapter--"The law of the Spirit of life in Christ
   Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." For when he was
   formerly placed under the law, he was in captivity under the strength
   and power of sin. I will now confirm these reasons against the
   objections which are, or which can be, made against them. Against the
   first it may be objected--"Since the law of the mind,' and the law of
   the Spirit,' are one, they are in this argument unskillfully
   distinguished; both because no one lights against the law of the
   members except by the law of the Spirit, or by the strength and power
   of the Holy Spirit; and therefore the law of the mind is the law of the
   Spirit." To this I reply, it has already been proved, that the law of
   the mind, and the law of the Spirit, are not the same, and that the
   conscience also wages war against the law of the members in those men
   who are under the law. Against the Second reason it may be objected,
   "Even the regenerate themselves offend in many things.' (James iii. 2.)
   There is on earth no man that sinneth not.' (1 Kings viii. 46.) The
   regenerate cannot say with truth that they have no sin.' (1 John i.
   8.)" With other objections similar in their import. To these, I reply,
   that I heartily acknowledge all these things, but that I do not
   perceive how by means of them the second reason can be weakened. For
   these expressions are not repugnant to each other--"In many things the
   regenerate offend," and "The regenerate most generally gain the victory
   in the contest against sin," that is, when they use the arms with which
   they are furnished by the Holy Spirit. (4.), any one says, "In this
   contest, the regenerate are more frequently the conquered than the
   conquerors," I shall request him to explain how then it can be declared
   concerning the regenerate, "that they walk not after the flesh, but
   after the Spirit;" for, "to be the conquered" is "to fulfill the
   desires of the flesh;" and he who usually does this, "walks after the
   flesh." But many passages of Scripture teach that this contest, which
   the regenerate maintain against sin by the strength and power of the
   Holy Spirit, has generally a felicitous and successful termination;
   "for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the
   victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that
   overcometh the world, but he that believeth Jesus to be the Son of
   God," (1 John v. 4,5.) "Submit yourselves therefore to God; resist the
   devil, and he will flee from you." (James iv. 7.) Greater is He that is
   in you, than he that is in the world." (1 John iv. 4.) "Put on the
   whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of
   the devil. Wherefore, take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye
   may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to
   stand." (Ephes. vi. 11,13.) "I can do all things through Christ which
   strengtheneth me." (Phil. iv. 13.) "All things are possible to him that
   believeth." (Mark ix. 23.) This truth also is proved, by various
   examples, through the whole of Hebrews 11. "Now unto him that is able
   to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to
   the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory," &c. (Ephes. iii.
   20,21.) "Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling," "and to
   present you, faultless, before the presence of his glory with exceeding
   joy, to the only wise God our saviour, be glory," &c. (Jude 24, 25.)
   "They that are after the Spirit, do mind the things of the Spirit. If
   ye, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
   live. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him
   that loved us." (Rom. viii. 5,13,37.) By many other passages of
   Scripture, this may also be proved. GALATIANS v, 16-1 8. But let us now
   consider Gal. v. 16-18, and let us compare it with Romans vii. 22,23,
   the passage at present under investigation, that it may also clearly
   appear, from such consideration and comparison, that the result of the
   contest between the Spirit and the flesh is generally this: the Spirit
   departs from the combat the conqueror of the flesh, especially as, in
   this seventh chapter to the Romans, we perceive an entirely contrary
   issue or result is described and deplored. The passage may be thus
   rendered: "This I say then, Walk in the Spirit and fulfill not that
   after which the flesh lusteth," or "ye shall not fulfill the lusts of
   the flesh." "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
   against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other; that ye
   may not do the things that ye would. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye
   are not under the law? The exhortation of the apostle occurs in the
   sixteenth verse; and, on account of the ambiguity of the Greek word, it
   may be read in two different ways, "fulfill not," or "ye shall not
   fulfill." If the former rendering be adopted, then the exhortation
   consists of two parts, of which the one teaches what must be done, and
   the other what must be omitted; that is, we must walk in the Spirit,
   and the desires of the flesh must not be fulfilled." But if the clause
   be rendered in the second manner, then the sixteenth verse contains an
   exhortation in these words: "Walk in the Spirit;" and a consectary
   subjoined to the exhortation in these words: "And ye shall not fulfill
   the desires or lusts of the flesh." The latter mode of reading the
   passage seems to be more agreeable to the mind of the apostle; for he
   had previously, in the thirteenth verse, exhorted the Galatians not to
   abuse their Christian liberty for carnal licentiousness and
   lasciviousness. But now, in the sixteenth verse, he produces a remedy,
   by which they will be able to restrain and curb the assaults and the
   power of the flesh, and which is, if they walk in the Spirit, it shall
   then come to pass, that they shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.
   In the seventeenth verse a reason is added, that is deduced from the
   contrariety or contest which subsists between the flesh and the Spirit,
   and from either the end or the result of this contest. (1.) The
   contrariety or contest is described in these words: "For the flesh
   lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh." From
   which is manifest the necessity both of the exhortation, not to abuse
   their Christian liberty to carnal licentiousness, and not to fulfill
   the lusts of the flesh; and of the remedy, by which alone the lusts of
   the flesh can be curbed and restrained, and which is this: "if they
   walk in the Spirit, that lusteth against the flesh." For it is from
   this enmity and contrariety which subsists between the flesh and the
   Spirit that the conclusion is drawn, "If ye walk in the Spirit, ye
   shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh." From this it is also
   manifest, that this latter mode of rendering is better adapted to the
   meaning of the apostle. (2.) The end or result of this contest is
   described in these words: "And these are contrary the one to the other,
   that ye may not do the things that ye would." I have said that the end
   or the issue of the contest is here described; because some persons
   suppose that its issue, and not its end, is pointed out in this
   passage. (i.)But the particle, ina "that," which is used by the
   apostle, signifies the end or intention, and not the result or issue;
   and this interpretation is entirely agreeable to the mind of the
   apostle. "For the Spirit lusteth against the flesh" for this purpose,
   "that we may not do those things" which we lust according to the flesh,
   and "which we would," the consequence of which is, "if we walk in the
   Spirit, we shall not fulfill the desires of the flesh." And, on the
   contrary, since "the flesh also lusteth against the Spirit" for this
   purpose, "that we may not do those things which we lust according to
   the Spirit," it follows that if we walk in the flesh or according to
   the flesh, we shall not fulfill the desires of the Spirit. But this
   rendering is agreeable to the scope or design of the apostle, "that ye
   may not do what things soever ye would according to the flesh." (ii.)
   If we assert that the result or issue is here signified, then the
   meaning will likewise be two-fold. For it will be possible for it to be
   as follows: "The flesh and the Spirit are contrary the one to the
   other, so that ye cannot do those things which according to the Spirit
   ye would." It may likewise be this: "So that ye cannot do these things
   which, according to the flesh ye would." That is, this contest obtains
   the following result, "that ye cannot do those things which, according
   to the Spirit, ye would;" or, "that ye cannot do those things, which,
   according to the flesh, ye would." But let us see which of these two
   meanings is the more suitable: Truly, the latter of them is. It is not
   only more suitable, but likewise necessary, if the apostle is here
   treating about the issue or result. This will be still more apparent
   from the absurdity of the admonition, if the passage be explained in
   the other sense: The apostle admonishes the Galatians, "to walk in the
   Spirit, and not to fulfill the desires of the flesh;" (for we will now
   retain this rendering of the latter clause, as that which is more
   consentaneous with the meaning that explains the passage concerning
   this issue or result;) and the persuasion to this will then be: "For
   the flesh and the Spirit are contrary the one to the other, by this
   result, that ye cannot do those things which, according to the Spirit,
   ye would." This indeed is not to exhort, but to dissuade and dehort by
   a forewarning of the unhappy result. Besides, reason itself requires,
   according to [logical] scientific usage, that what has been proposed be
   drawn out in the conclusion; otherwise the parts of connection will be
   broken. But the proposition was either this--"Walk in the Spirit, and
   ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh," or it was this: "Walk in
   the Spirit, and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh." I am desirous to
   have it demonstrated to me, by what means this proposition can be
   concluded from the eighteenth verse understood about the issue or
   result, by which the flesh hinders the Galatians from doing that which,
   according to the Spirit, they would. But it has been already shown,
   that each of these propositions may be fairly concluded from the
   passage, when understood as relating to the end or intention of the
   conflict, nay, when also understood as referring to the issue or result
   when the Spirit is the conqueror. It is apparent, therefore, not only
   that this is the end or design of the contest which is here mentioned
   from the lusting of the Spirit, but that this is likewise its issue or
   result from the strength and power of the Spirit--that, when the flesh
   is subdued, the Spirit comes off as the conqueror; and that the man
   who, by the Spirit, wages war against the flesh, and who walks in the
   Spirit, does not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. From these is inferred
   a consectary in the eighteenth verse: "But if ye be led of the Spirit,
   ye are not under the law;" that is, if ye walk in the Spirit, if under
   the guidance of the Spirit ye contend against the lusts of the flesh,
   and contend so as not to fulfill them, from these circumstances you may
   assuredly conclude that ye are not under the law. In this consectary,
   we see, that the phrases, "to be under the law," and "not to fulfill
   the lusts of the flesh," are opposed to each other; for the latter of
   them is descriptive of the proper effect of the guidance of the Spirit.
   Wherefore, the phrases, "to be under the law," and "to fulfill the
   lusts of the flesh," are consentaneous and of the same import. But this
   is the very thing which is asserted in Romans vi. 14: "For sin shall
   not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under
   grace." From this, it is apparent, that the dominion of sin, which is
   the cause why the lusts of the flesh are fulfilled, prevails in those
   persons who are under the law. But since the dominion of sin does not
   obtain in those who are under grace, (and, in fact, on this account,
   because they are under grace,) it is therefore evident that these
   phrases, "to be under grace," and "to be led by the Spirit," are
   consentaneous, nay, that they are exactly the same. For the effect of
   each of them is one and alike, and that is, to prevent sin from having
   dominion over a man, and to hinder man from fulfilling the lusts of the
   flesh, which is also explained at great length in Romans 8, in a manner
   agreeable to that which is briefly laid down in this seventeenth verse,
   that is, "The Spirit is contrary to the flesh for this purpose--that
   men may not do those things which, according to the flesh, they would."
   But, from Romans 7 it is very plain, that the result of that contest is
   different from the one upon which the apostle is here treating: For, in
   that chapter, the man does that which, after the flesh, he would, and
   does not what he is said to will after the inward man; the law of God,
   the law of the mind, and the inward man, vainly attempting to restrain
   the power of sin and to hinder the lusts of the flesh, because all
   these [strive as they may] are debilitated through the flesh. 9. If any
   one urge this as an objection, "It likewise befalls the best of the
   regenerate, that they do not the things which, according to the Spirit,
   they would, but that they fulfill the lusts of the flesh;" I perfectly
   assent to the truth of this, if the small addition be made, that "this
   sometimes happens to the regenerate." For if such be their general
   practice, they do not now walk in the Spirit; though this is a property
   of the regenerate. I say, that Romans 7 does not describe what
   sometimes befalls the pious, and that it contains a description of the
   state of that man about whom the apostle is there treating, that is, of
   a man who is under the law, before he is led by the guidance of grace,
   and is governed by the motions of the Holy Spirit. This is confirmed by
   the passage in Gal. v. 16-18. Then I reply, such a case as this does
   not occur from the circumstance of the Spirit, who has for a long time
   maintained a strenuous contest with the desires of the flesh, being at
   length conquered, and yielding on account of impotence or weakness: But
   it happens, because the man is either overtaken with temptation and
   overcome, before he begins to oppose to it the arms of the Spirit and
   of grace; or, in the progress of the conflict, he throws out of his
   hands those arms which, at the commencement, he began to use; or he
   uses them no longer, having begun the battle in the Spirit, but ending
   in the flesh. In no other way than in this can it happen, that the
   flesh, the world and Satan can overcome us; because "greater is He who
   is in us, than he that is in the world "as has already been pointed out
   in several passages. Without manifest ignominy and contumely poured on
   divine grace and on the Spirit of Christ, no other cause can be
   assigned why the pious, and those who are placed under grace, should
   sometimes be conquered by the flesh, the world and Satan; for either
   the Spirit that is in us is not the stronger of the two; or, while
   lusting and fighting against the flesh, He overcomes. And how can it
   possibly come to pass, that He who has conquered the flesh while it was
   still in its full strength, and has thus subjected us to Himself,
   should not be able to gain the victory over the flesh when it is
   crucified and dead in the body of Christ? 10. To the Third reason it is
   objected, "Even the regenerate may in some degree and relatively be
   said to be captives under sin, that is, so far as they are not yet
   fully regenerated, and still feel within themselves the motions of the
   flesh lusting against the Spirit, from which they are not completely
   delivered while they continue in this mortal body." I grant the
   antecedent, but I deny the consequence; for so far are the scriptures
   from ascribing the detention of the regenerate as captives under sin,
   to the imperfection of regeneration and to the remains of the flesh,
   that they are said with respect to this very regeneration to be freed
   from the yoke and slavery of sin and from the tyranny of the devil.
   "The remains of sin survive in the regenerate," and, "The regenerate
   are detained as captives by the remains of sin," are contradictory
   affirmations: For the former of the two is a token of sin conquered and
   overcome; the latter attributes victory and triumph to sin. After the
   Holy Spirit has commenced the mortification and death of sin, what is
   the act of the same Spirit respecting sin? Undoubtedly it is the
   persecution of the remains of sin, that He may subdue and extinguish
   them until they no longer exist; "and when their place is sought after,
   it is no more to be found," as St. Augustine has elegantly observed,
   when treating on this matter in a passage of his works. But the cause
   why such an opinion as this is entertained, is because "deliverance
   from sin" and "slavery under its tyrannical power," "a being loosed
   from the chains of Satan" and "captivity under his tyranny," are so
   accounted as if they can concur together, as the phrase is, in remiss
   degrees, and meet together in one subject, in much the same manner as
   the colour of white and that of black meet together in green, and heat
   and cold meet together in lukewarmness. Yet this matter stands in a
   situation vastly different; for liberty cannot consist with even the
   smallest portion of servitude or captivity; though it may labour under
   great difficulties in resisting its assaulting foes, and though it may
   occasionally come out of the conflict with something like a defeat. But
   if the matter stood in the relation of similes which have been adduced,
   yet even then it could not be said, "This man is partly free from sin,
   and partly its slave and captive;" but a necessity would then arise for
   the existence of a third thing from these two, which might obtain the
   name of "a medium between the extremes," belonging neither to this nor
   to that. But I am desirous to see some passage of Scripture adduced,
   where that is said about the regenerate, and about those who are placed
   under grace, which is ascribed to the man about whom the apostle is
   treating, or what is equivalent to it. ISAIAH LXIV, 6 11. But a passage
   is produced from the prophet Isaiah to prove that pious persons, and
   those who are placed under grace are, by the law of their members,
   brought into captivity under the law of sin. The degree of correctness
   with such an affirmation is made, will be very manifest from a
   comparison of the two passages. That in Isaiah (lxiv, 6) says, "But we
   are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as filthy
   rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind,
   have taken us away." The passage in Romans, (vii, 23,) now under
   investigation, is this. "But I see another law in my members, warring
   against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law
   of sin which is in my members." Let us now approach and institute a
   comparison. The subject of the first of these passages is, the
   captivity by which the children of Israel were led away into exile on
   account of their sins; the subject of the latter is, captivity under
   sin; therefore, this is to pass over to a different genus, contrary to
   the method observed in every approved discussion. In the former of
   these passages, the subject is the punishments which that people
   deservedly suffered on account of the actual sins which they had
   committed against God; but, in the latter, the subject is the cause
   whence it arises that the man who consents to the law of God, and who,
   with the law of his mind, wages war against the law of his members, is
   conquered and overcome, so that he actually commits sin, to which he is
   instigated and impelled by sin which dwelleth in him. Wherefore, the
   latter passage treats upon the CAUSE of actual sin, and the former upon
   the PUNISHMENTS of actual sins. For this phrase, "We all do fade as a
   leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away," does not
   signify that those men were impelled to some kind of sin through the
   depraved lusts of the flesh, as by a vehement wind, or that they melted
   away, as it were, into sins; but it signifies, that, on account of
   actual sins, which are distinguished by the appellation of "our
   iniquities," they are driven away into banishment as by a wind, and
   were scattered about as leaves. Let this passage be compared with the
   first Psalm, in which similar declarations are made concerning the
   wicked. Consult our interpreters of holy writ, such as Calvin,
   Musculus, Gualther, &c., and it will be evident, even with respect to
   the things which precede it, that the whole of this passage is unaptly
   cited by many persons to prove what they are desirous to establish. For
   the plainer and more obvious explanation of this matter we must
   observe, that there is a two-fold captivity under the tyranny of
   sin--the one, that of our primeval origin from Adam, according to which
   we are all born "children of wrath" and the servants of sin--the other,
   that of our own particular act, when, by actual transgressions, we
   subject and bind ourselves still more to sin, and engage in its
   service. Some persons will have this two-fold servitude to have been
   allegorically typified by the Egyptian and Babylonian captivities. For
   the Israelites, in their parents, entered into Egypt; and while there,
   after a lapse of years, they began to be oppressed and to be regarded
   as servants. The same people, on account of their sins, were led away,
   by the violence of their enemies, into captivity in Babylon. But the
   captivity about which the apostle is here treating, is posterior to the
   first of these two kinds; for the law of the members, which we have
   from our primeval origin, waging war with the law of the mind, when the
   latter is overcome, brings a man who is under the law into captivity to
   the law of sin, that very man who was formerly conceived in sin and
   born in iniquity. And, to express the whole in one word, he who was
   born in sin and originally under captivity to it, is brought into
   captivity under the law of sin by means of actual sins. From these
   observations, therefore, it is apparent, that the proposition of our
   syllogism is true, and stands unshaken against all these objections.
   The assumption stands in the very text of the apostle, from which the
   conclusion follows, that the man about whom the apostle treats in this
   passage, is an unregenerate man, and not placed under grace, but under
   the law.

  VERSE THE TWENTY-FOURTH

   The lamentable exclamation, O wretched man that I am! -- a two-fold
   reading of it. 2. The body of death is the body of sin. 3. By four
   reasons it is proved that the body of death is not our mortal body. 4.
   This is confirmed by the testimonies of St. Augustine and Epiphanius.
   5. An argument in favour of the true opinion. 6. Another argument in
   its favour. 1. From the condition of this man, when accurately
   considered by himself, follows the mournful lament and exclamation, "O
   wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death, or from this body of death?" Of this, a two-fold explanation is
   produced, according the double meaning of the words--either "from the
   body of this death," or "from this body of death," which some people
   interpret by "this mortal body that we bear about with us," and others,
   by "that body of sin which has the dominion in a man who is under the
   law, and which renders him liable to death." The latter interpretation,
   however, is more agreeable both to the phrase and to the context; for
   the pronoun, toutou must not be referred to Swmatov "the body," but to
   Qanatou "death," to which it is most nearly conjoined; and the clause
   ought to be rendered thus: "Who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death," [which is sin not only existing within me, but dwelling and
   reigning]? as it is expressed in the 17th and 20th verses. 2. For the
   apostle attributes a body to sin in the sixth verse of the sixth
   chapter of this epistle: "Our old man is crucified with him, that The
   Body of Sin might be destroyed," the destruction of which is followed
   by a deliverance from the servitude of sin, as it is expressed in the
   same verse. The phrase also occurs in Col. ii. 11: "In putting off the
   Body of the Sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ."
   Wherefore, according to this mode of reading it, the meaning of the
   exclamation is, "Who shall deliver me from this tyranny of sin, which,
   reigning in me and dwelling in my flesh, bringing me into captivity and
   subjecting me to itself, brings certain death to me?" 3. Some other
   persons are urgent about a different rendering, and give this meaning
   to the words, "Who shall deliver me from this mortal body?" That is, as
   the apostle speaks in another passage, "I desire to be dissolved, and
   to be with Christ." But this meaning does not agree with the
   exclamation, (1.) On account of the construction, which declares that
   the pronoun, toutou "this," must not be referred to the body, but to
   death. (2.) Because the preceding verses do not permit this meaning to
   be entertained. For the force and tyranny of sin, dwelling in this man,
   and impelling him to fulfill his desires, is the subject on which the
   apostle is here treating. But "the deliverance" which is earnestly
   sought in this 24th verse, opposed to "the captivity" which is the
   subject of the verse. (3.) On account of the thanksgiving which is
   appended to it, and which ought not to be subjoined to a desire which
   was not then fulfilled [if the meaning of the phrase were, this mortal
   body]. (4.) Because the grace of Christ is not simply to deliver out of
   this mortal body, but to free us from the body of sin and from its
   dominion. It is true indeed, that, through the blessed analusin
   "dissolution" or "departure," for which we are waiting in the faith and
   hope of Christ, rest is granted to us from all our labours, and from
   the conflict of lusts with which we are inwardly attacked. But in this
   passage the apostle is treating, not about the conflict and impulse of
   lusts which exist within us, but about the fulfilling of those lusts by
   that impulse to which "the law of the mind" opposes itself in vain. 4.
   St. Augustine is one of my supporters, who says, in his treatise On
   Nature and Grace (cap. 53,) "The saints most certainly do not pray to
   be delivered from the substance of the body, which is good, but from
   carnal vices; from which no man is delivered without the grace of the
   saviour, nor at the time of his departure from the body, when it dies."
   It is no injury to my interpretation, that St. Augustine here says,
   that, according to his interpretation, "Saints or holy persons pray for
   deliverance from carnal vices" &c.; I only point out what he understood
   by "the body of death? On the Perfection of Justice, against Celestius,
   St. Augustine also says, "It is one thing, therefore, to depart out of
   this body, which the last day of the present life compels all men to
   do; but it is another thing to be delivered from the body of this
   death, which divine grace alone, through Jesus Christ, imparts to his
   saints and believers? Epiphanius, On the 64th Heresy, (lib. 2, tom. I,)
   from Methodius, says, "Wherefore, O Aglaophon, he does not call this
   body death, but sin which dwells in the body through the lust of the
   flesh, and from which God has delivered him by his coming? 5.
   Wherefore, from the 24th verse, when rightly understood, I argue thus
   for the establishment of my own opinion: Those men who are placed under
   grace are not wretched; But this man is wretched; Therefore, this man
   is not placed under grace. The assumption is in the text, and thus
   placed beyond all controversy. In reference to the proposition, perhaps
   some one will say, "Men, placed under grace, are partly blessed, and
   partly wretched--blessed, as they are regenerate and partakers of the
   grace of Christ--wretched, as they still have within them the remains
   of sin, with which they ought to maintain a constant warfare. This is a
   sure sign of a felicity which is not yet full and perfect." I confess
   that, while the regenerate continue as sojourners in this mortal life,
   they do not attain to a felicity that is full, complete in all its
   parts, and perfect. But I do not recollect ever to have read [in the
   Scriptures] that they are, on this account, called "wretched" with
   regard to the "spiritual life which they live by faith of the Son of
   God," though, in reference to this natural life, "they be of all men
   most miserable." (1 Cor. xv. 19.) The opposite to this may be easily
   proved from the Scriptures: "Blessed are the poor in spirit--they that
   mourn--that hunger and thirst after righteousness," &c. (Matt. v.
   3-12.) "But," some one will rejoin, "Is it not wretched to contend with
   the remains of sin, to be buffeted by the messenger of Satan, sometimes
   to be overcome, and to be grievously injured?" It is undoubtedly
   desirable that this were not necessary, that it never occurred, that
   they might be delivered from the messenger of Satan; but the
   contenders, and those who are thus buffeted, cannot be called
   "wretched" on account of that contest and buffeting. But it is wretched
   indeed, to be overcome; yet neither are they called "wretched," who,
   though they be sometimes conquered, more frequently obtain the victory
   over the world, sin and Satan. 6. He who desires to be delivered from
   the body of this death, that is, from the dominion and tyranny of sin,
   is not placed under grace, but under the law. But this man desires to
   be delivered from the dominion and tyranny of sin; therefore, this man
   is not placed under grace, but under the law. The proposition is true,
   because regenerate men, and those who are placed under grace, are free
   from the servitude and tyranny of sin--not indeed perfectly free, but
   yet so far as to render it impossible for them to be said to be under
   the dominion and servitude of sin, if the person who speaks concerning
   them be desirous of talking in accordance with the Scriptures. But it
   has been already proved, that this man is desirous of being freed from
   the body of sin which dwells and reigns within him; therefore, the
   conclusion regularly follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VERSE THE TWENTY-FIFTH

   1. Various readings of the first clause, from the ancient fathers. 2.
   In the latter clause, this man is said "to serve the law of God with
   his mind, but with his flesh, the law of sin." 3. "To serve God," and
   "to serve the law of God," are not the same thing. 4. The various kinds
   of law mentioned in this chapter, with a diagram, and the explanation
   of it. 5. From this verse nothing can be obtained in confirmation of
   the contrary opinion. 1. St. Chrysostom reads the former part of this
   verse thus: "I thank," &c., which is also the reading of Theophylact.
   This is the reading of St. Ambrose: "The grace of God through Jesus
   Christ." St. Jerome, also, against Pelagius, adopts the same reading.
   St. Augustine renders the clause thus: "By the grace of God through
   Jesus Christ." (Discourse 5. On the Words of the Apostle. Tom. 10.)
   Epiphanius renders it, "The grace of God through Jesus Christ." (From
   Methodius against Origen, Heresy 64. Lib. 2, tom. 1.) But this clause
   contains a thanksgiving, in which St. Paul returns thanks to God that
   he, in his own person, has been delivered from this body of sin, about
   which he had been treating, and to which that man was liable whose
   character he was then personating. In this, thanksgiving is contained,
   by implication, an answer to the preceding interrogatory exclamation;
   that is, "The grace of God will deliver this man from the body of this
   death, from which he could not be delivered by the law." This is
   directly and openly explained by some copies of the Greek original, in
   which this verse is thus read: "The grace of God, through our Lord
   Jesus Christ," that is, "This grace will deliver me, or the man whose
   character I have been personating, from the body of this death"--a
   thing which it was the chief purpose of the apostle to prove in this
   investigation. 2. In the latter part of the same verse, is something
   resembling a brief recapitulation of all that had been previously
   spoken, in which the state of the man about whom the apostle is here
   treating, is briefly defined and described in the following words: "So
   then, with the mind, I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh,
   the law of sin." In the correct explanation of these phrases, lies an
   important key for the clear exposition and dilucidation of the whole
   matter; these phrases must, therefore, be subjected to a diligent
   examination. 3. Those persons who interpret this passage as relating to
   a regenerate man and to one placed under grace, are desirous to
   intimate, by these phrases, that St. Paul, so far as he was regenerate,
   "served God," but that so far as he was unregenerate, and still partly
   carnal, "he served sin." They also take "the mind" in the acceptation
   of the regenerated portion of man, and "the flesh" for that portion of
   him which is not yet regenerate; and they suppose that "to serve the
   law of God" is the same thing as "to serve God," and that "to serve the
   law of sin" is the same thing as "to serve sin." But neither of these
   suppositions can be proved by this text or by other passages of
   Scripture. (1.) For the apostle is not accustomed to bestow on man, as
   he is regenerate, the epithet of "the mind," but that of "the Spirit."
   And this he does for a very just reason; for "the mind" is the subject
   of regeneration, "the Holy Spirit" is the effector of it, from
   communion with whom a participation also with his name arises. Besides,
   "the mind" is attributed to the flesh:" Vainly puffed up by his fleshly
   mind." (Col. ii. 18.) The gentiles are said to have "walked in the
   vanity of their mind." (Ephes. ii. 17.) Idolaters are "given over to a
   reprobate mind;" (Rom. i. 28; ) and the apostle mentions "men of
   corrupt minds." (1 Thess. vi. 5; 2 Tim. iii. 8.) (2.) But that "to
   serve God" is not the same as "to serve the law of God," and "to serve
   sin" is not the same as "to serve the law of sin," is evident, First.
   From the difference of the words themselves. For it is very probable,
   that different phrases denote different meaning. If any one denies
   this, the proof of his position is incumbent on himself. Secondly. From
   the words of Christ, who denied the possibility of any man serving two
   masters, God and Mammon, God and sin. If any one say that "it is
   possible for this to be done in a different respect, that is, to serve
   God with the mind, and to serve sin with the flesh," I reply that, by
   such a petty distinction as this, the general affirmation of Christ is
   evaded, to the great detriment of piety and divine worship, and that a
   wide door will thus be opened for libertines and Pseudo-Nicodemites.
   But some one will say, "The apostle expressly affirms this, which I
   deny, and my denial will be supported by the phrases themselves, when
   correctly explained, as they will soon be; for this man serves sin, and
   not God. Thirdly. From the perpetual usage of the Scriptures, which are
   not accustomed to employ these restrictions when any man is said to
   serve God, or to serve sin. Wherefore, since they are employed in this
   passage, it is exceedingly probable that the same thing is not
   signified by these different phrases. 4. But the subject itself, upon
   which the apostle here treats, when placed plainly before the eyes, may
   disclose to us the true meaning of these phrases; so that the man who
   will inspect it with honest eyes, and with eyes desirous to investigate
   and ascertain the truth alone, may have that with which to satisfy
   himself. The apostle, therefore, here makes mention of four laws. (1.)
   The law of God. (2.) The law of sin. (3.) The law of the mind. (4.) The
   law of the members. They are opposed to each other and agree together
   in the following manner: "The law of God," and "the law of sin," are
   directly opposed; as are likewise "the law of the mind," and "that of
   the members." "The law of God," and "the law of the mind," agree
   together; as do likewise "the law of sin," and "the law of the members.
   From this, it follows that "the law of God," and "the law of the
   members," are indirectly opposed; as are also "the law of sin," and
   "that of the mind." But it will be possible to render these things more
   intelligible by the subjoined diagram: "The law of God" and "the law of
   sin," obtain in this place the principal dignity. "The law of the mind"
   and "that of the members" are placed as hand-maids or assistants to
   them, rendering due service to their superiors; for "the mind delights
   in the law of God," and "the law of the members brings a man into
   captivity to the law of sin." (Rom. vii. 22,23.) These things being
   premised, I proceed to the explanation. The apostle here lays down two
   lords, who are completely contrary to each other, and directly opposed,
   God and sin--the former of these, the lawful lord; the latter, a
   tyrant, and, by violent means, usurping dominion over man, by the fault
   indeed of man himself, and by the just judgment of God. Both of them
   impose a law on man. God imposes his law, that man may obey him in
   those things which it prescribes; and sin Imposes its law, that man may
   obey it in "the lusts thereof," which it proposes by a certain law of
   its own. The former is called "the law of God;" the latter, "the law of
   sin." By the former, God endeavours to lead the man, who is placed
   under the law, to yield obedience to him; by the latter, sin strives
   and attempts, by every kind of violence, to compel the man to obey him.
   By his law, God prescribes those things which are "holy, and just, and
   good;" by its law, sin proposes those things which are useful,
   pleasant, and agreeable to the flesh. Now both of them, God and sin,
   have, in this man who is under the law, something which favours their
   several causes and purposes, and which assents to each of these laws.
   God has the mind, or "the law of the mind;" sin has the flesh, or the.
   law of the flesh, or "of the members." The mind, consenting to the law
   of God, that it "is holy, and just, and good;" the flesh, assenting to
   the law of sin, that it is useful, pleasant and agreeable; "the law of
   the mind," which is the knowledge of the divine law, and an assent to
   it; "the law of the members," which is an inclination and propension
   towards those things which are useful, pleasant, and agreeable to the
   flesh, that is, towards these mundane, earthly and visible objects. In
   the 23rd verse of this chapter, these two laws are said to be,
   antisrateuomenoi "waging war together," like soldier, who are in the
   field of battle, and drawn up in hostile array against each other, that
   the one army may overcome that which is opposed to it, and may gain the
   victory for its lord and general. "The law of the mind" fights for "the
   law of God," and "the law of the members" marches under the banner of
   "the law of sin;" the former, that, after having conquered the flesh
   and the law of the members, it may bring man into subjection to the law
   of God, with this design--that man may serve God; the latter, that,
   after having overcome the law of the mind, it may sentence man to
   bondage, and "bring him into captivity to the law of sin," with this
   design--that man may serve sin. The conflict between these two
   contending parties, is about man, whom God wishes to bring into
   subjection to himself; and sin eagerly indulges the same wish. The
   former of these prescribes his own law to him; the latter also
   prescribes its law; and both of them employ their own military forces,
   that they severally have in the man, each to obtain the victory for
   himself. From these explanations it will now appear what the phrases
   signify; "With the mind to serve the law of God," is, with a mind
   consenting to the law of God, to perform its military services to that
   law, for the purpose of bringing man into subjection to God; "With the
   flesh, to serve the law of sin," is with the flesh assenting to the
   desires of sin, to render its military services to the law of sin, in
   order to bring man into captivity to that law and to subject him to
   sin. The end, therefore, or the intention of the battle is, that man
   may be brought into subjection either to the law of God, or to the law
   of sin; that is, that he may walk either according to the flesh, or
   according to the mind. The act tending to this end, is the waging of
   war, which is indeed actual hostility, and an inimical encounter
   between the parties; but it is also the employment of persuasion
   towards man, without whose assent neither party can obtain this its
   end. The mind, adverse to the flesh, persuades the will of man to do
   that which is holy, and just, and good, and to reject what is merely
   delectable. The flesh, repugnant to the mind, persuades the same human
   will to set aside and disregard that which is holy, and just, and good,
   and to embrace that which is capable of affording present delight and
   usefulness. The effect produced by the mind on the will, is the
   volition of good and the hatred of evil; the effect which the flesh
   produces on the same will, is the volition of evil and the nolition of
   good. This is a change of the will, first to one party, and then to the
   other. But the issue or result declares which of the parties in this
   man has produced the stronger and more powerful effect. But this is the
   result of the conflict, [as it is described in the twenty-third verse,]
   the nonperformance of good, the nonomission of evil, a token of the
   impotence of the mind, which commanded good to be done, and forbade the
   commission of evil, which approved of the performance of good, but
   disapproved of the perpetration of evil; and it is the commission of
   what is evil, the omission of what is good, the captivity of man under
   the law of sin, plainly demonstrating that, in this man, the party of
   sin and of the flesh is the more powerful of the two, the law of the
   mind fruitlessly striving against it. The cause of this result is the
   weakness of the law, which has been debilitated by the flesh, (Rom.
   viii. 3,) and the force and pertinacious power of the flesh in this
   man, the effect of which is, that the man does not walk according to
   the law but according to the flesh, and does not march according to the
   law of the mind but according to that of the members. But if to this
   conflict be added a stronger force of the Spirit of Christ, who does
   not write the letter of the law on tables of stone, but impresses the
   love and fear of God on the fleshly tables of the heart--then are we
   permitted not only to hope for a different result, but it is also given
   us assuredly to obtain a successful issue. This is indicated by the
   apostle in Romans viii. 2: "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
   Jesus hath made me tree from the law of sin and death." For it comes to
   pass, by means of the power of this Spirit, that the man, who had
   previously been "brought into captivity to the law of sin," is
   delivered from it, and "no longer walks after the flesh, but after the
   Spirit;" that is, in his life, he follows the motion, the influence,
   and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, which motion, influence and
   guidance tend indeed to the same end as that to which the law of God,
   and the law of the mind, endeavoured to lead the man, but with an
   energy not equal; as not being able to complete their attempt, on
   account of the hindrance of the law of sin and of the members. This is
   likewise the cause why this man is said to walk not according to the
   law of the mind, but according to the Spirit, [a phrase frequently
   employed by the apostle in Romans 8,] and "to be led of the Spirit, and
   not to be under the law," (Gal. v. 18.) Not indeed because the man who
   lives according to the Spirit, does not live according to the law of
   God; but because the Spirit of Christ, and not the law, is the cause
   why the man regulates his life according to the law of God. For the law
   knows how to command, but cannot afford any assistance--a doctrine
   which St. Augustine frequently inculcates. 5. From these observations,
   it may now be evident, that even from this (25th) verse, nothing can be
   adduced in proof of the contrary opinion; but that the opinion which
   explains the passage as referring to a man under the law, is also
   established by this verse. For this man, as he is under the law, "with
   his mind serves the law of God;" but, as he is carnal, "with his flesh
   he serves the law of sin," and he serves it so as to bring himself into
   captivity to the law of sin--his mind and conscience vainly struggling
   against it. Nor is it of the least service for the establishment of the
   other opinion, that the apostle says, "I myself;" for he had previously
   used the word "I" in many instances in this chapter, even when he said,
   "Sin wrought in me all manner of concupiscence;" (verse 8) "for I
   lived," or I was alive, "without the law once; but, when the
   commandment came, I died;" (9) "I found the commandment to be unto
   death to me;" (10; ) "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived
   me, and by it slew me," (11) and other passages. But the pronoun, autov
   [in our English version, translated "myself,"] which is an adjunct to
   the pronoun "I," indicates that this pronoun "I" must be referred to
   the person about whom he had been previously treating. For it is the
   demonstrative [pronoun] of the nearest antecedent; as though he had
   said, "I am he about whom I have already been discoursing." This is
   likewise evident, because he concludes from the preceding verses, that
   the man whose character he took on him self to personate, (the prudence
   of [him who was under the influence of] the Holy Spirit requiring such
   personation,) "with his mind serves the law of God, but with his flesh
   the law of sin." Let those things be taken into consideration which, in
   his epistle, the apostles writes concerning himself, and let them be
   compared with the particulars of the description here given; and it
   will then clearly appear, that the apostle, in this passage, was by no
   means treating about himself, such as he was at that time. III.
   RECAPITULATION 1. What distinctly belongs to the man described in this
   chapter, both as he is under the law, and as he is carnal and the slave
   of sin. 2. The inconsistent state of a man who is under the law. 3. The
   manner in which God leads a sinner to penitence, faith in Christ, and
   the obedience of faith. 4. This representation of it confirmed by St.
   Augustine and Musculus--How far this is the work of the regenerating
   Spirit. 5. To this it is objected that a three-fold state of man is
   thus laid down--A reply to this objection. 1. But now, if not
   disagreeable, let all these things be collected together, and in a
   compendious form be exhibited before the eyes, that they may at one
   glance be examined, and a judgment formed concerning them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE MAN ABOUT WHOM THE APOSTLE IS HERE TREATING, DO FAR AS HE IS: UNDER THE
  LAW.

   He allows not, or approves not of, that which he does; He wills indeed
   that which is good; He hates evil; He consents to the law of God that
   it is good; He has it [in him] to will that which is good; It is no
   longer himself that does evil; He truly delights in the law of God
   after the inward man; According to the law of his mind he wages war
   with the law of his members; This causes him to exclaim, Who shall
   deliver me With his mind, therefore, he serves the law of God; CARNAL
   AND THE SLAVE OF SIN. He does that which he allows not, or of which he
   disapproves. But he does not what is good. And yet he does that which
   is evil. Yet he does that which he would not. But he finds evil present
   with him, and he finds not [how] to perform what is good. But the evil
   is done by sin which dwelleth in him.. But he has another law in his
   members. But the law of his members wages war against the law of his
   mind, so as to bring the man into captivity to the law of sin. From
   this misery, and the body of this death? But with his flesh he serves
   the law of sin. The things which are thus opposed to each other must
   not be disjoined, while they are attributed to the man about whom the
   apostle here treats; but they ought both to be united together, and
   jointly attributed to him. For this is required by the analogy of the
   subject itself that is under the law and the dominion of sin--as he is
   under the law, the particulars enumerated in the first column belong to
   him--as he is under the dominion of sin, those in the second column are
   his attributes. But the mode by which the apostle joins these things
   with each other, and attributes them to this man in a conjoint form, is
   that of a disjunctive enunciation. This is indicated by the frequent
   use of the particle, de which is the post- positive of men itself, or
   what immediately follows it. The one without the other does not render
   a sentence complete; but men "indeed, truly," denotes that something
   will follow, and de "but, yet, then," that something has preceded, with
   which the former or the latter part of the sentence ought to be joined.
   This remark must be diligently observed in the consideration of Romans
   7, as must likewise the following--that both parts are not of the same
   order and dignity, but that the latter clause [in which de is used as
   the connecting word] is the chief and principal one, for whose
   explanation, illustration and amplification, the former clause [in
   which men occurs] is employed; as a proposition, or the first part of a
   sentence, is for its rendition or concluding part. Those latter
   particulars, therefore, [which are here inserted in the second column,]
   belong to the more ample explanation and proof of the proper cause, on
   account of which a man who is under the law cannot resist sin, but sin
   has the dominion over him. But the former particulars [enumerated in
   the first column] belong or conduce to the excusing of the law, lest
   the blame of this crime could be justly ascribed to it. From all which
   things united together the conclusion may be drawn that the man about
   whom the apostle is treating, must, on account of the predominant flesh
   and of sin which dwells in his flesh, be still reckoned in the number
   of carnal persons. But, because he is under the law, and so under it
   that it has effected in him whatever is usually effected by the law in
   transferring and conducting man as a sinner to the grace of Christ, he
   must, [almost at any hour], speedily be taken out from the number of
   carnal persons, and placed in a state of grace; in which higher state,
   he will no longer be put to the necessity of fighting, under the
   auspices and guidance of the law, against the vigourous and lively
   "motions of sins;" but, by the power of grace and under the guidance
   and influence of the Holy Spirit, he will contend against his crucified
   and mortified inclinations, till he obtain over them, when they are
   nearly dead and buried, a complete victory. 2. The man who will reflect
   upon this inconsistent state, if I may so denominate it, will easily
   perceive, that the things which the apostle has here written, must be
   referred to this state. For, diligently, and as if purposely, he
   exercises caution over himself not to employ the word "Spirit" in any
   passage in his description of this state; yet this word, the use of
   which he here so carefully avoids, is that which he employs in almost
   every verse of the next chapter, (Rom. 8) and which is so familiar to
   this apostle in all his epistles, as to seem to be perpetually before
   his eyes and his mind, especially when he is treating about the
   regenerate and their duty to God and their neighbour, and also when he
   treats upon the contest which the pious still have with the flesh and
   the remains of sin. The thoughtful consideration of this single matter
   is able and ought to cause doubts in the minds of those who interpret
   this portion of holy writ as applicable to regenerate persons and those
   who are placed under grace, if they only be animated with a sincere
   desire of ascertaining the truth, and love the truth for its own sake,
   even when it does not agree with their own preconceived opinions. 3. I
   am also desirous that all men seriously consider how God leads us to
   faith, in his Son, and to the obedience of faith, and what means he
   uses to convert a sinner. We know that God employs his holy word to
   produce this effect; we know that this word consists of two essential
   and integral parts, the law and the gospel; we know, also, that the law
   must first be preached to a sinner, that he may understand and approve
   it, that he may explore and examine his life by it when it is known and
   approved, that, when such examination is completed, he may acknowledge
   himself to be a sinner, and by his demerits, deserving of damnation,
   that he may mourn and be sorrowful on account of sin, and may detest
   it, that he may understand himself to be in urgent need of a deliverer,
   and that he may be instigated and compelled to seek him. To a man who
   is thus prepared by the law, the grace of the gospel must be announced,
   which, being manifested to the mind by the Holy Spirit, and by the same
   Spirit sealed on the heart, produces faith within us, by which we are
   united to Christ; that, holding communion with him, we may obtain
   remission of sins in his name, and may draw from him the vivifying
   power of his Spirit. By this quickening power, the flesh is mortified
   with its affections and lusts, and we are regenerated to a new life, in
   which we not only will or resolve to bring forth the fruits of
   gratitude to God, but we are likewise capable to bring them forth, and
   actually do so by this same Spirit, "who worketh in us both to will and
   to do." Let any man now describe to me out of the Scriptures the proper
   effects which flow from the preaching of the law, in the minds of those
   whom God has decreed to convert to a better life; and I will instantly
   present to him a man, such as he who is described to us by the apostle,
   under his own person, in this chapter, (Rom. 7.) "But are these effects
   through the preaching of the law produced in this man, without the
   grace of Christ, and the operation of the Holy Spirit?" What man can
   have the audacity to affirm this, unless he be one of the prime
   defenders of Pelagian doctrine, He who, by the preaching of the law,
   (the Holy Spirit blessing such preaching, and co-operating with it,) is
   compelled to flee to the grace of Christ, is not instantly, or at once,
   under grace, or under the influence, guidance and government of the
   Spirit. For, "the law is our schoolmaster [to bring us] unto Christ."
   (Gal. iii. 24.) "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to
   every one that believeth." (Rom. x. 4.) "By the law is the knowledge of
   sin." (iii, 20.) 4. St. Augustine, when treating upon the use of the
   law, says, in his Reply to the two epistles of the Pelagians to
   Boniface, "The law, as a schoolmaster, leads and conducts a man to this
   grace of God, by terrifying him concerning his transgressions of the
   law, that something may be conferred on him which it was not able to
   bestow." And in a subsequent passage, "We do not, therefore, make void
   the law through faith, but we establish the law,' which, by terrifying
   men, leads them to faith. Therefore, because the law worketh wrath,'
   that grace may bestow, on the man who is thus terrified and turned to
   fulfill the righteousness of the law, the mercy of God through Jesus
   Christ our Lord, who is the wisdom of God, and concerning whom it is
   written, He beareth in his tongue law and mercy. Law, by which he may
   terrify--Mercy, by which he may afford relief; law by a servant--mercy,
   by himself" &c., &c. (Lib. 4, cap. 5.) Let St. Augustine also be
   consulted, in his treatise on corruption and grace, in the first
   chapter of which he speaks thus appropriately to the matter under
   discussion: "The Lord himself has not only shown us from what evil we
   may turn aside, and what good we may perform, which the letter of the
   law alone is able to shew; but he also assists us, that we may turn
   aside from evil and may do good, which no one can do without the Spirit
   of grace. If this grace be wanting, the law is present for this
   purpose--to bring us in guilty and to kill us, on which account, the
   apostle says, The letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life. (2 Cor.
   iii. 6.) He, therefore, who lawfully uses the law, learns in it evil
   and good; and, not confiding in his own strength, he flees to grace, by
   the aid of which he ceases from evil and does good. But what man thus
   flees to grace, except when his steps are directed by the Lord, and he
   delighteth in his way? (Psalm xxxvii. 23.) And by this also, the act of
   desiring the assistance of grace is the beginning of grace." Consult
   also the fifth chapter of the same treatise, in which the following
   passage occurs: "You are not willing to have your faults pointed out.
   You are unwilling that they should be smitten, and that you should feel
   useful grief, which may induce you to seek a physician. You are not
   desirous to have yourself shown to yourself, that when you perceive
   your own [mental] deformity you may be very importunate for a
   reformation of yourself, and may supplicate God not to suffer you to
   remain in this foul and deformed condition." And in the sixth chapter,
   he says: "Therefore, let the damnable origin be reprehended, that a
   willingness for regeneration may arise out of the sorrow consequent on
   such reprehension; yet, if he who is thus chastised be a son of the
   promise, that, when the noise of the correction sounds outwardly and
   the strokes of the whip are heard, God may work inwardly in him also to
   will by his secret inspiration." Musculus says, in his Common Places,
   in the chapter On Laws, (fol. 124,) "The law causes me not only to
   understand, but likewise with anguish and remorse of conscience to feel
   and experience that sin is in me. The proper effect of the law is, that
   it convicts us of being inexcusably guilty of sin, subjects us to the
   curse, and condemns us, (Gal. 3,) and when we are deeply affected with
   the smart of sin and condemnation, it renders us, anxious and earnest
   in our desires for the grace of God. Hence, arises that of the apostle,
   which is the subject of his investigation in Romans 7, and at the close
   of which he exclaims, O wretched man that l am! who shall deliver me
   from the body of this death?
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE GRACE OF GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRIST."

   "But is this, therefore, the work of the regenerating Spirit?" With
   regard to the END, I confess that it is; but with regard to the EFFECT
   itself, I dare not make any assertion. For mortification and
   vivification, which, as integral parts, contain the whole of
   regeneration, are completed in us by our participation of the death and
   resurrection of Christ. (Rom. 6.) In Romans viii. 15, the apostle
   distinguishes between "the Spirit of bondage to fear," and "the Spirit
   of adoption." Many persons denominate the former of these, "a legal
   Spirit," and the latter "the Spirit of the gospel of Christ." I,
   therefore, make the service of the Spirit of bondage to precede that of
   the Spirit of adoption, though both of them tend to one design. Whence,
   it appears that this my explanation of the seventh chapter is not
   contrary to the true doctrine concerning the law and its use, and the
   necessity of the grace of Christ; but that the doctors of the church,
   who give a different interpretation of it, have not reflected on this
   matter when they entered on an explanation of the chapter. For, since
   they teach, from the Scriptures, the very same thing as I suppose the
   apostle here to make the subject of his investigation, we do not differ
   from each other in our opinion of doctrines, but only in this single
   circumstance--that they do not think this passage relates to that head
   of doctrine, which, I affirm, is professedly treated in it: Yet, in
   this opinion, I do not stand alone, but I have many others with me, as
   we shall afterwards perceive. 5. Some one may here object, "that by
   this, my explanation, a three-fold state of man is laid down, when the
   Scriptures acknowledge but a two-fold state; and that three kinds of
   men are introduced, when no more than two are known to the
   Scriptures--that is, the state of regeneration and that which precedes
   regeneration, believers and unbelievers, regenerate and unregenerate
   men," &c. To this I reply, (1.) that in my explanation three consistent
   states of men are not laid down, neither are there three distinct and
   perfectly opposite kinds of men; but that it teaches how much the law
   has the power of effecting in a man, and how the same individual is
   compelled by the law to flee to the grace of Christ. (2.) I say that
   the state of the man described in this chapter is not a consistent one,
   but is rather a grade or step from the one to the other--from a state
   of impiety and infidelity to a state of regeneration and grace--from
   the old state in Adam to the new state in Christ. According to this
   grade or step, the man is denominated by some persons renascent, [or in
   the article of being born again]. And, truly, the distance of the one
   of these states from the other is far too great, for a man to be able
   to pass from one to the other without some intermediate steps. (3.) I
   deny that there is any absurdity in laying down a three-fold state of
   man, regard being had to the different times; that is, a state before
   or without the law, one under the law, and another under grace. For the
   apostolical Scriptures make mention of such a three-fold state in the
   two chapters now under consideration, and in Romans 6 and 7, and
   Galatians 4 and 5. St. Augustine says, in his book, The Exposition of
   certain Propositions in the Epistle to the Romans, (Cap. 3) "Therefore
   we distinguish the four conditions of man, into that BEFORE the law,
   UNDER the law, under grace, and in peace. In the state before the law,
   we follow the lusts of the flesh; under the law, we are drawn along
   with them; under grace, we neither follow those lusts, nor are drawn by
   them; in peace, there is no lusting of the flesh. Before the law,
   therefore, we do not fight; under the law, we fight," &c., &c. Consult
   also Bucer, in his commentary on this passage. For he lays down a
   three-fold man, (1.) a profane man who does not yet believe in God,
   (2.) a holy man who loves God, but who is weak to prevail against sin,
   and (3.) lastly, a man furnished with a stronger portion of the Spirit
   of Christ, so that he is able, not only to repress and condemn the
   flesh, but likewise to live, in reality, the life of God, with
   pleasure, and with confirmed and perpetual diligence. Let, therefore,
   the whole of his commentary on this passage be perused, and it will
   appear that, with respect to the substance of the matter, the
   difference is very slight between his explanation of it, and that which
   I have now given. This I shall also clearly prove in the following
   chapter, by passages cited from the same commentary. But let us see
   whether the Scriptures themselves do not, in many places, propose three
   kinds of men, and give us a description of a three-fold state. In Rev.
   iii. 15,16, some persons are described, as being neither hot nor cold,
   but lukewarm. Christ says that he came not to call to repentance "the
   righteous," that is, those who esteemed themselves as such, but
   "sinners," that is, those who owned themselves, or who, on his
   preaching, would own themselves to be of that description. (Matt. ix.
   13.) Christ calls to himself those who are fatigued, weary,
   heavy-laden, and oppressed with the burden of their sins, (Matt. xi.
   28,)but drives away from him those who are proud and puffed up with
   arrogance on account of their own righteousness. (Luke xviii. 9.)
   "Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now
   ye say, We see; therefore, your sin remaineth." (John ix. 41.) In the
   parable of the Pharisee and the Publican, is intimated to us a
   three-fold description of men--one kind in the Pharisee, two kinds in
   the Publican, one before his justification, the other after it. But who
   can enumerate all the similar instances, Indeed, such enumeration is
   unnecessary. It is rather a matter of surprise, that, as the books of
   our divines are filled with such distinctions, they did not occur to
   their minds when meditating on this passage, in which this matter [of
   the different conditions or states of man] is professedly treated. IV.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SEVENTH AND THE EIGHTH CHAPTERS

   The truth of the interpretation of the seventh chapter, as it has been
   so far deduced by the author, is proved from some of the early verses
   of the eighth chapter when compared with those which precede them. 2.
   The first verse. 3. The second verse, and an explanation of the phrases
   used in it. 4. The third verse. A comparison of the former part of it
   with Romans vii. 5 and 14, and of the latter part of it with the sixth
   verse of the same chapter. 5. The fourth verse, and a comparison of it
   with Romans vii. 4. A paraphrastical recapitulation of those things
   which are taught in the first four verses of the eighth chapter, and
   their connection with the preceding chapter. 1. But I may now be
   permitted to confirm this my interpretation from some of the first of
   the verses of the next chapter, provided they be diligently compared
   with those in the seventh chapter. 2. For, in the first verse, a
   conclusion is inferred from verses of the preceding chapter, which is
   agreeable and accommodated to the principal design proposed by the
   apostle through the whole of this epistle. The words are these: "There
   is, therefore, now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who
   walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." That this verse
   contains a conclusion, is evident from the illative particle
   "therefore," and indeed a conclusion not deduced from the former part
   of the last verse in the seventh chapter, but from the entire
   investigation, which consists of these two parts: "Men do not obtain
   righteousness, and power to conquer sin and to live in a holy manner,
   by means either of the law of nature or that of Moses; but, through the
   faith of the gospel of Jesus Christ, those very blessings are
   gratuitously bestowed on them who work not, but believe on Christ." But
   these two things, JUSTIFICATION which consists of remission of sins,
   and The Spirit of Holiness by which believers are enabled to overcome
   sin and to live in a holy manner, are parts of the gracious covenant
   into which God has entered with us in Christ: "I will put my laws into
   their minds, and write them in their hearts, &c.; for I will be
   merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities
   will I remember no more." (Heb. viii. 10,12.) Therefore, when the
   apostle had proceeded so far with the proof of this thesis, (having in
   the first five chapters treated on righteousness and remission of sins,
   and in the sixth and seventh chapters, on the power to conquer sin and
   live in a holy manner,) he now infers this conclusion: "There is,
   therefore, now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who
   walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." The emphasis of the
   conclusion lies in these words: "Who are in Christ Jesus, who walk, not
   after the flesh, but after the Spirit," to the exclusion of those who
   are under the law, and for whom is prepared certain condemnation, as
   being persons out of Christ, and subjected to the dominion of sin--as
   if the apostle had said, "From all these things, therefore, it is
   apparent that condemnation impends over all those who are under the
   law, because they neither perform the law, nor are able to perform it;
   but that freedom from condemnation granted only to those who are in
   Christ, and who walk according to the Spirit." But that the emphasis
   lies in these words: "Those who are in Christ Jesus," to the exclusion
   of the others, is apparent, (1.) From the fact, that this very part is
   repeated. though in other words, which are these, "who walk after the
   Spirit." (2.) Because the exclusion of other persons is openly placed
   in the repetition, "who walk not after the flesh." (3.) From the
   subject, itself, of the apostle's investigation, which is this: "The
   gospel and not the law, is the power of God to salvation to those who
   believe and do not work." Wherefore, in order that the conclusion may
   correspond with the proposition, it ought to be read and understood
   with the opposition here produced. (4.) From other conclusions in this
   epistle, inferred in similar cases--"therefore, we conclude that a man
   is justified by faith without the deeds of the law," (Rom. iii. 28)
   also, in the twenty-seventh verse of the same chapter, "Where is
   boasting then, It is excluded. By what law? By that of works? No; but
   by the law of faith." "But it was written for us also, to whom it shall
   be imputed," that is, to those who "believe on him that raised up Jesus
   our Lord from the dead." (iv, 24) And it appears that these things are
   spoken in opposition, to the complete exclusion of another opposite,
   thus: "But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that
   justifieth the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness." (iv,
   5.) "For the promise was not made to Abraham through the law, but
   through the righteousness of faith." (13.) "Ye are become dead to the
   law, that ye should be married to Christ." (vii, 4.) As, likewise, in
   the passage at present under consideration, "There is, therefore, now
   no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
   flesh, but after the Spirit," From these remarks, it is apparent that
   the words after the flesh, but after the Spirit," do not belong to the
   description either of the subject or of the attribute of the preceding
   conclusion, as if they were described who are in Christ, but that they
   are the consequent or the antecedent itself of the same conclusion,
   though enunciated in a form somewhat different. This is likewise
   evident from the very words; for the pronoun, toiv "those," which is
   properly subservient to this matter, is not used in this clause. 3. The
   same thing is taught in the second verse, in which these two things are
   united, "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus," that have
   reference to these two things in the preceding verse, "Those in Christ
   Jesus," and walking after the Spirit." But let us inspect the verse
   itself, which reads thus: "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
   Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Before we
   compare this verse with that which preceded it, we must give a
   preliminary explanation of the phrases used in it. "The law of the
   Spirit" is, therefore, called the right, the power, and the force or
   virtue of the Holy Spirit; for the apostle continues in the mode of
   speaking which he had previously adopted in the seventh chapter, where
   he attributes a law to sin, to the mind and to the members, that is,
   the power and force of commanding and impelling. The Spirit is here
   called that "of life," that is, "the vivifying Spirit" by a phrase
   familiar to the Hebrews, who employ the genitive cases of substantives
   instead of adjectives; as "the city of God," "the man of God," "the God
   of justice," &c. But the Spirit is thus designated in opposition or
   distinction to the law of the letter, or the letter of the law, which
   is weak for the work of vivification, and knows nothing more than to
   kill--according to this passage, "The letter killeth, but the Spirit
   giveth life," (2 Cor. iii. 6) and according to this: "for if there had
   been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness
   should have been by the law." (Gal. iii. 21.) But this "law of the
   Spirit of life" is said to be "in Christ Jesus," not because it is only
   in the person of Christ Jesus, but because it can be obtained in Jesus
   Christ alone; according to this declaration: "Believers receive the
   Spirit, not by the works of the law, but by the hearing of faith."
   (Gal. iii. 2,5.) This phrase, "in Christ," is very often used in the
   same manner in the apostolical writings. But that the phrase is to be
   received in this sense also in the present passage, is manifest, (1.)
   From the scope or design of the apostle, which is to teach, that not
   through the law, but through the grace of Christ, believers obtain
   righteousness and the Holy Spirit, by whose power they may be enabled
   to have dominion over sin, and to yield their members instruments of
   righteousness unto God. (2.) From comparing this passage with the first
   verse. For, "to those who are in Christ Jesus," is attributed freedom
   from condemnation, because "the vivifying Spirit in Christ Jesus has
   made them free from the law of sin and death." (3.) Because this
   "vivifying Spirit" does not "deliver from the law of sin and death,"
   except as it is communicated "to those who are in Christ Jesus." But to
   this "Spirit of life" is attributed that "it makes those who are in
   Christ Jesus free from the law of sin and death;" that is, from the
   power and tyranny of sin reigning, and killing by means of the law.
   This deliverance or emancipation is opposed to "the captivity unto the
   law of sin," of which mention is made in Romans vii. 23, and to "the
   body of death" which is mentioned in verse the twenty-fourth. From this
   "law of sin," and from this "body of death," a man who is under the law
   could be delivered neither through the law of Moses, nor through "the
   law of the mind" which "consents to the law of God." But from this is
   also most admirably proved the conclusion deduced in the first verse
   from those which preceded it [in the seventh chapter]. For "deliverance
   from the law of sin and death" is opposed to "condemnation;" and,
   therefore, when the former of those is laid down, the latter is
   removed. This deliverance is attributed "to those who are in Christ
   Jesus," and "who walk according to the Spirit," from which it follows,
   that they are made free from condemnation. But the reason why this
   deliverance is attributed to that subject, arises from the cause of
   deliverance, that is, the vivifying Spirit, which Spirit, as it exists
   in Christ and is to be obtained in him, is likewise in "those who are
   in Christ Jesus." Wherefore, it is not at all wonderful, that this
   Spirit exercises his own proper force and efficacy in those persons in
   whom he dwells; and since this force or virtue is so peculiar to him,
   that he has it not in common with the law of Moses, it follows from
   this, that those only "who are in Christ Jesus" and are partakers of
   his Spirit, or that those who, being in Christ Jesus, are partakers of
   his Spirit, are delivered from condemnation, while those who are under
   the law remain under condemnation, as being those who are overcome by
   "the law of the members," and have been "brought into captivity under
   the law of sin," no successful resistance being offered by "the law of
   the mind," which "consents to the law of God." We have already said
   that, from a comparison of this verse with the twenty-third verse of
   the preceding chapter, an unanswerable argument is deducible in
   proof--that, in the two verses now specified, the apostle is not
   treating about the same man; but that, in the twenty-third verse of the
   seventh chapter, he treats about a man who is under the law, and in
   this second verse, about one who is under grace; because the man
   described in the former of these verses is "brought into captivity
   under the law of sin and death," and this by "the law of the members,"
   "the law of the mind" offering fruitless resistance; but the man who is
   mentioned in the second verse, by the power of the life-giving Spirit,
   whom he has obtained in Christ Jesus, is "made free from the same law
   of sin and death." 4. Let us consider the third verse, in which the
   same thing may appear still more plainly to us; for in it the cause is
   explained why men who are under the law, cannot be made free from the
   dominion and condemnation of sin; but it is shown that this is obtained
   for them and effected by Christ. But the cause is this, because
   deliverance from the law of sin and death, or freedom from
   condemnation, could not be obtained except by the condemnation of sin,
   that is, except sin had been previously despoiled of the [assumed]
   right which it possessed, and of its power which it exercised over men
   who were subject to it. But it possessed the right and power of
   exercising dominion and of killing. But sin could not be despoiled of
   its right, and deprived of its power, by the law; for the law was
   rendered "weak, through the flesh," for the performance of such an
   arduous service. When God saw this state of things, and was unwilling
   the unhappy race of men should be perpetually detained under the
   tyranny and condemnation of sin, "he sent his own Son in the likeness
   of sinful flesh, and indeed for sin," that is, for destroying it, and
   he condemned sin in the flesh of his Son, who bore sin in his own body
   [on the tree] and took away from it that authority over us which it
   possessed, and weakened its powers. From these remarks it appears that
   this passage, which has hitherto been accounted one of great
   difficulty, is plain and perspicuous, provided each part of it be
   arranged aright, in the following manner: "For God, having sent his own
   Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the
   flesh; which was a thing impossible to the law, because it was weakened
   through the flesh." For "that which the law could not do" is, "the
   condemnation of sin in the flesh?' Hence it is manifest, that this
   verse briefly explains the whole cause why sin reigns unto death over
   men who are under the law, and why it possesses neither the authority
   nor the power of reigning over "those who are in Christ Jesus" and
   under grace. This may be briefly shown from a comparison of those
   things which had been previously said, with this verse. For these
   words, "what was impossible to the law because it was weakened by the
   flesh," agree with the following declaration, contained in the fifth
   verse of the preceding chapter: "When we were in the flesh, the motions
   of sing, which are by the law, did work in our members;" and with these
   words in the fourteenth verse, "We know that the law is spiritual, but
   I am carnal;" they also agree with the eighteenth verse, "I know that
   in me, [that is, in my flesh,] dwelleth no good thing." But these
   words, "God, in the flesh of his Son, condemned sin," agree with what
   is said in the sixth verse, of the preceding chapter: "But now we are
   delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held;" that is,
   sin being condemned which held us bound and in subjection to it. But,
   in this passage, the cause is more fully explained, that in the flesh
   of Christ such condemnation was effected. 5. From these observations is
   deduced the meaning of the fourth verse, plainly agreeing with those
   which preceded. It is this, after it had come to pass, that sin was
   condemned in the flesh of the Son of God, the right or authority of the
   law was completed and consummated in those who are in Christ Jesus, and
   who walk after the Spirit; so that they are no longer under the
   guidance and government of the law, but under the guidance of Him who
   has delivered us from sin, and who has claimed us for his own people.
   This is plainly expressed by the apostle, in the fourth verse of the
   preceding chapter, in these words: "Ye also are become dead to the law
   in the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to
   Him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto
   God." For these phrases agree with each other: "Ye are become dead to
   the law," and, "the right or authority of the law is fulfilled or
   completed in you." And, "in the body of Christ ye are become dead to
   the law," is the same as, "sin was condemned in the flesh of Christ,
   that the right or authority of the law might be fulfilled in us." But
   when the right of the law is completed and consummated by the
   condemnation of sin which was effected in the flesh of Christ, we
   belong or are married to another, that is, the right is transferred
   from the law to Christ, that we may be no longer under the law, but
   under Christ, and may live under grace and the guidance of his Spirit.
   For these words, "that the right or authority of the law might or may
   be fulfilled in us," must not be understood as if, when sin had been
   condemned in the flesh of Christ, the right or authority of the law was
   still to be completed; but that after the condemnation of sin in the
   flesh of Christ, the right of the law was actually fulfilled. Several
   forms of speech, similar to this, are used in this manner in the
   Scriptures. For instance: "All this was done, that it might be
   fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet: (Matt. i. 22)
   "He came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be
   fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a
   Nazarene." (ii, 23.) "He came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the
   sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim, that it might be
   fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, The land of
   Zabulon, and the land of Nepthalim, &c., light is sprung up to them who
   sat in the region and shadow of death." (iv, 13-16.) "He cast out the
   spirits With His word, and healed all that were sick, that it might be
   fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took
   our infirmities," &c. (viii, 16,17.) See also Matt. xii. 17; xiii, 35;
   xxvi, 56. In all these examples, the phrase, "that it might be
   fulfilled," evidently means that the prediction was actually fulfilled
   by those acts which are mentioned in the several passages. This is also
   signified by a phrase different from the preceding, in Matt. xxvii. 9,
   "Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet." It is
   lawful also to change the mode of speech in this verse, (Rom. viii, 4,)
   into another exactly of the same import: "Then was fulfilled the right
   or authority of the law in us." In addition to these, consult Matt.
   xxvii. 35; Luke xxi. 22; John xiii. 18; xvii, 12; xviii, 9; and
   innumerable other passages. From this explication it is apparent, that
   this portion of holy writ, (Rom. viii. 1-4,) is plain and perspicuous,
   though, without this interpretation, it is encompassed with much
   obscurity, as almost all interpreters have confessed, while they have
   laboured hard to explain it. We will now, by permission, compress all
   these remarks into a small compass, and briefly recapitulate them; what
   I have advanced will then become far more evident. Let us do this in
   the following manner: "Since, therefore, we have already seen, that men
   under the law are held captive under the dominion and tyranny of sin,
   we may easily conclude from this, that those only who are in Christ
   Jesus, and who walk after the Spirit and not after the flesh, are free
   from all condemnation; because the law, the right, the power, the force
   or virtue of the vivifying Spirit, which is and can be obtained in
   Jesus Christ alone, has liberated persons of this description from the
   law, the power and this force of sin and death, from the empire and
   dominion of sin, and of its condemnation. Christ Jesus could lawfully
   do this by his Spirit, as being the person in whose flesh sin was
   condemned, that it has no longer any right, neither can have any, over
   those who are Christ's; in which flesh, indeed, He was sent by his
   Father, because this very thing was impossible to the law, weakened as
   it was through the flesh. And thus it has come to pass, that the right
   of the law, which it had over us when we were still under the law, is
   completed or fulfilled in persons of this description, who have become
   Christ's people through faith, that they might hereafter live, be
   influenced, and governed by his grace and according to the guidance of
   the Holy Spirit. From these things we may certainly conclude that sin
   cannot have dominion over them, and therefore, that they are able to
   yield their members instruments of righteousness to God, as those who
   have been translated from the death of sin to the life of the Spirit."
   But these topics the apostle pursues as far as the sixteenth verse of
   this eighth chapter, in a manner accommodated to the same scope or
   design as we have hitherto pointed out; and he seems always mindful of
   the exhortation which he had given in Romans vi, 12,13; from the
   conjoint reason in which he descends into the succeeding long
   investigation. These observations, however, may suffice, lest we be too
   operose in demonstrating a matter that is so plain and perspicuous.

SECOND PART
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. THE OPINION WHICH IS TO BE CORROBORATED BY TESTIMONIES

   This opinion, which explains Romans 7, as relating not to a man under
   grace, but to one who is placed under the law, and to one who is not
   yet regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, was never yet condemned in the
   church of Christ, as heretical, but has always had some defenders among
   the doctors of the church. We will now approach to the second part of
   our proposition, which we have judged it right to treat for the purpose
   of making it evident to all men, that the opinion which I defend is not
   of recent growth, neither has it been fabricated by my brain, nor
   borrowed from some heretic, but that it is very ancient, and approved
   by a great part of the doctors of the primitive church, and that,
   besides, it has never been so far rejected, by those who have given a
   different interpretation to the passage, as to induce them to judge it
   worthy of being branded with the black mark of heresy.
     __________________________________________________________________

  II. THE MOST ANCIENT AND MOST RESPECTABLE OF THE CHRISTIAN FATHERS APPROVE OF
  THE INTERPRETATION WHICH WE GIVE TO THIS CHAPTER

   Irenaeus. 2. Tertullian. 3. Origen. 4. Cyprian. 5. Chrysostom. 6. Basil
   the Great. 7. Theodouret. 8. Cyril. 9. Macarius the Egyptian. 10.
   Damascenus. 11. Theophylact. 12. Ambrose. 13. Jerome. 1. IRENAEUS
   Irenaeus thus cites part of this chapter in lib. 3, cap. xx, "On this
   account, therefore, he, who through the virgin is Emmanuel, God with
   us, the Lord himself, is the sign of our salvation; because he was the
   Lord who saved them, as through themselves, they possessed not the
   means of being saved. On account of this also, when St. Paul is shewing
   the weakness of man, he says, I know that in me, (that is, in my
   flesh,) dwelleth no good thing, thus intimating that the blessing of
   salvation is not from us, but from God. And again, O wretched man that
   l am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? He then infers
   a deliverer, the grace of Jesus Christ our Lord." In this quotation,
   [when referring to St. Paul's declaration,] he does not say, "a
   regenerate Man," "a believer," or Christian," but simply "a man," under
   which appellation, neither the Scriptures nor the fathers are
   accustomed to speak of one who is a Christian, a believer, and a
   regenerate man. 2. TERTULLIAN For though he denied that in His flesh
   dwelt any good thing, yet it was according to the law of the letter in
   which he was; but according to the law of the Spirit, with which he
   connects us, he delivers from the weakness of the flesh. He says, "For
   the law of the Spirit of life hath manumitted thee from the law of sin
   and death." For though he seems to dispute on the part of Judaism, yet
   he directs to us the integrity and plenitude of instructions, on
   account of whom, as labouring "in the law through the flesh, God sent
   his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin
   in the flesh." (On Chastity, cap. 17.) In this sentence, Tertullian
   openly affirms, that the passage must be explained concerning "a man
   who is under the law of the letter." Nor is it a very great objection
   if any one assert, that this book was written by him while he was in a
   heresy; for on this point he was not heretical, and the opinion, it is
   apparent, had then obtained, that this chapter was to be understood in
   this manner. 3. ORIGEN But with respect to what he says, "but I am
   carnal, sold under sin," on this occasion, as a teacher of the church,
   he takes upon himself the personation of the weak, on which account he
   has also said in another passage, "to the weak became I also as weak."
   Therefore, in this passage St. Paul is made "a carnal man and sold
   under sin," to those who are the weak, (that is, to the carnal,) and
   who are sold-under sin, and he speaks those things which it is their
   practice to utter under the pretext either of excuse or of accusation.
   Speaking, therefore, as in their person, he says, "but I am carnal,
   sold under sin," that is, living according to the flesh, and reduced,
   [as a servant] by purchase, to the power of sin, lust and
   concupiscence; "for that which I do, I allow not," &c. And he (that is,
   Paul the carnal man) here says, "now then it is no more I that do it,
   but sin that dwelleth in me." But in other passages Paul the spiritual
   man says, "I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the
   grace of God which was with me." Therefore, as he thus ascribes his
   labours, not to himself, but to the grace of God which worked in him;
   so does that carnal man attribute the evil works, not to himself, but
   to sin that dwelleth and worketh in him. On this account he says, "now
   then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me; for in
   me, (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing." For Christ does
   not yet dwell in him, neither in his body yet the temple of the Holy
   Spirit. Nevertheless, this man whose character is personated is not in
   every respect averse from good things, but in purpose and in will he
   begins to seek after good things. But he cannot yet obtain such things
   in reality and in works. For there is a certain infirmity of this kind
   in those who receive the beginnings of conversion, that when they truly
   will instantly to do every thing that is good, the effect does not
   immediately follow the will. (On Romans 7.) 4. CYPRIAN When treating
   upon the contest between the flesh and the Spirit, in his sixth
   Discourse On the Lord's Prayer, as well as in his pamphlet On the
   Celibacy of the Clergy, Cyprian does not cite Romans 7, but he quotes
   Gal. v. 17, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
   against the flesh," &c. But that he understood Romans 7, to relate not
   only to the indwelling of sin, but also to its dominion, is evident
   from his Prologue concerning the Cardinal Works of Christ, in which,
   among other remarks, the following occurs - - "If I do not know who it
   is that inscribed this law in my members that it may, with such violent
   domination, oppress the Spirit, and that the better and more worthy
   nature may succumb to the worse, I must patiently endure it if I do not
   understand the Almighty Operator of the universe." He adds, in a
   subsequent passage of the same prologue: It is difficult to understand
   wherefore this law of sin, in this and in similar individuals,
   oppresses the law of righteousness, and wherefore weak and enervated
   reason so miserably falls, when it is able to stand; especially when
   this defect depends on the sentence of damnation, and the ancient
   transgression has obtained this inevitable punishment." 5. CHRYSOSTOM
   When treating professedly on this portion of holy writ and explaining
   it, in his comment on Romans 7, Chrysostom, after confirming what he
   had advanced in the preceding verses, expresses himself in the
   following manner: Therefore, Paul subjoined this assertion, "but I am
   carnal, sold under sin." Thus describing a man who lives under the law
   and before it. Therefore, sin itself is adverse to the law of nature.
   For this is what he says, "Warring against the law of my mind." It also
   imposes on the law of nature a universal contest and warfare, when it
   afterwards draws up in battle array the forces of sin. For the Mosaic
   law was lastly added beyond what was necessary. But, though the former
   law teaches indeed those things which ought to be done, and though the
   latter unites in extolling them; yet neither the one nor the other has
   performed any execution in this battle against sin. So great is the
   tyranny of sin, so wonderfully prevailing and overcoming! This is
   likewise intimated by St. Paul, when, after announcing the conflict of
   opposing and predominant sin, he says: "But I see another law in my
   members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into
   captivity to the law of sin." For he does not simply say, "conquering
   me," but "rendering me a captive to the law of sin." Neither does he
   say, "bringing me into captivity to the impulse of the flesh or of
   carnal nature," but "bringing me into captivity to the law of sin,"
   that is, to the tyranny and power of sin. O wretched man that I am! who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death? Do you here behold how
   amazingly great is the tyranny of wickedness, and how it also overcomes
   the mind which "finds a condelectation, or joint delight, in the law of
   God?" For he says, "It is not that any one says I hate the law of God
   "or am averse to it, and am brought into captivity to sin. For "I find
   a condelectation in the law, I consent to it, and flee to it." Yet it
   was not able to save him when he fled to it. But Christ has saved him,
   when he was fleeing, from it. Here you acknowledge the great excellence
   of grace. And in his Commentary on Romans viii. 9, he says: After sin
   has been destroyed, this difficult warfare is terminated by the grace
   of the Holy Spirit, through which the contest is now become easy to us.
   For this grace first Crowns us [as Victors], and then leads us forth to
   battle honourably attended by numerous auxiliary forces. 6. BASIL THE
   GREAT But we will now adduce what he has said in another passage, when
   delivering the same doctrine, in a manner far more objurgatory: "For we
   know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin. For
   that which I do I allow not," &c. And, prosecuting this speculation in
   more particulars, that it is impossible for him who is held captive by
   sin to serve the Lord, he manifestly points out to us our Deliverer
   from this tyranny, while he says, "O wretched man that I am I who shall
   deliver me from this body of death, I give thanks to God through Jesus
   Christ our Lord," &c. (On Baptism, lib. 1 fol. 409.) It is, therefore
   quite necessary, both from the things already related, and from others
   of a similar kind, (if we have not received the blessing of God in
   vain,) that we be first delivered from the power of the devil, who
   leads the man that is detained in captivity by sin to [the commission
   of] those evils which he would not, and then, having denied all things
   present, and our own self, and having left all kindred feeling for this
   life, that we become the Lord's disciples, as he hath himself said, "If
   any man will come to me, let him deny himself," &c. (Ibid.) This is
   what he who is unwillingly drawn by sin ought to know, that he is
   governed by another sin pre-existing in himself, which while he
   willingly serves, with regard to other things he is led by it even to
   those which he does not will. As it is said in Romans 7, "For we know
   that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin," &c.,
   quoted as far as the seventeenth verse, "but sin that dwelleth in me.
   (Summary of Morals, Sum. 23, cap. I, fol. 477.) The spirit or mind,
   which is the patient bearer of the dominion of the affections or
   inclinations, is not permitted by them to be free to [do] those things
   which it wills, according to the speculation of the apostle already
   related, who said, "but I am carnal, sold under sin. For what I would,
   that do I not; but what I hate, that do 1." (Compendium of Questions
   explained, Quest. 16, fol. 563.) "Now then it is no more I that do it,
   but sin that dwelleth in me," God himself permitting even this to
   befall us for our good, if by any means the mind, through those things
   which it reluctantly suffers, may be brought to understand that which
   has the dominion over it; and if, knowing itself, that it unwillingly
   serves sin, it recover from the snare of the devil, and seek for the
   mercy of God which is prepared to receive those who are legitimately
   penitent. (Ibid.) 7. THEODORET But I am carnal. He introduces a man
   before [he has obtained] grace, who is beset with motions and
   perturbations of mind. For he denominates that man carnal who has not
   yet obtained spiritual grace. (On Romans 7.) For what I would, that do
   l not; but what l hate, that do 1. The law beautifully effects one
   thing, that is, it teaches what is evil, and induces a hatred of it on
   the mind. But these words, "I would not," and "I hate," signify
   weakness, and not necessity. For we do not sin, as being impelled by
   necessity or by some force; but, being enticed by pleasure, we do those
   things which we abhor as wicked and flagitious deeds. (Ibid.) I delight
   in the law of God after the inward man. He has called the mind "the
   inward man" (Ibid.) But I see another law in my members, warring, &c.
   He bestows on sin the appellation of "the law of sin." It exerts its
   operation when the corporeal perturbations of the mind are in lively
   motion; but, on account of that supineness with which the mind has
   invested itself from the beginning, it is unable to restrain them.
   Though the mind has cast away its own liberty, yet it has patience
   enough to serve them. But though the mind thus serves them, yet it
   hates servitude; and commends him who brings an accusation against
   servitude. After the apostle had discoursed on all these topics, that
   he might show what sort of people we were before grace, and our
   condition after grace, and having taken on himself the personation of
   those who, before grace, had been besieged and encompassed by sin;
   therefore, as though he was completely surrounded by a mass of enemies,
   and led away into captivity and compelled to become a slave, and seeing
   no aid from any other quarter, he grievously groans and laments; he
   shows that help could not be afforded by the law, and he cries out, "O
   wretched man that I am!" (Ibid.) There is therefore now no
   condemnation, &c. For the perturbations of our mind do not overcome us
   who are now unwilling, because we have accepted the grace of the divine
   Spirit. (On Romans 8.) For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
   Jesus, &c. As he called sin "the law of sin," so does he call the
   vivifying Spirit "the law of the Spirit." he says, that the grace of
   this Spirit, through faith in Jesus Christ, has endowed thee with a
   two-fold liberty; for it has not only broken the power of sin, but it
   has also destroyed the tyranny of death. (Ibid.) 8. CYRIL For what the
   law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, &c. Therefore,
   when the only Begotten became man for us, the law of sin was indeed
   abolished in the flesh; and our affairs were brought back again that
   they may return to their first origin. For death, corruption, pleasures
   and other lusts prevailed, which, having corruption as their assistant,
   committed depredations on the weak and infirm mind. (Against Julian,
   lib. 3, fol. 184.) So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God,
   but with the flesh,, the law of sin. There is, therefore, now no
   condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus, &c., quoting the whole
   passage down to the 5th verse. For the flesh and the spirit manifestly
   fight the one against the other; that is, carnal prudence and the
   motions of innate lusts war against the power of life according to the
   Spirit. Though the divine law urges us that we ought to choose the
   good, yet the desire of the flesh is born, towards that which is
   contrary. But now that is loosened which hindered, and the law of sin
   is weakened; but the law of the Spirit has prevailed. On what account,
   "For God hath sent his own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin,
   that he might condemn sin in the flesh." Now, in what manner was not
   the incarnation of the Word exceedingly useful, For even "our sin is
   here condemned in the flesh." But if the Word had not been made flesh,
   our affairs would have remained without any amendment, and we should
   now be serving in the flesh the law of sin, no one having abolished it
   within us. (On the True Faith, to the Queens, lib. I, fol. 283.) We
   confess, therefore, that, by Adam's personal transgression of the law,
   the human substance has been corrupted; and that, by the pleasures of
   the flesh, and those motions which are so pleasing to our nature, our
   understanding is oppressed as by the domination of a tyrant. Wherefore
   it was necessary for our salvation, who are sojourners on earth, that
   the WORD OF GOD should become man, and he should take human flesh upon
   himself as his own, given up though it was to corruption, and sickly
   through the allurements of pleasure; and that, as he is the life of
   all, he should indeed destroy its corruption, but restrain its innate
   motions, that is, those which impelled us headlong to vices and
   pleasures; for in this manner it was necessary that offenses should be
   mortified in our flesh. But we recollect that the blessed Paul
   denominates the voluptuous motions which art planted within us, "the
   law of sin." Wherefore, because human flesh became a property of the
   WORD, it has now ceased to yield to corruption. And because he knew no
   sin, as God who united him to himself, and, as I have already said, who
   made [human nature] a property [of the WORD], it has now ceased to be
   sick with vices and pleasures. Neither did the only begotten Son of God
   perform this for himself, (for he is the Word which always exists,) but
   he undoubtedly did it for us. For if we are alike brought into
   captivity through Adam's transgression of the law, therefore the
   blessings which are in Christ will descend upon us, and which are
   incorruption and the destruction of sins. (First Epistle to Successus.)
   9. MACARIUS THE EGYPTIAN Adam having transgressed the command of God,
   and having obeyed the impious serpent, sold himself to the devil; and
   thus wickedness invested his mind, that excellent creature, which God
   had formed after his own image, as the apostle likewise says: "Having
   spoiled principalities and powers, and triumphed over them in his
   cross." For the Lord came on this account, that he might expel them,
   [the principalities and powers,] and might receive his own house and
   his proper temple, which is MAN. The mind, therefore, is called "the
   body of darkness and of wickedness," so long as it has within itself
   the darkness of sin; because it lives there in a wicked world of
   darkness, and is there detained captive. As Paul likewise, when giving
   it the appellation of "the body of sin and death," says "that the body
   of sin might be destroyed." And again, "Who shall deliver me from the
   body of this death?" On the contrary, the mind that has believed in
   God, is both delivered from the mortified sin of a life of darkness,
   and has received the light of the Holy Spirit as its life; living in
   which, from that time it perseveres; because it is there governed by
   the light divine. (Homily 1.) From this, it is evident, that Macarius
   understood this passage, as referring to a man who was subjected to the
   spirit of darkness, the slave of sin, and the captive of Satan, and
   who, not being yet dead to sin, has not received the light of the Holy
   Spirit, that is, who is not yet regenerated by the Spirit of Christ.
   10. DAMASCENUS In the fourth book of his Orthodox Faith, (cap. 23,) he
   explains this matter very satisfactorily; wherefore, it will not be
   considered irksome, if at greater length we transcribe his opinion in
   his own words, as they have been rendered by his Latin translator: The
   law of God, when coming to our mind, attracts it to itself, and
   stimulates our consciences. But our conscience is also called "the Law
   of our mind." But the suggestion of the devil, that is, the law of sin,
   when coming to the members of the flesh, also commits itself, through
   the flesh, to us. For, after we have once voluntarily transgressed the
   law of God, and have admitted the suggestion of the devil, we have
   granted entrance to him, being brought into captivity by our own selves
   to sin: Whence our body is promptly led on to commit sin. Therefore,
   the odour and feeling of sin is said to be inherent to our body, that
   is, the lust and pleasure of the body, "the law in the members of our
   flesh." Therefore, "the law of the mind," that is, the conscience,
   feels a sort of condelectation in the law of God, that is, in the
   commandment which it really wills. But "the law of sin," that is, the
   suggestion through. the law which is in the members, that is, the
   concupiscence, the inclination and motion of the body, by means of the
   irrational part of the soul also "wars against the law of my mind,"
   that is, my conscience, and brings me, consenting to the law of God and
   not fulfilling it, yet not desiring sin, into captivity, according to
   contradiction through the enticement of pleasure and the lust of the
   body, and the brute part of the soul which is devoid of reason--as I
   have before said, it causes me to err, and persuades me to serve sin.
   "But what was impossible to the law, in that the law was rendered weak
   through the flesh, God, sending his own Son in the likeness of the
   flesh of sin," (for he assumed flesh, but by no means sin,) "condemned
   sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled
   in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." For "the
   Spirit strives with our infirmity," and affords strength to "the law of
   the mind" in our souls, against "the law which is in our members." 11.
   THEOPHYLACT He says, "I am carnal," that is, human nature
   universally--both that part of it in existence before the enactment of
   the law, and that at the time of the giving of the law--had a numerous
   multitude of passions associated with it. For we not only became mortal
   through Adam's transgression of the law, but human nature, being "sold
   under sin," receives likewise corrupt inclinations, being evidently
   subjected to the authority and domination of sin, so that it cannot
   raise its head. (On Romans 7.) This weakness, therefore, the law could
   not cure, though it dictated what ought to be done, but when Christ
   came, he healed it. This then is the scope or design of those things
   which the apostle has said, or will yet say--to shew that human nature
   has endured those things which are immedicable, and that it cannot be
   restored to soundness by any other than by Christ, and by him alone.
   (ibid.) O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
   this death? The law of nature was not able, the written law could not;
   but the tyranny of sin conquered both of them. Whence, therefore, is
   the hope of salvation, &c. (Ibid.) I yield thanks to God through Jesus
   Christ. For he has performed those things which the law was unable to
   do. For he has delivered me from weakness of body, inspiring into it
   strength and consolation, that it may no longer be oppressed by the
   tyranny of sin. 12. AMBROSE Whether St. Ambrose, or some other person,
   was the author or the interpolator of those Commentaries on the Epistle
   to the Romans, which generally pass under his name, the following are
   some of his remarks on the seventh chapter: That he is sold under sin,
   is that he derives his origin from Adam, who first sinned, and by his
   own transgression rendered himself subject to sin, as Isaiah says, "For
   your iniquities have ye sold yourselves." (i, 1.) For Adam first sold
   himself; and by this act, all his seed was subjected to sin. Wherefore
   man is too full of weakness to observe the precepts of the law, unless
   he be strengthened by divine aids. Hence arises that which he says,
   "The law is spiritual, but I am carnal," &c.; that is, the law is
   strong, and just, and faultless; but man is frail, and subjugated by
   the offense of his progenitor, that he is unable to use his power with
   regard to yielding obedience to the law. He must therefore flee to the
   mercy of God, that he may avoid the severity of the law, and being
   exonerated from his transgressions, may, with regard to other things,
   resist his enemy under the favour of heaven. But to perform that which
   is good I find not. Therefore, that which is commanded by the law is
   pleasing to him, and his will is to do it; but, in order to its
   completion, power and virtue are wanting; because he is so oppressed by
   the power of sin, that he cannot go where he would; neither is he able
   to contradict, because another is the lord and master of his power.
   (Ibid.) That he may extol the grace of God, the apostle expounds these
   words, concerning the great evils from which it has delivered man; that
   he might point out what destructive materials he derives from Adam, but
   what blessings through Christ have been obtained for him whom the law
   could neither succour nor relieve. (Ibid.) Let the whole [of the rest
   of the] passage be perused. 13. JEROME We have sinned, and have
   committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, &c.
   Undoubtedly the three Hebrew children had not sinned, neither were they
   of that [accountable] age when they were led away to Babylon, so as to
   be punished for their vices. Therefore, as they here speak in the
   person of their nation at large, so we must read and apply that passage
   of the apostle, "for what I would, that do I not," &c. (On Daniel 9.)

  III. THE OPINION OF ST. AUGUSTINE

   Quotations from his writings. 2. These passages confirm the
   interpretation of the author. It is objected, that St. Augustine
   afterwards gave a different explanation, and retracted his former
   opinion; to this the reply is, it appears that his interpretation of
   this chapter was free from any such change. 3. What St. Augustine
   properly retracted is shown by quotations from his writings. 4. His
   modesty in the explanation of this chapter. He understands this passage
   to refer, not to actual sins, but to the internal motions of
   concupiscence. 1. But let us approach to St. Augustine, and see what
   was his opinion concerning this passage, since my opinion is loaded and
   oppressed with the weight of his authority: If then I do that which I
   would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. The law is indeed
   sufficiently defended from all crimination. But we must be on our guard
   to prevent any one from supposing, that, by these words, the free
   exercise or choice of the will is taken away from us; which is not the
   fact. For now is described a man placed under the law, before [the
   arrival of] grace. (Exposition of certain Propositions from the Epistle
   to the Romans, cap. 7.) But I see another law in my members, warring
   against the law of my mind, &c. He calls that "the law of sin" by which
   every one is bound who is entangled in the habit or nature of the
   flesh. He says that this wars against "the law of the mind," and
   "brings it into captivity to the law of sin." From this, the man is
   understood to be described who is not yet under grace. For, if the
   carnal habit or nature were only to maintain a warfare, and not to
   bring into captivity, there would not be condemnation. For in this
   consists condemnation--that we obey and serve corrupt and carnal
   desires. But, if such desires still exist and do not all disappear, yet
   in this case we do not yield obedience to them, we are not brought into
   captivity, and we are now under grace, concerning which he speaks when
   he cries out for the aid of the Deliverer, that this might be possible
   through the grace, of love, which fear was not able to do through the
   law. For he has said, "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
   from the body of this death," And he added, "the grace of God through
   Jesus Christ our Lord." He then begins to describe man placed under
   grace, which is the third degree of those four into which we have
   distinguished mankind. (Ibid.) But not being yet content with the past
   inquiry and explanation, lest I had, with too much negligence, passed
   by any thing in it, (Rom. 7,) I have still more cautiously and
   attentively examined the very same words of the apostle, and the tenor
   of their meanings. For you would not consider it proper to ask such
   things, if the manner in which they may be understood were easy and
   devoid of difficulties. For, from the passage in which it is
   written--"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid," unto
   that in which the apostle says, "I find then a law, that, when I would
   do good," &c., and, I believe, as far the verse in which, it is said,
   "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death, The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord"--you wished me
   to elucidate or resolve the question first from these passages, in
   which the apostle seems to me to have transfigured unto himself, a man
   placed under the law, with whose words he speaks from his own person.
   (To Simplicianus, the Bishop of the Church of Milan.) Hence it is
   evident, FIRST, that the church had at that period prescribed nothing
   definite concerning the meaning of this passage: For Simplicianus, the
   bishop of Milan, indeed, officiating in the very Church in which St.
   Ambrose had formerly discharged the Episcopal functions, would not have
   earnestly requested to have the opinion of St. Augustine, if the
   opinion to be maintained concerning it had been prescribed. Secondly.
   After St. Augustine had diligently considered the matter, he openly
   declares, that the whole passage must be understood as referring to a
   man under the law. "For," he says, "I was without the law once." By
   this he plainly shows that he was not speaking properly in his own
   person, but generally in the person of "the old man." (Ibid.) He
   afterwards subjoins the cause why it is so, and says, "For we know that
   the law is spiritual, but I am carnal," in which he shows, that the law
   cannot be fulfilled except by spiritual persons, who do not become such
   without the aid of grace. (Ibid.) Indeed, when he had said--"but I am
   carnal," he also subjoined the kind of carnal man that he was. For even
   those who are now placed under grace, and who are now redeemed by the
   blood of Christ, and born again through faith, are called "carnal"
   after a certain manner; to whom the same apostle says, "And I,
   brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
   carnal," &c. (1 Cor. iii. 1.) But that man who is still under the law
   and not under grace, is so very carnal as not yet to be born again from
   sin, but to be sold under the law by sin; because the price of deadly
   pleasure embraces that sweetness by which a man is deceived and
   delighted to act even contrary to the law, since the pleasure is
   greater in proportion to its unlawfulness, &c. "He consents, therefore,
   to the law of God," inasmuch as he does not what it prohibits, but
   chiefly by not willing that which he does. For, not being yet liberated
   by grace, he is conquered [by sin], although through the law he is both
   conscious that he is acting improperly, and is reluctant. But with
   regard to that which follows, where he says, "Now then it is no more I
   that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me;" he does not, therefore, say
   it, because he does not consent to commit sin, though he consents to
   the law by disapproving of the sin which he commits. But he is still
   speaking in the person of a man placed under the law, who is not yet
   under grace, and who is indeed drawn, by reigning concupiscence and by
   the deceitful sweetness of prohibited sin, to perpetrate evil, though,
   through his knowledge of the law, he partly disapproves of such bad
   actions. But this is the reason why he says, "It is no more I that do
   it," because, being conquered, he does it, since it is done by evil
   desires, to whose conquering power he yields. But grace causes him no
   longer thus to yield, and strengthens the mind of man against lusts, of
   which grace the apostle is now about to treat. (Ibid.) SEE ALSO WHAT
   IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS THIS QUOTATION. "To will is present with me." He
   says this with respect to facility. For what can be more easy, to a man
   placed under the law, than to will that which is good, and to do what
   is evil, &c. (Ibid.) But the whole of this is said for the purpose of
   shewing to man, while yet a captive, that he must not presume on his
   own strength or power. On this account he reproved the Jews as proudly
   boasting about the works of the law, when they were attracted by
   concupiscence to whatsoever was unlawful, though the law, of which they
   boasted, declared "Thou shalt not covet," or indulge in concupiscence.
   Therefore, a man who is conquered, condemned and captivated, must
   humbly declare--a man who, after having received the law, is not as one
   that lives according to the law, but is rather a transgressor of it,
   must humbly exclaim, "O wretched man that I am," &c. (Ibid.) 2. That
   man who will compare these passages from St. Augustine with my
   arguments concerning Romans 7, will perceive that we entirely agree in
   sentiment, and that I subscribe to this opinion of St. Augustine. From
   these extracts, it likewise appears that nothing had, at that period,
   been prescribed by the church concerning this portion of the
   apostolical writing,, but nothing towards that part especially--that it
   was to be understood about a man who is regenerate and placed under
   grace. But I am here met with this objection: "St. Augustine, in
   subsequent years, gave a different explanation to this chapter, that
   is, as being applicable to a regenerate man placed under grace, as he
   has done in the 43rd, 45th, and 47th of his discourses On Time, and in
   several other passages." I confess, that the fact was as it is here
   stated; and we will afterwards examine those passages; we shall
   perceive how much they are able to contribute towards the establishment
   of the opinion that is opposed to mine. "But," the same objectors say,
   "St. Augustine retracted and condemned that very opinion which he had
   first explained in his treatise, entitled, An Exposition of certain
   Propositions in the Epistle to the Romans, and in his book addressed to
   Simplicianus, bishop of Milan; his authority, therefore, cannot be
   adduced in confirmation of that opinion." To this I might reply, First,
   from the fact of St. Augustine having first entertained the same
   opinion about this passage as I do, and afterwards a different one, it
   is evident that neither of these opinions had been considered by the
   church in the light of a catholic or universally admitted doctrine.
   Secondly. It is possible that St. Augustine may, in the beginning, have
   held a more correct opinion than that which he subsequently maintained,
   especially when, in the first instant, he followed his own judgment,
   which had been formed from an accurate inspection of the entire
   chapter, and from a diligent comparison of different sentiments on the
   subject; but he was afterwards influenced by the authority of certain
   interpreters of holy writ, as he informs us in his Retractions, (lib.
   I, cap. 23,) though he adds, that he had with much diligence considered
   the subject; for he did not consider it without some of that prejudice
   which he had imbibed from the authority of those expositors. 3. But
   though I might make those preliminary replies, yet the answer which I
   will give is this: St. Augustine never trusted or condemned that
   opinion by which he had explained this chapter as applicable to a man
   placed under the law; but he only retracted this part of his early
   opinion "These words must not be received as uttered in the person of
   the apostle himself, who was then spiritual, but in that of a man
   placed under the law and not yet under grace." For he had made two
   assertions, First, that this chapter must be understood as relating to
   a man placed under the law. Secondly, that it must neither be
   understood as relating to a man placed under grace, nor as relating to
   the apostle himself who was then spiritual. The former of these
   assertions was never retracted by St. Augustine; the latter he has
   retracted, as will most clearly appear to any one who will examine the
   passage, which it will be no trouble to transcribe on this occasion,
   since the works of this father are not in the hands of every one. In
   the first book of his "Retractions," (cap. 23,) he says: "While I was
   yet a priest, it happened that the Epistle of the apostle to the Romans
   was read among us who were at that time together at Carthage, and my
   brethren made inquiries of me about some passages in it, to which when
   I had given as proper replies as I was able, it was the wish of my
   brethren that what I spoke on this subject should be written out,
   rather than be uttered in an extemporaneous manner; when, on this point
   I had acceded to their request, another book was added to my Opuscula.
   In that book I say, But when the apostle asserts, For we know that the
   law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin, he shows in a manner
   sufficiently plain, that it is impossible for the law to be fulfilled
   by any persons, except by those who are spiritual, and are made such by
   the grace of God.' This I wished not to be received in the person of
   the apostle, who was at that time spiritual, but in that of a man
   placed under the law, and who was not yet under grace. For that was the
   manner in which I first understood these words; which I afterwards
   considered with more diligence, after having perused the productions of
   certain commentators on the divine oracles, by whose authority I was
   moved; and I perceived that, when he says for we know that the law is
   spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin, the words may also be
   understood as referring to the apostle himself. This I have shown, with
   as much diligence as I was able, in those books which I have lately
   written against the Pelagians. "In this book, therefore, I have said
   that, by the words but l am carnal, sold under sin, through the
   remainder of the chapter to the verse in which he says, O wretched man
   that I am! a man is described who is still under the law, but not yet
   placed under grace, who wills to do that which is good, but who,
   conquered by the desires of the flesh, does that which is evil. From
   the dominion of this concupiscence the man is not delivered, except by
   the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, by the gift of the Holy
   Ghost, through whom love being diffused, or shed abroad, in our hearts,
   overcomes all the desires of the flesh, that we may not consent to
   those desires to do evil, but rather that we may do good. By this,
   indeed, is now overturned the Pelagian heresy, that will not admit that
   the love by which we live good and pious lives is from God to us, but
   that asserts it to be from ourselves. "But in those books which we have
   published against the Pelagians, we have shown, that the words of the
   apostle in Romans 7, are better understood as those of a spiritual man
   who is now placed under grace on account of the body of flesh which is
   not yet spiritual, but which will be so in the resurrection of the
   dead, and on account of carnal concupiscence itself, with which the
   saints maintain such a conflict, not consenting to it for evil, as not
   to be without its opposing motions in this life which yet they resist.
   But the saints will not have such motions to evil in that world in
   which death will be swallowed up in victory. Therefore, on account of
   this concupiscence and those motions to which such a resistance is
   given as they may still be in us, [or as suffers them yet to be in us,]
   every holy person who is now placed under grace can utter all those
   words which I have here said are the expressions of a man who is not
   yet placed under grace, but under the law. To show this, would require
   much time; and I have mentioned the place where I have shown it."
   (Ibid.) "Of the books which I wrote when a bishop, the first two were
   addressed to Simplicianus, bishop of the church of Milan, who was
   successor to the blessed Ambrose--in them I discussed diverse
   questions. Two of the questions on which I treated in the first book,
   were from St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans. The first of them was on
   what is written in vii, 7 -- What shall we say then? Is the law sin?
   God forbid! -- down to the 25th verse in which it is said, Who shall
   deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God though Jesus
   Christ our Lord. In that book, I have expounded these words of the
   apostle, The law is spiritual, but l am carnal, and the other
   expressions by which the flesh is shown to contend against the Spirit.
   In it I have explained them in such a manner as that in which a man is
   described who is still under the law, but not yet placed under grace.
   For a long time afterwards elapsed, before I discerned that they could
   also be the words of a spiritual man, and this with a stronger
   semblance of probability." (Retractations, lib. 2, cap. 1.) 4. These
   are the passages transcribed with verbal accuracy, in which St.
   Augustine retracts the opinion which he had previously explained, from
   which it is apparent that he neither rejected his former opinion, nor
   convicted it of falsehood, error or heresy; but that he only said,
   "This passage in the apostle's writings may also be understood as
   referring to a man who is regenerate, spiritual, and placed under
   grace, and this much better and with more probability than concerning a
   man placed under the law;" yet he says that this [his first] opinion is
   opposed to the Pelagian heresy. But the very words which he employs in
   his Retractations teach us, that this chapter in the apostolical
   writings may likewise be understood concerning a man who is placed
   under the law, but [according to his latest judgment] not so well, and
   with less probability. We see therefore, that the modesty of St.
   Augustine was at an immense distance from the vehemence of those who
   assert, that "this part of holy writ must be understood concerning a
   man who is placed under grace, nor can it by any means be explained as
   referring to a man placed under the law without incurring the charge of
   Pelagian heresy." Let the reader examine, if he pleases, the works of
   St. Augustine, (tom. 10,) concerning the words of the apostle, (Sermon
   5, on Romans vii. 7, fol. 59, col. 3,) "Speak to me, holy apostle,
   about thyself, when no one doubts that thou art speaking about
   thyself." And in the same sermon, (col. 4,), If, therefore, I say that
   the apostle speaks of himself, I do not affirm it." But it is improper
   for this last, whether it be an explanation or a retractation of St.
   Augustine, to be urged by those who reject the cause of this change, by
   which, he openly declares, he was moved to suppose that this passage
   might likewise be explained in reference to a man under grace, and this
   much better and with greater probability. He says that the cause of it
   was, because he perceived that this man might be called "carnal" on
   account of the body of flesh which is not yet spiritual, and because he
   has yet within him the desires of the flesh, though he does not consent
   to them. This is also the opinion of those expounders whom St.
   Augustine says he followed. But our divines who oppose themselves to me
   on Romans 7, do not explain that chapter in this manner, as, -- to will
   that which is good, is to will not to lust or indulge in unlawful
   desires, and to do evil, is to lust; but they explain it, actually to
   do or to commit that which is evil. The authority, therefore, of St.
   Augustine ought not to be produced by them; because, as we shall
   afterwards more clearly demonstrate, his judgment was this: If this
   chapter be explained as referring to actual sins, it cannot be
   explained concerning a regenerate man. But if it be explained
   respecting a regenerate man, it must necessarily be understood only
   concerning the inward motions of concupiscence or lust. Wherefore, I
   have St. Augustine in his first opinion, fully agreeing with me, and in
   his latter not differing greatly from me; but those who are opposed to
   me have St. Augustine contrary and adverse to them in both these his
   opinions. IV.
     __________________________________________________________________

  OUR OPINION IS SUPPORTED BY SEVERAL WRITERS OF THE MIDDLE AGES

   Venerable Bede. 2. St. Paulinus. 3. Nicholas De Lyra. 4. Ordinary
   Gloss. 5. Interlineary Gloss. 6. Hugh the cardinal. 7. Thomas Aquinas,
   who thinks that Romans vii. 14, may be explained in both ways, but he
   refers its application to a regenerate man. 8. He is of opinion, that
   the 17th and 18th verses can only be considered by a forced
   construction to relate to a man under sin. His reasons for advancing
   this last assertion are examined and answered. 9. An abbreviation of
   the comments which Thomas has given on these two verses; with a
   conclusion deduced from them, that they may be appropriately understood
   to relate to a man under the law, but in no other than a forced manner
   to a man under grace. 1. VENERABLE BEDE For we know that the law is
   spiritual, but I am carnal. Perhaps, therefore, it is some other
   person, or perhaps thyself. Either thou art the person, or I am. If,
   therefore, it be some one of us, let us listen to him as if concerning
   himself, and, divesting our minds of angry feelings, let us correct
   ourselves. But if it be he, [the apostle,] let us not thus understand
   what he has said, "What I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that
   do I." (On Romans 7.) Therefore, because he thrice intreated the Lord,
   that this thorn might be taken away from him; and because he who was,
   not heard according to his wishes, was heard according to that which
   was for his healing; he perhaps does not speak in a manner that is
   unbecoming when he says, The law is spiritual, but I am carnal."
   (Ibid.) 2. ST. PAULINUS And I am perfectly aware that this blessed man
   prefers to employ my weakness; and, lamenting concerning my
   afflictions, he cries out, instead of me, "O wretched man that I am I"
   (Second Epistle to Severus Sulpicius, Priest at Tours.) 3. NICHOLAS DE
   LYRA For we know that the law is spiritual and placing men in right
   order to follow the instigation of the Spirit or of reason. (On Romans
   7.) But I am carnal, that is, I follow the impulse of the flesh or of
   sensuality; and the apostle speaks, as was before observed, in the
   person of the fallen human race, in which there are more persons who
   follow the impulse of sensuality than that of reason. After the inward
   man that is according to the natural dictates of reason; because reason
   is called "the inward man," and sensuality "the outward man." O
   wretched man that I am! In this passage, he consequently begs to be
   delivered, speaking in the person of all mankind, "O wretched man that
   I am" through the corruption of nature! So then, with the mind, I serve
   the law of God that is, according to the inclination of reason. But
   with the flesh, the law of sin by following the inclination of the
   flesh. 4. ORDINARY GLOSS "For we know that the law is spiritual," &c.,
   quoted to the end of the chapter. It is not perfectly clear whether
   these things are better understood as spoken in his own person, or in
   that of all mankind. (On Romans 7.) 5. INTERLINEARY GLOSS But I am
   carnal unable to resist the corruption of my mind or the devil. (On
   Romans 7.) Sold under sin in my first parent, that I may be really
   under sin as a servant. Now then it is no more I that do it under the
   law before the times of grace. Evil is present with me with my reason;
   it is near to my inward man. I see another law the fuel or flame, which
   reigns. Warring against the law of my mind, the law and my reason
   united together in one. Bringing me into captivity through consent and
   working, because it governs by habit or custom. To the law of sin for
   sin is the law, because it has the dominion. The grace of God, not that
   the law, nor my own powers, but that the grace of God delivers. So then
   with the mind the rational and inward man, having, as before, fuel. 6.
   HUGH THE CARDINAL For we know that the law is spiritual. This is the
   third part of the chapter, in which he shows, that those things which
   were commanded in the law of Moses, cannot be fulfilled without the law
   of the Spirit, that is, without grace. But I am carnal that is, frail
   and weak to resist the devil and the lust of the flesh. For what I
   would according to reason, that is, I approve. but what I hate that is,
   evil. But from this it is inferred that he wants the spiritual law, by
   which he may do that which he wills according to reason. There is,
   therefore, now no condemnation. The preceding things have been
   expounded concerning the captivity of mortal sin under which man was
   carnally living, and concerning the captivity of the venial sin of the
   man who is in grace; and that the law of the Spirit, or grace, delivers
   from the captivity of death; and he draws this inference: "There is,
   therefore, now no condemnation," that is, no mortal sin through which
   is condemnation. 7. THOMAS AQUINAS But I am carnal. He shows the
   condition of the man: And this expression may be expounded in two ways.
   In one way, that the apostle is speaking in the person of a man who is
   in sin. And St. Augustine expounds it thus in the 83d hook of his
   Questions. But, afterwards, in his book against Julian, he expounds it,
   that the apostle may be understood to speak in his own person, that is,
   of a man placed under grace. Let us proceed, therefore, in declaring
   what kind of words these are, and those which follow them, and how they
   may be differently expounded in either manner, though the second mode
   of exposition is the best. (On Romans 7.) I am fully aware that the
   same Thomas has marked out two passages in this chapter, which he
   asserts it to be impossible to explain concerning an unregenerate man
   except by a distorted interpretation. But it will repay our labour if
   we inspect those passages, and examine those reasons which moved Thomas
   to hold this sentiment. The first passage is the 17th verse: "Now then
   it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me." The second
   passage is the 18th verse: "For I know that in me (that is, in my
   flesh) dwelleth no good thing." (1.) He says "that the first of these
   passages cannot, except by a distorted interpretation, be understood
   concerning a man who is under sin; because the sinner himself
   perpetrates that din, while he is one who, according to the principal
   part of himself, that is, according to his reason and mind, consents to
   the perpetration of sin. But this must properly be attributed to a man,
   which belongs to him according to what is man; but he is a man by his
   mind and his reason." But I answer, First, It is said, not only
   respecting a man who is under sin, that he does not perpetrate sin
   except with his mind and reason, which dictate, that sin is forbidden
   by the law, which yet are conquered through the lust of the flesh, and
   by the consent of the will, but it is likewise said respecting the
   regenerate and those who are under grace; for these persons do not
   actually commit sin except with a mind that is conquered, and through
   consent of the will; and, therefore, it is a vain attempt to be
   desirous to distinguish, in this manner, between him, who is under sin
   and him who is under grace. Secondly. I deny that all those who are
   under sin commit iniquity with the consent of their mind, that is,
   without any resistance of conscience. For when those persons who are
   under the law, sin, they do this against conscience and with a mind
   that is reluctant, because they are overcome by the tyranny of sin and
   carnal concupiscence. Thirdly. Though the matter really were as he has
   stated it, yet it would not follow that it cannot be said of this man
   by any interpretation, except a distorted one: "It is no more he that
   commits this sin, but it is sin." A reason is produced by Thomas
   himself; for the man does this through the motion and compulsion of sin
   which dwelleth in him and has the dominion. But effects are usually
   ascribed to the principal causes; therefore, this verse may be
   understood, without any distorted meaning, to relate to a man who is
   under the law. If any one, according to the judgment of St. Augustine,
   declare--"It cannot be attributed to a man who actually gives his
   consent to sin, that he does not himself commit it, but sin, and,
   therefore, the perpetration of it must be understood as relating not to
   the consent to evil and the commission of it, but to concupiscence or
   evil desire, and thus this act belongs to a man under grace," to this
   objection, I reply that I deny the antecedent, as I have previously
   observed; but I confess that if it be understood concerning
   concupiscence alone, and not concerning the consent to sin and the
   actual perpetration of it, the expression contained in this verse can
   by no means, not even distortedly, be employed concerning a man who is
   under the law and under sin. (2.) Thomas says "that the latter of these
   passages, the 18th verse, cannot be explained, except in a distorted
   manner, concerning a man under sin, on account of the correction which
   is added, and which it was unnecessary to adduce if the discourse were
   about a man under sin, as being one who has no good thing dwelling
   either in his flesh or in his mind. To this, I reply that the
   antecedent is false; for we have already demonstrated, in the remarks
   on this 18th verse, that, in the mind of a man who is under the law,
   some good exists and dwells, as Thomas here employs the word to dwell -
   - nay, that it also reigns and has the dominion, as the word ought
   properly to be received. Therefore, the ignorance of Thomas about this
   matter, caused him thus to think and to write. 9. But let the entire
   comment of Thomas on this passage be perused, and it will then appear,
   that all these things in the two verses may be explained in the
   plainest manner concerning a man under the law, but with much
   perversion and contortion about a regenerate man who is placed under
   grace, l show this in the following brief manner, having united
   together, in a compendious summary, those things which he has treated
   with greater prolixity, as any one may perceive on referring to his
   pages: "If the man or the reason be called fleshly or carnal because he
   is attacked by the flesh--if to do signifies the same as to lust or
   desire--if to will good, and not to will evil, be taken for a complete
   volition and nolition, which continue in the election or choice of a
   particular operation; -- but if to commit evil, and not to do good, be
   understood according to an incomplete act, which consists only in the
   sensitive appetite, not reaching so far as to the consent of reason--if
   this captivity be produced solely at the motion of concupiscence--if
   deliverance from the body of this death be desired, that the corruption
   of the body may be totally removed, then the expression in this passage
   of Scripture must be understood concerning a regenerate and just man,
   who is placed under grace. "But if this man or reason be called fleshly
   or carnal because he is in subjection to the flesh, consenting to those
   things to which he is instigated by the flesh--if to do be the same
   thing as to execute by actual operation--if to will that which is good,
   and not to will what is evil, be taken in the acceptation of an
   incomplete volition and nolition, by which men will good in general and
   do not will what is evil, and if they do neither of these in
   particular; -- but if to commit evil, and not to do good, be understood
   according to a complete act, which is exercised in external operation
   through the consent of reason--if this captivity be produced through
   consent and operation or doing, and, lastly, if deliverance from the
   body of this death be desired or asked, that the corruption of the body
   may not have dominion over the mind, drawing it to commit sin, then the
   expressions in this passage must be understood concerning a man who is
   a sinner, and who is placed under the law." But let us now subjoin--A
   man who is attacked by the flesh, yet who conquers it in the conflict,
   is not called fleshly or carnal; but this appellation is bestowed on
   the man who, by yielding his consent, is brought into subjection to the
   flesh. The apostle is here treating about a volition and a nolition
   that are incomplete and imperfect, and about the actual perpetration of
   evil and the omission of good, and not solely about the act or motion
   of lusting or desiring; (for this is declared by the matter itself, for
   the man wills and does not, therefore the volition is imperfect.) This
   captivity is not at the motion of concupiscence alone, but it is by
   consent and operation; for either concupiscence itself, or the law of
   the members, brings a man into captivity through the waging of war
   against the law of the mind; and the deliverance which is required is
   from the corruption of the body, that it may not have dominion over the
   mind, and not that it may be totally removed; for the apostle presents
   a thanksgiving to God for having obtained that which he had desired.
   Therefore, this passage must be understood, not about a man under
   grace, but about one who is under the law; not about a man who is
   already restored by grace, but about one who is yet to be restored. Our
   proposition is taken from Thomas Aquinas. We have added the assumption
   from the text itself.

V. THE FAVOURABLE TESTIMONIES OF MORE RECENT DIVINES

   is good, and I hate evil. To will, is present with me. With the mind, I
   myself serve the law of God." These undoubtedly are not the traits of a
   wicked or profane man, and of one who is not yet approaching to God;
   but they are those of a holy man who loves God and who trembles at his
   words. For God rescues us by certain degrees from that death into which
   we are all born. First, he suffers us, for some time, to live in
   ignorance, disregarding his judgments. At this period, "sin is dead,"
   &c. But when it has pleased God to terminate this ignorance, he sends
   forth his law, and gives us to see that it is "holy, and just, and
   good." From this, it necessarily arises that "we consent to the law,"
   that we will what it commends, and that we are abhorrent from those
   things which it condemns. But if the Spirit of Christ do not afford
   unto us powerful succour, this love of God and consent to his law
   remain so weak, and the force of sin which is still within us prevails
   so strongly, that, through the correction and command of the law, the
   depraved lusts become the more inflamed, and we occasionally do, not
   only by lusting or desiring, but also by actually committing, that
   which we ourselves detest, and we neglect those things of which we are
   not capable of doing otherwise than approving and willing. But these
   things cause the dread of the divine judgment to increase within us, by
   which we are completely unnerved, and deprived of sensation. All these
   effects are produced by the law, but through the corruption of our
   depraved nature; and it is the condition of the period now mentioned,
   which the apostle describes in himself in the present chapter. But
   whilst God, who is the Father of mercies, resolves more fully to impart
   himself to us, and vouchsafes more bountifully to bestow the Spirit of
   his Son upon us, by this, his Spirit, he represses and subdues that
   power of sin which otherwise impels us against the law and authority,
   how much soever we may consent to the law itself; he implants within us
   a true judgment concerning things, and a solid love, [honest, for that
   which is upright and honourable, so that now, with pleasure, and with a
   confirmed and perpetual inclination or purpose, we live the life of
   God. This condition of holy people is described by the apostle in the
   subsequent chapter, in which he declares that "the law of the Spirit of
   life in Christ Jesus had made him free from the law of sin and death."
   (Rom. viii, 2.) As, therefore, the apostle in this place begins to
   declare what the law, of itself, effects in holy people, and from this
   begins to commend it when it is so exceedingly beneficial, yet he
   asserts that it cannot render a man just before God, but that it drives
   him to Christ who alone can justify. And he brings forward in this
   place, and points out, the condition of a man of God, which is that of
   the middle age of holy people, in which the law is indeed already
   known, but not yet fully inscribed on the heart; that is, when the mind
   of man consents to the law of God, but the appetite of nature still
   offers resistance, and impels to act in opposition to the precepts of
   the law. I repeat it, in this condition, the apostle has proposed
   himself for an example, that he might point out in himself what power
   the law possessed, and how all things are death, until the Spirit of
   Christ obtains greater influence within us. But St. Paul did not still
   contend with his nature after the manner which is described in this
   passage, for he soon afterwards declares that "the law of the Spirit of
   life in Christ Jesus had made him free from the law of sin and death,"
   and that through the Spirit of Christ, "the righteousness of the law
   was now fulfilled in him, as he walked, not after the, flesh, but after
   the Spirit." (On Romans 7.) 7. WOLFGANG MUSCULUS The law, indeed, has
   righteousness and justification, by commanding those things which are
   just. But it is impossible that it should have that by which to
   justify; for it is hindered and rendered inefficacious through the
   flesh, that is, through the corrupt and depraved inclinations of the
   flesh, through which it comes to pass that a man who is carnal, and the
   slave of sin, is incapable of obeying those commands which are holy,
   and just, and good. (Common Places in the chapter on the laws, under
   the title of The Power and efficacy of the law.) We say that the power
   and efficacy of the law, which is called "the letter," is two-fold. The
   one is that which it produces of its own, and may be called proper. The
   other is improper, which it does not bring from itself, but which it
   performs through the corruption of our flesh. The first is proper,
   because it produces the knowledge of sin. On this subject, the apostle
   speaks thus: "I had not known sin but by the law; for I had not known
   lust except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." (Rom. vii. 7.) He
   also says, "By the law is the knowledge of sin." (iii, 20.) (Ibid.) He
   afterwards not only speaks about "the knowledge of sin," which consists
   of the understanding, but he also speaks principally about that
   knowledge of it which is received by a lively feeling of sin in our
   flesh; that is, the law causes me not only to understand, but likewise
   with gnawing remorse of conscience to feel and to experience that sin
   is within me. It is proper, because it convinces us that we are
   inexcusably guilty of sin, subjects and condemns us to malediction,
   (Gal. iii, 10,) and, through a feeling of sin, and when terrified of
   condemnation, it renders us anxious, and desirous of the grace of God.
   Hence, arises that which is the subject of the apostle's investigation
   in Romans 7, when at length he cries out, "O wretched man that I am!
   who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God
   through Jesus Christ."(Ibid.) After the apostle, in Romans 7, has
   disputed about the power and efficacy of the law, which works in carnal
   and natural men, speaking in the next chapter of the grace of the Holy
   Spirit, which is bestowed on those who believe in Christ, he
   subjoins--"for the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
   me free from the law of sin and death," &c. under the title of the Law
   of the Spirit.) St. Paul understands "the law of sin" to be the power
   and tyranny of sin reigning in our flesh, by which we are violently
   dragged and impelled to commit sin. "The law of death" is that by which
   sinners are adjudged to death eternal. Therefore "the law of the Spirit
   of life" not only produces this effect in us, that we are not condemned
   on account of the imputation of righteousness which is through faith in
   Christ; but it likewise extinguishes the power of sin in us, that sin
   may now no longer reign in us, but the strength and grace of Christ,
   and that we may no more serve sin, but righteousness, nor be obnoxious
   to death, but challenged and claimed for the true life. (Ibid.) For the
   more lucid explanation of this matter, we must observe the three
   degrees of the saints, by which they are divinely led to the perfection
   of piety: The first is of those who resemble drunken men, and who,
   having for some time lulled to sleep all judgment and every good
   inclination, live in sins, the law of God not having yet produced its
   effect in them; the second degree is of those who, by what way soever
   they may have returned to themselves, the judgment of their reason
   being now illuminated, and their inclinations changed, desire that
   which is good, and thus consent to the law of God and delight in it,
   and really abhor that which is evil; but the tyranny of sin still
   prevailing, they are reluctantly drawn to evil things; and, therefore,
   the good of which they approve, and which they desire and will, they
   perform not; but the evil which they hate and avoid, they perpetrate,
   though their consciences exclaim against it, and though the judgment of
   their minds dictate something far different, &c. To this second degree
   must be referred those things of which St. Paul here treats in his own
   example. The Third Degree is of those who have been rescued into the
   liberty of righteousness, after having, through the Spirit, subdued and
   conquered the power and wickedness of sin, that they do not now obey
   the law of sin, but the law of the Spirit that reigns in their members,
   and possesses the double faculty of willing and doing. About this
   degree, the apostle will treat in the subsequent chapter. (Comment on
   Romans 7.) I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. A most wonderful
   and sudden turn of the affections. He had just before deplored himself
   as a wretched man and a captive, and almost immediately he gratefully
   returns thanks. From this, we perceive that St. Paul now uses his own
   person, not that which he sustained when he wrote these things, but
   that which he had formerly represented. (Ibid.) There is, therefore,
   now no condemnation. As he had previously described the condition of
   the man who was living in a legal spirit, so now he describes and
   points out the condition of him who is endued with the evangelical
   Spirit. (On Romans 8.) The mutual and unanimous agreement of the
   witnesses whom I have here produced, will, according to my judgment,
   very easily liberate my opinion from all surmise and suspicion of
   novelty.
     __________________________________________________________________

THIRD PART
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. THIS OPINION IS NEITHER HERETICAL NOR ALLIED TO ANY HERESY

   .In this third part, two things are contained: the first is a
   negative--that this, my interpretation of Romans 7 is not favourable to
   the Pelagian heresy. The principal dogmas of the Pelagian heresy are
   recounted from St. Augustine. 2. It is proved by induction and by
   comparison that this interpretation agrees with none of these dogmas.
   3. Two rejoinders to the contrary. An answer to the first of them, that
   every good thing must not be taken away from the regenerate. 4. An
   answer to the second. The truth must be confirmed, and falsehood
   refitted, by solid arguments. 5. It is proved from St. Augustine that
   the doctrine which relates to the necessity of the grace of Christ, and
   to the impossibility of the law for the conquest of sin, was accounted
   by the ancients to be of far more importance than that which proves the
   perpetual imperfections of the regenerate in this life. 6. To this, the
   fathers of the Council of Carthage seem to give their assent, in their
   epistle to Pope Innocent. Thesis.--No heresy, neither that of Pelagius
   nor any other, can be derived or confirmed from this opinion. But this
   opinion is, in the most obvious manner, adverse to Pelagianism, and
   affords a signal and professed confutation of its grand and leading
   falsehood. 1. This thesis contains two parts. The First is, that this
   opinion is neither heretical, nor allied to heresy. The Second that it
   is directly contrary to the Pelagian heresy, and professedly refutes
   it. With regard to the First of these parts, because it consists of a
   negation, those who maintain the affirmative of it must destroy it by
   the proof of the contrary. I am desirous, therefore, to hear from them
   what heresy it is which this opinion advocates and favours. They will
   undoubtedly announce it to be that of Pelagius. But I require a proof
   of the particular point in which there is the least agreement between
   this opinion and Pelagianism. Let us shew, however, ex abundanti, that
   this opinion is not favourable to Pelagianism. The following heads of
   doctrine are those which St. Augustine has laid down in his book on
   Heresies and his Hypognosticon, as belonging to Pelagianism: (i.)
   Whether Adam had sinned, or had not sinned, he would have died. (ii.)
   The sin of Adam was injurious to no one except to himself; and
   therefore, (iii.) Little children do not contract original sin from
   Adam; neither will they perish from life eternal, if they depart out of
   the present life without the sacrament of baptism. (iv.) Lust or
   concupiscence in man is a natural good; neither is there any thing in
   it of which man may be ashamed. (v.) Through his free will, as per se,
   man is sufficient for himself, and is able to will what is good, and to
   fulfill or perfect that which he wills. Or even, for the merits of
   works, God bestows grace on every one. (vi.) The life of the just or
   the righteous in this life has in it no sin whatsoever; and from these
   persons, the church of Christ in this state of mortality are completed,
   that it may be altogether without spot or wrinkle. (vii.) Pelagius,
   being compelled to confess grace, says that it is a gift conferred in
   creation, is the preaching of the law, and the illumination of the
   mind, to know those things which are good and those which are evil, as
   well as the remission of sins if any one has sinned, excluding from
   this [definition of grace] love and the gift and assistance of the Holy
   Spirit, without which, he says, the good which is known may be
   performed, though he acknowledges that this grace has also been given
   for this purpose--that the thing may be the more easily done, which can
   indeed be otherwise done by the power of nature, but yet with greater
   difficulty. 2. These are the principal dogmas of the Pelagian heresy,
   to which others, if any such there be, may be referred. But none of
   these dogmas are patronized by the opinion which explains Romans 7, as
   applicable to a man placed under the law, and in the manner in which we
   have explained it, and as St. Augustine has declared it in his book
   entitled "The Exposition of certain Propositions from the epistle to
   the Romans," and in his first book to Simplicianus. This will be proved
   thus by induction: (i.) Our opinion openly professes that sin is the
   only and sole meritorious cause of death, and that man would not have
   died, had he not sinned. (ii.) By the commission of sin, Adam corrupted
   himself and all his posterity, and rendered them obnoxious to the wrath
   of God. (iii.) All who are born in the ordinary way from Adam, contract
   from him original sin and the penalty of death eternal. Our opinion
   lays this down as the foundation of further explanation; for this
   original sin is called, in Romans 7, "the sin," "the sin exceedingly
   sinful," "the indwelling sin," "the sin which is adjacent to a man, or
   present with him," or "the evil which is present with a man and" the
   law in the members." (iv.) Our opinion openly declares that
   concupiscence, under which is also comprehended lust, is an evil. (v.)
   The fifth of the enumerated Pelagian dogmas is professedly refuted by
   our opinion; for, in Romans 7, the apostle teaches, according to our
   opinion, that the natural man cannot will what is good, except he be
   under the law, and unless the legal spirit have produced this willing
   in him by the law; and though he wills what is good, yet it is by no
   means through free will, even though it be impelled and assisted by the
   law to be capable of performing that very thing. But it also teaches
   that the grace of Christ, that is, the gift of the Holy Spirit and of
   love, is absolutely necessary for this purpose, which grace is not
   bestowed according to merits, (which are nothing at all,) but is purely
   gratuitous. (vi.) The sixth of the enumerated dogmas of Pelagius is
   neither taught nor refuted by our opinion, because it maintain, that
   Romans 7 does not treat about the regenerate. But, in the mean time,
   the patrons and advocates of our opinion do not deny that what is said
   respecting the imperfection of believers in the present life, is true.
   (vii.) The seventh of the enumerated dogmas of Pelagius is refuted by
   our opinion; for it not only grants, that good can with difficulty be
   done by the man who is under the law, and who is not yet placed under
   grace; but it also unreservedly denies that it is possible for such a
   man by any means to resist sin and to perform what is good. 3. But some
   one will perhaps rejoin, and say "Your interpretation of this chapter
   is favourable to Pelagianism, on two accounts. First, because it
   attributes something of good to a man who is not yet regenerated and
   placed under grace. Secondly, because it takes away from the church a
   passage of Scripture, by which she is accustomed to prove the
   imperfection of the regenerate in the present life, and the conflict
   which is maintained between the flesh and the Spirit as long as man
   lives upon earth." With regard to the First of these objections, I
   reply that we must see, First, what kind of good it is that our
   interpretation attributes to a man who is unregenerate. For, it is
   certain that every good, of what kind soever it may be, must not be
   entirely taken away from an unregenerate man and one who is not yet
   placed under grace; because the knowledge of the truth, (Rom. i.
   18,19,) the work of the law written in his heart, his thoughts accusing
   or else excusing one another, the discernment of what is just and
   unjust, (ii, 15,18,) the knowledge of sin, grief on account of sin,
   anxiety of conscience, desire of deliverance, &c., (vii, 7,9,13,24) are
   all good things, and yet they are attributed to a man who is
   unregenerate. Secondly. We must know that this, our opinion, which
   explains Romans 7 as relating to a man under the law, does not bring
   forth these good things from the storehouse of nature, but it deduces
   them from the operation of the Spirit, who employs the preaching of the
   law and blesses it. Thirdly. We must also consider that this was not a
   subject of controversy between the church and the Pelagians: "May
   something of good be attributed to an unregenerate man who is not yet
   under grace, but who is placed under the law; or may it not?" But the
   question between them was "Can something of good be attributed to man,
   without grace and its operation?" He who receives some operation of
   grace is not instantly under grace or regenerate; for grace prepares
   the will of man for itself, that it may dwell in it. Grace knocks at
   the door of our hearts; but that which has occasion to knock does not
   yet reside in the heart nor has it the dominion, though it may knock so
   as to cause the door to be opened to it on account of its persuasion.
   But we have frequently treated on topics similar to this in the first
   part of this our treatise. 4. With respect to the Second of these
   objections, I reply, First. This passage of Holy Writ was not produced
   by the church, in her earliest days, for establishing the imperfection
   of the regenerate in this life, and the conflict between the flesh and
   the Spirit such as that which is maintained in regenerate persons; for
   we have already shown that the most ancient of the Christian fathers
   did not explain Romans 7 in reference to the regenerate, or those who
   are placed under grace; though it subsequently began to be employed, by
   some divines, to establish this dogma. Secondly. It is inconsequent
   argumentation to say that "the opinion by which some passage is
   otherwise explained than it is by the many, nay which has been quoted
   by the church herself to destroy some heresy, is therefore or can be
   judged to be allied to heresy, because it takes away from the church a
   passage which has been usually employed to prove a true doctrine, and
   to refute a heresy." For if this be not inconsequent reasoning, there
   will scarcely be one of our divines who will not thus be deservedly
   judged to be allied to some heresy or other, and sometimes indeed to a
   very enormous one. By such a law [of criticism] as this, Calvin is
   called "an Aryan" by the Lutherans, because he openly avows in his
   writings, that "many passages of Scripture, which have been adduced by
   the ancient church (both Greek and Latin) to establish the doctrine of
   the trinity, do not contribute in the least to that purpose," and
   because he gives to them such a different interpretation. Thirdly. No
   detriment will accrue to the church by the removal of this passage,
   from the support of the imperfection of the regenerate in this life as
   she is furnished with a number (which is sufficiently copious) of other
   passages to prove the same doctrine, and to weaken the contrary one.
   This is abundantly demonstrated by St. Augustine, when be professedly
   treats upon, the Perfection of Righteousness in this life in opposition
   to Coelestius. Fourthly. We must well and carefully examine by what
   passages of Scripture, and by what arguments, the truth may be proved,
   and falsehood refuted, lest, if weak and less valid, and in some degree
   doubtful, passages and arguments be adduced, the hopes of heretics
   should be elevated, after they have demolished such weak bulwarks as
   those, and they should suppose it possible to disprove and confute the
   remaining [more suitable and valid] arguments on the same subject. For
   that man inflicts no slight injury on the truth who props it up by weak
   arguments; and the rules of art teach us, that a necessary conclusion
   must be verified or proved by necessary arguments; for the conclusion,
   follows that part [of a syllogism] which is the weakest. But it has
   been already shown, that this portion of Scripture has not been devoid
   of controversy even among the catholic commentators on the Holy
   Scriptures. Fifthly,. In what manner soever this chapter, as thus
   explained according to my mind, may not be able to serve the church to
   prove the imperfection of the regenerate in the present life, yet it
   serves her for the confirmation of another doctrine, and one of a far
   greater importance, against the Pelagians--that is, the necessity of
   the grace of Christ. and the incapability of the law to conquer or to
   avoid sin, and to order or direct the life of a man according to its
   rule. 5. But we may discover, from various passages in the writings of
   St. Augustine, the vast difference which the ancient church put between
   the necessity of the former of the two questions or doctrines,
   [specified in the preceding paragraph,] and the latter. For instance:
   But in that which Pelagius argues against those who say, "And who would
   be unwilling to be without sin, if this were placed in the power of
   man?" he in fact disputes correctly, that by this very question they
   own that it is not impossible, because either many persons or all men
   wish to be without sin. But let Pelagius only confess [from what source
   this is possible, and peace is instantly established. For the origin of
   it is the grace of God through Jesus Christ, &c. (On Nature and Grace,
   against the Pelagians, cap. 59.) There may be some question among real
   and pious Christians, whether there has ever been in this world, is
   now, or can possibly be, any man who lives so righteously as to have no
   sin whatsoever. Yet he is assuredly void of understanding who
   entertains any doubt whether it is possible for a man to be without sin
   after this life. But I do not wish to enter into a contest about this
   question. Though it seems to me that in no other sense can be
   understood what is written in the Psalms, and in similar passages, if
   any such there be: "In thy sight shall No man living be justified;"
   (cxliii, 2) yet it may be shown that even these expressions may be
   better understood in another sense, and that even perfect and complete
   righteousness, to which there may be no addition, was yesterday in an
   individual, while he lived in the body, is in him to-day, and will be
   in him to-morrow while there are still far more persons, who, while
   they do not doubt that it is necessary for them truly to say, even to
   the last day of [their continuance in] this life, "Forgive us our
   trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us," yet are
   firmly persuaded that their hope in Christ and in his promises is real,
   certain and firm, yet in no way except by the aid of the grace, of the
   saviour, Christ the crucified, and by the gift of his Spirit. I do not
   know whether that man can be correctly reckoned in the number of
   Christians of any description, who denies either that any persons
   attain to the most complete perfection, or that some arrive at any
   degree whatever of proficiency in true piety and righteousness. (Ibid.
   cap. 60.) Besides, though I am more inclined to believe that there is
   not now, has not been, and will not be, any one who is perfect with
   such a purity as this; and yet when it is defended and supposed, that
   there is, has been, or will be such a perfect man, as far as I am able
   to form a judgment, they who hold this opinion do not greatly or
   perniciously err, &c. But those persons are most strenuously and
   vehemently to be resisted, who suppose it possible either to fulfill or
   to perfect the righteousness of the human will, by its own power,
   without the aid of God, or by aiming at it to make some proficiency.
   (On the Spirit and the Letter, cap. 2.) Consult likewise his treatise
   On Nature and Grace, cap. 42, 43, 58, & 63; in which he briefly
   says--"It is no question at all, or not a great one, what man is
   perfected, or the time. when he becomes so, as long as no doubt is
   entertained that it is impossible for this to be done without the grace
   of Christ." See also his treatise On the Demerit and Remission of Sin,
   lib. 2, cap. 6,14; and lib. 3, cap. 13. 6. But in order that we may
   know this to have been the opinion not only of St. Augustine, but also
   of the church universal, let us listen to the bishops assembled
   together in the Council of Carthage, who write in the following manner
   to Pope Innocent: "But in what manner soever this question turns
   itself, because though a man is not found in this life without sin, yet
   it may be said to be possible by the adoption of grace and of the
   Spirit of God; and that [such perfection] may be attained we must urge
   most importunate intreaties and use our best endeavours. Whosoever is
   deceived on this point, ought to be tolerated. It is not a diabolical
   impiety, but it is a human error, to affirm that it must be MOST
   diligently pursued and desired, though it cannot shew that which it
   affirms; for it believes it possible for that to be done which it is
   undoubtedly laudable to will." We perceive, therefore, that Romans 7,
   when explained according to my mind, is serviceable to the church in
   establishing a doctrine of far greater importance than that which is
   declared from the other opinion. "But," some one will say, "it is
   possible to establish both these doctrines, [the imperfection and the
   perfection of the regenerate,] From that opinion which explains the
   chapter as relating to a man who is under grace." I reply, granting
   this, yet I deny that it is possible to establish both in a direct
   manner; for, one doctrine, that of the imperfection of the regenerate
   in this life, will be directly proved from this passage, and the other
   will be deduced from it by consequence. But it is a matter of much
   importance, whether a doctrine be confirmed by a passage of Scripture
   properly explained and according to the intention of the Scriptures, or
   whether it be deduced from them by the deduction of a consequence. For
   some passages of Scripture are like certain seats, out of which
   controversies ought to be determined; and those which are of this kind
   are usually employed in a very stable and safe manner for the decision
   of controversies. II.
     __________________________________________________________________

  OUR OPINION IS DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO THE PELAGIAN HERESY

   THE Second thing contained in this third part is an affirmation, that
   our interpretation of Romans 7 is professedly adverse to the Pelagian
   heresy. 2. This is proved from the fact, that the principal dogma of
   that heresy is professedly confuted through this very interpretation.
   3. In some passages of his works, which are here cited, St. Augustine
   confesses with sufficient plainness that this is true. 4.Objection and
   an Answer to it. 5. Another Objection--that Prosper Dysidaeus, the
   Samosatenian, explains this chapter in the same manner. Answer--no
   heretic is in error on every point. The Jesuits, those myrmidons of the
   pope, explain this chapter as referring to a man placed under grace. 6.
   A third objection--that his interpretation differs from the confessions
   of the reformed churches, which have been framed and established by the
   blood of martyrs. Answer--no article of any confession is contrary to
   this interpretation: No man ever shed his blood for the contrary
   interpretation. Numbers of martyrs were not even interrogated about
   this article on the perfection of righteousness. 1. I now come to the
   second part of the thesis, in which I said, that this chapter, when
   explained as referring to a man who is under the law, is directly and
   professedly contrary to the Pelagian heresy. Though I have already
   proved this in part, on the occasion of replying to the preceding
   objection, yet I will now at somewhat greater length teach and confirm
   it. 2. We have just seen that the article of the Pelagian heresy which
   is by no means either the last or the least, is that in which it is
   asserted that a man is able through his own free will, as being of
   itself sufficient for him, to fulfill the precept of God, if he be only
   instructed in the doctrine of the law, so as to be capable of knowing
   what he ought to perform and what to omit. It appears that this dogma
   is not only firmly refuted, but that it is also plucked up as if by the
   roots and extirpated, according to the very design and purpose of the
   apostle, by means of this chapter, when it is understood as referring
   to a man under the law. This is apparent from the opposition of the
   dogma to the context of the apostle. The former says, "Man, instructed
   by the teaching of the law, is capable, by the powers of his free will
   alone, to overcome sin and to obey the law of God." But the apostle
   declares that this cannot be effected by the powers of free will and of
   the law. he says, "sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not
   under the law, but under grace," (Rom. vi. 14,) from which it is
   manifest that, if they were under the law, sin would have the dominion
   over them--a consequence upon which he treats more copiously in the
   seventh chapter. Pelagius says, "Man is able, without the grace of
   Christ, and instructed solely by the teaching of the law, to perform
   the good which he wills, through his free will, and to omit the evil
   which he does not will;" but the apostle declares that this man
   "consents indeed to the law that it is good, but that to perform what
   is good he finds not in himself; he omits the good which he wills, and
   he performs the evil which he wills not." Therefore, the doctrine of
   the apostle is, independently of its consequence, directly repugnant to
   the Pelagian dogma, and this, indeed, from the scope and end which the
   apostle had, in the same chapter, proposed to himself. But, from
   passages of this description, heresies are far more powerfully
   convicted and destroyed, than they are from passages accommodated to
   their refutation beyond the scope and intention of the writer, though
   this also be done according to the correct meaning of the same
   passages. 3. St. Augustine himself confesses that, when this chapter is
   explained in reference to a man under the law, it is adverse to the
   Pelagian heresy: "But," says Pelagius, "why should I thus exclaim, who
   am now baptized in Christ? Let them make such an exclamation who have
   not yet perceived such a benefit, and whose expressions the apostle
   transferred to himself, if indeed this is said by them? But this
   defense of nature does not permit them to cry out with this voice. For
   nature does not exist in those who are baptized; and, in those who are
   not baptized, nature has no existence. Or, if nature is granted to be
   vitiated even in baptized persons, so that they exclaim, not without
   sufficient reason--O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from
   the body of this death? -- and if succour is afforded to them in that
   which immediately follows, The Grace of God through Jesus Christ our
   Lord, let it now at length be granted, that human nature requires the
   aid of a physician. (On Nature and Grace, cap. 54.) From these remarks
   it is apparent, according to the mind of St. Augustine, that this
   passage, even when it is understood in reference to a natural man, is
   destructive to that dogma of Pelagius, in which he asserts that the
   natural man is able, by the powers of nature, to perform the law of
   God. Thus also in a passage upon which we have already made some
   observations from his Retractations, lib. I, cap. 23, St. Augustine
   openly affirms that this chapter, when explained as relating to a man
   under the law, confutes the Pelagian heresy. These are his words: "By
   this, indeed, is now overturned the Pelagian heresy, that will not
   admit that the love, by which we live good and pious lives, is from God
   to us, but that asserts it to be from ourselves." Besides, if we can
   obtain from them even this admission, that those who are not yet
   baptized implore the aid of the saviour's grace, this will indeed be no
   small matter against that false defense of nature, as being sufficient
   for itself, and of the power of free will. For he is not sufficient for
   himself who says, O wretched man that l am! who shall deliver me? or
   else he must be said to possess full liberty, who still requires to be
   liberated. (On nature and Grace, cap. 55.) But at this point, on
   account of which we have undertaken the consideration of these things,
   the apostle begins to introduce his own person, and to speak as if
   concerning himself. In this passage the Pelagians are unwilling that
   the apostle himself should be understood, but assert that he has
   transferred to himself another man who is yet placed under the law, and
   not delivered through grace, in which passage they ought indeed to
   concede "that by the law no man is justified." as the same apostle has
   declared in another part of his writings, but that the law is of force
   for the knowledge of sin and the transgression of the law itself; that,
   after sin has been known and increased, grace may be required through
   faith. (Against the two Epistles of the Pelagians to Boniface, lib. I,
   cap. 8) 4. "But," some man will say, "the Pelagians have interpreted
   that chapter as applicable to a man who is unregenerate, not without
   good reason. They undoubtedly knew that such an interpretation was
   peculiarly favourable to their sentiments which they defended against
   the church." To this I reply, First. It has already been shown, both in
   reality, and by the testimony of St. Augustine, that this chapter, even
   when understood as applicable to a man under the law, and not yet
   regenerate, is adverse to the Pelagian doctrine. Secondly. It may have
   happened that the Pelagians supposed the chapter might be explained in
   reference to a man placed under the law, and not under grace, without
   any consideration of the controversy in which they were engaged with
   the orthodox. Thirdly. It cannot favour the sentiments of the
   Pelagians, that the apostle is said in this chapter to be treating
   about a man under the law; but this might be favourable, that they
   adduced such a description of a man who is under the law, as they knew
   was accommodated to strengthen their sentiments. For they said that "a
   man under this law is he who, by the power and instinct of nature,
   (which was not corrupted in Adam,) is able to will that which is good,
   and not to will what is evil; but who, through a depraved habit, was so
   bound to the service of sin, as in reality, and actually he was not
   able to perform the good which he would," &c. This false description of
   the man might also be met, not by denying that the subject of this
   chapter is a man under the law, but by refuting that description. For
   heretics are not heretical on all subjects and in every point; and it
   is their usual practice to intermix true things with those which are
   false, and frequently on true foundations to erect a superstructure of
   falsehoods--I repeat it, on true foundations, which, by some artifice,
   or by manifest violence are perverted to the support of falsehoods. 5.
   It is objected, besides, "It is impossible for this opinion not to be
   heretical or allied to heresy, when we see one Prosper Dysidaeus. a
   Samosatenian, who is deeply polluted by a multitude of heresies,
   interpreting Romans 7 in reference to a man who is not yet under grace,
   but under the law, which he undoubtedly would not have done, had he not
   understood that through it he had a mighty support for his own
   heresies." REPLY.--This objection is truly ridiculous--as if he who is
   a heretic ought to err in all things, and can speak nothing that is
   true, or if he does utter any truth, the whole of it must be referred
   to the confirmation of his heresy. Even the very worst of heretics
   have, in some articles, held the same sentiments as those of the
   church. It is a well known fact that the ancient heretics endeavoured,
   and indeed were accustomed, to interpret many passages of Scripture
   against the orthodox, in such a way as they could not injure their
   several heresies. Yet these very passages are, even at the present
   time, explained by our theologians against the sense of the ancient
   orthodox, and in accordance with the interpretation of those heretics.
   But such persons are not, on this account, to be denominated "the
   favourers of heresies." But I am desirous to have it demonstrated to me
   what affinity my explanation of Romans 7 has with Aryanism or
   Samosatenianism. If the same person, who is either an Aryan or a
   Samosatenian, is likewise earnest about the perfection of righteousness
   in this life, he will deny that this chapter ought to he understood as
   relating to the regenerate, not as he is either a Samosatenian or an
   Aryan, but as he is a Pelagian or a follower of Celestius. If it be
   allowable to reason in this manner, then the opinion which explains
   this chapter as referring to a man under grace, will itself labour
   under great prejudices, from the fact that it is generally so
   interpreted by the Jesuits, and by their leaders, who are the sworn
   enemies of the church of Christ, and of the truth, and, at the same
   time, the most able retainers of the popish church, that is, of a
   church which is idolatrous, tyrannical, and most polluted with
   innumerable heresies. Away, then, with such a mode of argumentation as
   this, about the explanation of any portion of Scripture! Let it never
   proceed from the mind or the lips of those persons who, with a good
   conscience, have undertaken the defense of the truth. Who does not
   perceive that arguments of this kind are employed for the purpose of
   abashing and unsettling the minds of ignorant and inexperienced
   hearers; that, being blinded by a certain fear and stupor, they may not
   be able to form a judgment on the truth, nay, that they may not dare to
   touch the matter under controversy, through a vain fear of heresy! Such
   artifices as these are notorious; and all men of learning and
   moderation are aware of them. Nor are they capable of proving injurious
   to any persons except to the unlearned and the simple, or to those who
   have spontaneously determined to wander into error. For we have shewn
   that this chapter has been understood in the same sense as we interpret
   it, by many doctors of the church, who declared and proved themselves
   to be the most eminent adversaries of Aryanism, Samosatenianism, and
   other heresies, and the most strenuous defendants of the true doctrine
   concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Gracious Lord!
   What a wide and ample plain is here opened for those persons who feel a
   pleasure in thrusting out the most able and efficient assertors of
   catholic doctrine into the camp of heretics, under this pretext, that
   they Interpret certain passages of Scripture which have been usually
   adduced for the refutation of heresy, in such a manner as not to enable
   other persons to attack heresies with those passages so interpreted. 6.
   Lastly. This, my explanation is burdened with another objection--that
   "it differs from the confessions of all the reformed churches in
   Europe, for the establishment of which such a multitude of martyrs have
   shed their blood." This argument likewise, I assert, is employed, not
   for teaching the truth, but to inflame and blind the minds of those who
   listen to it, through the indignation which they conceive. For I deny
   that--in any confession, whether that of the French, the Dutch, the
   Swiss, the Savoy, the English, the Scotch, the Bohemian, or the
   Lutheran churches, or of any other--there is extant a single article
   that is contrary to this interpretation, or that is in the least
   weakened by this interpretation of Romans 7. It may, indeed, possibly
   have happened that some portion of this chapter has been used in some
   confession for the establishment of a doctrine which cannot be
   confirmed from it, unless it be explained as relating to a regenerate
   man who is under grace. But how does this circumstance militate against
   him who approves of the very same doctrine, and defends it in an
   earnest and accurate manner, by adducing several other passages of
   Scripture in its support, Such a man affirms this alone--that the true
   doctrine, in whose defense it has been cited, is not sufficiently well
   defended by this passage of holy writ. And what man ever shed his
   blood, or was compelled to shed it, because he was of opinion that this
   chapter ought to be explained in reference to a regenerate man, and not
   to a man who is under the law? I speak with freedom, and frankly
   declare that, while I am listening to such reasons, I am scarcely able
   to govern and restrain myself from openly crying out, through grief,
   that God would have mercy on those who teach these things, and would
   put within them a good mind and a sincere conscience, lest, while
   rushing headlong against conscience, they at length receive due
   punishment for the demerit of malignant ignorance, or that he would be
   pleased to hinder their attempts, or at least, that he would render
   them abortive, lest they should injure the truth which has been
   divinely manifested, and the church of Christ! For I cannot put any
   milder construction on such expressions, when they proceed from men
   that are endued with knowledge and understanding. All those matters
   contained in confessions are not equally necessary. All the particulars
   in any confession are not confirmed by the blood of those who are
   dragged away to the stake not for the whole of that confession, but on
   account of some part of it. And we know that many thousands of martyrs
   have sealed the truth of the gospel with their blood, who were never
   questioned respecting this article of the perfection or imperfection of
   righteousness, and who never expended any thoughts upon it. I refer now
   to this question: "Are those who, through Christ, are justified and
   sanctified, able in this life to fulfill the law of God without any
   defect, through the assistance of Christ and the Spirit of grace?" For
   all Christians are well assured, that, without the grace of Christ,
   they are not able to do any good whatsoever. Wherefore, the use of this
   kind of argument must be laid aside by those who are good and
   conscientious inquirers after the truth, and who endeavour to preserve
   her when she is discovered.
     __________________________________________________________________

FOURTH PART

  THE OPPOSITE OPINION IS APPROVED BY NONE OF THE ANCIENT DOCTORS OF THE CHURCH

   THE ancients who have interpreted this chapter as relating to a man
   under grace, and the moderns who give it a similar interpretation,
   differ very materially from each other; because, by the good which the
   apostle says he wills and does not, and by the evil which he says he
   wills not and does, the ancients understand only the not-indulging in
   concupiscence, and the indulging in it; while the moderns understand
   GOOD and EVIL actually performed. 2. That such was the opinion of the
   ancients is proved by citations from Epiphanius, Augustine, Bede, and
   Thomas Aquinas. 3. The difference between these two diverse
   explanations of good and evil is so great, in the judgment of the
   ancients, that, according to both explanations, they cannot agree with
   a regenerate man. This is proved by citations from Augustine, Bede,
   Thomas Aquinas, and Hugh the cardinal. Thesis.--The meaning which the
   greater part of our modern divines ascribe to the apostle in this
   chapter, is not approved by any of the ancient doctors of the church,
   not even by Augustine himself; but by many of them, it was repudiated
   and rejected. In this thesis, I do not assert that none of the ancient
   doctors has interpreted this chapter as relating to a man who is
   regenerate and placed under grace; for I have already confessed that
   St. Augustine and some others give it that interpretation. But I affirm
   that the interpretation of our divines differs from the explanation of
   those ancients in a point of great moment; and so great is this
   difference, that, except by a forced construction and a meaning
   contrary to the mind of those old authors themselves, the moderns are
   unable to confirm their opinion on this subject by the authority of the
   ancients. This will, I think, be proved with sufficient accuracy, if it
   be shewn that those things which the apostle attributes to this man,
   are received by our divines in a widely different acceptation from that
   in which they were understood by those among the ancients who explained
   the chapter as relating to a man under grace. Indeed the moderns
   receive it in a sense so far different and dissenting from this
   explanation of some of the ancients, that these very ancients have
   entertained the opinion that these attributes, when received according
   to their modern construction by our divines, do not agree with a man
   who is regenerate and under grace, but with one who is placed under the
   law. The truth of this affirmation I will now proceed to point out in
   the following manner: That Good which the apostle says he indeed wills
   but does not, and that EVIL which, he says, he wills not and yet does,
   are interpreted by most of our divines as referring to ACTUAL GOOD AND
   EVIL. And they explain the evil by that very deed which is committed,
   with the consent of the will, through the lusting of the flesh against
   the lusting of the Spirit; in like manner, they explain the GOOD by
   that very deed which a man indeed lusts or desires to do according to
   the Spirit, but which he does not actually perform, being hindered by
   the lusting of the flesh. let the commentaries of our divines be
   examined, and it will at once be evident that this is their
   interpretation of the chapter; and this is openly declared by those
   who, on this subject, are opposed to me in opinion. But when St.
   Augustine, and all those ancients whom I have had an opportunity of
   perusing, interpret this chapter as referring to a man who is
   regenerate and placed under grace, they assert that the evil which the
   apostle says he would not, but did, is to lust or desire; but they
   interpret the GOOD which he says he would, but did not, by not lusting
   or coveting; yet they make a distinction between these two--lusting and
   going after their lusts--and not lusting and not going after their
   lusts. In a manner nearly similar, the apostle St., James denotes this
   difference in his epistle, i, 14, xv, "But every man is tempted, when
   he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath
   conceived, it bringeth forth sin," that is, actual sin; "and sin, when
   it is finished, bringeth forth death." That this was the meaning of the
   ancients, is proved by 1. EPIPHANIUS For, that which is said, "What I
   do I allow not, but what I hate that I do," must not be received
   concerning that evil which we have performed and completed, but
   concerning that about which we have only thought. (Heresy 64th, against
   Origen, lib. 2, tom. 2.) Otherwise, how should the apostle have indeed
   chiefly done the evil which displeased him, but not the good which was
   pleasing, if he had not spoken about extraneous thoughts, which we have
   occasionally thought, and not willing them, not knowing from what cause
   they arise? (Ibid.) For this good is perfect, not only to abstain from
   doing, but likewise from thinking; and the good is not done which we
   will, but the evil which we will not. (Ibid.) Wherefore, this is placed
   within us: to will, that we will not think about these things. Yet this
   is not placed within us: to gain our end, that they be dispersed so as
   not to return again to our minds, but only that we may in some degree
   use them, or not use them--as is the sentiment in the subsequent
   passage: "For the good that I would I do not;" for I will not to think
   on those things which hurt me, because this is a good and immaculate
   employment, and devoid of reprehension, according to the common saying,
   [in reference to another affair.] "a square may be formed either in the
   mind, or by the hands, without any blame." Therefore, "the good that I
   would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do;" I will not
   to think, and yet I think on those things which I will not.(Ibid.) In a
   subsequent passage, when refuting those who interpreted this passage as
   descriptive of the deeds performed by the apostle himself, his words
   are: But now, if any venture to dispute these words by objecting, "The
   apostle teaches us this, by these words--For the good that I would, I
   do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do that they are to be
   referred not only to our thinking evil in our minds from which we are
   averse and which we avoid, but likewise to our actually doing and
   performing evil," we therefore request the man who reasons thus, if
   what he says be correct, to explain to us what that evil was which,
   though the apostle hated and nilled to do, yet he did it. Or, on the
   contrary, let him inform us what good that was which he willed greatly
   to perform, but which he was not able to do, &c. (Ibid.) Consult the
   remaining portion of this passage. 2. AUGUSTINE And it follows, "I find
   then a law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me;" that
   is, I find a law to be within me when I will to do the good which the
   law wills; because "evil is present," not with the law itself which
   says, "Thou shalt not covet" or lust, but "evil is present with me,"
   because I likewise unwillingly lust. (On Marriage and Concupiscence,
   cap. 30, ten,. 7.) To "the body of this death," therefore, is
   understood to belong, that "another law in the members wages war indeed
   against the law of the mind;" while the flesh lusteth against the
   Spirit, although it does not subjugate the mind, because the Spirit
   also lusteth against the flesh; and thus, though the law of sin itself
   holds some part of the flesh in captivity, by which it may resist the
   law of the mind, yet it does not reign in our body, though it be
   mortal, if we do not obey it in the lusts thereof (Ibid. cap. 31. ) But
   the apostle subjoins this expression: "So, then, with the mind I myself
   serve the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin," which must
   be understood in this manner: "With my mind I serve the law of God, by
   not consenting to the law of sin; but with the flesh, I serve the law
   of sin by having desires of sin, to which, though I do not yield my
   consent, yet I am not totally free from them." (Ibid.) Or perhaps we
   are afraid of those words which follow: "For that which I do, I allow
   not; for what I would that do I not; but what I hate, that do 1." Are
   we afraid that, from these words, any one should suspect the apostle of
   consenting to the concupiscence of the flesh to evil works, But we must
   take into our consideration that which the apostle immediately
   subjoins: "If, then, I do that which I would not, I consent unto the
   law that it is good." For he here says that he consents to the law more
   than to the concupiscence of the flesh because he bestows on this
   latter the appellation of "sin." Therefore, he said that he does and
   performs not with an inclination of consenting and fulfilling, but with
   the very motion of lusting or coveting. Hence, therefore, he says, "I
   consent to the law that it is good." "I consent," because I will what
   it does not will. He afterwards says, "Now it is no more I that do it,
   but sin that dwelleth in me." What does this mean--"Now then,"--except
   that he is now under grace, which has delivered the delighting of the
   will from consenting with lust, Neither is the other part of the clause
   any better understood: "It is no more I that do it," than that he does
   not now consent to "yield his members as instruments of unrighteousness
   to sin." For if he both lusts, and consents, and performs, how is it
   "no more he that does it," though he is grieved at his doing it, and
   grievously groans on account of having been conquered? (Against the two
   Epistles of the Pelagians, cap. 10.) For this is "to perform that which
   is good," that a man do not indulge in concupiscence or lust. But this
   good is imperfect when the man lusts, though he does not consent to
   concupiscence for evil. (Ibid.) And from these things he afterwards
   concludes--"So, then, with the mind, I myself serve the law of God, but
   with the flesh, the law of sin," that is, "with the flesh, the law of
   sin" by indulging in concupiscence, "but with the mind, the law of God"
   by not consenting to such concupiscence. (Ibid.) He does not say, how
   to do or to perform, but "how to fulfill or complete that which is
   good;" because to perform or to do what is good, is, not to go after
   lusts; but to fulfill or to perfect what is good, is not to lust or to
   indulge in concupiscence. That, therefore, which is said to the
   Galatians, (v, 16,) "ye shall not fulfill or perfect the lusts of the
   flesh," is said about a contrary object in this passage of the epistle
   to the Romans--"but how to fulfill or perfect that which is good, I
   find not." Because those lusts are not perfected or fulfilled in evil,
   when the assent of our will is not added to them; nor is our will
   perfected or fulfilled in good, so long as the motion of those lusts
   continues, though we do not consent to such motion. But this conflict,
   in which even those who are baptized struggle as in an agony, when "the
   flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh," in
   which the Spirit also does or performs a good work, by not consenting
   to evil concupiscence; but it does not fulfill or perfect such work,
   because it does not consume or remove those evil desires or lusts. The
   flesh, likewise, does or performs an evil desire; but it does not
   fulfill or perfect it, because, the Spirit not consenting to it, the
   flesh also does not come so far as to the condemned works. This
   conflict, therefore, is not that of the Jews nor of any other
   description of men whatsoever, but it is evidently that of Christian
   believers, and of those who live good lives and labour hard in this
   contest, as is briefly shewn by the apostle, in Romans vii. 25, where
   he says, "then, with the mind, I myself serve the law of God; but with
   the flesh the law of sin." (Against Julian the Pelagian, lib. I, cap.
   26.) Be unwilling, therefore, to do that which you are not willing to
   suffer; and do not say, that we allure you to sweet deeds, about which
   we cite the apostle as thus declaring himself: "For I know that in me,
   (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing." For, though "they do
   not perfect or fulfill the good which they would" in not indulging in
   concupiscence; yet they do or perform good, in not going after their
   lusts. (Ibid. lib. 5, cap. 5.) Be it far from us, therefore, to assert
   what you pretend, that we affirm that, "the apostle spake these words
   as though he was desirous to be understood by them, that he was in the
   act of fornication, struggling hard against it, whilst he was led away
   by some hand of a pestiferous voluptuousness," when the apostle himself
   says, It is no more I that do it; thus shewing that the lusts of the
   flesh did work only a libidinous impulse without a consent to the sin.
   (Ibid. lib. 6. cap 11.) He likewise refrains himself from every evil
   thing, who has sin which he does not suffer to reign within him, and
   into whom secretly creeps a reprehensible thought which he does not
   permit to arrive at the end [intended] of a deed or performance. But it
   is one thing not to have sin, and it is another not to obey its desires
   or lusts. it is one thing to fulfill that which is commanded, "Thou
   shalt not covet or lust," and it is another at least, by a certain
   attempt at abstinence, to do that which is also written: "Thou shalt
   not go after thy lusts." Yet it is impossible for us to know any of
   these things correctly, without the grace of the saviour. To do or
   perform righteousness, therefore, in the true worship of God, is to
   fight by an internal conflict against the inward evil of concupiscence,
   and not at all to have, to perfect, or fulfill that which is its
   opposite. For he who fights, is still not only in great peril, but is
   also sometimes smitten, though he is not utterly cast down. But he who
   has no adversary, rejoices in full peace and tranquillity. He also is
   most truly said to be without sin, in whom no sin dwells, but not he,
   who, through abstaining from an evil work, says, "It is no more I that
   do it, but sin that dwelleth in me." (On Nature and Grace, cap. 62.)
   Therefore, the apostle "does that which he would not," because he wills
   not to lust or indulge in concupiscence, and yet he lusts; therefore,
   "he does that which he would not." Did that evil concupiscence draw the
   apostle into subjection to concupiscence to commit fornication? Far
   from it. Let not such a thought as this arise in our hearts. He
   struggled hard, and was not subdued. But because he was unwilling also
   to have this against which he was struggling, therefore, he said, "I do
   that which I would not;" I am unwilling to indulge in concupiscence,
   and yet I lust. Therefore, "I do that which I would not," but yet I no
   not consent to concupiscence. For otherwise he would not have said, "Ye
   shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh," if he himself fulfilled
   them. (On Time, Sermon 55, tom. 10.) How do I perform that which is
   good, and not perfect what is good, I do or perform good, when I do not
   consent to evil concupiscence; but I do not perfect or fulfill what is
   good, in not entirely refraining from concupiscence. Again, therefore,
   how does my enemy perform that which is evil, and not perfect what is
   evil? He does or performs evil, because he moves an evil desire; and he
   does not perfect what is evil, because he does not draw me to
   evil.(Ibid.) "With the mind, I myself serve the law of God," by not
   consenting, "but with the flesh, the law of sin," by not indulging in
   concupiscence. (Ibid.) Hence, also this expression, "I do that which I
   would not;" "for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit" and I am
   unwilling that it should lust. I account it a great matter if I do not
   consent, for I wish to abstain from it; therefore, "I do that which I
   would not." For I will that the flesh lust not against the Spirit, and
   I am unable; this is what I have said, "I do that which I would not."
   (Sermon 13th, on the Words of the Apostle.) If, therefore, "the flesh
   lusteth against the Spirit," that in this very thing you do not what
   you would, because you will not to indulge in concupiscence and are not
   able, [to refrain from such indulgence,] at least hold thy will in the
   grace of the Lord, and persevere by its assistance. Repeat before him
   that which you have sung, "Direct my steps according to thy word; and
   let not any iniquity have dominion over me." (Psalm cxix. 133.) What is
   this, "Let not any iniquity have dominion over me"? Listen to the
   apostle: "Let not sin reign in your mortal body." What is this
   reigning, "By obeying it in the lusts thereof." He has not said, Do not
   have evil desires. For how have I not evil desires "in this mortal
   body," in which "the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit
   against the flesh"? This thing, therefore, "Let not sin reign," &c.
   (Ibid.) 3. VENERABLE BEDE But if it be himself, (that is, the apostle,)
   let us not so understand that which he has said: "What I would, that do
   I not, but what I hate, that I do;" as if he willed to be chaste and
   yet was an adulterer, or willed to be merciful and was cruel, or willed
   to be pious and was impious. But what are we to understand, I will not
   to indulge in concupiscence, and yet I do indulge in it. (On Romans 7.)
   Though I do not consent to concupiscence, and though I do not go after
   my lusts, yet I still indulge in concupiscence. (Ibid.) What is it that
   I hate? To indulge in concupiscence: I hate to indulge in
   concupiscence, and yet I do so from my flesh and not from my mind.
   (Ibid.) But that which I do, is to indulge in concupiscence, not to
   consent to it; that no one may now seek in the apostle an example for
   himself of sinning, and afford a bad example. "What I would, that do I
   not." For what says the law? "Thou shalt not lust or covet." And I
   would not lust, and yet I do lust, although I do not yield up my
   consent to concupiscence, and though I do not go after it. For I offer
   resistance, I turn away my mind, I give a denial to the instruments, I
   repress my members; and yet that is done within me which I will not.
   That which the law likewise wills not, I nill with the law. What it
   would not, that I would not. Therefore, "I consent to the law." I am in
   the flesh, I am in the mind; but I am more in the mind than in the
   flesh. Because, when I am in the mind, I am in that which governs; for
   the mind governs; the flesh is governed. And I am more in that by which
   I rule or govern, than in that by which I am governed. Therefore, I
   rule more in the mind. (Ibid.) 4. THOMAS AQUINAS To will is present
   with me, that is, to me who am now recovered by grace. It is through
   the operation of divine grace, by which indeed I not only will that
   which is good, but I also perform something that is good, because I
   offer resistance to concupiscence, and under the guidance of the
   Spirit, I act against it. But I do not find in my power the manner in
   which I may perform that which is good, that is, in order entirely to
   exclude concupiscence. (On Romans 7.) 3. But these two explanations of
   those attributes are, in the judgment of those very ancients who have
   explained this chapter as relating to a regenerate man, so vastly
   diverse and dissentient, that the same things cannot agree with a
   regenerate man according to both these explanations; nay, that,
   according to the first of these explanations, they can agree with a
   regenerate man, but according to the second they can agree only with a
   man who is under sin and under the law. This I will now proceed to
   prove from the testimonies of those ancients themselves: 1. AUGUSTINE
   For in no better manner is this understood--"It is no more I that do
   it" - than that he does not consent "to yield his members as
   instruments of unrighteousness unto sin." For if he both lusts, and
   consents, and does, how is it "no more he that does it," though he is
   grieved that he does it, and groans grievously at being conquered,
   (Against the two Epistles of the Pelagians, lib. I, cap. 10.) On two of
   these three passages we have before disputed, and which say, "But I am
   carnal, sold under sin:" And this is the third: "- bringing me into
   captivity to the law of sin which is in my members." On account of all
   the three, the apostle may seem to be describing him who is still
   living under the law, and not yet under grace. But as we have already
   expounded the two former of them to be spoken in reference to the flesh
   which is yet corruptible, so may this third passage likewise be
   understood; as if it said that I was brought into captivity by the
   flesh not by the mind, by motion not by consent; and that it therefore
   brought me into captivity, because in my flesh itself there is no other
   than our common [sinful] nature. (Ibid.) He is spiritual because he
   lives according to the Spirit; but still, on the part of mortal flesh,
   the same man is spiritual and carnal. Behold the spiritual man: "With
   the mind I myself serve the law of God.", Behold the carnal man: "But
   with the flesh I serve the law of sin." Is, then, this same man both
   spiritual and carnal? He is evidently so, as long as he is a dweller on
   earth. Whosoever thou art, be not surprised if thou yieldest and
   consentest to any lusts whatsoever, since thou either supposest them to
   be good for fulfilling libidinous excess, or thou undoubtedly seest
   them now to be so evil, that yet by yielding to them thou consentest,
   and followest whither they lead, and dost perpetrate those things which
   they wickedly suggest; thou art entirely carnal, whosoever thou art
   that dost correspond with this description--thou art totally carnal.
   But if indeed thou lustest or desirest that which the law forbids when
   it says: "Thou shaft not covet," yet if thou dost also observe that
   other thing which the law likewise says, "Thou shalt not go after thy
   lusts," in thy mind thou art spiritual, and in thy flesh carnal. For it
   is one thing, not to lust or not to indulge in concupiscence; and it is
   another, not to go after its lusts. The non-indulgence in concupiscence
   is the property of one who is entirely perfect; not to go after his
   lusts, is that of one who is fighting, engaged in a struggle, and
   labouring. Let me be allowed, likewise, to add what the thing itself
   requires, that it is also the property of him who does not walk after
   his lusts; it is the property of a man who is conquering and
   overcoming. For the first of these [the non- indulgence in
   concupiscence] is obtained by the battle, the struggle and the labour,
   but not till after the victory has been secured. (On the Words of the
   Apostle, Sermon 5.) It is apparent, therefore, from the mind of St.
   Augustine, that, if this chapter be explained as relating to consent
   and to the actual perpetration of evil, it can by no means be
   understood concerning a regenerate man, but concerning a man who is
   under the law, and "is merely carnal," as he expresses himself. 2.
   VENERABLE BEDE We know that the law is spiritual. There is, therefore,
   perhaps, some other; probably thou art the man; either thou art he, or
   I am. If, then, he be some one of us, let us listen to him about
   himself, and, not being offended, let us correct ourselves. But if it
   be himself, (that is, the apostle,) let us not so understand that which
   he has said: "What I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that I do;"
   as if it was his will to be chaste and yet he was an adulterer, or to
   be merciful and yet was cruel, or to be pious and yet was impious. But
   what are we to understand? My will is, not to indulge in concupiscence;
   and yet I do indulge in it. (On Romans 7.) 3. THOMAS AQUINAS Of all
   these writers, Thomas Aquinas most plainly places the two explanations
   in opposition to each other; and he declares that the things which are
   in this chapter attributed by the apostle to the man about whom he is
   treating, according to one of these explanations agree with a
   regenerate man, but, according to the other they agree with a man who
   is under sin: Man, therefore, is said to be carnal, because his reason
   is carnal. It is called "carnal" on two accounts: On the First, because
   when the reason consents to those things to which it is instigated by
   the flesh, it is brought into subjection to the flesh, according to the
   declaration in 1 Corinthians iii. 3: "For, whereas there is among you
   envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal?" In this manner,
   it is also understood about a man not yet restored by grace. On the
   Second account, reason is said to be carnal from the circumstance of
   its being attacked by the flesh; according to that declaration in Gal.
   v. 17, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit." And, in this manner, the
   reason even of a man who is placed under grace is understood to be
   carnal. But both these carnalities proceed from sin, &c. Hence he says,
   "For that which I do I understand not," [or "allow not,"] that is, that
   it ought to be performed. This may indeed be understood in two ways: In
   the ONE mode, it may be understood concerning him who is subjected to
   sin, who knows in general that sin must not be committed, yet, being
   conquered, by the suggestion of the devil, or by passion, or by the
   inclination of a perverse habit, he commits it, and is, therefore, said
   to perform that which he understands ought not to be performed, doing
   this against his conscience, as it is said in Luke xii. 47, "That
   servant, who knew his Lord's will, and did not according to his will,
   shall deservedly be beaten with many stripes." In the other mode, it
   may be understood concerning him who is placed in grace, who indeed
   does that which is evil; not indeed by executing it in operation or
   with a consenting mind, but only by indulging in concupiscence
   according to the feeling of the sensual appetite. And that
   concupiscence is on account of the reason and the understanding,
   because it precedes his judgment, at this approach of which such an
   actual operation is hindered, &c. First, therefore, he says, in
   reference to the omission of good, "for the good which it is my will to
   do, I do not." This may indeed be understood, in one mode, about a man
   who is placed under sin; and thus that which he says in this place, "I
   do," must be received according to a complete act, which is exercised
   externally, through the consent of reason. But when he says, "It is my
   will," it must be understood not indeed in reference to a complete will
   which is preceptive of a work or operation, but in reference to a
   certain incomplete will, by which men will in general that which is
   good, as they also have in general a correct judgment concerning one
   thing; and such a will is corrupted in particular because it does not
   what it understands in general ought to be done, and that which it
   wills to do. But according to its being understood respecting a man
   recovered by grace, we must, on the contrary, understand by this which
   he says, "It is my will," a complete will continuing throughout in the
   election or choice of a particular operation, that by this which he
   says, "I do," may be understood an incomplete act which consists only
   in the sensual appetite, and does not extend to the consent of reason.
   For a man who is placed under grace, wills indeed to preserve his mind
   from corrupt lusts; but he does not perform this good, because of the
   inordinate motions of concupiscence which rise up in his sensual
   appetite. Similar to this is what he says in Gal. v. 17, "so that ye do
   not the things which ye would." Secondly, he subjoins, in reference to
   the perpetration of evil, "But the evil which I hate, that I do." If
   this be indeed understood concerning a man who is a sinner, then by
   this which is said, "I hate," is understood a certain imperfect hatred,
   according to which every man naturally hates evil. But by this which he
   says, "I do," is understood an act perfected by the execution of a work
   according to the consent of reason; for that hatred in general is taken
   away in a particular which is eligible through the inclination of a
   habit or passion. But if it be understood concerning a man placed under
   grace, then by this which he says, "I do," is, on the contrary,
   understood an imperfect act, which consists solely in the concupiscence
   of the sensual appetite; and by this which he says, "I hate," is
   understood a perfect hatred, by which any one perseveres in the
   detestation of evil, until the final reprobation of it, &c. But the law
   of sin brings a man into captivity in two ways: By the one mode,
   through consent and operation, it captivates a man who is a sinner; by
   the other mode, it captivates a man placed under grace, with respect to
   the motion of concupiscence. Grace delivers from the body of this death
   in two ways: By the ONE mode, that the corruption of the body may not
   have the dominion over the mind, drawing it to summit sin; by the OTHER
   mode, that the corruption of the body may be totally removed.
   Therefore, with respect to the First, it appertains to the sinner to
   say, "Grace has delivered me from the body of this death, that is, it
   has delivered me from sin, into which my soul was led through the
   corruption of the body." But from sin a righteous man has been already
   delivered; wherefore it belong, to him to say, "The grace of God hath
   made me free from the body of this death, that is, that there may not
   be in my body the corruption of sin or of death," which will occur in
   the resurrection. Afterwards when he says "so then with the mind I
   myself serve the law of God," &c., he infers a conclusion, which is
   inferred according to these two premised expositions, in different
   ways, from the premises. For, according to the exposition of the
   preceding words in the person of a sinner, the conclusion must be
   inferred thus: "It has been said that the grace of God hath made me
   free from the body of this death, that I may not be led away by it to
   sin. Therefore, since I shall now be free, with the mind I serve the
   law of God; but with the flesh I serve the law of sin, which indeed
   remains in the flesh with respect to the fuel, by which the flesh lusts
   against the Spirit." But if the preceding words be understood [as
   proceeding] from the person of a righteous man, then the conclusion
   must be thus inferred: "The grace of God through Jesus Christ hath made
   me free from the body of this death; that is, so that the corruption of
   sin and death may not be in me." 4. HUGH THE CARDINAL There is,
   therefore, now no condemnation. The preceding words have been expounded
   concerning the captivity of mortal sin, under which the man was
   carnally living; and concerning the captivity of venial sin, of the man
   who is in grace. But he gives the appellation of "mortal sin" to that
   which is exercised in operation itself, and "venial" to that which
   consists in the act and motion of lusting or indulging in
   concupiscence, without the consent of the will.

FIFTH PART
     __________________________________________________________________

  I. THE OPPOSITE OPINION IS INJURIOUS TO GRACE AND HURTFUL TO GOOD MORALS

   It is First shewn, that the interpretation of Romans 7, which prevails
   in the present day is injurious to grace, by attributing to it less
   than is proper. (1.) The contest which is described in that chapter,
   cannot be attributed to the Holy Spirit dwelling in a man, without
   manifest contumely to the Holy Ghost. (2.) An objection and reply. 2.
   It is Secondly shewn, that the modern interpretation is hurtful to good
   morals; because it draws along with it, as a consequence, that a man
   flatters and encourages himself in his sins, provided only that he
   commits them with a reluctant conscience. This is illustrated by some
   instances. 3. It is likewise confirmed by St. Augustine and by the
   Venerable Bede. Thesis.--The opinion which affirms, that this chapter
   treats about a man who is regenerate and placed under grace; and which
   also interprets the good which this man would and does not, and the
   evil which he would not but does, as referring to actual good and evil;
   is injurious to grace, and inimical to good morals. 1. That this modern
   opinion is injurious to divine grace, I demonstrate in the following
   manner: An injury is inflicted on grace, not only by him who attributes
   to nature or to free will that which belongs to grace, that is, having
   taken it away from grace; but likewise by him who attributes to it less
   than is its due, and than ought truly to be ascribed to grace. In the
   last of these modes, this modern opinion is inimical to grace: For it
   attributes less than, according to the Scriptures, ought to be ascribed
   to grace. The Scriptures ascribe to divine grace, that, in the
   regenerate, it worketh not only to will but also to do; (Phil. ii. 13)
   that, by its power, our old man is crucified, and the body of sin is
   destroyed or enervated, so that henceforth we should not obey it in the
   lusts thereof; that, through grace, the regenerate are dead indeed unto
   sin, and are raised up again to walk in newness of life, in which they
   serve not sin but God, neither do they yield their members as
   instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but as instruments of
   righteousness to God; (Rom. vi. 2-13) that, through the efficacy of the
   Spirit, they mortify the deeds of the body; (viii, 13) and that grace
   not only supplies to the regenerate strength to resist the world,
   Satan, and the flesh, but, likewise, power to gain the victory over
   them. (Ephes. vi. 11-18; James iv. 4-8; 1 John iv. 4; v, 4; &c., &c.)
   But this modern opinion attributes to grace, that its only effect in
   the regenerate is to will and not to do, that it is too weak to crucify
   the old man, to destroy the body of sin, or to conquer the flesh, the
   world and Satan. For the regenerate man, according to this opinion, is
   said to obey sin in its lusts, and to walk after the desires of the
   flesh; though he is said to do this, compelled by the violence of sin,
   in opposition to conscience, and with a reluctant will. For the
   interpretation and addition alter the mode of obedience by which men
   obey sin; it does not deny obedience itself. This was also the cause
   why St. Augustine interpreted the chapter in reference to
   concupiscence; for he perceived that if he interpreted it concerning
   actual sins, he would be inflicting an injury on grace. (1.) I am
   desirous that it should be made the subject of diligent consideration,
   and that it should be frequently and deliberately pondered, whether the
   contest which is said to be described in this chapter can be ascribed
   to the indwelling Holy Spirit, without manifest contumely and dishonour
   to the grace of Christ and of His Spirit, if this be laid down as the
   issue of the contest, that the man works from the will of the flesh,
   not from concupiscence of the Spirit. This is the result of the battle,
   which is laid down by those who interpret the chapter concerning actual
   good and evil. To any who earnestly peruses the passage, it will indeed
   appear evident that such a contest cannot be ascribed to the Holy
   Spirit, without enormous disgrace to Him. For, what is it? It is said
   to be a contest, and a waging of war between "the law of the mind,"
   that is, the Holy Spirit dwelling within, and "the law of the members;"
   and the victory is assigned to the law of the members against the law
   of the mind; for it leads the man away, as a captive, to the law of
   sin, the Holy Spirit, who dwells within vainly resisting and warring
   against it. Under these circumstances, is not the Holy Spirit
   represented as being much weaker than the law in the members, that is,
   than the lust of the flesh and indwelling sin, The man who denies this,
   will deny that the sun shines when he is to be seen in all his meridian
   splendour. For, in this place, no mention is made of his spontaneous
   yielding or surrender, of desisting from the combat, or the casting
   away of his weapons, which we have declared to be the cause why he who
   begins to fight in the Spirit is conquered by the flesh. But no mention
   of such circumstances can here be made; for it is said to be a battle,
   and a waging of war not between "the law of the members" and a man who
   uses "the law of the mind," but to be between "the law of the mind" and
   "the law of the members;" to which law of the mind the casting away of
   its weapons cannot be attributed, for it is itself engaged in the
   battle and not by proxy. Neither can a desisting from the combat be
   ascribed to the law of the mind before it has actually been conquered
   and overcome. Much less can a spontaneous surrender be attributed to
   it, because this can by no means occur between these two combatants.
   For "the law of the mind" must necessarily lose its life, and cease to
   have any existence, before it willingly and spontaneously yields to the
   rebellious flesh. (2.) Some one, however, may reply, "This is a
   metaphorical kind of speaking or discourse, and through a Prosopopoeia,
   a person and the properties of a person are attributed to the law of
   the mind and to that of the members. But, properly and without any
   trope or figure, this man is said to fight with himself; that is, the
   man, as he is regenerate, fights with himself as he is unregenerate."
   My answer to this is, there is nothing to prevent the thing from being
   done in the manner now specified; for a regenerate man, as such, fights
   in the power and strength of the grace and the Spirit of Christ.
   Therefore, if while fighting he is conquered, the grace and the Spirit
   of Christ are overcome, which would be a fact most ignominious to the
   grace and Spirit of Christ. But if he be conquered while in a state of
   nonresistance, and not during the conflict, but after he has cast away
   his weapons or has desisted from the combat, then this is not the case
   which is the subject of the present investigation; for, in the case
   stated by the apostle, the man is made prisoner while in actual combat,
   not after he has ceased to be a belligerent; because the effect and
   accomplishment of this bringing into captivity is joined to the act of
   waging war and that indeed immediately. But these two are properly
   joined together, and in a manner that is agreeable to the nature of
   parties fighting against each other, if "the law of the mind," that is,
   the conscience, convinced of the equity and justice of the law, be said
   to contend with "the law of the members;" for the former is conquered
   while fighting and in the very midst of the conflict, because it is too
   weak to be capable of withstanding the impetuosity of the shock against
   "the law of the members," that is, the lusts of the flesh and the
   desires of sin, though it earnestly strives to bear away, by every
   exertion and with all its powers, the palm of victory from the field of
   battle. 2. But matter of fact teaches that this opinion is inimical and
   hurtful to good morals. For nothing can be imagined more noxious to
   true morality than to assert that" it is a property of the regenerate
   not to do the good which they would, and to do the evil which they
   would not;" because it necessarily follows from this that those persons
   flatter themselves in their sins, who, while sinning, feel that they do
   so with a reluctant conscience and with a will that offered some
   resistance. For they conclude themselves to be regenerate from this
   circumstance--because it is not one of the properties of the
   unregenerate to do the evil which they would not, and to omit the
   performance of the good which they would; the unregenerate being those
   who omit the good, and perpetrate the evil, with a full consent of the
   will, and without any resistance. I truly and sacredly affirm that this
   has, in more instances than one, fallen within the range of my
   experience: When I have admonished certain persons to exercise a degree
   of caution over themselves and to guard against the commission of some
   wickedness which they knew to be prohibited by the law, they have
   replied "that it was indeed their will so to refrain, but that they
   must declare, with the apostle, We are unable to perform the good which
   we would." "I speak the truth in Christ and lie not, my conscience also
   bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost," that I have received this very
   answer from a certain individual, not after he had perpetrated the
   crime, but when he was previously admonished not to commit it. I am
   also acquainted with a lady, who on being admonished and blamed for a
   certain deed which she knew she had perpetrated against the law of God
   and her own conscience, coolly replied "that as she had done that deed
   with a reluctant will and not with a full consent, in this she
   experienced something similar to what the apostle Paul endured when he
   said, The evil that l would not, that I do." I have known both men and
   women, young persons and old, who, when I have explained this seventh
   chapter of the epistle to the Romans in the sense in which I defend it
   in this treatise, have openly confessed to me "that they had always
   previously entertained the opinion that, if they had actually
   perpetrated any evil with a reluctant mind, or had omitted the
   performance of any good when their conscience exclaimed against such
   omission, it was not necessary for them to care much about the matter
   or deeply to lament it, since they considered themselves in this
   respect to be similar to St. Paul." These persons, therefore, have
   returned me hearty thanks, as they have declared, because, by my
   interpretation, I had delivered them from that false opinion. 3. But,
   lest it might appear that I alone make this assertion, and, without any
   witness or supporter, declare that "the opinion which interprets this
   chapter as referring to actual good and evil, is adverse to good morals
   arid to piety," let us now see what judgment some of the ancients have
   formed about this matter. AUGUSTINE When discussing these words of the
   apostle--"for the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I
   would not, that I do"--this father makes the following remarks: As
   often as the divine words which have just been recited from the epistle
   of the apostle Paul, are read, it is to be feared that, when they arc
   incorrectly understood, they furnish an occasion to men who are seeking
   one; because they are inclined to the commission of sin, and with
   difficulty restrain themselves. Therefore, when they have heard the
   apostle declaring, "For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil
   which I hate, that I do," they commit evil; and, as if displeased with
   themselves because they thus do evil, they suppose that they resemble
   the apostle, who said, "For the good that I would, I do not; but the
   evil which I would not, that I do." For this passage is sometimes read,
   and at present imposes on us the necessity of admonishing, that, when
   men take it in a wrong acceptation, they convert salutary food into
   poison. (0n Time, Sermons 43 a 45, tom. 10.) But lest, in this battle,
   these divine words when read should seem, to those who have not a good
   understanding of them, as the trumpet of the enemy's army and not that
   of our own ranks, by which we may be incited, and not by which we may
   be conquered, pay attention, I beseech you, my brethren, and, you who
   are in the contest, contend manfully. For, you who have not yet begun
   the combat, will not understand what I say; but you who are now
   contending, will easily understand my meaning. I speak openly; your
   words will be in silence. Recollect, in the first place, what the
   apostle has written to the Galatians, from which this passage may be
   well expounded; for, speaking to believers who had been baptized, he
   says--speaking to them as those to whom all sins had been remitted in
   the sacred laver; but speaking to them as to those who are still
   fighting, he says, "This I say then: Walk in the Spirit and ye shall
   not fulfill the lusts of the flesh." He has not said, Ye shall not do
   or perform, but, Ye shall not fulfill or perfect. And why does he say
   this, He proceeds to say "for the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and
   the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary, the one to the
   other, that ye may not do the things that ye would. But if ye be led of
   the Spirit, ye are not under the law." If ye be led of the Spirit--What
   is "to be led of the Spirit"? To consent to the Spirit of God which
   commands, and not to the flesh which lusteth. Yet it lusts, and
   resists, and wills something, and thou wiliest not. Persevere in not
   willing [that which the flesh wills]. And yet thy desire to God should
   be of this description, that there may not be any concupiscence for
   thee to resist. Consider what I have said. I repeat it: Thy request
   unto God should be of this kind, that no concupiscence whatever may
   remain which it may be necessary for thee to resist. For thou dost
   resist; and, by not consenting, thou dost overcome; but it is far
   better to have no enemy than to conquer one. The time will arrive when
   that enemy will have no existence. Apply thy mind to the notes of
   triumph, and see if it will be "O death, where is thy contest?" It will
   not be "O death, where is thy sting?" Thou shalt seek its place, and
   shalt not find it. (Ibid.) In a subsequent passage on the same
   treatise, when explaining still more plainly the meaning of the
   apostle, lest his words should prove hurtful to those who seek
   occasion, St. Augustine writes in the following manner: The apostle,
   therefore, does not what he would, because he wills not to lust or
   indulge in concupiscence; yet he lusts; therefore he does the evil
   which he wills not. Did this evil concupiscence draw the apostle into
   subjection to lust for fornication? By no means. Let not such thoughts
   as these arise in thy heart. He contended against it; he was not
   subdued. But because he willed not, and had this against which he might
   contend, therefore he said "What I would, that do I not;" I will not to
   lust, or to indulge in concupiscence, and yet I do lust. "Therefore,
   what I would, that do I not;" but yet I consent not to concupiscence.
   For, otherwise, he would not have said, "Ye shall not fulfill the lusts
   of the flesh:" if he fulfilled them himself. But he has placed for
   thee, before thy eyes, the combat in which he was engaged, that thou
   mayest not be afraid concerning thine own. For, if the blessed apostle
   had not said this, when thou hast perceived concupiscence in motion
   within thy members to which thou wouldst not yield thy consent, yet,
   since thou hast perceived it to be in motion, perhaps thou mightest
   despair concerning thyself, and say--if I belonged unto God, l should
   not have such motions. Look at the apostle engaged in the battle, and
   be unwilling to fill thyself with despair. He says, "But I see another
   law in my members, warring against the law of my mind; and because I am
   unwilling that it should wage ware for it is my own flesh, I am myself
   the person, it is a part of myself--"that which I would, I do not; but
   the evil which I hate, that do I," because I lust. Therefore, the good
   which I do in not giving consent to my evil concupiscence, I perform
   it, but I do not perfect it. And concupiscence, which is my enemy,
   performs evil, and does not perfect it. In what way do I perform good
   and not perfect it? I perform good when I do not consent to evil
   concupiscence, but I do not perfect good so as not to indulge the least
   concupiscence. Again, therefore, in what way does my enemy perform
   evil, and not perfect evil? It performs evil, because it puts evil
   desires in motion. It does not perfect evil, because it does not draw
   me to evil.(Ibid.) VENERABLE BEDE But the thing which I do or perform
   is to lust, not to consent to lust; lest any one should now seek in the
   apostle an example for himself, and should himself afford a bad one.
   "That which I would, I do not." For what saith the law, "Thou shalt not
   covet." And it is not my will to lust, and yet I lust, though I give no
   consent to my lust, and though I go not after it. (On Romans 7.) II.
     __________________________________________________________________

  VARIOUS OBJECTIONS IN FAVOUR OF THE COMMON INTERPRETATION ANSWERED

   An objection for the common interpretation; it is possible for this to
   be the meaning of Romans 7, "that the regenerate do not so frequently
   and so perfectly perform what is good, and omit what is evil as they
   wish." Reply: The gloss is contrary to the text, because this chapter
   describes the continuous state of the man about whom it treats. 2. The
   manner in which St. Paul would have spoken, if had intended to convey
   the meaning that generally obtains, and this in conformity with the
   style and modes of speaking which he usually adopts in other passages
   when writing concerning himself. An argument against the usually
   received opinion, taken from those things which have been previously
   spoken, and which are here reduced into the form of a syllogism. 3.
   Another objection in favour of the common interpretation, and this in
   two members. An answer to the first member. An answer to the second,
   "that when the regenerate sin, they sin with reluctance." Every inward
   struggle against sin is not a sign that the man is regenerate. 4.
   Another objection, and a reply to it. Remarks on a complete and an
   incomplete will. The regenerate will not, with a complete will, more
   good than they perform, neither perpetrate more evil than they will. 5.
   Each of us must institute a serious examination into self and into all
   the motions of his will. 1. But some one will say, in defense of this
   modern opinion, and in order to wipe away this double stain, "By this
   interpretation, no injury is inflicted on divine grace, and no harm is
   done to good morals." Some other man, possessed of still greater
   vehemence in defending the opinion which he has once conceived, will
   bring against me the charge of calumny, [and will say,] "It is a well
   known fact that they who give this interpretation to the chapter, do
   not take away from the regenerate the performance of all actual good,
   and the omission of what is evil, and consequently, [the work of] the
   grace of regeneration; but this is all that they affirm: Sometimes,
   nay, very often, those men who are regenerated by the Spirit of Christ
   do the evil which. they would not, and, far more frequently, omit or do
   not perform the good which they would; and the same regenerate persons
   never perform so perfectly the good which they do as they will to
   perform it, and they never omit evil so perfectly as they will to omit
   it. But neither of these assertions can be denied by those who
   acknowledge the imperfection of righteousness in this life, and who
   accurately consider the examples of the most holy of mortals which are
   depicted in the Holy Scriptures." I reply, this subterfuge affords no
   defense or excuse for the modern explanation of Romans 7. For, (as the
   phrase is,) in this instance the gloss is contrary to the text. For
   that chapter does not treat about that which occasionally befalls the
   man who is the subject of discussion, but about what generally and for
   the most part is accustomed to happen to him; and it contains a
   description of the continuous state of the man about whom it treats.
   This is openly declared by the words themselves and by the mode of
   speech employed. The apostle says, "The good that I would, I do not;
   but the evil which I would not, that I do." This is said without any
   distinction or contraction of the general saying to its being specially
   understood as though he sometimes did not the good which he would, and
   sometimes did the evil which he would not, or as though he many times
   abstained from the evil which he hates, and performed the good which he
   would. But the apostle simply and indefinitely enunciates concerning
   the detested evil that he perpetrates it, and concerning the good which
   he willed that he performs it not. But if this indefinite enunciation
   be said to mean "that the good which has been willed is more frequently
   performed than omitted, and that the detested evil has been more
   frequently avoided than committed," which must necessarily be affirmed
   by those who explain the chapter in reference to a regenerate man, for
   a regenerate man walks not according to the flesh, but according to the
   Spirit--then I say, the apostle did not know how to enunciate his own
   meaning. For indefinite enunciations possess equal force with those
   which are universal, or they approach as near as possible to them; they
   enunciate, concerning objects, those attributes which are in every one
   of them and at all times, or most usually and according to the more
   excellent part. Thus it is said concerning the Cretians, that they are
   liars. (Tit. i. 12.) The Athenians are said to be light and frivolous,
   and to take pleasure in "hearing some new thing;" and the Carthaginians
   are called perfidious. The Scriptures speak thus, that the Jews have
   been rejected on account of the greater part, (for "God doth not cast
   away his people whom he foreknew,") and that the gentiles were received
   into their place. For power was given, and a command enjoined on the
   apostles, to preach the gospel to all nations, and most of them have
   now long since been converted to Christ, or will yet be converted.
   Neither in this chapter is the apostle treating about a perfect and, in
   every respect, complete performance of good and omission of evil, but
   simply about the performance of the one and the omission of the other.
   For he says that the man commits evil, but not perfectly, if he is
   regenerate; otherwise, he would sin with an entire and full will. But
   this will be subsequently treated at greater length. 2. But if St. Paul
   intended in this chapter to convey such a meaning as those interpreters
   ascribe to him, then he must have spoken in the following manner, if he
   was desirous of saying thing, in accordance with himself: "We know that
   the law is spiritual, and requires from us an obedience perfect in all
   its parts, and continuous without any intermission or interruption. But
   I have not yet so far conquered the flesh, I have not yet such a
   complete dominion over sin, neither have I broken or subdued the lusts
   of the flesh so much, as to be able to perform that perfect and
   uninterrupted obedience to the law. For it occasionally happens to me,
   that I do the evil which I would not, and omit the good which I would;
   nay, I perceive that I never perform what is good in such perfection
   and with so much zeal as it is in my will to perform; nor have I
   omitted what is evil in such perfection as I have wished. For in both
   cases, even while I am performing what is good and omitting what is
   evil, I feel the concupiscence of the flesh struggling and resisting;
   and I consider myself to have experienced admirable success if I come
   victorious out of the combat, that is, if I do that which the Spirit
   lusteth, and not what the flesh lusteth." Such a declaration as this
   would have been suitable to the sense which they attribute to the
   apostle, and this is properly the index and interpreter of that
   meaning. But many passages of Scripture, in which the apostle treats
   about himself, teach us that he ought to have spoken thus, if he had
   spoken things that were consistent with himself: "For I am conscious to
   myself of nothing; yet am I not hereby justified." (1 Cor. iv. 4.) "I
   therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so perform I my part as a
   combatant, not as one who beateth the air; but I beat down and keep my
   body under, and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when
   I have preached to others, I myself should become a reprobate." (vi,
   26,27.) "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ." (xi, 1.)
   "- While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things
   which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but
   those which are not seen are eternal." (2 Cor. iv. 18.) "- Giving no
   offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed; but in all
   things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience,"
   &c. (vi, 3-10.) "For I through the law am dead to the law, that I may
   live unto God. I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not
   I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh,
   I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself
   for me." (Gal. ii. 19, 20.) "But God forbid that I should glory, save
   in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is
   crucified unto me, and I unto the world." (vi, 14.) Many other passages
   of a similar import might be cited. Since, therefore, this
   interpretation does not agree with the chapter, it cannot, by this
   opinion, be excused from the two crimes which are objected against it,
   [as being injurious to divine grace, and noxious to good morals].
   Wherefore I persist in preferring the same accusation, and I declare,
   The opinion which attributes to a regenerate man "that he generally
   does the evil which he would not, and that he most commonly omits the
   good which he would," is injurious to the grace of regeneration and
   hurtful to good morals; But the opinion which explains Romans 7 as
   referring to a regenerate man, attributes these things to one who is
   regenerate; Therefore, this opinion is injurious to the grace of
   regeneration, and hurtful to good morals. The light of the major
   proposition is so great as not to require either proof or illustration.
   The minor is in the text. For, as has already been shewn, to the man
   about whom the apostle is treating it is attributed, that he most
   commonly commits what is evil and omits what is good; therefore, the
   conclusion properly follows. It appears, therefore, that I have not
   through calumny affixed this objection to the opinion which is opposed
   to my own; and I can sacredly affirm, now, that prior to the act of
   taking the pen into my hands, I had made a vow before God that [in the
   discussion of this subject] I would indulge in no calumny. Wherefore,
   though the objection were false, it would in that case have escaped
   from me through ignorance and not through malice. 3. Some one, however,
   who is desirous of pertinaciously keeping and retaining the thesis
   which has been once laid down, will here reply--"Let it be granted,
   that this explanation is deficient in those things which the apostle
   attributes to this man; let it likewise be granted, that the
   interpretation produced by other persons is not suitable to the
   passage; yet it does not become disadvantageous to good morals, nor is
   any injury inflicted on grace through this opinion, provided that the
   whole together be excepted, as it equitably should be, and that one
   part be not separated from another--this also being granted, that,
   though this interpretation be unsuitable for Romans 7, yet it is
   agreeable to the rest of the Scriptures and to the analogy of faith."
   (1.) That I may not seem to be too rigid, I am willing to grant the
   former of these; about the latter we shall see something further. For I
   own, that the opinion of St. Augustine, which interprets the chapter as
   relating only to the act and motion of concupiscence, neither proves to
   be detrimental to grace, nor injurious to good morals, though he
   explains the passage concerning a regenerate man. But I say that, after
   it has been impressed and inculcated on the minds of hearers or readers
   that the apostle is treating about a regenerate man in Romans 7, it is
   not in our power to hinder such persons from understanding the rest of
   those things which are attributed to this man in a different manner
   from that in which they ought to be understood, that is, from receiving
   them in an acceptation which is not agreeable to the text and design of
   the apostle, and as they are not received when they are explained as
   relating to a man who is under sin, and under the law, especially when
   the inclination is a persuasive to such an interpretation, and when the
   concupiscence of the flesh gives a similar impulse. This, as I have
   already related, has been actually done by many people, and certainly
   not without blame attached to the opinion itself, though "the whole of
   it be received together." For this is not the only thing declared by
   that opinion, "The regenerate sometimes commit sin; and they never
   perfectly perform what is good, and omit what is evil, while they
   continue in the present life;" but this is likewise added: "It is a
   property of the regenerate, to commit sin not with a full consent of
   the will, and while in the act of sinning to will not to sin; since the
   unregenerate sin with a full consent of the will, and without any
   reluctance on its part." Those persons who wish to excuse themselves by
   this chapter, and who, while engaged in sin, feel some resistance of
   the will and remorse of conscience in the act of sinning, conclude from
   the preceding assertion, that they commit sin not with a full consent
   of the will, and, therefore, that the very fact itself of their thus
   committing sin is a sign of their regeneration. Such a conclusion as
   this is both injurious to grace and inimical to good morals. (i.) It is
   injurious to grace, because it lays that down, as a sign of
   regeneration, which is alike common to the regenerate and to the
   unregenerate, that is, to those who are under the law. (ii.) It is
   inimical to good morals, because sin is neither so much avoided by that
   man who holds such an opinion as this, nor does its perpetration
   produce deep sorrow in him who is its author, because from the mode of
   the deed he still concludes that he is regenerate. (2.) But let us now
   consider, whether those things which have been adduced to liberate
   their opinion from this two-fold criminal charge, be conformable to the
   rest of the Scriptures and to the analogy of faith, or not. I confess
   it indeed to be a very great truth, that, while the regenerate pass
   their lives in this mortal body, they neither perfectly perform what is
   good, nor omit what is evil. But I add, that, while in the present
   life, they never perfectly will what is good, or perfectly hate what is
   evil. I likewise confess, that even the best of the regenerate offend
   in many things, and sometimes actually sin, by doing what is evil and
   omitting what is good; for the regenerate do not always act from the
   principle of regeneration. But I deny that, when they sin, they sin
   unwillingly, though they may do so with a struggle in their mind and
   conscience. For, while the contest and struggle continued between the
   mind and the flesh, how much soever they might nill the evil to which
   the flesh incited them, and will the good from which it dehorted them;
   yet they do not proceed onward to the deed itself except when the
   battle is terminated, the mind or conscience is overcome, and after the
   will has yielded consent to the flesh--though such consent be not
   without stinging remorse of conscience. Then I deny, that it can be
   concluded from this opposition of the mind, that he is a regenerate man
   who sins in this manner. For, as we have often previously shewn, the
   commission of sin with a reluctant mind and conscience belongs to many
   of the unregenerate. Besides, as we have also previously taught, that
   resistance which immediately preceded the perpetration of sin, was not
   from the Holy Spirit who regenerated and inhabited, but from the mind
   which was convinced of the righteousness and equity of the law. For the
   life of the conscience continues; and from its life, action and motion
   remain, when the Holy Spirit is either wholly departed, or is so
   grieved as to employ no motion and act for the hindrance of sin. It is
   a well known fact, that the soul in man which is vegetative, performs
   the first and the last offices of life, while the rational soul ceases
   its operations as in the case of lunatics and maniacs, and the
   sensitive soul desists from acting in lethargic persons. I wish these
   observations to receive a diligent consideration; for they have a great
   tendency to induce a man to enter upon a serious and sure examination
   respecting himself, to attain a correct knowledge of the state of
   regeneration, and sedulously to distinguish between it and the state
   BEFORE the law, and chiefly between it and that UNDER the law. 4. Yet
   some person will here rejoin, and, for the sake of excusing or
   defending his opinion, will say, "It cannot be denied that the
   regenerate will more good than they actually perform, and perpetrate
   more evil than they will." My answer is, this, when correctly
   understood, may be conceded; for it is stated with some ambiguity. "To
   will and not to will this thing," may be understood concerning either a
   complete or an incomplete volition and nolition, (to use the words of
   Thomas Aquinas,) though in a sense a little different. (1.) I give the
   appellation of a complete will to that which is borne to a particular
   object that is particularly considered, approving or disapproving of
   that object according to the prescript or direction of the last
   judgment of the reason that is formed concerning it. (2.) I give the
   appellation of an incomplete will to that which is borne towards the
   same object generally considered, approving or disapproving of it
   according to the prescript or direction not of the last judgment of the
   reason which is formed concerning it. The former of these, which is
   indeed complete, may be called simply a volition and a nolition. But
   the latter, which is incomplete, is otherwise expressed by the words,
   desire and wishing, and ought to be called vellcity rather than will.
   Having premised these things, I now say, It cannot be affirmed with
   truth, "that a regenerate man wills more good with a complete will than
   he actually performs," unless without any fault of his own, he be
   hindered by necessity or by some greater force, or "that he actually
   does more evil than it is his will to do." For he does it not through
   coaction. A merchant who, for the sake of avoiding shipwreck, throws
   his heavy bales into the sea, willingly performs that act, having
   followed this last judgment of his reason--that it is better for his
   bales of goods to be destroyed, than for himself to perish with them.
   Thus, with a complete (I do not say with a full) volition, David willed
   his adulterous intercourse with Bathsheba. Willingly, and with a
   complete volition, Peter denied Christ. But if this be understood
   concerning an incomplete will, then I grant it may be said "that the
   regenerate will to perform more good than they really execute, and to
   omit more evil than they omit." This, however, is not an exclusive
   property of the regenerate; for it belongs to all those who are so
   under the law, that in them the law has discharged all its functions,
   and (the Holy Spirit employing it for this purpose) in them has
   produced all those effects which it is possible and usual for the law
   to produce. Both the regenerate, and those who are under the law, might
   indeed will, that there was not in them such a vast force and efficacy
   of sin yet existing and reigning in them; and might wish, that they
   were not solicited and impelled to evil deeds through concupiscence and
   the temptation of sin; nay, they might also will that they did not lust
   or indulge in concupiscence; but those evil acts to which they are
   solicited by sin which either is in them, or dwells in them and reigns,
   they do not perform, except through the intervention of the consent of
   the will that has been obtained by this temptation of sin. For lust
   does not bring forth sin, unless it has conceived; but it conceives
   through the consent of the will tanquam ex marito. But as long as the
   will remains in a state of suspense, inclining to neither part, so long
   no act is produced--as we behold in a just balance, or true scales, of
   which neither part verges upward or downward prior to one of them
   receiving an accession of weight which depresses that scale and
   elevates the opposite one. All motion reclines or depends on rest as on
   a foundation. Thus, the will does not move towards the part of sin
   unless when acquiescing in its temptation. 5. These remarks are
   exceedingly plain, and capable of being fully confirmed by experience
   itself, if any one will only accurately ponder within himself all the
   motions of his own will. But the greatest part of us avoid this duty;
   for it cannot be performed without [inducing] sorrow and sickness of
   mind, which no man willingly brings upon himself. But it is by no means
   probable, that sin should obtain a full consent from the will of that
   man who is generally well instructed in the righteousness and
   unrighteousness of actions, before he has ceased to feel any sorrow or
   regret: Wherefore, the difference between a regenerate and an
   unregenerate man must not be placed in this particular when both of
   them commit sin. For, in that particular deed, they equally yield to
   the temptation of sin, both of them sin from the same principle of
   depraved nature, and in both instances the resistance is one and the
   same when sin is perpetrated, that is, on the part of the mind and
   conscience convicted of the justice or the injustice of the deed. For
   if the Spirit were itself that resistance, then sin would not be
   perpetrated in the very act. "Is there then no difference between the
   regenerate and the unregenerate, when they commit sin?" That I may not
   deny this, I say that such difference must be brought forward from
   plain passages in the Holy Scriptures; otherwise, that man will deceive
   himself to his great peril, who follows some other rule of judging.

THE CONCLUSION AN Examination and comparison of each of the three
Interpretations of this chapter.

   The FIRST, which is the latest of the two opinions embraced by St.
   Augustine, and which interprets this chapter concerning a man under
   grace, has various disadvantages: (1.) in the meaning of the word
   CARNAL, and that of the phrase, "sold under sin." (2.) In the
   explanation of the evil which, the apostle says, he did; and of the
   good which he omitted. (3.) In the explanation of the word To Do or To
   PERFORM. (4.) In the interpretation of "indwelling sin." (5.) In the
   explanation of "the law of the mind." (6.) In explaining the captivity
   of man under the law of sin. (7.) In the distorted meaning given to the
   votive exclamation. (8.) In assigning to a regenerate man a double
   servitude, and in interpreting "the mind" for "the spirit." These eight
   inconveniences are sufficient to induce a rejection of this First
   Interpretation. 2. The SECOND, which is that of modern divines, and
   which also explains the chapter concerning a man under grace, in
   addition to the inconveniences that it has in common with the First,
   has likewise some which are peculiar to itself. (1.) In saying, what
   permanently belongs to the continuous state of this man, sometimes only
   happens to him. (2.) In giving a rash explication of "performing that
   which is good." (3.) In asserting, that the regenerate commit sin
   unwillingly. (4.) In predicating contradictory things concerning this
   man. (5.) In predicating with restriction those things concerning the
   regenerate, which the Scriptures simply attribute to them. 3. The
   THIRD, which is St. Augustine's first opinion, as well as that of
   Arminius, and which understands this chapter as relating to a man who
   is under the law, is plain and perspicuous, and not at disagreement
   either with apostolical phraseology or with other passages of
   Scripture; this fact is rendered obvious even from this
   circumstance--that this man is said at once to be "placed under the
   law" and "under the dominion of sin." 4. This treatise is closed with
   an address, by Arminius, to his brethren in the ministry, in which the
   author offers himself for examination, with a most serious intreaty for
   them to admonish him, in a fraternal manner, if he has erred; but to
   yield their assent to the truth, if he has in this work written such
   things as are in accordance with the scriptures and with the meaning of
   the apostle. Let us now briefly compare these three expositions of
   Romans vii, FIRST, that which St. Augustine gave not long before his
   death; Secondly, that which he taught in early life, which is likewise
   my interpretation, and that of many doctors of the primitive church, as
   I have already proved, and that of some even among our own divines;
   and, LASTLY, the exposition of those persons who assent to St.
   Augustine in this particular-that in common with him they explain it as
   relating to a regenerate man, but who dissent from him on another
   particular--that they interpret GOOD and EVIL, not as relating to the
   act of CONCUPISCENCE, but as referring to ACTUAL GOOD AND EVIL. 1. That
   St. Augustine might be able to interpret this chapter as relating to a
   regenerate man and one placed under grace, (which he supposed would be
   serviceable to him in his disputes with the Pelagians,) he was
   compelled to put a forced construction on the apostolical phraseology,
   and to interpret many things in opposition to the express meaning and
   intention of the apostle. (1.) He has interpreted a carnal man to mean
   one who yet bears about with him mortal flesh, who is not yet become
   spiritual in the flesh, and who still has and feels within himself the
   lusts of the flesh. But about the first of these two descriptions of
   men the apostle is not here treating: It is, therefore, quite beyond
   the purpose; and I beseech St. Augustine to point out to me a single
   passage of Scripture, in which the regenerate are called carnal because
   they still have within them the lusts of the flesh. If they are called
   spiritual in the Scriptures, "because by the Spirit they mortify the
   deeds of the flesh" and do not go after carnal lusts, but walk
   according to the Spirit, then indeed they cannot be called carnal from
   the fact of their still having those lusts. They may be called "those
   who are not perfectly spiritual" on account of the presence of sinful
   lusts; but they can by no means be styled carnal, because the dominion
   of sin is taken away from them. In a similar manner he was under the
   necessity of distorting another attribute of this man, sold under sin,
   when this phrase properly signifies "one who is the slave of sin, and
   who serves sin," whether he does this willingly without any resistance
   of conscience, or in opposition to his mind and so far unwillingly. It
   is not allowed to us to frame petty distinctions, and, according to
   these, to attribute to persons certain words, which the Scriptures do
   not employ, in that sense, and which are not usually ascribed to those
   persons in holy writ. (2.) Then he interprets the evil which the
   apostle says he did, by the word to lust or to indulge in
   concupiscence; and the good which he says he omitted, by the word not
   to lust--a most absurd and distorted application of those terms! First.
   Because the words, Katergazesqai, Prassein and Poiein "to do," cannot
   have the same signification as concupisco, "to lust." At least, so far
   as I know, the Scriptures have in no passage, explained "to lust" by
   any of those three words. And St. Augustine himself, in the definition
   of sin, when distinguishing between these things, says, "Sin is every
   thing which is spoken, done, and lusted or desired against the law of
   God." Bucer, in his "Comment on Romans 7," says, "Some persons receive
   the three verbs here rendered to do,' in the acceptation, to lust,' but
   that is not St. Paul's mode of speaking. He understands by the word,
   the deed itself which is actually committed at the impulse of
   concupiscence, in opposition to that which the law dictates, and which
   the mind, consenting to that law, approves. Concupitio, to lust' or
   desire, is in reality, an internal act of concupiscence in the mind,
   which indulges in such concupiscence. But these verbs to do,' in this
   chapter do not signify an internal act of lusting, but, properly, the
   external act of doing those things which have been lusted or desired."
   (Fol. 369.) Secondly. "Sin is said to do this evil, and, by the
   perpetration of the evil, to slay the man himself." Sin does not slay
   him through concupiscence. St. James speaks thus: "Then when lust hath
   conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished [or
   completed by action], bringeth forth death." (i, 15.) But it slays the
   man through actual sin. This is declared by the apostle in the fifth
   verse of this very chapter, when he says, "for when we were in the
   flesh, the motions of sin, which were by the law, did work in our
   members to bring forth fruit unto death." I am now speaking, not
   according to the rigor of the law, but according to the grace of the
   gospel in Jesus Christ. Thirdly. The evil and the good, the former of
   which, he says, he perpetrates, but the latter he omits, are so opposed
   to each other, that evil is what is forbidden by a prohibitive law,
   which law is usually proposed by a negative; but Good is what is
   commanded by a preceptive law, which is usually propounded by an
   affirmative. A sin is perpetrated against a prohibitive law by
   commission, but against a preceptive law by omission. On this account
   they are called sins of omission and of commission. If a prohibitive
   law be observed, evil is said to be omitted, but if a preceptive law be
   observed, good is said to be performed. Now, to lust, and not to lust,
   are not thus opposed to each other. For though to lust be forbidden by
   a prohibitive law, yet not to lust is not commanded by a preceptive
   law; neither can it be commanded by such a law; for not to lust
   consists of a negative or the omission of an act; but by omission, an
   offense is committed against a preceptive law. But, by the omission of
   concupiscence, no offense is committed against a positive or preceptive
   law, but a prohibitive law is fulfilled; and by obedience, which
   consists in not lusting, good is not performed, but evil is omitted.
   That we may point out this absurdity [of St. Augustine's exposition],
   we will invert in the following manner what the apostle has said: "The
   good that I would, I do," that is, I do not lust; "but the evil which I
   would not, I do not," that is, I do not lust. For I will not to lust,
   and I do not lust; I nill to lust, and I do not lust. Therefore, in
   this case, the very same act is the performance of good and the
   omission of evil--a complete absurdity. And that is called the
   performance of a good action which is the omission of an evil one--an
   equal absurdity! O Augustine, where was thy usual acumen? Let the
   expression be pardoned; for a good philosopher is not always a
   philosopher, and our Homer himself will sometimes nod. Fourthly. It is
   an illogical mode of expression to say, "I will to lust," and "I will
   not to lust," because actual concupiscence is prior to volition and
   nolition, and the act of concupiscence does not depend upon the choice
   or determination of the will. According to the trite and true saying,
   "first motions are not in our power, unless they be occasioned by some
   act of the will," as the schoolmen express themselves. But we must say,
   "I could wish not to lust," that is, "I could wish to be free from the
   impulse of concupiscence." And this is an expression of desire, not
   tending to or going out towards the performance or omission of our act,
   but earnestly demanding the act of another person for our liberation
   from that evil which impels us to an evil act, and which hinders us
   from a good act--we approving of the good act and disapproving of the
   bad one. (3.) He was compelled, when expounding what the apostle says
   in the 18th verse, "But to perform that which is good I find not," to
   interpret it by "completing what is good," that is, "I find not
   perfectly to do what is good," as is evident from those passages which
   we have cited from St. Augustine. This interpretation is absurd,
   distorted, and contradictory to the sentiments and meaning of the
   author; for, First. The word, Katergazesqai does not signify "to
   perfect," that is, "perfectly to do any thing;" but it signifies "to
   operate, to perform, to effect, or to do," as this word is most
   commonly used, not for "doing any thing perfectly," but for "producing
   an effect." My observations on this point are evident from the text
   itself; for the same Greek word is employed in the first clause of the
   15th verse, when the apostle says, "For that which I do, I allow not,"
   yet he does not perfectly perform the evil of which he disapproves. It
   is also used in the latter clause of the 20th verse, "Now then it is no
   more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me." But sin does not
   perfectly perpetrate evil in this man, especially if he be regenerate,
   as St. Augustine supposes; and he openly says himself the contrary to
   this, as is evident from the passages which we have already cited in
   the fourth part of this treatise. Secondly. The synonyms of this verb
   which are promiscuously used in the seventh chapter, prassein and
   poiein prove the same thing. For the apostle says that he does and
   performs the evil which he would not, (verses 15, 16, 19,) yet he does
   not perfectly perform that evil; this is obvious from what he adds,
   "which I would not." Therefore he performs it not with a full consent
   of his will. For this is confessed by St. Augustine, when he explains
   the passage about the regenerate; but he does it not with a full
   consent of the will, that is, he does it not perfectly. Thirdly. "The
   GOOD which the apostle would, but which he does not," (19,) is,
   according to St. Augustine, not to lust. But how is it that the apostle
   indeed does this "good," [by willing it, but does not perfect it,
   Therefore, a two-fold omission of concupiscence must be laid down [by
   those who adopt St. Augustine's argumentation,] one, under the term to
   do, is called an imperfect omission; the other, under the word to
   complete, receives the appellation of perfect. According to St.
   Augustine's sense, the apostle says in this verse, (19,) "I will not to
   lust, and this good I indeed do, but I do not perfect it." From this
   remark, the absurdity which I have mentioned is most manifest.
   Fourthly. More good is attributed to the will of this man, than to its
   capability and powers or efficacy. But the perfect volition of good is
   not attributed to his will, neither can it be attributed. Therefore,
   from its capability and efficacy not only can the perfect performance
   of good be taken away, but the imperfect performance is likewise taken
   away from them. That is, it is denied respecting this man, not only
   that he perfects good, but that he even performs it. Wherefore, this
   passage must not be understood concerning perfection, that is, the
   perfect performance of good. (4.) He was forced to interpret "sin that
   dwelleth or inhabiteth within me," by "sin existing within," and to
   create a distinction between it and "sin reigning and exercising the
   dominion over a man," while the phrase, "dwelling within me," denotes
   dominion, and the full and supreme power of him who is the resident, as
   we have previously shewn in its proper place. But it is apparent that
   sin reigns in this man; for it commits that sin in him which he himself
   would not, and leads him away as a captive under its power. (5.) He was
   under the necessity of interpreting "the law of the mind" by "the law
   of the Spirit," though in contradiction to the great contrariety
   subsisting between the attribute which is given to "the law of the
   mind," and that which is ascribed to "the law of the Spirit." For, in
   Romans vii. 23, "the law of the mind" is said to be overcome in combat
   by "the law of the members," from which event, the man "is brought into
   captivity to the law of sin." And in Romans viii. 2, "the law of the
   Spirit" is said to make the man "free from the law of sin and death;"
   that is, it is stronger and superior in the conflict against "the law
   of the members;" and, when the latter is conquered and overcome, "the
   law of the Spirit" delivers the man from the captivity into which he
   had been brought by the force of "the law of the members." (6.) St.
   Augustine was compelled to pervert the phrase, "captivity to the law of
   sin," and to give it the meaning of our primeval state in Adam, from
   whom we are born corrupt and under the captivity of sin and Satan,
   when, in this passage, the apostle is not treating on that captivity,
   but on another, which is produced from it, that is, by "the law of the
   members" which we have contracted from Adam, waging war against "the
   law of the mind," overcoming it, and bringing man, by his own act,
   under captivity to the law of sin. For we have the former captivity
   originally from Adam, but we bring down the latter upon ourselves by
   our own act. Even if the discourse of the apostle had referred to our
   primeval state, yet, because the regenerate have received remission of
   sin and are endowed with the spirit of the grace of Christ, they cannot
   be said to be captives under sin. For, though the fuel has not been
   extinguished, yet the power of commanding, and of subjecting us to
   itself, is taken away from sin by the power of regeneration. (7.) He is
   forced to torture the votive exclamation in the 24th verse, to a desire
   different from that on which the apostle is here treating, and with
   which the thanksgiving in the 25th verse does not correspond. For, in
   this passage, St. Paul treats upon the desire by which the man requests
   to be delivered from the dominion of sin, which he calls "the body of
   death;" and St. Augustine is compelled [by the scheme of interpretation
   which he had adopted] to explain in reference to the desire by which he
   desires to be liberated from this mortal body, and when that event
   occurs, he will at once be free from the concupiscence of sin. A
   thanksgiving, however, seems [in this case] to be most unadvisedly
   subjoined to the votive desire, before the fruition of the thing which
   is said to be wished; yet this is done in this passage, according to
   the interpretation of St. Augustine. (8.) Lastly, St. Augustine is
   forced to assign a double servitude to a regenerate man--the one, as he
   serves God--the other, as he serves sin; and this in contradiction to
   the express declaration of Christ--"No man can at one time serve two
   masters." It is objected, "that in a different respect, and according
   to his different parts, man is said to serve God, and to serve sin;"
   but this remark does not clear this opinion from the stain with which
   it is aspersed. (i.) Because the Scriptures are unacquainted with that
   distinction, when they are speaking about regenerate persons; let a
   passage to the contrary be produced. (ii.) Because, if even the flesh
   war against the Spirit or the mind by lusting; yet a man cannot be
   said, solely on account of this resistance and warfare, "with his flesh
   to serve" sin, or "the law of sin;" for, with St. Augustine, these two
   are the same things. He is likewise compelled to use the word, "the
   mind," for the regenerated part of man, for the man so far as he is
   regenerate, in opposition to Scripture usage and phraseology, as we
   have explained in the first part of this treatise. These appear to me
   most equitable reasons for rejecting the latter opinion of St.
   Augustine, and for appealing from him when asleep to St. Augustine in
   his waking moments. I have no doubt that he would also have abandoned
   this his second opinion, had he taken into his consideration the
   arguments which are now adduced, especially when he had perceived the
   explication of the whole chapter to be so suitable and proper, and
   impossible to be wrested in any point by the Pelagians for proving
   their doctrine. 2. Our divines have fallen into some of these errors
   with which we have charged the opinion of St. Augustine, such as the
   following: They are forced to interpret "to be carnal," and "to be sold
   under sin," in a manner very different from that which the meaning of
   the apostle will allow; they call "sin that dwelleth in a man," "sin
   existing within," thus distinguishing it from reigning sin; they assert
   that "the law of the mind" signifies "the law of the Spirit;" they
   explain in a corrupt manner the votive exclamation; and, lastly, they
   attribute a two-fold servitude to a regenerate man. In addition to
   these mistakes, they fall into others which are peculiar to their
   interpretation, but which are agreeable neither to the meaning of the
   apostle in this chapter, nor to the rest of the Scriptures, for, (1.)
   They are compelled to interpret that which, according to the meaning of
   the apostle, belongs to the continuous state of this man, as if it
   happened to him only occasionally, in contradiction to the express
   phraseology of the apostle, who says, "The good that I would, I do not;
   but the evil which I would not, that I do." This phraseology is by no
   means in accordance with the signification by which any one is said
   occasionally to perpetrate evil and to do good, as we have already
   rendered very manifest. (2.) They are under the necessity of
   interpreting the phrase, "The good that I would, I do not" by "I do not
   good in the perfection in which I ought," or, "I do not so much good as
   it is my will to do;" yet neither of these explanations is agreeable to
   the meaning of the apostle, as we have previously seen. (3.) They
   broadly assert, that while the regenerate are actually committing sin,
   they are unwilling to commit sin in the very act of sinning, in
   opposition to the whole of the Scriptures and to the nature of actual
   sin itself, which, if it be not voluntary, ceases to be sin. (4.) They
   are compelled to say contradictory things about this man. For they take
   away from sin, which exists within him, the dominion over him; and yet
   they attribute to it a habitation or indwelling, and they ascribe such
   force and efficacy to it, that it perpetrates evil itself in the man in
   opposition to his will, and brings him into captivity to the law of
   sin. These are most undoubted effects indeed of sin reigning and
   exercising dominion. (5.) Lastly, as there are many passages of
   Scripture, which attribute to the regenerate the willing of good, a
   delight in the law 0f God, and things of a similar kind, they are
   compelled to interpret those passages by this restrictive particle,
   "after the inward man," while, in the rest of the Scriptures, such
   attributes are simply ascribed to a regenerate man, because they have
   the predominance in him. But it is not necessary, at this time, to
   repeat all those things which we have before written and proved against
   that opinion. 3. But the opinion which I have undertaken to explain, is
   plain and perspicuous, under no necessity to affix any thing to the
   phraseology of the apostle, or to impinge against any other portions of
   holy writ. This may be perceived at one glance, by him who will cast
   his eyes upon these two things, that the man who is the subject of the
   present investigation, is said to be placed under the dominion of sin
   and under the law, that is, he is one in whom the law has discharged
   its entire office. (1.) For, as he is placed under the dominion of sin,
   the following affirmations are correctly and without any contortion
   made concerning him: "he is sold under sin; he does that which he wills
   not, and omits that which he wills; sin dwells in him, and in his flesh
   dwelleth no good thing; he cannot attain to the performance of that
   which is good; he does not perform that which is good, but he
   perpetrates evil; evil is present with him; the law of his members
   wages war with the law of his mind and overcomes it, and renders the
   man a captive under the law of sin which he has in his members; and,
   being thus entangled and bound down, he is detained by the body of this
   death, (that is, by the body of sin,) and required with his flesh to
   serve the law of sin." (2.) But, as he is said to be placed under the
   law, the following affirmations belong to him correctly and without any
   contortion: "He allows not (he approves not) that which he does; he
   wills that which he does not, and he wills not that which he does; he
   consents to the law of God that it is good; it is no longer he who
   commits evil; he has good dwelling in his mind; the good that he wills
   he does not, but the evil which he wills not, that he does; he delights
   in the law of God after the inward man; with the law of his mind he
   wages war against the law of his members; he is exceedingly desirous of
   deliverance; and with his mind he serves the law of God." Nay, these
   two united classes of attributes, joined as they intimately are, in the
   text of the apostle, cannot belong to any other man than to this as he
   is placed under the law, and at the same time under the dominion of
   sin. So far from these two relations not being capable of belonging at
   once to the same man, that he who is under the law necessarily endures
   the dominion of sin, that is, the law is too weak to be able to release
   and liberate the sinner from the tyranny of sin. This is the subject
   upon which the apostle treats through the whole of this chapter, and
   points it out in the person of that man who is placed under the law in
   a mode the most excellent of all, that is, one in whom the law has
   fulfilled not only some part of its office, (for that did not serve the
   purpose which he had in view,) but in whom the law had discharged all
   its offices and acts; for this was required by the necessity of the
   cause about which the apostle was treating; because "the weakness of
   the law" could not be taught by the example of him who had not within
   himself all those things which are usually effected by the law. For the
   Jews might have always objected that some other persons had made still
   further progress through the power and efficacy of the law. If this
   observation, as well as many others, be diligently considered, it will
   be of great potency in effecting a persuasion that the present chapter
   must be understood as relating to a man who is under the law. And I
   feel fully persuaded within myself, that if views similar to these had
   entered into the minds of our expositors, when they explained this
   portion of Scripture, they would undoubtedly have interpreted it in
   this manner; for such were their piety and their learning, that I
   cannot bring myself to feel any other persuasion than this concerning
   them. But it frequently happens, that the fear of falling into error or
   heresy, if any passage be explained in a manner different from that
   generally received, hinders those who are under the influence of such a
   fear from venturing the more diligently to inspect such passage, and to
   consider whether it may not be explained appropriately and agreeably to
   the analogy of faith, even by that mode which is said to be favourable
   to heresy. I likewise believe, that this interpretation of mine is
   rejected by many persons who have never once thought on the mode in
   which the Scriptures define that man whom I assert to be described in
   this chapter. If they had earnestly endeavoured to ascertain this
   point, they would assuredly have discovered that all these things may
   be most commodiously explained concerning a man who is under the law. I
   will add, as the result of my own experience, that I have found
   multitudes who have not only not considered with sufficient diligence,
   but who also have not exhibited any desire to consider, what these
   names and epithets properly signify, and how they must be accurately
   distinguished from each other--the natural man, the carnal man, the
   outward man, the old man, the sensual man, the earthly man, the worldly
   man--also, the spiritual man, the heavenly man, the inward man, the new
   man, the illuminated man, the regenerate man, &c. The same persons also
   have not manifested any inclination to distinguish in an accurate and
   suitable manner between the acts and operations of the Spirit--when
   making use of the law, and when employing the gospel--when preparing a
   home or abode for himself, and when actually the inhabitant of his own
   temple--of his enlightening, regenerating and sealing--of his bringing
   men to Christ, uniting them to Christ--and communicating to them the
   benefits of Christ--of his operating, co-operating, exciting, aiding,
   assisting, and confirming or strengthening--and of his infusing habits,
   and producing good actions. All these things seem to me to be of such a
   description that if any person were, without a consideration of these
   matters, to attempt a serious and solid explanation of those things of
   which the apostle is treating in this chapter, his conduct would appear
   to me like that of a man who should endeavour to construct a large and
   splendid edifice without stones and lime. 4. These remarks I offer,
   with a sincere and candid mind, to those pious and learned men, and
   those eminent servants of Christ, my beloved brethren in Christ and
   fellow-labourers in the work of the Lord, who ought ever to receive
   from me all due honour and deference, to be read, known, judged, and
   approved or disapproved; and I request and most earnestly beseech of
   them only one thing, in the name of our common saviour--that, if they
   shall discover me to have written anything, in the preceding treatise,
   which is either contrary to the analogy of faith or contrary to the
   sense and meaning of the apostle, they will admonish, teach and
   instruct me about it in a fraternal manner. If they find any such
   matter, I testify, before God, that I will not only lend an attentive
   and patient hearing to their admonitions, teaching and instruction, but
   will also yield them full compliance. I likewise protest, that if, in
   the present instance, any things of this description have escaped from
   me, (for we all know but in part,) I consider them as not written and
   as not spoken. But if they shall perceive that these very things are
   agreeable to the rest of the Scriptures and conformable to the mind of
   the apostle, then I may be permitted to request and intreat from them
   that they will grant a place to the truth, thus pointed out, in the
   church of Christ, which is the pillar and ground of the truth. I
   solemnly engage, that there is no cause for them to be afraid lest
   disturbances, quarrels, dissensions, or the occasions of such great
   evils, in the Christian church, should arise from such an examination
   and conference. They will have to discuss the subject with one--who
   knows in part how to distinguish between those doctrines which are
   simply necessary and fundamental, and those which have not in them an
   equal necessity, but are as the parts of a superstructure raised on a
   foundation--who, next to the necessity for truth, thinks all things
   should be yielded to the peace of the churches--who can, with Christian
   charity, bear with those that differ from him, provided they do not
   attempt "to have dominion over the faith of other persons"--who is not
   desirous with an officious hastiness to obtrude on the public either
   his own admissions, or those of other persons, which had been confided
   to each other for the sake of a mutual conference, but who knows how to
   retain them faithfully, and has skill enough to revolve them in his
   mind for nine long years, according to the ancient proverb, "One day is
   the disciple of another; our later meditations are wiser and more
   accurate than our early ones; we daily grow old and yet are learning
   many things" Lastly, they will have to discuss the subject with one who
   may be in error, but who cannot be a heretic, and whose will assuredly
   it is not to be one. Amicable, fraternal, and placid conferences of
   this description, instituted between professors of the same faith and
   of the same religion, are not only useful, but likewise necessary to
   the churches of Christ, for the further investigation of the truth, for
   retaining it firmly when discovered, and for boldly defending it
   against adversaries. From these friendly conferences, we may discover
   truth, since they are not undertaken through a desire for victory, or
   for the sake of defending some topic which had been formerly conceived
   and adopted. But from those others, which are not so much Christian
   conferences, as vehement, bitter and vexatious altercations, and which
   we perceive to be agitated by the followers and defenders of different
   religious professions, generally ensues the result that is comprised in
   the vulgar proverb, "Truth is lost in the midst of their wrangling."
   Such an issue is no ground of surprise when the very method and
   circumstances of the altercation very often declare that the whole
   affair was at its commencement undertaken, and afterwards prosecuted,
   without the spirit of truth, charity and peace; and that, as a
   necessary consequence, it has been conducted to a sad catastrophe, most
   lamentable to the churches of Christ. And let no man rashly persuade
   himself, that as long as the [visible] church shall be a sojourner in
   this world, and shall have, in the midst of her, unskillful, infirm and
   wicked persons, she will maintain the doctrine of Christ so correctly
   as not to require a still further investigation of the truth from the
   Scriptures, which are the inexhaustible fountain of divine wisdom, as
   to be able to dispense with the examination of those dogmas which are
   built up as a superstructure on the foundation of the Scriptures, and
   as not to be under the least necessity of confirming and defending
   Christian doctrine, by the force and weight of solid arguments, against
   ancient heresies which have been polished up after a new method, and
   against novel heresies which are daily springing up and becoming still
   more prevalent. It is not an act of arrogance to enter upon such an
   exercise and employment as this, but it is an act of true and solid
   piety towards God, which commands and prescribes that, as "a
   dispensation of the gospel has been committed to us," we ought to "stir
   up the gifts of God which are in us," to study and strive to augment
   the talents which have been divinely granted to us, and, with a pure
   conscience and in the fear of the Lord, to discharge the duties of this
   sacred ministry, to the sanctification of his name, the building up and
   edification of the church of Christ, and to the demolition and
   extirpation of the kingdom of Satan and of Antichrist--which may the
   God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ vouchsafe to grant to us,
   through and for the sake of his only begotten Son, and in the power and
   efficacy of his Spirit. Amen. END OF DISSERTATION ON ROMANS.

   BENEVOLENT READER, IT cannot be a matter of secrecy to you, how
   various, uncertain and prodigious the rumors are which have been
   circulated through Holland, Germany, and Great Britain, concerning
   James Arminius, Professor of Divinity; and in what manner (I do not
   stop to discuss with how much zeal) some persons accuse this man of
   schism and others of heresy, some charge him with the crime of
   Pelagianism and others brand him with the black mark of Socinianism,
   while all of them execrate him as the pest of the reformed churches. On
   this account, those persons who feel a regard for the memory of this
   learned man, and who, not without good reason, are desirous of
   maintaining his reputation and character, and of defending him from
   those atrocious imputations and virulent calumnies, have lately
   published some of his erudite lucubrations, which are polished with the
   greatest care. They have thus placed them within the reach of the
   public, that the reader, who is eager in the pursuit after truth, may
   more easily and happily form his judgment about the station which
   Arminius is entitled to hold among posterity, not from fallacious
   rumors and the criminations of the malevolent, but from authentic
   documents, as if from the ingenuous confession itself of the accused
   speaking openly in his own cause, and mildly replying to the crimes
   with which he has been charged. With this object in view, the friends
   of Arminius have published, as separate treatises, his "Modest
   Examination of a Pamphlet, written some years ago by that very learned
   Divine, William Perkins, on Predestination: To which is added, an
   Analysis of the Ninth Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans," and his
   "Dissertation on the true and genuine Meaning of the Seventh Chapter of
   the Epistle to the Romans." But these two works are neither sufficient
   nor satisfactory to many dispositions that are prying or that indulge
   in surmises, and to other eminent men who abound with an acrimonious
   shrewdness of judgment; because they embrace neither the whole nor the
   chief of the perplexing difficulties of James Arminius. Some of those
   who attended his Academical Lectures, affirm that he frequently uttered
   novel and astounding paradoxes about other points of the orthodox
   doctrine [than are contained in the two works just mentioned]. Other
   persons relate, as a great secret, that Arminius addressed "A Letter"
   to Hippolytus a Collibus, in which he more fully discloses his own
   pestiferous sentiments; and that "CERTAIN ARTICLES" are circulated in a
   private manner, in which, while treating upon several of the chief
   heads of orthodox theology, he introduces his own poisonous dogmas. In
   this state of affairs, we may be permitted to give some assistance to
   an absent person, nay, to one who is dead, and to offer a reply to the
   accusations and criminations which we have now specified, by the
   evidence of witnesses who are worthy of credit, and by the publication
   of the very documents which we are thus challenged to produce. Perhaps,
   by this means, we shall be able to remove those sinister insinuations
   and suspicions. We shall, at least, meet the wishes of a number of
   persons, and shall terminate the anxieties of several minds that have
   till now been in a state of suspense. Accept, therefore, candid reader,
   of that "Letter" about which so many reports have been circulated, and
   which was addressed to Hippolytus a Collibus, Ambassador from Prince
   Frederick 4, the Electar Palatine. Accept, likewise, of those
   "ARTICLES" which are to be diligently examined and pondered, and which
   give us the sentiments of Arminius on the One and the Triune God, The
   Attributes of God, the Deity of the Son, Predestination and Divine
   Providence, Original Sin, Free Will, the Grace of God, Christ and his
   Satisfaction, Justification, Faith and Repentance, Regeneration, the
   Baptism of Infants, the Lords Supper, and On Magistracy. Accurately
   consider and candidly judge whatever he thought necessary to be amended
   or to be rendered more complete in the doctrine of the reformed
   churches. The writing of this man require no commendations from me, or
   from any other person: There is no need of ivy in this instance, for
   these productions will insure approbation.

  A LETTER, BY THE REV. JAMES ARMINIUS, D.D. &c. &c. TO HIS EXCELLENCY, THE
  NOBLE LORD, HIPPOLYTUS A COLLIBUS, AMBASSADOR, FROM THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
  PRINCE, THE ELECTOR PALATINE, TO THE SEVEN UNITED DUTCH PROVINCES, JAMES
  ARMINIUS WISHETH HEALTH AND SUCCESS MOST NONOURABLE SIR:

   When I was lately admitted to a conversation with you, you had the
   kindness to intimate to me the reports which you understood had been
   circulated at Heidelberg about my heterodoxy in certain articles of our
   faith; and you gave me this information, not only that you might
   yourself hear from me personally the whole truth about the matter, but,
   much more, that, by the intervention of your good offices, the
   suspicions concerning me, which have been so unhandsomely conceived and
   propagated, might be removed from the minds of other persons, since
   this is a course which truth requires. I endeavoured at that interview,
   with diligence and seriousness to comply with your obliging request,
   and by returning a frank and open reply to each of those questions
   which your excellency proposed, I instantly disclosed my sentiments
   about those several Articles. For, in addition to my being bound to do
   this, by my duty as a Christian man, and especially as a divine, such a
   course of conduct was demanded from me by the great candour,
   condescension and benevolence which you exhibited towards me. But my
   explanation was so agreeable to your excellency, (which I ascribe to an
   act of the divine Benignity towards me,) as to induce you, on that
   occasion, to think it requisite that those propositions of mine should
   be committed to writing and transmitted to you, not only for the
   purpose of being thus enabled the more certainly and firmly to form
   your own judgment about the matter when you had maturely reflected upon
   it, but also with the design of communicating my written answers to
   others, that they might confute the calumny and vindicate my innocence.
   Having followed the counsel of your prudence, and firmly relying on the
   same hope, I now accede to your further wishes, in this letter; and I
   intreat your excellency to have the goodness to peruse its contents
   with the same candour and equanimity as were displayed when you
   listened to their delivery. Unless my mind greatly deceives me, your
   excellency will find in this letter that which will not only be able to
   obliterate, but also completely to eradicate, every unjust suspicion
   concerning me, from the minds of those good men who know that every one
   is the best interpreter of his own sentiments, and that the utmost
   credit is to be given to him who sacredly, and in the presence of God,
   bears testimony to his own meaning. The articles of doctrine about
   which your excellency made inquiries, were, as far as my memory serves
   me, the following: the Divinity of the Son of God, Providence, Divine
   Predestination, Grace and Free Will, and Justification. Beside these,
   you inquired about the things which concerned our opinions, in answer
   to the interrogatories of the States of Holland, concerning the mode of
   holding the proposed synod. But as the latter relate to that most
   eminent man, the Revelation John Uytenbogard, minister of the church at
   the Hague, as much as to me, I leave them to be explained by him, whose
   residence is much nearer to that of your excellency. With regard to all
   these doctrinal Articles, I confidently declare that I have never
   taught anything, either in the church or in the university, which
   contravenes the sacred writings, that ought to be with us the sole rule
   of thinking and of speaking, or which is opposed to the Dutch
   Confession of Faith, or to the Heidelberg Catechism, that are our
   stricter formularies of consent. In proof of this assertion I might
   produce, as most clear and unquestionable testimonies, the theses which
   I have composed on these several Articles, and which have been
   discussed as Public Disputations in the university; but as those theses
   are not entirely in readiness for every one, and can be with difficulty
   transmitted, I will now treat upon each of them specially, as far as I
   shall conceive it necessary.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE DIVINITY OF THE SON OF GOD.

   Concerning the divinity of the Son of God, I have taught, and still
   teach, that the Father has never been without his Word and his Spirit,
   but that the Word and the Spirit are not to be considered in the Father
   under the notion of properties, as wisdom, goodness, justice, or power,
   but under that of really existing persons, to whom it belongs to be, to
   live, to understand, to will, to be capable, and to do or act, all of
   which, when united, are indications and proofs of a person, but that
   they are so in the Father as to be also from the Father, in a certain
   order of origin, not through collaterality, to be referred to the
   Father, and that they are from the Father neither by creation nor by
   decision but by a most wonderful and inexplicable internal emanation,
   which, with respect to the Son, the ancient church called generation,
   but with respect to the Holy Spirit, was denominated spiration or
   breathing, a term required by the very [etymon of the] word spirit. But
   about this breathing, I do not interpose my judgment -- whether it is
   from the Father and the Son, as the Latin fathers express themselves,
   or from the Father through the Son, as the Greek fathers prefer to
   define it, because this matter, I confess, far surpasses my capacity.
   If, on any subject, we ought to think and speak with sobriety, in my
   opinion, it must be on this. Since these are my sentiments on the
   divinity of the Son of God, no reason could exist why, on this point, I
   should endure the shafts of calumny. Yet this slander was first
   fabricated and spread through the whole of Germany by one in whom such
   conduct was exceedingly indecorous; because he was my pupil, and ought
   to have refrained from that course, having been taught by his own
   painful experience that he either possessed an unhappy memory, or was
   of doubtful credit; for he had previously been convicted of a similar
   calumny, and had openly confessed his fault before me, and requested my
   forgiveness. But, as I learned from a certain manuscript which was
   transmitted to Leyden out of Germany, and which the same youth had
   delivered to the Heidelberg divines, he took the groundwork of his
   calumny from those things which I had publicly taught concerning the
   economy of our salvation, as administered by the Father through the Son
   and the Holy Spirit. In the explanation of this economy, I had said
   "that we must have a diligent regard to this order, which the
   Scriptures in every part most religiously observe; and that we must
   distinctly consider what things are attributed as peculiar to the
   Father in this matter, what to the Son, and what to the Holy Spirit."
   After this, some other persons seized upon a different occasion for the
   same calumny, from my having said that the Son of God was not correctly
   called Autoqeon "very God," in the same sense in which that word
   signifies "God from himself." This audacious inclination for
   calumniating was promoted by the circumstance of my having explained in
   a different manner, certain passages of the Old and New Testament,
   which have been usually adduced to establish the Consubstantiality or
   the coessentiality of the trinity. But I can with ease in a moment
   shew, from the books of the Old and New Testament themselves, from the
   whole of antiquity, and from the sentiments of the ancient church, both
   Greek and Latin, as well as from the testimony of our own divines, that
   nothing can be deduced from those alleged misinterpreted passages,
   which is with the least semblance of probability, adverse to the sound
   and orthodox faith. In his able defense of Calvin, against the treatise
   of Hunnius, entitled "Calvin Judaizing," the learned Paraeus has taught
   that this last occasion was seized upon in vain; and he has liberated
   me from the necessity of this service. To spend any time in confuting
   the first slander, which was circulated by the young student, would not
   repay my trouble. Those who know that the Father in the Son hath
   reconciled the world unto himself, and administers the word of
   reconciliation through the Spirit, know, likewise, that, in the
   dispensation of salvation, an order must be considered among the
   persons of the Trinity, and their attributes must not be confounded,
   unless they be desirous of falling into the heresy of the
   Patripassionists. Respecting the second occasion, which concerns the
   word Autoqeon "very God," an answer somewhat more laboured must be
   undertaken, because there are not a few persons who are of a contrary
   opinion, and yet our church does not consider such persons as holding
   wrong sentiments concerning the trinity. This is the manner in which
   they propound their doctrine. "Because the essence of the Father and of
   the Son is one, and because it has its origin from no one, therefore,
   in this respect, the Son is correctly denominated Autoqeon that is, God
   from himself." But I reply, "The essence of the Son is from no one, or
   is from himself," is not the same as "the Son is from himself, or from
   no one." For, to speak in a proper and formal manner, the Son is not an
   essence, but having his essence by a certain mode Uparxewv of being or
   existence. They rejoin -- "The Son may be considered in two respects,
   "as he is the Son, and as he is God. As he is the Son, he is from the
   Father, and has his essence from the Father. But as he is God, he has
   his essence from himself or from no one." But the latter of these
   expressions is the most correct; for to have his essence from himself
   implies a contradiction. I reply, I admit this distinction; but it is
   extended much further than is allowable. For as he is God, he has the
   divine essence. As he is the Son, he has it from the Father. That is,
   by the word "God," is signified, generally, that which has the divine
   essence without any certain mode of subsistence. But, by the word "the
   Son," is signified a certain mode of having the divine essence, which
   is through communication from the Father, that is, through generation.
   Let these double ternaries be taken into consideration, which are
   opposed to each other, in one series, To have Deity -- To BE God To
   have Deity from the Father -- To BE the Son To have Deity from no one
   -- To BE the Father And it will be evident, that among themselves they
   mutually correspond with each other, thus: "to have Deity," and "to be
   God" -- "to have Deity from the Father," and "to be the Son" -- "to
   have Deity from no one," and "to be the Father" -- are consentaneous,
   though under the word "Father," as an affirmative, that is not
   signified which has its essence from no one; for this is signified by
   the word "ingenitus, inwardly born, which is attributed to the Father,
   though not with strictness, but only to signify that the Father has not
   his essence by the mode of generation. But the word "FATHER" by its own
   force and meaning is conclusive on this point: For where order is
   established, it is necessary that a beginning be made from some first
   person or thing, otherwise there will be confusion proceeding onwards
   ad infinitum. But, with respect to origin, he who is the first in this
   order has his origin from no one; he who is the second, has his origin
   from the first; he who is the third has his origin from the first and
   the second, or from the first through the second. Were not this the
   real state of the matter; there would be a Collaterality, which would
   make as many Gods as there were collateral persons laid down; since the
   Unity of the Deity in the trinity is defended against the
   Anti-trinitarians solely by the relation of origin and of order
   according to origin. But that it may evidently appear what were the
   sentiments of antiquity about this matter, I will here adduce from the
   ancient fathers, both of the Greek and Latin church, some passages
   which are applicable to this subject. BASIL THE GREAT According to the
   habit of causes to those things which are from them, we say that the
   Father has precedence before the Son. (Ever. lib. 1.) - because the Son
   has his source from the Father. According to this, the Father is the
   greater, as the cause and the source. Wherefore our Lord also has said,
   "My Father is greater than I," that is, because He is the Father. But
   what other signification can the word "FATHER" have, than the cause and
   the beginning of Him who is begotten from Him? (Ibid.) The Father is
   the root and the fountain of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. (Discourse
   against the Sabellians and Arius.) When I have said "one essence," I do
   not understand two [persons] distinguished from one, but the Son
   subsisting from the source of the Father, not the Father and Son from
   one superior essence. For we do not call them "brothers," but we
   confess them to be "the FATHER and the SON." But essence is identity,
   because the Son is from the Father, not made by command, but begotten
   from nature; not divided from the Father, but while he remains perfect,
   reflecting perfectly back again the light. But that you may not be able
   to charge these our assertions against us as a crime, and lest you
   should say, "He preaches two gods; he announces a multitude of
   deities;" there are not two gods, neither are there two fathers. He who
   produces two original sources, preaches two gods. (Ibid.) The way of
   the knowledge of God is, by one Spirit, through one Son, to one Father.
   And, on the contrary, natural goodness, natural sanctification, and
   royal dignity are transmitted from the Father, through the only
   begotten Son, to the Spirit. Thus we confess the persons [in the
   Godhead] and at the same time the pious doctrine of the unity is not
   undermined. (On the Holy Spirit, cap. 18.) GREGORY NAZIANZEN THE
   essence is common and equal to the Son with the Father, though the Son
   has it from the Father. (Fourth Discourse on Theology.) How is it
   possible for the same thing to be greater than itself and yet equal to
   itself? Is it not, therefore, plain, that the word "greater," which is
   attributed to the Father in reference to the Son, must be referred to
   CAUSE; but the word "equal," which is attributed to the Son, as to his
   equality with the Father, must be referred to Nature? (Ibid.) It may
   indeed be truly said, but not therefore so honourably, that, "with
   regard to the humanity, the Father is greater than the Son:" For what
   is there wonderful in God being greater than man? (Ibid.) AMBROSE
   Though Christ has redeemed us, yet "all things are of God," because
   from him is all the paternity. It is, therefore, of necessity that the
   person of the Father have the precedence. (On 2 Corinthians v. 18.)
   Consult also his remarks On 1 Corinthians 15. AUGUSTINE IF that which
   begets is the original source of that which is begotten, the Father is
   the source of the Son, because he begets him. (On the Trinity, lib. 5,
   cap. 14.) He did not say "whom the Father will send from me," as He
   said, "whom I will send from the Father," that is, plainly shewing the
   Father to be the source of the entire Deity. (Ibid. Lib. 4, Cap. 10.) -
   Therefore this was said concerning the Father: "He doeth the works;"
   because from Him also is the origin of the works, from whom the
   cooperating persons [in the Deity] have their existence: For both the
   Son is born of Him, and the Holy Spirit principally proceeds from Him,
   from whom the Son is born, and with whom the same Spirit is common with
   the Son. (Idem, tom. 10, fol. 11, col. 1.) Indeed God the Father is not
   God from another God; but God the Son is God from God the Father. But
   the Son is as much from the Father, as the Father is from no one.
   (Against Maximinus, Lib. 3, cap. 23, col. 2.) HILARY There is no God
   who is eternal and without beginning, and who is God to that God from
   whom are all things. But the Father is God to the Son; for from Him He
   was born God. (Lib. 4, fol. 60.) The confession of the true faith is,
   God is so born of God, as light is from light, which, without detriment
   to itself, offers its own nature from itself, that it may bestow that
   which it has, and that it may have what it bestows, &c. (Lib. 6, fol
   87.) It is apparent from these passages, according to the sentiments of
   the ancient church, that the Son, even as he is God, is from the
   Father, because he has received his Deity, according to which he is
   called "God," by being born of the Father; though the name of God does
   not indicate this mode of being or existence. From these quotations, it
   is also evident that, because the Father is the source of the Son, and
   of the Holy Spirit, he is called the source of the whole Deity; not
   indeed because God has any beginning or source, but because the Deity
   is communicated by the Father to the Son and the Holy Spirit. So far,
   therefore, is this from being a correct expression: "The Son of God as
   he is God, is from no one; and, with respect to his essence, is from
   himself or from no one." For he who has received his essence by being
   born of the Father, is from the Father with respect to his essence. I
   consider, therefore, that those who desire to think and to speak with
   orthodox antiquity, ought to abstain from these methods of expression;
   because, by adopting them, they seem to become the patrons of the
   opposing heresies of the Tritheists, and the Sabellians. Peruse the
   preface to the Dialogues of St. Athanasius On the Trinity, by Theodoure
   Beza; who excuses Calvin by saying, that he did not so solicitously
   observe the difference between the two phrases - - "He is the Son per
   se, through himself," and "He is the Son a se, from himself." If any
   one be desirous of knowing from me anything further on this point, I
   will not refuse to hold a placid conference with him either in writing
   or by conversation. I now proceed to the other topics, in the
   discussion of which I will consult brevity.
     __________________________________________________________________

  THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD

   My sentiments respecting the providence of God are these: It is present
   with, and presides over, all things; and all things, according to their
   essences, quantities, qualities, relations, actions, passions, places,
   times, stations and habits, are subject to its governance,
   conservation, and direction. I except neither particular, sublunary,
   vile, nor contingent things, not even the free wills of men or of
   angels, either good or evil: And, what is still more, I do not take
   away from the government of the divine providence even sins themselves,
   whether we take into our consideration their commencement, their
   progress, or their termination. 1. With respect to the Beginning of
   Sin, I attribute the following acts to the providence of God: First.
   Permission, and that not idle, but which has united in it four positive
   acts: (1.) The preservation of the creature according to essence, life
   and capability. (2.) Care lest a greater or an equal power be placed in
   opposition. (3.) The offering of an object against which sin will be
   committed. (4.) The destined concession of its concurrence, which, on
   account of the dependence of a second on the first cause, is a
   necessary concurrence. Secondly. The administration of arguments and
   occasions, soliciting to the perpetration of sin. Thirdly. The
   determination of place, time, manner, and of similar circumstances.
   Fourthly. The immediate concurrence itself of God with the act of sin.
   2. With respect to the Progress of sin, I attribute also the following
   four acts to the divine government: The First is the direction of sin
   that is already begun, to a certain object, at which the offending
   creature either has not aimed, or has not absolutely aimed. The Second
   act is the direction of sin to the end which God himself wills, whether
   the creature intend or do not intend that end, nay, though he intend
   another and quite opposite end. The Third act is the prescribing and
   determination of the time during which he wills or permits sin to
   endure. The Fourth act is the defining of its magnitude, by which
   limits are placed on sin, that it may not increase and assume greater
   strength. The whole of these acts, both concerning the commencement and
   the progress of sin, I consider distinctly in reference to the act
   itself, and to the anomy or transgression of the law, a course which,
   according to my judgment, is necessary and useful. 3. Lastly, with
   respect to the END and COMPLETION of sin, I attribute to divine
   providence either punishment through severity, or remission through
   grace; which are occupied about sin, in reference to its being sin and
   to its being a transgression, of the law. But I most solicitously avoid
   two causes of offense -- that God be not proposed as the author of sin,
   and that its liberty be not taken away from the human will. These are
   two points which, if any one knows how to avoid, he will think upon no
   act which I will not in that case most gladly allow to be ascribed to
   the providence of God, provided a just regard be had to the divine
   pre-eminence. But I have given a most ample explanation of these my
   sentiments, in the theses which were twice publicly disputed on the
   same subject in the university. On this account, therefore, I declare
   that I am much surprised, and not without good reason, at my being
   aspersed with this calumny - - that l hold corrupt opinions respecting
   the providence of God. If it be allowable to indulge in conjecture, I
   think this slander had its origin in the fact of my denying that, with
   respect to the decree of God, Adam necessarily sinned -- an assertion
   which I yet constantly deny, and think it one that ought not to be
   tolerated, unless the word "necessarily" be received in the acceptation
   of "infallibly," as it is by some persons; though this change does not
   agree with the etymology of the two words; for, necessity is an
   affection of being, but infallibility is an affection of the mind. Yet
   I easily endure the use of the first of these words, provided those two
   inconveniences to which I have recently alluded be faithfully avoided.
     __________________________________________________________________

  DIVINE PREDESTINATION

   With respect to the article of predestination, my sentiments upon it
   are the following: It is an eternal and gracious decree of God in
   Christ, by which he determines to justify and adopt believers, and to
   endow them with life eternal, but to condemn unbelievers, and
   impenitent persons; as I have explained in the theses on the same
   subject, which were publicly disputed, and in which, no one found any
   thing to be reprehended as false or unsound. Only it was the opinion of
   some persons that those theses did not contain all the things which
   belong to this decree; nay, that the predestination about which there
   is the greatest controversy at this time, is not the subject of
   investigation in those theses. This indeed I confess; for I considered
   it the best course to discuss that decree of predestination which is
   the foundation of Christianity, of our salvation, and of the assurance
   of salvation, and upon which the apostle treats in the eighth and ninth
   chapters of the epistle to the Romans, and in the first chapter of that
   to the Ephesians- But such a decree as I have there described is not
   that by which God resolves to save some particular persons, and, that
   he may do this, resolves to endow them with faith, but to condemn
   others and not to endow them with faith. Yet many people declare, that
   this is the kind of predestination on which the apostle treats in the
   passages just cited. But I deny what they assert. I grant that there is
   a certain eternal decree of God, according to which he administers the
   means necessary to faith and salvation, and this he does in such a
   manner as he knows to be suited to righteousness, that is, to his mercy
   and his severity. But about this decree, I think nothing more is
   necessary to be known, than that faith is the mere gift of the gracious
   mercy of God; and that unbelief is partly to be attributed to the fault
   and wickedness of men, and partly to the just vengeance of God, which
   deserts, blinds and hardens sinners. But concerning that predestination
   by which God has decreed to save and to endow with faith some
   particular persons, but to damn others and not endow them with faith,
   so various are the sentiment, entertained even by the divines of our
   profession, that this very diversity of opinion easily declares the
   difficulty with which it is possible to determine any thing respecting
   it. For while some of them propose, as the object of predestination
   generally considered, that is, of election and reprobation, man as a
   sinner and fallen in Adam, others lay it down, man considered as
   created and placed "in puris naturalibus." Some of them consider this
   object to be, man to be created, or, as some of them express it, man as
   salvable and damnable, as capable of being created and of falling.
   Others of them lay down the object of election and reprobation, which
   they denominate Nonelection and Preterition, man considered in common
   and absolutely; but they lay down the object of reprobation, on which
   they bestow the appellation of Predamnation and Affirmative
   Reprobation, man a sinner and guilty in Adam. Lastly, some of them
   suppose that the object must be considered entirely in common, man as
   yet to be created, as created, and as fallen. I am aware that when this
   diversity of opinion is offered as an objection, it is usual to reply
   that, in the substance of the matter there is complete agreement,
   although some difference exists in the circumstances. But it would be
   in my power to prove, that the preceding opinions differ greatly in
   many of the things which conduce to the very matter and substance of
   this kind of predestination; but that of consent or agreement there is
   nothing except in the minds of those who hold such sentiments, and who
   are prepared to bear with those who dissent from them as far as these
   points extend. Such a mode of consent as this, [of which they are
   themselves the patrons,] is of the highest necessity in the Christian
   church -- as, without it, peace can by no means be preserved. I wish
   that I also was able to experience from them any such benevolent
   feelings towards me and my sentiments. In that species of
   predestination upon which I have treated, I define nothing that is not
   equally approved by all. On this point, alone, I differ -- I dare not
   with a safe conscience maintain in the affirmative any of the preceding
   opinions. I am also prepared to give a reason for this conscientious
   scruple when it shall be demanded by necessity, and can be done in a
   suitable manner.
     __________________________________________________________________

  GRACE AND FREE WILL

   Concerning grace and free will, this is what I teach according to the
   Scriptures and orthodox consent: Free will is unable to begin or to
   perfect any true and spiritual good, without grace. That I may not be
   said, like Pelagius, to practice delusion with regard to the word
   "grace," I mean by it that which is the grace of Christ and which
   belongs to regeneration. I affirm, therefore, that this grace is simply
   and absolutely necessary for the illumination of the mind, the due
   ordering of the affections, and the inclination of the will to that
   which is good. It is this grace which operates on the mind, the
   affections, and the will; which infuses good thoughts into the mind,
   inspires good desires into the actions, and bends the will to carry
   into execution good thoughts and good desires. This grace goes before,
   accompanies, and follows; it excites, assists, operates that we will,
   and co-operates lest we will in vain. It averts temptations, assists
   and grants succour in the midst of temptations, sustains man against
   the flesh, the world and Satan, and in this great contest grants to man
   the enjoyment of the victory. It raises up again those who are
   conquered and have fallen, establishes and supplies them with new
   strength, and renders them more cautious. This grace commences
   salvation, promotes it, and perfects and consummates it. I confess that
   the mind of a natural and carnal man is obscure and dark, that his
   affections are corrupt and inordinate, that his will is stubborn and
   disobedient, and that the man himself is dead in sins. And I add to
   this -- that teacher obtains my highest approbation who ascribes as
   much as possible to divine grace, provided he so pleads the cause of
   grace, as not to inflict an injury on the justice of God, and not to
   take away the free will to that which is evil. I do not perceive what
   can be further required from me. Let it only be pointed out, and I will
   consent to give it, or I will shew that I ought not to give such an
   assent. Therefore, neither do I perceive with what justice I can be
   calumniated on this point, since I have explained these my sentiments,
   with sufficient plainness, in the theses on free will which were
   publicly disputed in the university.
     __________________________________________________________________

  JUSTIFICATION

   The last article is on justification, about which these are my
   sentiments: Faith, and faith only, (though there is no faith alone
   without works,) is imputed for righteousness. By this alone are we
   justified before God, absolved from our sins, and are accounted,
   pronounced and declared righteous by God, who delivers his judgment
   from the throne of grace. I do not enter into the question be the
   active and the passive righteousness of Christ, or that of his death
   and of his life. On this subject, I walk at liberty: I say "Christ has
   been made of God to me righteousness" -- "he has been made sin for me,
   that through faith, I may be the righteousness of God in him." Nor yet
   do I refuse to confer with my brethren on this question, provided such
   conference be conducted without bitterness, and without an opinion of
   necessity, [that the partial view of any one should be generally
   received,] from which scarcely any other result can ensue than the
   existence of distraction, and of increased effervescence in the minds
   of men, especially if this discussion should occur between those who
   are hot controversialists, and too vehement in their zeal. But some
   persons charge me with this as a crime -- that I say the act itself of
   faith, that is, believing itself, is imputed for righteousness, and
   that in a proper sense, and not by a metonymy. I acknowledge this
   charge, as I have the apostle St. Paul, in Romans 4, and in other
   passages, as my precursor in the use of this phrase. But the conclusion
   which they draw from this affirmation, namely, "that Christ and his
   righteousness are excluded from our justification, and that our
   justification is thus attributed to the worthiness of our faith," I by
   no means concede it to be possible for them to deduce from my
   sentiments. For the word "to impute ," signifies that faith is not
   righteousness itself, but is graciously accounted for righteousness; by
   which circumstance all worthiness is taken away from faith, except that
   which is through the gracious condescending estimation of God. But this
   gracious condescension and estimation is not without Christ, but in
   reference to Christ, in Christ, and on account of Christ, whom God hath
   appointed as the propitiation through faith in his blood. I affirm,
   therefore, that faith is imputed to us for righteousness, on account of
   Christ and his righteousness. In this enunciation, faith is the object
   of imputation; but Christ and his obedience are the impetratory
   [procuring] or meritorious cause of justification. Christ and his
   obedience are the object of our faith, but not the object of
   justification or divine imputation, as if God imputes Christ and his
   righteousness to us for righteousness. This cannot possibly be, since
   the obedience of Christ is righteousness itself, taken according to the
   most severe rigor of the law. But I do not deny that the obedience of
   Christ is imputed to us; that is, that it is accounted or reckoned for
   us and for our benefit, because this very thing -- that God reckons the
   righteousness of Christ to have been performed for us and for our
   benefit -- is the cause why God imputes to us for righteousness our
   faith, which has Christ and his righteousness for its object and
   foundation, and why he justifies us by faith, from faith, or through
   faith. If any one will point out an error in this my opinion, I will
   gladly own it, because it is possible for me to err, but I am not
   willing to be a heretic. The preceding, then, as far as I remember, are
   the Articles which your excellency mentioned to me, with my
   explanations of them produced from sincerity of mind; and as thus
   sincere, I wish them to be accounted by all who see them. This one
   favour I wish I could obtain from my brethren, who are associated with
   me in the Lord by the profession of the same religion, that they would
   at least believe me to have some feeling of conscience towards God. And
   this favour ought to be easily granted by them, through the charity of
   Christ, if they be desirous to study his disposition and nature. Of
   what service to me can a dissension be which is undertaken merely
   through a reckless humour of mind, or a schism created in the church of
   Christ, of which, by the grace of God and Christ, I profess myself to
   be a member? If my brethren suppose that I am incited to such an
   enterprise through ambition or avarice, I sincerely declare in the
   Lord, that they know me not. But I can confess that I am so free from
   the latter of these vices, as never to have been tickled, on any
   occasion, with even the most enticing of its snares -- though it might
   be in my power to excuse or palliate it under some pretext or other.
   With regard to ambition, I possess it not, except to that honourable
   kind which impels me to this service -- to inquire with all earnestness
   in the Holy Scriptures for divine truth, and mildly and without
   contradiction to declare it when found, without prescribing it to any
   one, or labouring to extort consent, much less through a desire to
   "have dominion over the faith of others," but rather for the purpose of
   my winning some souls for Christ, that I may be a sweet savour to him,
   and may obtain an approved reputation in the church of the saints. This
   good name I hope I shall obtain by the grace of Christ, after a long
   period of patient endurance; though I be now a reproach to my brethren,
   and "made as the filth of the world and the offscouring of all things"
   to those who with me worship and invoke one God the Father, and one
   Lord Jesus Christ, in one spirit and with the same faith, and who have
   the same hope with me of obtaining the heavenly inheritance through the
   grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. I hope the Lord will grant unto me,
   that they and I may meekly meet together in his great name, and
   institute a Christian conference about those things which appertain to
   religion. O may the light of that sacred and happy day speedily shine
   upon me. In that assembly, I engage, through the grace of God, to
   manifest such moderation of mind, and such love for truth and peace, as
   ought deservedly to be required and expected from a servant of Christ
   Jesus. In the mean time [till this assembly can be convened], let my
   brethren themselves remain quiescent and suffer me to be quiet, that I
   may be at peace, and neither annoy them, nor create any uneasiness. If
   they entertain other thoughts concerning me, let them institute an
   [ecclesiastical] action against me; I will not shun or evade the
   authority of a competent judge, neither will I forfeit my recognizances
   by failing to appear. If it be supposed that the minds of those who
   hear me are preoccupied in my favour, at a distance, by some politic
   subtlety which I display, and that the matter is so managed through
   cunning, as makes my brethren neither to consider it advisable to
   arraign me before the judges, nor to account it sufficiently safe to
   commit to my care the youthful students; and therefore, that the black
   stain which I have deserved ought to be affixed to my reputation, that
   my pupils and hearers may be frightened away; therefore, lest the
   result of this should be that the deferring of such a conference be
   productive of certain danger, behold I now offer myself, that I may, in
   company with them, address, solicit, and intreat those high personages
   who are invested with the power of issuing a summons for a convention
   of this kind, or of granting it, not to suffer us any longer to
   continue in this anguish and disquietude of mind, but either themselves
   to apply a speedy remedy, or allow it to be applied by others, but
   still by their order and under their direction. I will not refuse to
   place myself before any assembly whatsoever, whether it be composed of
   all the ministers in our United Netherlands, or of some to be convoked
   from each of the seven provinces, or even of all the ministers of
   Holland and West Friesland, to which province our university at Leyden
   belongs, or of some ministers to be selected out of these, provided the
   whole affair be transacted under the cognizance of our lawful
   magistrates. Nor do I avoid or dread the presence of learned men, who
   may be invited from other countries, provided they be present at the
   conference on equitable conditions, and subject to the same laws as
   those under which I must be placed. To express the whole matter at once
   -- let a convention be summoned, consisting of many members or of few,
   provided some bright hope of success be afforded [to them], a hope, I
   repeat it, which I shall be able, by sound arguments, to prove
   destitute of good foundation. Behold me, this day, nay, this very hour,
   prepared and ready to enter into it. For I am weary of being daily
   aspersed with the filthy scum of fresh calumnies, and grieved at being
   burdened with the necessity of clearing myself from them. In this part
   of my conduct, I am assuredly dissimilar from heretics, who have either
   avoided ecclesiastical assemblies, or have managed matters so as to be
   able to confide in the number of their retainers, and to expect a
   certain victory. But I have finished. For I have occupied your
   attention, most honourable sir, a sufficient length of time; and I have
   made a serious encroachment on those valuable moments which you would
   have devoted to matters of greater importance. Your excellency will
   have the condescension to forgive the liberty which I have taken to
   address this letter to you, as it has been extorted from me by a degree
   of necessity -- and not to disdain to afford me your patronage and
   protection, just so far as divine truth and the peace and concord of
   the Christian church will allow you to vouchsafe. I pray and beseech
   Almighty God long to preserve your excellency in safety, to endue you
   yet more with the spirit of wisdom and prudence, by which you may be
   enabled to discharge the duties of the embassy which has been imposed
   upon you, and thus meet the wishes of the most illustrious prince, the
   Elector Palatine. And, after you have happily discharged those duties,
   may he benignantly and graciously grant to you a prosperous return to
   your own country and kindred. Thus prays Your excellency's most devoted
   servant,

CERTAIN ARTICLES TO BE DILIGENTLY EXAMINED AND WEIGHED. BECAUSE SOME CONTROVERSY
HAS ARISEN CONCERNING THEM AMONG EVEN THOSE WHO PROFESS THE REFORMED RELIGION

   These articles are partly either denied or affirmed in a decisive
   manner, and partly either denied or affirmed in a doubting manner, each
   of which methods signified by certain indicative signs which are added
   to the different articles. I. ON THE
     __________________________________________________________________

  SCRIPTURE AND HUMAN TRADITIONS

   The rule of theological verity is not two-fold, one primary and the
   other secondary; but it is one and simple, the Sacred Scriptures. 2.
   The Scriptures are the rule of all divine verity, from themselves, in
   themselves, and through themselves; and it is a rash assertion, "that
   they are indeed the rule, but only when understood according to the
   meaning of the confession of the Dutch churches, or when explained by
   the interpretation of the Heidelberg Catechism." 3. No writing composed
   by men -- by one man, by few men, or by many -- (with the exception of
   the Holy Scriptures,) is either axiopison "creditable of itself," or
   autopison "of itself deserving of implicit credence," and, therefore,
   is not exempted from an examination to be instituted by means of the
   Scriptures. 4. It is a thoughtless assertion, "that the Confession and
   Catechism are called in question, when they are subjected to
   examination;" for they have never been placed beyond the hazard of
   being called in doubt, nor can they be so placed. 5. It is tyrannical
   and popish to bind the consciences of men by human writings, and to
   hinder them from being submitted to a legitimate examination, under
   what pretext soever such tyrannical conduct is adopted.
     __________________________________________________________________

  II. ON GOD CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE

   GOD is good by a natural and internal necessity, not freely; which last
   word is stupidly explained by the terms "unconstrainedly" and "not
   slavishly." 2. God foreknows future things through the infinity of his
   essence, and through the pre-eminent perfection of his understanding
   and prescience, not as he willed or decreed that they should
   necessarily be done, though he would not foreknow them except as they
   were future, and they would not be future unless God had decreed either
   to perform or to permit them. 3. God loves righteousness and his
   creatures, yet he loves righteousness still more than the creatures,
   from which, two consequences follow: 4. The First, that God does not
   hate his creature, except on account of sin. 5. The Second, that God
   absolutely loves no creature to life eternal, except when considered as
   righteous, either by legal or evangelical righteousness. 6. The will of
   God is both correctly and usefully distinguished into that which is
   antecedent, and that which is consequent. 7. The distinction of the
   will of God into that which is secret or of his good pleasure, and that
   which is revealed or signified, cannot bear a rigid examination. 8.
   Punitive justice and mercy neither are, nor can they be "the only
   moving" or final causes of the first decree, or of its first operation.
   9. God is blessed in himself and in the knowledge of his own
   perfection. He is, therefore, in want of nothing, neither does he
   require the demonstration of any of his properties by external
   operations: Yet if he do this, it is evident that he does it of His
   pure and free will; although, in this declaration [of any of His
   properties] a certain order must be observed according to the various
   egresses or "goings forth" of his goodness, and according to the
   prescript of his wisdom and justice.
     __________________________________________________________________

  III. ON GOD, CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THE RELATION BETWEEN THE PERSONS IN THE
  TRINITY

   The Son of God is not called by the ancient fathers "God from himself,"
   and this is a dangerous expression. For, Autoqeov [as thus interpreted,
   God from himself,] properly signifies that the Son has not the divine
   essence from another -- But it is by a catachresis, or improperly, that
   the essence which the Son has is not from another; because the relation
   of the subject is thus changed: for "the Son," and "the divine
   essence," differ in relation. 2. The divine essence is communicated to
   the Son by the Father, and this properly and truly. Wherefore it is
   unskillfully asserted "that the divine essence is indeed properly said
   to be common to the Son and to the Father, but is improperly said to be
   communicated:" For it is not common to both except in reference to its
   being communicated. 3. The Son of God is correctly called Autoqeov
   "very God," as this word is received for that which is God himself,
   truly God. But he is erroneously designated by that epithet, so far as
   it signifies that he has an essence not communicated by the Father, yet
   has one in common with the Father. 4. "The Son of God, in regard to his
   essence, is from himself," is an ambiguous expression, and, on that
   account, dangerous. Neither is the ambiguity removed by saying "The
   Son, with respect to his absolute essence, or to his essence absolutely
   considered, is from himself." Besides, these modes of speaking are not
   only novel, but are also mere prattle. 5. The divine persons are not
   trowoi uparxewv or modes of being or of existing, or modes of the
   divine essence; For they are things with the mode of being or existing.
   6. The divine persons are distinguished by a real distinction, not by
   the degree and mode of the thing. 7. A. person is an individual
   subsistence itself, not a characteristic property, nor is it an
   individual principle; though it be not an individual, nor a person,
   without a characteristic property or without an individual principle.
   8. QUERIES. -- Is it not useful that the Trinity be considered, both as
   it exists in nature itself, according to the co-essential relation of
   the divine persons, and as it has been manifested in the economy of
   salvation, to be accomplished by God the Father, in Christ, through the
   Holy Spirit? And does not the former of these considerations appertain
   to religion universally, and to that which was prescribed to Adam,
   according to the law? But the latter consideration properly belongs to
   the gospel of Jesus Christ, yet not excluding that which I have
   mentioned as belonging to all religion universally, and therefore to
   that which is Christian.
     __________________________________________________________________

  IV. ON THE DECREE OF GOD

   The decrees of God are the extrinsic acts of God, though they are
   internal, and, therefore, made by the free will of God, without any
   absolute necessity. Yet one decree seems to require the supposition of
   another, on account of a certain fitness of equity; as the decree
   concerning the creation of a rational creature, and the decree
   concerning the salvation or damnation [of that creature] on the
   condition of obedience or disobedience. The act of the creature also,
   when considered by God from eternity, may sometimes be the occasion,
   and sometimes the outwardly moving cause of making some decree; and
   this may be so fare that without such act [of the creature] the decree
   neither would nor could be made. 2. QUERY. -- Can the act of the
   creature impose a necessity on God of making some decree, and indeed a
   decree of a particular kind and no other -- and this not only according
   to some act to be performed respecting the creature and his act, but
   also according to a certain mode by which that act must be
   accomplished? 3. One and the same in number is the volition by which
   God decrees something and determines to do or to permit it, and by
   which he does or permits the very thing which he decreed. 4. About an
   object which is one and the same, and uniformly considered, there
   cannot be two decrees of God, or two volitions, either in reality, or
   according to any semblance of a contrary volition -- as to will to save
   man under conditions, and yet to will precisely and absolutely to
   condemn him. 5. A decree of itself imposes no necessity on any thing or
   event. But if any necessity exists through the decree of God, it exists
   through the intervention of the divine power, and indeed when he judges
   it proper to employ his irresistible power to effect what he has
   decreed. 6. Therefore, it is not correctly said, The will of God is the
   necessity of things." 7. Nor is this a just expression: "All things
   happen necessarily with respect to the divine decree." 8. As many
   distinct decrees are conceived by us, and must necessarily be
   conceived; as there are objects about which God is occupied in
   decreeing, or as there are axioms by which those decrees are
   enunciated. 9. Though all the decrees of God have been made from
   eternity, yet a certain order of priority and posteriority must be laid
   down, according to their nature, and the mutual relation between them.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON PREDESTINATION TO SALVATION, AND ON DAMNATION CONSIDERED IN THE HIGHEST
  DEGREE

   The first in order of the divine decrees is not that of predestination,
   by which God foreordained to supernatural ends, and by which he
   resolved to save and to condemn, to declare his mercy and his punitive
   justice, and to illustrate the glory of his saving grace, and of his
   wisdom and power which correspond with that most free grace. 2. The
   object of predestination to supernatural ends, to salvation and death,
   to the demonstration of the mercy and punitive justice, or of the
   saving grace, the wisdom, and the most free power of God, is not
   rational creatures indefinitely foreknown, and capable of salvation, of
   damnation, of creation, of falling, and of reparation or of being
   recovered. 3. Nor is the subject some particular creatures from among
   those who are considered in this manner. 4. The difference between the
   vessels to honour and those to dishonour, that is, of mercy and wrath,
   does not appertain to the adorning or perfection of the universe or of
   the house of God. 5. The entrance of sin into the world does not
   appertain to the beauty of the universe. 6. Creation in the upright
   state of original righteousness is not a means for executing the decree
   of predestination, or of election, or of reprobation. 7. It is horrid
   to affirm, that "the way of reprobation is creation in the upright
   state of original righteousness;" (Gomarus, in his Theses on
   Predestination;) and in this very assertion are propounded two contrary
   volitions of God concerning one and the same thing. 8. It is a horrible
   affirmation, that "God has predestinated whatsoever men he pleased not
   only to damnation, but likewise to the causes of damnation." (Beza,
   vol. I, fol. 417.) 9. It is a horrible affirmation, that "men are
   predestinated to eternal death by the naked will or choice of God,
   without any demerit on their part." (Calvin, Inst. l. I, c. 2, 3.) 10.
   This, also, is a horrible affirmation: "Some among men have been
   created unto life eternal, and others unto death eternal." 11. It is
   not a felicitous expression, that "preparation unto destruction is not
   to be referred to any other thing, than to the secret counsel of God."
   12. Permission for the fall [of Adam] into sin, is not the means of
   executing the decree of predestination, or of election, or of
   reprobation. 13. It is an absurd assertion, that "the demerits of the
   reprobate are the subordinate means of bringing them onward to destined
   destruction." 14. It is a false assertion, that "the efficient and
   sufficient cause and matter of predestination are thus found in those
   who are reprobated." 15. The elect are not called "vessels of mercy" in
   the relation of means to the end, but because mercy is the only moving
   cause, by which is made the decree itself of predestination to
   salvation. 16. No small injury is inflicted on Christ as mediator, when
   he is called "the subordinate cause of destined salvation." 17. The
   predestination of angels and of men differ so much from each other,
   that no property of God can be prefixed to both of them unless it be
   received in an ambiguous acceptation.

  ON THE CREATION, AND CHIEFLY THAT OF MAN

   The creation of things out of nothing is the very first of all the
   external acts of God; nor is it possible for any act to be prior to
   this, or conceived to be prior to it; and the decree concerning
   creation is the first of all the decrees of God; because the properties
   according to which he performs and operates all things, are, in the
   first impulse of his nature, and in his first egress, occupied about
   nihility or nothing, when those properties are borne, ad extra,
   "outwards." 2. God has formed two creatures rational and capable of
   things divine; ONE of them is purely spiritual and invisible, and [that
   is the class of] angels; but the OTHER is partly corporeal and partly
   spiritual, visible and invisible, and [that is the class of] men; and
   the perfection of this universe seeing to have required the formation
   of these two [classes of] creatures. 3. QUERY. -- Did it not become the
   manifold wisdom of God, and was it not suitable to the difference by
   which these two rational creatures were distinguished at the very
   creation, that, in the mode and circumstances of imparting eternal life
   to angels and to men, he might act in a different manner with the
   former from that which he adopts towards the latter? It appears that he
   might do so. 4. But two general methods may be mentally conceived by
   us, ONE of which is through the strict observance of the law laid down,
   without hope of pardon if any transgression were committed; but the
   OTHER is through the remission of sins, though a law agreeable to their
   nature was likewise to be prescribed by a peremptory decree to men,
   with whom it was not the will of God to treat in a strict manner and
   according to the utmost rigor; and obedience was to be required from
   them without a promise or pardon. 5. The image and likeness of God,
   after which man was created, belongs partly to the very nature of man,
   so that, without it, man cannot be man; but it partly consists in those
   things which concern supernatural, heavenly and spiritual things. The
   former class comprises the understanding, the affections, and the will,
   which is free; but the latter, the knowledge of God and of things
   divine, righteousness, true holiness, &c. 6. With respect to essence
   and adequate objects, the faith by which Adam believed in God is not
   the same as that by which he believed in God after the promise made
   concerning the Blessed Seed, and not the same as that by which we
   believe the gospel of Christ. 7. Without doing any wrong to God, to
   Adam, and to the truth itself, it may be said, that in his primeval
   state Adam neither received or possessed a Proximate capability of
   understanding, believing, or performing any thing whatsoever which
   could be necessary to be understood, believed, or performed by him, in
   any state whatsoever at which it was possible for him to arrive, either
   by his own endeavours or by the gift of God, though he must have had a
   remote capability, otherwise something essential would still have been
   to be created within man himself. 8. The liberty of the will consists
   in this -- when all the requisites for willing or not willing are laid
   down, man is still indifferent to will or not to will, to will this
   rather than that. This indifference is removed by the previous
   determination, by which the will is circumscribed and absolutely
   determined to the one part or to the other of the contradiction or
   contrariety; and this predetermination, therefore, does not consist
   with the liberty of the will, which requires not only free capability,
   but also tree use in the very exercise of it. 9. Internal necessity is
   as repugnant to liberty as external necessity is; nay, external
   necessity does not necessitate to act except by the intervention of
   that which is internal. 10. Adam either possessed, or had ready and
   prepared for him, sufficient grace, whether it were habitual or
   assisting, to obey the command imposed on him, both that command which
   was symbolical and ceremonial, and that which was moral.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE DOMINION OF GOD OVER THE CREATURES, AND CHIEFLY OVER MAN

   The dominion of God over the creatures rests on the communication of
   the good which he has bestowed on them: And since this good is not
   infinite, neither is the dominion itself infinite. But that dominion is
   infinite according to which it may be lawful and proper for God to
   issue his commands to the creature, to impose on him all his works, to
   use him in all those things which his omnipotence might be able to
   command and to impose upon him, and to engage his services or
   attention. 2. Therefore the dominion of God does not extend itself so
   far as to be able to inflict eternal death on a rational creature, or
   to destine him to death eternal, without the demerits of the creature
   himself. 3. It is, therefore, falsely asserted, that "though God
   destined and created for destruction any creatures (indefinitely
   considered) without any consideration of sin as the meritorious cause,
   yet he cannot be accused of injustice, because he possesses an absolute
   right of dominion over them." ( Gomar's Theses on Predestination.) 4.
   Another false assertion is this: "By the light of GLORY we shall
   understand by what right God can condemn an innocent person, or one who
   has not merited damnation, as by the light of GRACE we now understand
   by what right God saves unworthy and sinful men; yet this right we do
   not comprehend by the light of nature." (Luther On the Servitude of the
   Will.) 5. But still more false is the following assertion: "Man is
   bound to acquiesce in this will of God, nay, to give thanks to God,
   that he has made him an instrument of the divine glory, to be displayed
   through wrath and power in his eternal destruction." 6. God can make of
   his own whatsoever he wills. But he does not will, neither can he will,
   to make of that which is his own whatever it is possible for him to
   make according to his infinite and absolute power.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD 1

   . The providence of God is subordinate to creation; and it is,
   therefore, necessary that it should not impinge against creation, which
   it would do, were it to inhibit or hinder the use of free will in man,
   or should deny to man its necessary concurrence, or should direct man
   to another end, or to destruction, than to that which is agreeable to
   the condition and state in which he was created; that is, if the
   providence of God should so rule and govern man that he should
   necessarily become corrupt, in order that God might manifest his own
   glory, both of justice and mercy, through the sin of man, according to
   his eternal counsel. 2. It appertains to the providence of God to act
   and permit; which two things are confounded when permission is changed
   into action under this pretext -- that it cannot be idle or unemployed.
   3. Divine providence does not determine a free will to one part of a
   contradiction or contrariety, that is, by a determination preceding the
   actual volition itself; under other circumstances the concurrence of
   the very volition with the will is the concomitant cause, and thus
   determines the will with the volition itself, by an act which is not
   previous but simultaneous, as the schoolmen express themselves. 4. The
   permission of God by which he permits any one to fall into sin is not
   correctly defined as "the subtraction or withdrawing of divine grace,
   by which, while God executes the decrees of his will through his
   rational creatures, he either does not unfold to the creature his own
   will by which he wills that wicked work to be done, or he does not bend
   the will of the man to obey the divine will in that action." (Ursinus
   On Providence, tom. I, fol. 178.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON PREDESTINATION, CONSIDERED IN THE PRIMEVAL STATE OF MAN

   It is not a true assertion, that "out of men considered in puris
   naturalibus, (either without supernatural things or with them,) God has
   determined, by the decree of election, to elevate to supernatural
   felicity some particular men, but to leave others in nature." 2. And it
   is rashly asserted that "it belongs to the relation or analogy of the
   universe, that some men be placed on the right and others on the left,
   even as the method of the master Builder requires, that some stones be
   placed on the left side, and others on the right, of a house which is
   to be built." 3. The permission by which God permits that some men
   wander from and miss the supernatural end, is unwisely made subordinate
   to this predestination; for it appertains to providence to lead and
   conduct a rational creature to supernatural felicity in a manner which
   is agreeable to the nature of that creature. 4. The permission, also,
   by which God permitted our first parents to fall into sin, is rashly
   said to be subordinate to this predestination.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE CAUSE OF SIN UNIVERSALLY

   Though sin can be committed by none except by a rational creature, and,
   therefore, ceases to be sin by this very circumstance if the cause of
   it be ascribed to God; yet it seems possible, by four arguments, to
   fasten this charge on our divines. "It follows from their doctrine that
   God is the author of sin." 2. First reason. -- Because they teach that,
   "without foresight of sin, God absolutely determined to declare his own
   glory through punitive justice and mercy, in the salvation of some men
   and in the damnation of others." Or, as others of them assert, "God
   resolved to illustrate his own glory by the demonstration of saving
   grace, wisdom, wrath, ability, and most free power, in the salvation of
   some particular men, and in the eternal damnation of others; which
   neither can be done, nor has been done, without the entrance of sin
   into the world." 3. Second reason. -- Because they teach "that, in
   order to attain to that chief and supreme end, God ordained that man
   should sin and become corrupt, by which thing God might open a way to
   himself for the execution of this decree." 4. Third reason. -- Because
   they teach "that God has either denied to man, or has withdrawn from
   man, before he sinned, grace necessary and sufficient to avoid sin;"
   which is equivalent to this -- as if God had imposed a law on man which
   was simply impossible to be performed or observed by his very nature.
   5. Fourth reason. -- Because they attribute to God some acts, partly
   external, partly mediate, and partly immediate, which, being once laid
   down, man was not able to do otherwise than commit sin by necessity of
   a consequent and antecedent to the thing itself, which entirely takes
   away all liberty; yet without this liberty a man cannot be considered,
   or reckoned, as being guilty of the commission of sin. 6. A Fifth
   reason. -- Testimonies of the same description may be added in which
   our divines assert, in express words, that "the reprobate cannot escape
   the necessity of sinning, especially since this kind of necessity is
   injected through the appointment of God." (Calvin's Institutes, Lib. 2,
   23.)
     __________________________________________________________________

  OF THE FALL OF ADAM

   Adam was able to continue in goodness and to refrain from sinning, and
   this in reality and in reference to the issue, and not only by
   capability not to be brought into action on account of some preceding
   decree of God, or rather not possible to lead to an act by that
   preceding decree. 2. Adam sinned freely and voluntarily, without any
   necessity, either internal or external. 3. Adam did not fall through
   the decree of God, neither through being ordained to fall nor through
   desertion, but through the mere permission of God, which is placed in
   subordination to no predestination either to salvation or to death, but
   which belongs to providence so far as it is distinguished in opposition
   to predestination. 4. Adam did not fall necessarily, either with
   respect to a decree, appointment, desertion, or permission, from which
   it is evident what kind of judgment ought to be formed concerning
   expressions of the following description: 5. "I confess, indeed, that
   by the will of God all the sons of Adam have fallen into this miserable
   condition in which they are bound and fastened." (Calvin's Institute,
   lib. 3, cap. 23.) 6. "They deny, in express words, the existence of
   this fact - - that it was decreed by God that Adam should perish by his
   own defection." 7. "God foreknew what result man would have, became he
   thus ordained it by his decree." 8. "God not only foresaw the fall of
   the first man, but by his own will he ordained it."
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON ORIGINAL SIN

   Original sin is not that actual sin by which Adam transgressed the law
   concerning the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and on account of
   which we have all been constituted sinners, and rendered obnoxious or
   liable to death and condemnation. 2. QUERIES. -- Is original sin only
   the absence or want of original righteousness and of primeval holiness,
   with an inclination to commit sin, which likewise formerly existed in
   man, though it was not so vehement nor so inordinate as now it is, on
   account of the lost favour of God, his malediction, and the loss of
   that good by which that inclination was reduced to order? Or is it a
   certain infused habit (or acquired ingress) contrary to righteousness
   and holiness, after that sin had been committed, 3. Does original sin
   render men obnoxious to the wrath of God, when they have been
   previously constituted sinners on account of the actual sin of Adam,
   and rendered liable to damnation? 4. Adam, when considered in this
   state, after sin and prior to restoration, was not bound at once to
   punishment and obedience, but only to punishment.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE PREDESTINATION OF MAN CONSIDERED PARTLY IN HIS PRIMEVAL STATE, AND
  PARTLY IN THE FALL

   IT is rashly asserted that "the matter of predestination, as it is
   opposed to reprobation, is man in common or absolutely, if regard be
   had to the foreordaining of the end; but if regard be had to the means
   for the end, it is man about to perish by and in himself and guilty in
   Adam." (Trelcatii Institut., lib. 2. On Predestination.) 2. With equal
   infelicity is it asserted that "one reprobation is negative or passive,
   another affirmative or active -- that the former is before all things
   and causes in things foreknown and considered, or that will arise from
   things; and that this act is respective of sin, and is called
   predamnation." 3. It may become a subject of discussion in what manner
   the following things can be said agreeably to this doctrine: "The
   impulsive cause of this predestination is the benevolent inclination of
   the will of God in Christ; and predestination is an eternal act of God,
   by which he resolves to make in Christ some creatures partakers of his
   grace and glory." 4. This is a stupid assertion: "The just desertion of
   God, by which he does not confer grace on a reprobate man, and which
   appertains to predestination and to its execution, is that of
   exploration or trial." This also cannot be reconciled with the
   expressions in the preceding paragraph.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON PREDESTINATION CONSIDERED AFTER THE FALL

   QUERIES. -- Out of the fallen human race, or out of the mass of
   corruption and perdition, has God absolutely chosen some particular men
   to life, and absolutely reprobated others to death, without any
   consideration of the good of the one or of the evil of the other? And
   from a just decree, which is both gracious and severe, is there such a
   requisite condition as this in the object which God is about to elect
   and to save, or to reprobate and condemn? 2. Is any man damned with
   death eternal, solely on account of the sin of Adam? 3. Are those who
   are thus the elect necessarily saved on account of the efficacy of
   grace, which has been destined to them only that they may not be able
   to do otherwise than assent to it, as it is irresistible, 4. Are those
   who are thus the reprobate necessarily damned, because either no grace
   at all, or not sufficient, has been destined to them, that they may
   assent to it and believe, 5. Or rather, according to St. Augustine, Are
   those who are thus the elect assuredly saved, because God decreed to
   employ grace on them as he knew was suitable and congruous that they
   might be persuaded and saved; though if regard be had to the internal
   efficacy of grace, they may not be advanced or benefited by it, 6. Are
   those who have thus been reprobated certainly damned, because God does
   not apply to them grace as he knows to be suitable and congruous,
   though in the mean time they are supplied with sufficient grace, that
   they may be able to yield their assent and be saved,
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE DECREES OF GOD WHICH CONCERN THE SALVATION OF SINFUL MEN, ACCORDING TO
  HIS OWN SENSE

   The first decree concerning the salvation of sinful men, as that by
   which God resolves to appoint his Son Jesus Christ as a saviour,
   mediator, redeemer, high priest, and one who may expiate sins, by the
   merit of his own obedience may recover lost salvation, and dispense it
   by his efficacy. 2. The SECOND DECREE is that by which God resolves to
   receive into favour those who repent and believe, and to save in
   Christ, on account of Christ, and through Christ, those who persevere,
   but to leave under sin and wrath those who are impenitent and
   unbelievers, and to condemn them as aliens from Christ. 3. The THIRD
   DECREE is that by which God resolves to administer such means for
   repentance and faith as are necessary, sufficient, and efficacious. And
   this administration is directed according to the wisdom of God, by
   which he knows what is suitable or becoming to mercy and severity; it
   is also according to his righteousness, by which he is prepared to
   follow and execute [the directions] of his wisdom. 4. From these
   follows a FOURTH DECREE, concerning the salvation of these particular
   persons, and the damnation of those. This rests or depends on the
   prescience and foresight of God, by which he foreknew from all eternity
   what men would, through such administration, believe by the aid of
   preventing or preceding grace, and would persevere by the aid of
   subsequent or following grace, and who would not believe and persevere.
   5. Hence, God is said to "know those who are his;" and the number both
   of those who are to be saved, and of those who are to be damned, is
   certain and fixed, and the quod and the qui, [the substance and the
   parties of whom it is composed,] or, as the phrase of the schools is,
   both materially and formally. 6. The second decree [described in § 2]
   is predestination to salvation, which is the foundation of
   Christianity, salvation, and of the assurance of salvation; it is also
   the matter of the gospel, and the substance of the doctrine taught by
   the apostles. 7. But that predestination by which God is said to have
   decreed to save particular creatures and persons and to endue them with
   faith, is neither the foundation of Christianity, of salvation, nor of
   the assurance of salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON CHRIST

   QUERIES. -- After the entrance of sin into the world, was there no
   other remedy for the expiation of sin, or of rendering satisfaction to
   God, than through the death of the Son of God, 2. Had the human nature
   in Christ any other thing, than substance alone, immediately from the
   LOGOS, that is, without the intervention of the Holy Spirit, 3. Have
   the holy conception of Christ through the Holy Ghost, and his birth
   from the Virgin Mary, this tendency -- to cover the corruption of our
   nature lest it should come into the sight of God, 4. Does the holy life
   of Christ, in which he fulfilled all righteousness according to the
   prescript of the moral law concerning the love of God and of our
   neighbour, conduce only to this purpose -- that Christ may be a pure
   and innocent High Priest and an uncontaminated victim, But was it not
   like-wise for this purpose -- that this righteousness [of the holy life
   of Christ] may be our righteousness before God, and by this means
   performed by him for us, that is, in our name and in our stead, 5. Do
   those things which Christ suffered prior to his being placed before the
   tribunal of Pilate, concur with those which he afterwards endured, for
   the purging away and expiation of sins, and the redemption and
   reconciliation of sinners with God? 6. Was the oblation by which Christ
   offered himself to the Father as a victim for sin, so made on the cross
   that he has not offered himself and his blood to his Father in Heaven,
   7. Is not the oblation by which Christ presents himself to his Father
   in heaven sprinkled with his own blood, a perpetual and continuous act,
   on which intercession rests or depends? 8. Is not the redemption which
   has been obtained by the blood of Christ, common to every man in
   particular, according to the love and affection of God by which he gave
   his Son for the world, though, according to the peremptory decree
   concerning the salvation of believers alone, it belongs only to some
   men?
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE VOCATION OF SINNERS TO COMMUNION WITH CHRIST, AND TO A PARTICIPATION OF
  HIS BENEFITS

   Sinful man, after the perpetration of sin, has such a knowledge of the
   law as is sufficient for accusing, convicting, and condemning him; and
   this knowledge itself is capable of being employed by God when calling
   him to Christ, that he may, through it, compel man to repent and to
   flee to Christ. 2. An unregenerate man is capable of omitting more evil
   external works than he omits, and can perform more outward works which
   have been commanded by God than he actually performs; that is, it is
   possible for him to rule his inducements for abstaining in another and
   a better manner than that in which he does rule them; although if he
   were to do so, he would merit nothing by that deed. 3. The distribution
   of vocation into internal and external, is not the distribution of a
   genus into its species, or of a whole into its parts. 4. Internal
   vocation is granted even to those who do not comply with the call. 5.
   All unregenerate persons have freedom of will, and a capability of
   resisting the Holy Spirit, of rejecting the proffered grace of God, of
   despising the counsel of God against themselves, of refusing to accept
   the gospel of grace, and of not opening to Him who knocks at the door
   of the heart; and these things they can actually do, without any
   difference of the elect and of the reprobate. 6. Whomsoever God calls,
   he calls them seriously, with a will desirous of their repentance and
   salvation. Neither is there any volition of God about or concerning
   those whom he calls as being uniformly considered, that is, either
   affirmatively or negatively contrary to this will. 7. God is not bound
   to employ all the modes which are possible to him for the salvation of
   all men. He has performed his part, when he has employed either one or
   more of these possible means for saving. 8. "That man should be
   rendered inexcusable," is neither the proximate end, nor that which was
   intended by God, to the divine vocation when it is first made and has
   not been repulsed. 9. The doctrine which is manifested only for the
   purpose of rendering those who hear it inexcusable, cannot render them
   inexcusable either by right or by efficacy. 10. The right of God -- by
   which he can require faith in Christ from those who do not possess the
   capability of believing in him, and on whom he refuses to bestow the
   grace which is necessary and sufficient for believing, without any
   demerit on account of grace repulsed -- does not rest or depend on the
   fact that God gave to Adam, in his primeval state, and in him to all
   men, the capability of believing in Christ. 11. The right of God -- by
   which he can condemn those who reject the gospel of grace, and by which
   he actually condemns the disobedient -- does not rest or depend on this
   fact, that all men have, by their own fault, lost the capability of
   believing which they received in Adam. 12. Sufficient grace must
   necessarily be laid down; yet this sufficient grace, through the fault
   of him to whom it is granted, does not [always] obtain its effect. Were
   the fact otherwise, the justice of God could not be defended in his
   condemning those who do not believe. 13. The efficacy of saving grace
   is not consistent with that omnipotent act of God, by which he so
   inwardly acts in the heart and mind of man, that he on whom that act is
   impressed cannot do otherwise than consent to God who calls him; or,
   which is the same thing, grace is not an irresistible force. 14. QUERY.
   -- Are efficacious and sufficient grace correctly distinguished
   according to a congruous or suitable vocation and one that is
   incongruous, so that it may be called efficacious grace, which God
   employs according to his purpose of absolutely saving some particular
   man, as he knows it to be congruous or suitable that this man should be
   moved and persuaded to obedience; and so that it may be called
   sufficient grace which he employs, not for such a purpose, though, from
   his general love towards all mankind, some are affected or moved by it,
   on whom, by a peremptory decree, he had resolved not to have mercy? 15.
   The efficacy which is distinguished from efficiency itself, seems not
   to differ at all from sufficiency. 16. Those who are obedient to the
   vocation or call of God, freely yield their assent to grace; yet they
   are previously excited, impelled, drawn and assisted by grace; and in
   the very moment in which they actually assent, they possess the
   capability of not assenting. 17. In the very commencement of his
   conversion, man conducts himself in a purely passive manner; that is,
   though, by a vital act, that is, by feeling, he has a perception of the
   grace which calls him, yet he can do no other than receive it and feel
   it. But, when he feels grace affecting or inclining his mind and heart,
   he freely assents to it, so that he is able at the same time to
   withhold his assent.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON PENITENCE

   The doctrine concerning repentance is not legal but evangelical; that
   is, it appertains to the gospel and not to the law, although the law
   solicits and impels to repentance. 2. The knowledge or confession of
   sins, sorrow on account of sin and a desire for deliverance, with a
   resolution to avoid sin, are pleasing to God as the very beginnings of
   conversion. 3. In propriety of speech, these things are not the
   mortification itself of the flesh or of sin but necessarily precede it.
   4. Repentance is prior to faith in Christ; but it is posterior to that
   faith by which we believe that God is willing to receive into his
   favour the penitent sinner. 5. QUERIES. -- Is the repentance of Judas
   properly called legal? 6. Was the penitence or repentance of the
   inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon, of which Christ speaks in Matt. xi. 21,
   dissembled and feigned, or true repentance?
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON FAITH

   Justifying faith is not that by which any one believes that his sins
   are remitted to him for the sake of Christ; for the latter faith
   follows justification itself or remission of sins, which is the effect
   of justifying faith. 2. Justifying faith is not that by which any one
   believes himself to be elected. 3. All men are not bound to believe
   themselves to be elected. 4. The knowledge and faith by which any one
   knows and believes that he is in possession of faith, is prior by
   nature to that knowledge and faith by which any one knows and believes
   himself to be elected. 5. From these remarks, some judgment may be
   formed concerning that which is sometimes asserted, "A believing and
   elect person is bound to believe that he is elected." 6. Justifying
   faith is that by which men believe in Jesus Christ, as in the saviour
   of those universally who believe, and of each of them in particular,
   even the saviour of him who, through Christ, believes in God, who
   justifies the ungodly. 7. Evangelical and saving faith is of such vast
   excellency as to exceed the entire nature of man, and all his
   understanding, even that of Adam, when placed in a state of innocence.
   8. God cannot of right require faith in Christ from that man whom, by
   an absolute will, he has reprobated, either without consideration of
   any sin, or as fallen in Adam; therefore, it was not his will that
   Christ should be of the least advantage to this man; or, rather, he
   willed that Christ should not profit him. 9. Faith is a gracious and
   gratuitous gift of God, bestowed according to the administration of the
   means necessary to conduce to the end, that is, according to such an
   administration as the justice of God requires, either towards the side
   of mercy or towards that of severity. It is a gift which is not
   bestowed according to an absolute will of saving some particular men;
   for it is a condition required in the object to be saved, and it is in
   fact a condition before it is the means for obtaining salvation. 10.
   Saving faith is that of the elect of God; it is not the faith of all
   men, of perverse and wicked men, not of those who repel the word of
   grace, and account themselves unworthy of life eternal, not of those
   who resist the Holy Spirit, not of those who reject the counsel of God
   against themselves, nor of those who have not been ordained to life
   eternal. No man believes in Christ except he has been previously
   disposed and prepared, by preventing or preceding grace, to receive
   life eternal on that condition on which God wills to bestow it,
   according to the following passage of Scripture: "If any man will do
   his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or
   whether I speak of myself." (John vii. 17.)

  ON REGENERATION AND THE REGENERATE

   The proximate subject of regeneration, which is effected in the present
   life by the Spirit of Christ, is the mind and the affections of man, or
   the will considered according to the mode of nature, not the will
   considered according to the mode of liberty. It is not the body of man,
   though man, when renewed by regeneration through his mind and feelings,
   actually wills in a good manner, and performs well through the
   instruments of the body. 2. Though regeneration is not perfected in a
   moment, but by certain steps and intervals; yet, as soon as ever it is
   perfected according to its essence, that is, through the renovation of
   the mind and affections, it renders the man spiritual, and capable of
   resisting sin through the assisting grace of God. Hence, also, from the
   Spirit, which predominates in him, he is called spiritual and not
   carnal, though he still has within him the flesh lusting against the
   Spirit. For these two, a carnal man and a spiritual man, are so
   denominated in opposition, and according to [that which is in each of
   them] the more powerful, prevailing or predominant party. 3. The
   regenerate are able to perform more true good, and of such as is
   pleasing to God, than they actually perform, and to omit more evil than
   they omit; and, therefore, if they do not perform and omit what they
   ought to do, that must not be ascribed to any decree of God or
   inefficacy of divine grace, but it must be attributed to the negligence
   of the regenerate themselves. 4. He who asserts that "it is possible
   for the regenerate, through the grace of Christ, perfectly to fulfill
   the law in the present life," is neither a Pelagian, nor inflicts any
   injury on the grace of God, nor establishes justification through
   works. 5. The regenerate are capable of committing sin designedly and
   in opposition to their consciences, and of so laying waste their
   consciences, through sin, as to hear nothing from them except the
   sentence of condemnation. 6. The regenerate are capable of grieving the
   Holy Spirit by their sins, so that, for a season, until they suffer
   themselves to be brought back to repentance, he does not exert his
   power and efficacy in them. 7. Some of the regenerate actually thus
   sin, thus lay waste their conscience, and thus grieve the Holy Spirit.
   8. If David had died in the very moment in which he had sinned against
   Uriah by adultery and murder, he would have been condemned to death
   eternal. 9. God truly hates the sins of the regenerate and of the elect
   of God, and indeed so much the more, as those who thus sin have
   received more benefits from God, and a greater power of resisting sin.
   10. There are distinctions by which a man is said to sin with a full
   will, or with a will that is not full -- fully to destroy conscience,
   or not fully but only partly, and to sin according to his unregenerate
   part. When these distinctions are employed in the sense in which some
   persons use them, they are noxious to piety and injurious to good
   morals.

  ON THE PERSEVERANCE OF SAINTS

   QUERIES. -- Is it possible for true believers to fall away totally and
   finally: 2. Do some of them, in reality, totally and finally fall from
   the faith? 3. The opinion which denies "that true believers and
   regenerate persons are either capable of falling away or actually do
   fall away from the faith totally and finally," was never, from the very
   times of the apostles down to the present day, accounted by the church
   as a catholic doctrine. Neither has that which affirms the contrary
   ever been reckoned as a heretical opinion; nay, that which affirms it
   possible for believers to fall away from the faith, has always had more
   supporters in the church of Christ, than that which denies its
   possibility of its actually occurring.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION

   QUERIES. -- Is it possible for any believer, without a special
   revelation, to be certain or assured that he will not decline or fall
   away from the faith, 2. Are those who have faith, bound to believe that
   they will not decline from the faith? 3. The affirmative of either of
   these questions was never accounted in the church of Christ as a
   catholic doctrine; and the denial of either of them has never been
   adjudged by the church universal as a heresy. 4. The persuasion by
   which any believer assuredly persuades himself that it is impossible
   for him to decline from the faith, or that, at least, he will not
   decline from the faith, does not conduce so much to consolation against
   despair or against the doubting that is adverse to faith and hope, as
   it contributes to security, a thing directly opposed to that most
   salutary fear with which we are commanded to work out our salvation,
   and which is exceedingly necessary in this scene of temptations. 5. He
   who is of opinion that it is possible for him to decline from the
   faith, and who, therefore, is afraid lest he should decline, is neither
   destitute of necessary consolation, nor is he on this account,
   tormented with anxiety of mind. For it suffices to inspire consolation
   and to exclude anxiety, when he knows that he will decline from the
   faith through no force of Satan, of sin, or of the world, and through
   no inclination or weakness of his own flesh, unless he willingly and of
   his own accord, yield to temptation, and neglect to work out his
   salvation in a conscientious manner.
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE JUSTIFICATION OF MAN AS A SINNER, BUT YET A BELIEVER, BEFORE GOD

   QUERIES. -- was it possible for the justice of God to be satisfied
   unless the law were likewise satisfied, 2. Is the satisfaction which
   has been rendered in Christ to the justice of God, the same as that
   rendered to the law through Christ? 3. Do legal righteousness and that
   of the gospel differ in essence? Or, Is the essence of both of them the
   same, that is, the matter -- the obedience performed to God, and the
   universal form -- the necessary conformity to the law? 4. Are there
   three parts of the righteousness of Christ by which believers are
   constituted righteous? Is the first of them the holiness of the nature
   of Christ, which is denominated habitual righteousness? Is the second
   those sufferings which, from infancy to the moment of his decease, he
   sustained on our account, and is this denominated his passive
   obedience, or that of his death? Is the third the most perfect, nay,
   the more than perfect fulfillment of the moral law, (add also that of
   the ceremonial law,) through the whole of his life to the period of his
   death; and is this denominated his active obedience, or that of his
   life? 5. Were not the acts of that obedience which Christ performed,
   and by which we are justified, imposed on him according to the peculiar
   command of the Father, and according to a peculiar compact or covenant
   entered into between him and the Father, in which he prescribed and
   stipulated those acts of obedience, with the addition of a promise that
   he should obtain eternal redemption for them, [the human race] and
   should see his seed, whom this obedience should justify through his
   knowledge, that is, through faith in him, 6. To which of the offices of
   Christ do those acts of obedience belong, 7. Is the righteousness of
   Christ the righteousness of a believer or of an elect person, before
   God imputes it to him? 8. Does God impute this righteousness to him
   before he justifies him through faith? 9. Or, which is the same thing,
   Is the object about which God is occupied in the act of justification,
   an elect person, unrighteous indeed in himself but righteous in Christ
   his head; so that he accounts him righteous because he is already
   righteous in Christ, that is, because the punishment due to him has
   been paid and endured by him in His Surety and Head, or because he has
   thus performed the obedience which was due from him? 10. Has an elect
   person really endured punishment in Christ and performed obedience, or
   only in the divine estimation or reckoning! And is this divine
   estimation, by which the elect person is reckoned to have endured
   punishment and performed obedience, an act preceding justification? 11.
   Does not the act of acceptation, by which God accepted the obedience of
   his Son, precede the oblation by which, through the gospel, he offers
   his Son for righteousness, 12. Is the accepted imputation of the
   righteousness of Christ justification itself, or a preliminary to
   justification? 13. Is not the act of apprehension, by which faith
   apprehends Christ and his righteousness, or Christ for righteousness,
   prior to justification itself? 14. If this act [of apprehension] be
   prior to justification, how is faith the instrumental cause of our
   justification; that is, at once the instrumental cause of the
   apprehending which precedes justification, and of justification itself
   which succeeds this apprehending, 15. Or, Does not faith apprehend
   Christ offered for righteousness, before faith is imputed for
   righteousness? 16. In this enunciation, "faith is imputed to the
   believer for righteousness," is the word "faith" to be properly
   received as the instrumental act by which Christ has been apprehended
   for righteousness? Or is it to be improperly received, that is, by a
   metonymy, for the very object which faith apprehends? 17. Is this
   phrase, "faith is received relatively and instrumentally," the same as
   "by the word Faith is signified, through a metonymy, the very object of
   faith"? 18. Or, Is it the same thing to say "we are justified by faith
   correlatively, and as it is an instrumental act, by which we apprehend
   Christ for righteousness" as we say "we are justified by obedience or
   righteousness"? 19. May the righteousness of Christ be correctly said
   to be graciously imputed for righteousness, or to be graciously
   accounted for righteousness? 20. When the apostle expresses himself in
   this manner, "Faith is imputed for righteousness," must not this be
   understood concerning the imputation which is made, not according to
   debt, but according to grace? 21. May that of which we are made
   partakers through faith, or by faith, be called the instrumental effect
   of faith? 22. When God has decreed to justify no one through grace and
   mercy, except him who believes in Christ, and, therefore, through the
   preaching of the gospel, requires faith in Christ from him who desires
   to be justified, can it not be said "when God is graciously judging
   according to the gospel, he is occupied about faith, as about a
   condition, which is required from, and performed by, him who appears
   before the throne of grace to be judged and justified"? 23. If this may
   be asserted, what crime is there in saying "through the gratuitous and
   gracious acceptance [of God] is faith accounted for righteousness on
   account of the obedience of Christ"? 24. Is "If the work of men who are
   born again were perfect, they might be justified by them, though they
   may have perpetrated many evil works when [or before] they obtain the
   remission of them" a correct assertion?
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE GOOD WORKS OF BELIEVERS

   QUERIES. -- Is it truly said, concerning the good works of believers
   "they are unclean like a menstruous cloth", And does this confession,
   "We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are as
   filthy rags," &c., (Isa. lxiv. 6,) belong to those works? 2. In what
   sense is it correctly said "Believers sin mortally in every one of
   their good works"? 3. Do the good works of believers come into the
   judgment of God so far only as they are testimonies of faith; or like-
   wise so far as they have been prescribed by God, and sanctioned and
   honoured with the promise of a reward, although this reward be not
   bestowed on them except "of grace" united with mercy, and on account of
   Christ, whom God hath appointed and set forth as a propitiation through
   faith in his blood, and, therefore, with reference to faith in Christ?
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON PRAYER

   QUERIES. -- Does prayer, or the invocation of God, hold relation only
   to the performance of worship to his honour? Or, does it likewise bear
   the relation of means necessary for obtaining that which is asked --
   means, indeed, which God foresaw would be employed before he absolutely
   determined to bestow the blessing on the petitioner, 2. Is the faith
   with which we ought to pray, that faith by which he who prays believes
   assuredly that he will obtain what he asks? Or is it that faith by
   which he is assuredly persuaded, that he is asking according to the
   will of God, and will obtain what he asks, provided God knows that it
   will conduce to his glory and to the salvation of the petitioner?
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE INFANTS OF BELIEVERS WHEN THEY ARE OFFERED FOR BAPTISM

   QUERY. -- When the children of believers are offered for baptism, are
   they considered as "the children of wrath," or as the children of God
   and of grace? And if they be considered in both ways, is this relation
   according to the same time, or according to different times?
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON THE SUPPER OF THE LORD

   QUERY. -- Is not the proximate and most appropriate, and, therefore,
   the immediate end of the Lords Supper, both as it was at first
   instituted and as it is now used, the memory, or commemoration, or
   annunciation of the Lord's death, and this with thanksgiving for the
   gift of God, in delivering up his Son to death for us, and in having
   given his flesh to be eaten and his blood to be drank through faith in
   him?
     __________________________________________________________________

  ON MAGISTRACY

   The chief magistrate is not correctly denominated political or secular,
   because those epithets are opposed to the ecclesiastical and spiritual
   power. 2. In the hands and at the disposal of the chief magistrate is
   placed, under God, the supreme and sovereign power of caring and
   providing for his subjects, and of governing them, with respect to
   animal and spiritual life. 3. The care of religion has been committed
   by God to the chief magistrate, more than to priests and to
   ecclesiastical persons. 4. It is in the power of the magistrate to
   enact laws concerning civil and ecclesiastical polity, yet not unless
   those persons have been asked and consulted who are the best versed in
   spiritual matters, and who are peculiarly designed for teaching the
   church. 5. It is the duty of the magistrate to preserve and defend the
   ecclesiastical ministry -- to appoint the ministers of God's word,
   after they have previously undergone a lawful examination before a
   presbytery -- to take care that they perform their duty -- to require
   an account of their ministry -- to admonish and incite those among them
   who are negligent -- to bestow rewards on those ministers who preside
   well over their flocks, and to remove such as are pertinaciously
   negligent, or who bring a scandal on the church. 6. Also to invoke
   councils, whether general, national or provincial; by his own authority
   to preside as moderator of the assembly, either in person or through
   deputies suitable for discharging such an office. 7. QUERY -- Is it
   useful to ecclesiastical conventions or assemblies, that those persons
   preside over them whose interest it is that matters of religion and
   church discipline should be transacted in this manner rather than in
   that? 8. For the discharge of these duties, the magistrate must
   understand those mysteries of religion which are absolutely necessary
   for the salvation of men; for in this part [of his high office] he
   cannot depend upon and confide in the conscience of another person. 9.
   The Christian magistrate both presides in those ecclesiastical
   assemblies in which he is present, and pronounces a decisive and
   definitive sentence, or has the right of delivering a decisive and
   definitive sentence.

  ON THE CHURCH OF ROME

   QUERIES. -- Must a difference be made between the court of Rome, (that
   is, the Roman pontiff, the cardinals, and the other sworn retainers and
   satelites of his kingdom,) and the Church which is denominated Romish?
   2. Can those persons by no means be called "the church of Christ," who,
   having been deceived by the Roman pontiff consider him as the successor
   of St. Peter and the head of the church? 3. Has God sent a bill of
   divorcement to those persons, so that he does not at all acknowledge
   them as his, any more than he does Mahometans and Jews?

   A LETTER ON THE SIN AGAINST THE HOLY GHOST TO JOHN UYTENBOGARD, HIS
   MOST DEAR AND PECULIARLY BELOVED BROTHER IN CHRIST, JAMES ARMINIUS
   WISHES HEALTH AND HIS WELFARE THROUGH CHRIST

   Most Friendly Of Mankind: As You intend soon to preach before the
   members of your church on The Sin against the Holy Ghost, you request
   that I will disclose to you my meditations and musings on that subject,
   on which you had also previously asked my opinion; but at that time, it
   was not in my power to comply with your request; for I had formed no
   distinct conception in my mind respecting it, neither have my
   sentiments upon it yet attained to any certain and full persuasion. But
   my slight musings and meditations, I neither feel any desire of denying
   to you, nor would it be my duty to withhold them from one to whom I
   have long ago transferred the plenary fight of requiring and even
   commanding any thing from me. Nor will I suffer myself to be seduced
   from this desire of obeying you by any false and rustic shame, though I
   know that my contemplations on this question, are such as cannot
   satisfy you, since, in fact, they are not much approved by myself. For,
   of what kind soever they may be, I am aware that they deserve to obtain
   some excuse, as they are concerning that question, than which scarcely
   any one of greater difficulty can be found in the whole Scripture, as
   St. Augustine testifies when professedly treating upon this subject,
   (tom. 19, fol. 9,) in his explication of Matt. xii. 31,32. Besides, I
   hope and feel fully persuaded, that you will so polish these, my rough
   notes, that I may afterwards receive them from you not only with
   interest, but also others which will be able entirely to complete my
   wishes. But I will not at present examine what St. Augustine has
   produced on the same passage, when writing about this sin; nor what is
   found on this subject in the writings of other authors, whether among
   the ancients or in our own times, lest I should be unnecessarily
   prolix, especially as you are yourself extremely well furnished with
   their works, and are ready to make the necessary inquiry into their
   sentiments. I will transcribe for you my own meditations, not in that
   order which is suitable to the nature of the thing itself, (for how is
   it possible for me to do this, when it is not fully known by me?) but
   in the order which it is possible for me to observe in the confusion of
   various thoughts. It will not be useless, in the first place, to prefix
   to this investigation those passages of Scripture in which mention is
   made of this sin, or in which it seems at least to be made. "Wherefore
   I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
   men; but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven
   unto men. And whosoever speaketh against the Son of Man, it shall be
   forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall
   not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come.
   (Matt. xii. 31,32.) "Verily I say unto you All sins shall be forgiven
   unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewithsoever they shall
   blaspheme; but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath
   never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation." (Mark iii.
   28,29.) "and whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
   shall be forgiven him; but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy
   Ghost, it shall not be forgiven." (Luke xii. 10.) There are, besides,
   two passages in the epistle to the Hebrews, the first of them in the
   sixth chapter, the other in the tenth, which it seems possible to refer
   to this subject without any great detriment. "For it is impossible for
   those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift,
   and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good
   word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall
   away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to
   themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame? (Heb.
   vi. 4-6.) "He that despised Moses' law, died without mercy under two or
   three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be
   thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath
   counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an
   unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?" (x,
   28,29.) To these may be added a passage from St. John's first epistle:
   "If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall
   ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There
   is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it?" (1 John
   v. 16.) Let the following passage also, from the epistle to the
   Hebrews, be added, for the sake of explanation, not because it is on
   exactly the same subject: "For if the word spoken by angels was
   steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just
   recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great
   salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was
   confirmed unto us by them that heard him, God also bearing them
   witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and
   gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?" (Heb. ii. 2-4.) To
   these, let another passage be subjoined from the Acts of the Apostles:
   "Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always
   resist the Holy Ghost. As did your fathers, so do ye." (Acts vii. 51.)
   But about the same persons, it was said, in a preceding chapter, "And
   they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which Stephen
   spake." (vi, 10.) "And all that sat in the council looking steadfastly
   on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel." (vi, 15.) I
   unite these passages for no other reason than that I may be able to
   contemplate them all together at one glance, and may direct my thoughts
   according to them. And, first, we must see the appellations which the
   sin receives about which we are here treating. The Evangelists Matthew,
   Mark and Luke call it "the blasphemy of the Spirit," or "the blasphemy
   against the Holy Ghost." In the sixth chapter of the epistle to the
   Hebrews, it is called "a prolapsing" or "falling away," and in the
   tenth chapter of the same epistle, it is called "contumely poured on
   the Spirit of grace," or "a doing despite to the Spirit of grace." I
   might add, from the sixth chapter, "the crucifying afresh of the Son of
   God," and "the putting of him to an open shame;" and from the tenth,
   "the treading under foot of the Son of God," and "the profanation of
   the blood of the covenant," unless they were capable of being referred
   to some other thing, which we shall afterwards discuss. In 1 John v.
   16, it is designated as "a sin unto death." The sin which is described
   in Hebrews ii. 2-4, is denominated "a neglecting of the salvation which
   was first announced by Christ and his apostles," and confirmed by God
   with infallible testimonies. In Acts vii. 51, it is called "a resisting
   of the Holy Ghost." We are permitted thus to employ these passages,
   because an inquiry is instituted into the genus of the sin. He, against
   whom the sin is committed, is styled by St. Matthew, Mark and Luke,
   "the Holy Spirit;" and, in Hebrews 10, he is called the "Spirit of
   grace;" by this addition of the epithet "of grace" to the Spirit, seems
   to be intimated that the person of the Holy Spirit himself is not so
   much the object of consideration in this passage, as some gracious act
   of his. The same Evangelists make a distinction between this sin and
   that against "the Son of Man," while in Hebrews 6 and 10, the same sin
   is said to redound to the ignominy of the Son of God and of his blood
   -- two declarations which must afterwards be reconciled, for each of
   them is true. But when the men who commit this sin are described, in
   Hebrews 6, as "those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of that
   heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have
   tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come," in
   Hebrews 2, salvation is said to have been announced to them, and
   confirmed by indubitable testimonies. In Acts 6, it is attributed to
   them that "they were not able to resist the wisdom and Spirit by which
   Stephen spoke," and that they "saw his face as that of an angel." From
   these particulars, it seems proper to collect by what cause they were
   impelled who committed this sin. It is, moreover, attributed to this
   sin by Matthew, Mark and Luke, that it is irremissible, or not to be
   forgiven; by St. John that his unto death. The same thing is affirmed
   in Hebrews 6, but, as it appears to me, it is in the cause; for it is
   said to be impossible that he who has thus "fallen away should be
   renewed again unto repentance." In Hebrews 10, in the application of
   the comparison, this sin is said to deserve a more severe punishment
   than the despising of the law of Moses; and in the commencement of the
   same passage, the certainty of punishment is signified by these words:
   "He died without mercy," which seems also to be placed in the
   antapodosis, the repetition or summing up. In Hebrews 2, he who
   neglects this salvation is said "to receive a just recompense of
   reward." Besides, the cause why that sin is irremissible, unto death,
   and why the man who thus sins cannot be renewed unto repentance, seems
   to be rendered in Hebrews 6, in the following terms: "- seeing they
   crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open
   shame." And in Hebrews 10, in the following words: "- who hath trodden
   under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant,
   wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing." For it does not seem to
   me that these expressions can be placed collaterally with falling away
   and doing despite to the Spirit of grace; but I think they must be
   placed in subordination among themselves. Lastly, in Hebrews 2 a 10, is
   instituted a comparison between this sin and the violation and the
   despising of the law of Moses; for this likewise is worthy of
   consideration, that we may correctly determine concerning the kind of
   sin. From this comparison of it appears that the sin about which those
   passages treat, is not committed against the law of Moses. But from the
   contexture of those things which precede, and from a comparison of
   those which follow, is to be taken the occasion through which Christ,
   in the Evangelists, St. Paul in the epistle to the Hebrews, and St.
   John in his first epistle, have made mention of this sin. Let us now
   commence an inquiry into the matters which come under consideration in
   this sin, following, as far as possible, the guidance of those passages
   which we have premised and prefixed to this our disquisition. But to me
   it appears possible, most commodiously to circumscribe them within the
   following bounds: Let us, in the first place, (1.) enter into a
   discussion on the genus or kind of this sin; (2.) its object and mode;
   (3.) those who commit the sin; (4.) the impelling cause; (5.) the end
   of this sin; (6.) the degrees of this sin; (7.) the peculiar attribute
   of this sin -- its irremissibility or unpardonableness, and its cause.
   To these we shall subjoin the three other questions, which you mention
   in your letter. (1.) Can this sin be known by the human judgment, and
   what are the marks? (2.) Are those who are commonly considered to have
   perpetrated this sin, to be held as being guilty of it or not, (3.)
   Does not this distinction between the sin against the Son of Man, and
   that against the Holy Spirit, contribute to the confirmation of the
   truth of the personality of the Holy Ghost? 1. With respect to the
   genus or kind, it is a subject of much regret that a disquisition upon
   it is a matter of great difficulty. For it is produced from no other
   source than the too great fertility of sin, and its deduction and
   derivation into various species; yet it is not necessary to refer all
   the distributions and distinctions of sin to this point; we must
   descend commodiously by those degrees which may bring us down to this
   kind of sin. In order to do this, we must commence with that which is
   the highest. Sin, therefore, is the transgression of the divine law, of
   whatever description that law may be; for we are treating upon a sin of
   this kind. A transgression of the law is either special, against one or
   more of the precepts of the law; or it is universal, against the whole
   and entire law, which is called a rejection and abrogation of the law,
   and a defection from it, and which is as much against what is commanded
   or forbidden in the law, as against him who directly commanded it,
   through contempt for Him. This kind of sin, I suppose, is signified in
   the Old Testament by the phrase, to sin with a high or elevated hand;
   for the moral law consists of a preface which is contained in these
   words: "I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt," &c., and of an enumeration of the precepts. Either the preface
   itself is rejected and God directly despised, or sin is committed
   against the precepts, none of which can in fact be violated without
   bringing ignominy on the divine Majesty and pouring contempt upon God.
   But every sin is not from a contempt for God. David committed adultery,
   which may be reductively or consequently referred to a contemning of
   God, and resolved into it; but he did not commit that sin through a
   contempt for God. The law of God is now two-fold -- the one of works,
   the other of faith; or, the precepts of the law are of two kinds: some,
   of the law properly so called, and others of the gospel. But this sin
   about which we are treating is not of the kind of those which are
   perpetrated against the law of God, whether it be a special or
   universal transgression and an apostasy from the law. This is evident
   from Hebrews x. 28,29; for this sin is there compared with the
   violation or abrogation of the law of Moses, as a greater sin with a
   smaller one. It is also evident from Hebrews ii. 2-4. This sin is also
   called "a doing despite unto the Spirit of grace," which is not that of
   the law, but the Spirit of Christ and of his gospel. It is easy to
   perceive the same thing in the Evangelists; for, in St. Matthew's
   gospel, Christ says, "but if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils,
   then the kingdom of God is come unto you." (xii, 28.) This sin,
   therefore, is committed against the Spirit who testifies that the
   kingdom of God has arrived; and, on this account, it is not committed
   against the law of God, but against the gospel of Jesus Christ. The
   same thing may be rendered evident from Hebrews 6, in which the apostle
   treats about a falling away from those gifts which are there
   enumerated, and which are the gifts of the gospel of Christ. Christ is
   also said "to be crucified afresh and put to an open shame "by this
   "falling away;" and, in Hebrews 10, he is said to be "trodden under
   foot," and "the blood of the covenant is said to be profaned." All
   these are sins committed, not against the law, but against the gospel
   of Christ. From these observations, it is evident, that those persons
   who assert that this sin is committed against the acknowledged truth
   concerning God, and concerning His will and works, have not taught
   concerning it with sufficient distinctness; they ought to have
   subjoined "against the truth of the gospel." But the commands of the
   gospel are two -- that of faith in Christ, and that of conversion to
   God. Concerning faith it is manifest. About conversion let us now
   inquire; for as aversion from God is produced by sin, the law accuses
   him who is thus averse or turned aside, and condemns him to cursing,
   without any hopes of pardon; but the gospel requires conversion and
   promises pardon. Therefore, conversion to God is an evangelical
   command, and not legal. But impenitence is opposed to conversion to
   God; and this, when final, condemns a man through the peremptory decree
   of God, that is, through that which is evangelical. This final
   impenitence, however, cannot be called "the sin against the Holy
   Ghost," which is the subject on which we are now treating. For (1.)
   final impenitence is common to all those who are to be condemned; while
   the sin against the Holy Ghost attaches to certain persons, or, rather,
   to very few. (2.) Final impenitence is not committed except at the
   closing period of life; but this sin is perpetrated while he is still
   running the space of life. This is apparent from 1 John v. 16: "There
   is a sin unto death; I do not say that he shall pray for it." (3.)
   Concerning him who commits the sin unto death it is said that "it is
   impossible for him to be renewed again to repentance;" but this would
   be a useless expression respecting one who was finally impenitent; for
   it is well known that all hopes of pardon are terminated by the short
   course of the present life. (4.) Respecting the sin against the Holy
   Ghost, it is affirmed that "it shall not be forgiven, neither in this
   world nor in that which is to come;" that is, it shall never be
   forgiven. But it is unnecessary to make such an affirmation concerning
   final impenitence. This sin, therefore, is a transgression of the
   precept which commands faith in Jesus Christ. But as the doctrine
   concerning faith in Jesus Christ is not only entire, but likewise
   consists of certain parts; from this may be assumed a difference in the
   transgression, that one is universal, the other special. The universal
   is that by which Christ is simply rejected and refused, and which may
   receive the general appellation of "infidelity" or "unbelief." The
   special is that by which Christ is not universally rejected, but is
   merely not accepted as he has been manifested in his word; and this is
   called "a heresy," that term being employed concerning those who, after
   having professed faith in Christ, do not preserve his doctrines entire
   and unsullied, but corrupt them. But the sin about which we are
   treating does not lie in this special transgression. It belongs,
   therefore, to the universal transgression of this precept concerning
   faith in Christ; and it is infidelity or unbelief. It is not all
   unbelief, of which there are various kinds. (1.) The infidelity of
   those who have heard nothing respecting Christ; but such persons do not
   commit the sin against the Holy Ghost. (2.) That of those persons who
   have indeed heard of Christ, but have not understood; (Matt. xiii. 19;
   ) neither does the sin against the Holy Ghost attach to these men. (3.)
   The unbelief of those who have understood, but who have not been
   certainly persuaded and convinced in their consciences respecting the
   truth of the things understood; but these persons are not guilty of the
   sin against the Holy Ghost. (4.) That of those men who, being convinced
   in their consciences that Jesus is the Christ, by their infidelity
   still reject him; and, according to my judgment, to this class of
   persons belongs the sin against the Holy Ghost, about which we are now
   treating. Therefore, the genus or kind is a repulsion and rejection of
   Christ in opposition to conscience. It is not a mere abnegation or
   disowning; for that is the part of him who has previously made a
   profession. It is not an oppugnation or attack; for that belongs to
   further progress, [in the sin], as we shall, afterwards perceive. But
   it is worthy of observation, that in reality it is one and the same
   thing, whether it be called "a refusal of Christ," or "a rejection of
   the truth concerning Christ," provided a universal rejection be
   understood, and not a particular rejection in one doctrine or more. 2.
   Let us now come to the object. The object of this sin is said to be a
   person against whom the offense is committed, whether that person be
   God, or the offending mortal himself, or his neighbour. But we must
   take into our consideration not only the object, but also its mode,
   which the schoolmen denominate "the formal reason." This mode, when
   added to the object, causes the latter to be proper, adequate, and
   peculiar or suitable. A surface is an object of sight, but it is one
   which is coloured. An offense is committed against God by ingratitude,
   but it is against him as having merited better returns from us. We also
   sin against God by disobedience and contempt, as against him
   commanding, forbidding, promising, threatening, chastising, correcting,
   &c. Apostasy is committed against God, but it is against him when
   acknowledged as God, and to whose Deity and name he who falls away had
   devoted himself by oath. But, in this place, the object of the sin
   about which we are treating is Jesus Christ, and he immediately. This
   is the reason why I add the word "immediately," because he who rejects
   the Son, rejects also the Father. The mode of formal reason has been
   manifested and proved, [to the man who commits this sin,] nay, it has
   been known to be the Messiah and Redeemer of the world. This is evident
   from Hebrews vi. 6, in which those who thus "fall away" are said to
   "crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open
   shame." It is also evident from Hebrews x. 29, in which such persons
   are said to "tread under foot the Son of God, and to count the blood of
   the covenant an unholy thing." This is still more apparent from the
   words of the Pharisees, who said, "He casteth out devils by Beelzebub,
   the prince of devils," which are thus related by St. Mark: "For they
   said, he has an impure spirit," whether by these words they committed
   this sin, or not; for they contain the occasion on which Christ began
   to speak about the sin against the Holy Ghost. But because this mode
   agrees with the object through some gracious act, which proceeds
   principally and immediately from the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of
   grace; on this account this sin is called "the sin against the Holy
   Ghost" or against "the Spirit of grace;" because the offense is
   committed against that act of the Holy Spirit, either by despising the
   act, or by treating him also with ignominy. But that act of the Spirit
   is the act of testifying concerning Christ and the coming of his
   kingdom; an act not only sufficient to prove that Jesus is the Christ;
   but also efficacious, and assuredly convincing the mind and conscience
   of him to whom the testification is communicated concerning Christ; the
   operation and complete effect of which, in the mind of man, are an
   assured knowledge and persuasion of this truth, that "Jesus is the
   Christ, the Son of God." But of this sin the Holy Spirit is not the
   object; for it is not directed against his person. This is apparent
   from the end of the testifying and the object; for the end of this
   testification is Christ. But the object of this sin committed against
   the testification, and the object of the testification itself, are one
   and the same. And the end of the testifying is, not that the Holy
   Spirit, but that Jesus, be acknowledged and accepted for the Son of God
   and for the Anointed of the Lord. This is declared by Christ in the
   following words: "If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then is
   the kingdom of God come unto you." It also conduces to the same purpose
   that, not the Spirit out of Christ, but Christ himself in and through
   the Spirit, performed the miracles. From this, it appears, that the
   performing of miracles serves to prove the truth of the preaching of
   Christ concerning himself. From these remarks, I think, we may easily
   solve the difficulty which lies in the words of Christ, who
   distinguishes this "sin against the Holy Ghost" from "the sin against
   the Son of Man," and who declares that the former is irremissible or
   unpardonable, but that the latter is capable of forgiveness. For the
   sin against the Son of Man, without this testification of the Spirit,
   is remitted to many men; and it appears from the whole of this
   discussion, that regard is not had so much to the person against whom
   the sin is committed, as to the act of testification proceeding from
   the Holy Spirit, against whom the sin is perpetrated. With respect to
   the act, therefore, it is said to be perpetrated against the Holy
   Ghost, not against the Son of Man, but, with respect to the object,
   against the Son of Man, but who is known from the act of testifying.
   Since, then, regard is had rather to the act than to the object, in
   this respect this sin is called by Christ "the sin against the Holy
   Ghost," and is distinguished from the sin which is committed against
   Christ without any consideration of this mode and formal reason. I know
   there are among the fathers those who understand the appellation, "Son
   of Man," through a reduplication or reflection, to signify Jesus as he
   is the Son of Man, and the epithet, "Son of God," to signify Jesus as
   he is the Son of God. They also consider, that, when a sin committed
   against Jesus as he is the Son of Man, the offense is another and a
   less one than when he is sinned against as the Son of God. But such a
   consideration has no place here; for the testification of the Holy
   Spirit conduces to this end -- that the person who is sometimes
   denominated the Son of Man and sometimes the Son of God, be received as
   the true and only Messiah. Yet if any man be desirous of referring this
   consideration of some of the ancient fathers to the point under
   discussion, he will be able to say that a sin is committed against the
   Son of Man when Jesus is not recognized as the Son of God, but that a
   sin is committed against the Son of God, when it has been already
   proved, by undoubted testimonies, that he is the Son of God. The
   expressions in the Evangelist "Whosoever speaketh a word against the
   Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him," serve to favour this
   consideration, as do also those in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
   "crucifying to themselves the Son of God," and they who have "trodden
   under foot the Son of God," that is, Jesus, whom, through "the
   enlightening" of the Holy Spirit, they had previously accounted as "the
   Son of God." For it is manifest from the Scriptures that it was
   necessary to believe this attribute concerning Jesus of Nazareth, that
   he was the Christ, the Son of God, the saviour and Redeemer of the
   world, &c.; and as the object and the acts occupied about it have a
   mutual relation so that from an adequate object we can determine
   concerning the act, and from an act we can form a conclusion respecting
   the adequate object, it appears possible for us to conclude, from the
   acts which the apostle enumerates in Hebrews 6, and 10, that those
   persons who had thus sinned against Jesus, not only acknowledged him as
   the Son of God, but also sinned against him as against the Son of God
   whom they had so acknowledged. For, no one is said to "crucify the Son
   of God afresh," and to "tread him under foot," except that man who
   acknowledges him as the Son of God, and who sins against him under that
   consideration. For instance, the American Indians cannot be said to
   have "trodden under foot the gospel of Christ," when they trampled
   under their feet, and threw into the fire, the small volume of the four
   gospels, which was shewn to them by the Spaniards, who, in a boasting
   manner, represented it to them as the true gospel. 3. Let us now
   proceed to the description of the persons who commit this sin, that is,
   such as they are defined to us according to the Scriptures. But,
   generally, they are those who, through the testification of the Holy
   Spirit in their minds and consciences, are convinced of this truth --
   that Jesus, the son of Mary, is Christ the Sod of God. Yet these
   persons may differ among themselves, and in reality do differ; for,
   after having been convinced of this truth, they either immediately
   reject Christ, never tendering him their names to be enrolled among his
   followers; or, having for a season embraced and professed Christ, they
   decline from him and fall away. Of the first of these two classes were
   the Pharisees, if, at the time when they said that" Christ cast out
   devils through Beelzebub," they were convinced in their consciences
   that such ejectment of the devils was truly the work of the Holy
   Spirit, as Christ had laid down his argument, "If I by the Spirit of
   God cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out?" Of the second
   class, are those of whom mention is made in Hebrews 6 and 10. For they
   who embrace Christ even with a temporary faith, do this through the
   illumination of the Holy Spirit; because "no man can say that Jesus is
   the Lord, except by the Holy Ghost." (1 Cor. xii. 3.) To these persons
   has been granted some "taste of the heavenly gift, of the good word of
   God, and of the powers of the world to come;" for the testification of
   the Holy Spirit concerning Jesus Christ the Son of God, when impressed
   with a full persuasion on the mind, can be followed by no other effect
   than the excitement of joy and gladness in the heart of him who
   professes Christ, as Christ himself declares, in Matthew xiii. 20, "But
   he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that
   heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it," and as he also
   declares, in John v. 35, concerning those who "were willing for a
   season to rejoice in the light of John the Baptist." But on this
   subject consult Calvin's Institutes. (Lib. 3, cap. 2, sec. 11.) With
   regard to what is added in Heb. vi. 5, that the same persons "were made
   partakers of the Holy Ghost," this may be understood to relate to those
   extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit which at that period flourished
   in the church. This is likewise declared in Heb. ii. 4: "God likewise
   bare them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers
   miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will." In
   these persons, that abnegation or renouncing of Christ occurs which, in
   Hebrews 6, is denominated "a falling away," that is, from the truth
   which they have acknowledged, and from the confession of the name of
   Christ which they have made. About this renunciation of himself, Christ
   treats in a general manner in Luke xii. 9, subjoining to that passage a
   special mode in the particular deed which we are now discussing, and
   says, "Whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be
   forgiven him; but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it
   shall not be forgiven." To this genus of renunciation belongs the deed
   of Peter; but it is distinct, and differs greatly from this species, as
   will be very apparent in the next member that comes under our
   consideration. Therefore, the sin against the Holy Ghost is
   distinguished according to the mode of efficient causes, of which we
   have already adduced a distinction. 4. It follows that we now institute
   an inquiry into the cause of this sin. The cause of all sin is commonly
   represented to be either ignorance, weakness, or malice. Ignorance, not
   negative, but privative of the knowledge which ought to be within, and,
   therefore, ignorance of the law. Weakness, too infirm to resist
   vehement passion and temptation, and the seductions which impel men to
   sin. Malice, by which any one knowingly and willingly, being enticed
   indeed by some temptation, but which can be easily resisted by the
   will, and which the will is able readily to overcome, is induced to
   sin. Though ignorance and infirmity are not directly and immediately
   the causes of sin, yet they are causes through the mode of prohibiting
   absence -- ignorance, through the mode of the absence of right
   knowledge and reason, which might be able to hinder from sin by
   instructing the will -- infirmity, through the mode of the absence of
   strength and capability, which might hinder from sin by confirming and
   invigourating the will. If, therefore, we be desirous accurately to
   examine this matter, the will is the proper, adequate and immediate
   cause of sin, and has two motives and incentives to commit sin, the one
   internal, the other external. The internal, which lies in man himself,
   is the love of himself and a concupiscence or lusting after temporal
   things, or of the blessings which are visible. The external motive is
   an object moving the appetite or desire; such objects are honours,
   riches, pleasures, life, health and soundness, friends, country, and
   similar things, the contraries to which the man hates and execrates,
   and is afraid of them, if he imagine them to be impending over him. But
   these motives do not move the will so efficaciously that the will is
   necessarily moved; for, in this case, the will would be excusable from
   sin; but they move the will through the mode of suasion and enticement.
   But now, when, through love of himself and the desire of some apparent
   good, (in which is included an avoiding or hatred of an apparent evil,)
   man is solicited or enticed to some act, which is indeed forbidden, but
   which he does not know to be sinful, then the will, following the
   appetite and erroneous reason, is said to sin through ignorance. But
   when, through the same motives, he is tempted to an act which he knows
   to be sin, then the will, following the appetite, sins indeed
   knowingly; but whether such sin is committed through infirmity or
   through malice, ought to be decided chiefly from the necessity of that
   good which the man is pursuing, and from the deep heinousness of the
   evil which he avoids. On this point, a judgment must also be formed
   from the vehemence of the appetite or passion, as well as from the
   inclination towards the person who seems desirous to hinder the
   completion or fulfilling of the desire, (a circumstance which does not
   on every occasion occur, but which for a certain reason I thought must
   be added in this place,) where a discrimination of the mode by which he
   endeavours to hinder, comes under consideration, whether it be good,
   lawful, and commanded, or whether it be evil, unlawful and forbidden.
   Let us now apply these remarks to our purpose. Paul persecuted the
   church of Christ, but he did it ignorantly, being inflamed with too
   great a zeal and desire for the law, as many of the Jews also crucified
   Christ, being ignorant that he was the Lord of glory; otherwise they
   would have refrained from such a nefarious crime. By those men,
   therefore, the sin about which we are treating was not committed. Peter
   denied Christ his Lord, whom he knew to be the true Messiah and the
   Anointed of the Lord, and his knowledge of this was obtained through an
   immediate revelation from the Father; but his conduct proceeded from a
   desire of life and a fear of death -- feelings which may attack even
   the bravest of mankind. he did it, therefore, through infirmity.
   Through fear of banishment, prescription, condemnation to the mines or
   to perpetual imprisonment, some persons have shrunk back from a
   confession of the name of Christ; and they must be considered as having
   thus sinned through infirmity. In order to recover the dignity of the
   sword, the official girdle, &c., which the emperor had threatened to
   take away from them unless they abjured Christ, some of the early
   Christians retained all their honours at the expense of denying Christ;
   yet still even these must be said to have sinned through infirmity.
   Some individual, having been vehemently tormented, afflicted, injured
   and stripped of his goods by a Christian prince, or by Christian
   people, breaks forth into passionate expressions of blasphemy against
   God and Christ; yet he must be considered as having acted thus through
   anger and dreadful commotion of spirit. But if the persons in the
   preceding instances were to add, to this their sin, hatred against
   Christ Himself and his doctrine, according to my judgment they would
   not be far from committing the sin against the Holy Ghost. To express
   and conclude the whole in one word, I affirm that this sin against the
   Holy Ghost is properly committed through malice. I understand, here,
   malice of two kinds: The one, by which no resistance is offered to
   concupiscence or desire, when that can easily be done, without much
   inconvenience; the other, by which Christ himself is hated, either
   because he endeavours, by his precepts, to hinder the completion or
   fulfillment of the unlawful desire; or because the enjoyment of such
   illicit desire is not permitted, on account of his cause and name. Both
   kinds of this malice were in those Jews with whom Christ had the
   transaction which is mentioned in Matthew 12. But they do not seem then
   to have been fully convinced in their consciences, that Jesus was the
   Christ and the promised Messiah. Let us add, therefore, to the other
   parts of the definition of this sin, that it is committed through
   malice and hatred against Christ, or through hatred of Christ and of
   the truth concerning him. This hatred I think is included in the words
   employed by the apostle in Hebrews 6 & 10; for such persons are there
   said "to crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an
   open shame, to tread under foot the Son of God, to count the blood of
   the covenant an unholy thing, and to do despite unto the Spirit of
   grace." I suppose, by these words, are signified, not the results which
   happen to those who, beyond expectation, fall away or decline from
   Christ through their sin; but the acts which, of themselves, and by
   their own nature are allied to their sin, and which have an affinity
   with, and are consequences from, the same sin, not without the fixed
   purpose of those by whom it is committed. 5. To this cause, we will
   commodiously subjoin an end; for they correspond, for the most part,
   between themselves, and in a certain respect agree with each other. The
   end, therefore, is twofold. The one is the obtaining and the enjoyment
   of an apparent good which has been desired; the other is the completion
   of hatred, and the rejection of Christ and of his acknowledged truth,
   which Calvin has enunciated in these words:" -- for this purpose, that
   they may resist." By this very circumstance, is signified the malice of
   the man who thus sins, which, not content with obtaining the apparent
   good through the act of sin, is delighted even with the very act of sin
   as with its end or intention. This is a certain sign, that the will of
   this man has not been impelled by inclination or passion to perpetrate
   this crime, but that it has freely followed the inclination, and has
   added of its own this other thing -- hatred against Christ, from which,
   this hatred may be said to be entirely voluntary, and, therefore,
   arising from malice. For as appetite or desire is attributed to the
   concupiscible faculty, infirmity to the irascible, and ignorance to the
   reason or mind, so is malice attributed to the will. But from these
   things, considered in this manner, it seems the sin against the Holy
   Ghost may be thus defined: "The sin against the Holy Ghost is the
   rejection and refusing of Jesus Christ through determined malice and
   hatred against Christ, who, through the testifying of the Holy Spirit,
   has been assuredly acknowledged for the Son of God, (or, which is the
   same thing, the rejection and refusing of the acknowledged universal
   truth of the gospel,) against conscience and committed for this purpose
   -- that the sinner may fulfill and gratify his desire of the apparent
   good which is by no means necessary, and may reject Christ." 6. Let us
   subjoin these observations concerning the devotees of this sin. The
   following degrees of this sin, it seems to me possible to lay down in a
   commodious manner: The First is the rejection and refusal of Christ
   acknowledged, or of the acknowledged truth of the gospel. This degree
   is universal and primary; and it holds good under every circumstance,
   whether he who rejects and refuses Christ have for a season professed
   himself to be a disciple of Christ, or not -- a point which we have
   already discussed under the third head. The second degree is blasphemy
   against Christ the Son of God, and against the acknowledged truth of
   the gospel. The third is the assaulting and persecution of Christ,
   either in his own person or in those of his members, or the extirpation
   of the truth acknowledged. A fourth degree may be added, from the
   difference between the object, and the act by which that object is
   demonstrated and manifested; and this is blasphemy against the Spirit
   himself, or against the act of the Holy Spirit. For. he who calls
   Christ "a wine bibber," "a friend of publicans and sinners," "a seducer
   and false prophet," while he owns him to be the Son of God, sins in a
   different manner From him who says, that those miraculous operations of
   the Holy Spirit were performed by Beelzebub and were diabolical. 7. We
   have now arrived at the seventh division, which relates to the adjunct
   or attribute peculiar to this sin, that is, its being irremissible or
   unpardonable, and the cause why it is thus incapable of being forgiven.
   This sin is called "the sin unto death," not in the sense in which all
   sins merit death eternal, and that are, notwithstanding, remitted to
   many persons, as they have believed in Christ and are converted to God,
   but because no one who has committed this sin against the Holy Ghost,
   or who shall hereafter commit it, has at any time had the felicity, nor
   will he have it, of escaping death eternal. It is called
   "irremissible," not in the same manner as that in which unbelief and
   final impenitence are unpardonable, through this decree of God: "He
   that believeth not on the Son of God, is condemned," and "Unless ye
   repent and be converted, ye shall all likewise perish," &c. For these
   are conditions, without which sin is forgiven to no man. But it is
   called "unpardonable" in this sense, that, when it has once been
   perpetrated, the sinner never obtains remission from God, and never can
   obtain it, through the definitive and peremptory statute and decree of
   God, even though the offender should live many ages afterwards. But the
   proximate and immediate cause why this sin is unpardonable, seems to me
   to be comprehended in these words of the apostle in the epistle to the
   Hebrews: "It is impossible for those who shall thus fall away, to be
   renewed again unto repentance." The efficacy of this cause proceeds
   from the perpetual and immutable decree of God concerning the
   nonforgiveness of sins without repentance. But the mind cannot rest
   here; for it is further asked, "Why is it impossible for those who thus
   sin to be renewed again unto repentance?" The solution of this
   question, as it seems to me, must be taken partly from the causes of
   this "renewing again unto repentance," and partly from the heinousness
   of this sin, as described by the apostle in Hebrews 6 and 10. From a
   collation of these passages, it will be manifest why those who thus sin
   "cannot be renewed again to repentance." (1.) Let us treat on the
   causes of this renewing again. Renewing again to repentance seems to
   proceed from the mercy or grace of God in Christ, on account of the
   intercession of Christ, through the operation of the Holy Spirit, or
   the Spirit of grace. But this mercy of God, intercession of Christ, and
   operation of the Holy Spirit, are not infinite, that is, they do not
   operate according to the infinite omnipotence of God and Christ, and of
   his Spirit; but they are circumscribed by a certain mode of the equity
   and will of God, of Christ, and of the Spirit of God. This is apparent
   from particular passages of Scripture. Concerning the mercy of God,
   "God has mercy on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will, he
   hardeneth." Concerning the intercession of Christ, "I pray not for the
   world." Concerning the operation of the Holy Spirit, "whom the world
   cannot receive." (2.) Let us now consider the heinousness of this sin
   from the description of this apostle, who says, Those who thus sin,
   "crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open
   shame; they tread under foot the Son of God, count the blood of the
   covenant an unholy thing, and do despite unto the Spirit of grace." But
   I account these acts to be so black and diabolical, that we must
   affirm, the mercy of God in Christ is circumscribed by no bounds
   whatsoever, the intercession of Christ is concluded within no space,
   and the Spirit of grace can be hindered by no malice, if God does not
   deny his mercy to such persons, if Christ intercedes for them, and if
   the Spirit of Grace is not deterred from them so as not to exert upon
   them his gracious efficacy. Take into consideration the difference of
   the sin which is committed against the law of God, and that against the
   gospel and the grace of God in Christ; and reflect how much more
   heinous it is to reject the remedy of the disease than to fall into the
   disease itself! To remove from his hearers their despair of pardon, St.
   Peter says to them, after having been convicted of the sin which they
   had committed against Christ, "Now, brethren, I wot that through
   ignorance ye did it." (Acts iii. 17.) St. Paul says to the Corinthians,
   "For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of
   glory." (1 Cor. ii. 8.) He also says, concerning himself, "but I
   obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief." (1 Tim. i.
   13.) Christ, when hanging on the Cross, and as the Scriptures express
   it in Isaiah liii. 12, while making intercession for the transgressors,
   said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." (Luke
   xxiii. 34.) The Scriptures declare, respecting the Holy Spirit, that he
   is capable not only of being grieved, (Ephes. iv. 30,) but likewise of
   being vexed, (Isa. lxiii. 10,) and of being quenched. (1 Thess. v. 19.)
   Whosoever they be who answer this description, and crucify Christ long
   acknowledged by them as the Son of God, and who tread under foot his
   blood, that blood by which God hath redeemed the church unto himself,
   which is the price of redemption, than which nothing is more precious,
   and by which alone the gratuitous covenant between God and men is
   confirmed and established -- who, against their consciences, treat the
   Holy Spirit with the greatest contempt and disgrace, and who sin so
   grievously against him that no sin can equal this in heinousness; it
   follows that, to people of this class, is justly and equitably denied
   their being renewed again to repentance, unless we completely divest
   God of justice, and remove from his free will the administration of
   divine mercy. When we have done this, and have ascribed the dispensing
   of salvation to the infinity of the divine mercy or goodness only, the
   very foundations of religion are then overturned, and by this means,
   life eternal is assigned to all men universally, and even to the
   devils. If any one supposes that the affirmations which are made in
   Hebrews 6 and 10, belong only to those who, after their open profession
   of Christianity, shall relapse and fall away, let him know that
   contumely and reproach are poured on "the Spirit of grace," by those
   who have never made a profession of Christianity, and that these words
   -- "to renew them again unto repentance," and "the blood through which
   he was sanctified," seem properly to belong to those who have not made
   a profession, and that the remaining parts of the description belong to
   the entire order of those who sin against the Holy Ghost. Having
   considered the preceding matters in this hasty and slight manner, let
   us now proceed to investigate those three questions which you proposed.
   I. With regard to the first, I think it may be known when any one has
   committed this sin; because, if this had been impossible, John would
   not have forbidden us to pray for that man. For we ought to pray for
   all those to whom, with even the least semblance of probability, the
   mercy of God has been manifested, for whom the intercession of Christ
   has been prepared, and to whom the grace of the Holy Spirit has not
   been denied. The ancient church formed a similar judgment, when she not
   only accounted it improper to pray for Julian, the apostate, but also
   actually prayed against him. But, according to my judgment, an
   indication of the knowledge of this sin is afforded by acts on the part
   of those who commit it. The first act is that profession of the name of
   Christ which is neither forced nor affected, but voluntary; the second
   is the rejection of Christ and the abandonment of all profession. If to
   these two acts be added blasphemy, opposition, &c., the judgment
   concerning this sin is rendered still more evident. From these remarks,
   it is manifest that the judgment of man can be formed only concerning
   those persons who have, at some time or other, made an open profession
   of Christianity, and have afterwards relapsed and fallen away. For it
   is impossible for us to know, except through [an act of] divine
   revelation, what effects the testification of the Holy Spirit has
   produced in the minds of those who reject Christ before they make an
   open profession of him and his religion. This seems to be intimated by
   St. John, when he says," If any man shall see his brother," that is,
   one who has made an open profession of faith in Christ, "sin a sin
   which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life;" and
   it appears to be immediately repeated on the general principle, "There
   is a sin unto death," which, if a brother commit, I do not say that he
   shall pray for it." Let the whole history concerning Julian, the
   apostate, be taken into consideration, and it will be rendered manifest
   that the judgment of the church in that age was founded on the two acts
   which we have enumerated -- the former being the public profession of
   Christianity, and the latter the act of desertion, blasphemy and
   persecution. II. The second question is -- "Have Cain, Saul, Judas,
   Julian, Francis Spira, &c., perpetrated this crime?" In regard to this,
   I say, without any prejudice to the judgment of those who hold other
   and perhaps more correct sentiments on the subject, it seems to me that
   Cain did not perpetrate this crime. For this, a probable reason may, I
   think, be rendered: For he did not sin against grace through hatred to
   it, but through a perverse jealousy for grace, and through envy against
   his brother, because Abel had obtained that grace which was denied to
   himself, he committed crime of fratricide. Concerning the despair which
   is attributed to him, we know that interpreters differ in their
   opinions; and though he may have despaired of the mercy of God, yet it
   cannot be concluded from this that he had committed the sin about which
   we are treating; for despair is also a consequence of other sins, and
   not always, I think, an attendant on this sin. The sin of Saul was
   against David as a type of Christ, whom he persecuted in opposition to
   his conscience; but he committed it with this intention -- that he
   might afterwards preserve the kingdom safe and unimpaired for himself
   and his posterity. But as it is another thing to sin against the type
   of Christ, than to sin against Christ himself, (for Saul was in all
   likelihood ignorant of David being such a type,) and as he did not
   entirely decline from the Jewish religion, it has to me the air of
   probability that Saul did not commit the sin against the Holy Ghost. My
   opinion is different respecting Judas Iscariot; for I think that he
   sinned against the Holy Ghost, and this by the two indications which we
   have previously laid down. For as he lived three whole years in
   familiar converse with Christ, heard his discourses, saw his miracles,
   was himself sent forth with his fellow-disciples to preach the gospel,
   and was so far enlightened by the Holy Spirit as to be capable of
   executing that office, and actually did perform its duties, and, having
   been made a partaker of the Holy Ghost, he himself performed miracles,
   cast out devils, healed the sick, and raised the dead in the name of
   Christ, it cannot remain a matter of uncertainty that he assuredly and
   undoubtedly acknowledged his teacher, Jesus Christ, as the true Messiah
   and the Son of God. However, he not only deserted him whom he had thus
   acknowledged, but also delivered him up to his enemies, that sought to
   put him to death; and he did this not through weakness or some
   excusable necessity, but merely out of malice and pure hatred of
   Christ. This is evident from the history of the Evangelists, who relate
   that, at the moment when the "very precious ointment" was poured on the
   head of Christ, Judas departed and went to the chief priests, and
   bargained with them concerning the reward of his treason, which conduct
   was undoubtedly adopted by him to revenge himself upon Christ for the
   loss of the three hundred pence, for which the ointment might have been
   sold, and which were taken away from him, by Christ's permission. To
   this must be added, that the Scriptures reckon him among those against
   whom David, the type of Christ, formerly uttered the same petitions as
   those which St. Peter enumerates in that passage, (Acts i. 2, ) as
   having had their accomplishment in Judas. I entertain a similar opinion
   respecting Julian the apostate, whom I consider to have completed every
   branch of this sin through consummate malice and the most bitter enmity
   against Christ. For he abandoned Christianity, poured infinite
   contumelies on Christ, and persecuted Christian people and the
   Christian truth in various ways, nay, by every method which it was
   possible for him to devise. He also attributed the miracles of Christ
   more to the devil than to the Son of God, for which reason, the church,
   in those early days, prayed against him, and her prayers were heard by
   God, and answered. With respect to Francis Spira, it would be with
   great reluctance that I should venture to pronounce him guilty of the
   sin against the Holy Ghost. On the contrary, I incline to the opposite
   opinion respecting him, and in this I follow the judgment of some
   learned men of the present age, who not only acquit him from the guilt
   of being charged with this sin, but who likewise do not even exclude
   him from the pardon of his sins. For (1.)he did not deny Christ
   himself, but declined to make such a confession of Christ as the
   Papists disapproved. (2.) He did not avoid this Protestant confession
   through malice and hatred of the truth known by him, but through
   weakness and too intense a desire for a good which appeared to him in
   some degree necessary; for he feared the forcible seizure and loss of
   his goods, without which he supposed it to be utterly impossible for
   him to gain a livelihood for himself and family. (3.) In the very
   agonies of his despair, he made frequent and honourable mention not
   only of Christ, but likewise of his truth which he had professed. (4.)
   Being asked by those who stood around him if he wished God to grant him
   pardon for that offense and to impress the assurance of it upon his
   mind, he replied, that there was nothing of which he was more desirous,
   nay, that he wished it could be purchased even by the greatest
   torments. The purchase of it, however, he knew to be an impossibility
   -- that no one might suppose that, by this his desire, he inflicted an
   injury on the blood of Christ. (5.) He diligently and seriously
   admonished those who visited him to apply themselves to the
   mortification of the flesh, to renounce the good things of the present
   life, and also to despise life itself if the cause of Christ and of
   truth were to be forsaken, lest they, having followed his example,
   should rush into the same abyss of despair and damnation. All these
   particulars [in His case] served as inducements to many persons [in the
   Venitian states] to withdraw from the papal church, and to unite
   themselves with the evangelical or reformed church; and to some of
   those who had entered into this union, they served as reasons for
   persevering in their profession. III. With respect to the third
   question, I answer, that this sin is not directly committed against the
   Holy Ghost himself, but that it is primarily, properly and immediately
   perpetrated against his gracious act. Yet this so redounds to the
   disgrace and contumely of the Holy Spirit himself, that he is said to
   be blasphemed and to be treated with ignominy by this sin; and that not
   accidentally, but per se, of itself. But I think, from this, by good
   consequence, may be deduced that the Holy Spirit is not some property,
   virtue, or power in God, usually considered by us under the mode of
   quality, but that it is something living, intelligent, willing and
   acting, distinct from the Father and the Son; upon which men are
   accustomed to bestow the appellation of "a person." To me, this seems
   possible to be proved by many arguments. (l.) Because he is
   distinguished in opposition to the Son, which ought not to be done, if
   he were a virtue or power not subsisting, communicated to Christ by the
   Father, by which he might perform miracles, as through a principle from
   which he has the dominion and power of his own act, and not through a
   principle which itself possesses such a dominion and power. (2.)
   Because it is said that men sin against the Holy Ghost, and blasphemy
   is said to be uttered against the Spirit, and he is treated with scorn
   and contempt. These phrases do not seem to me to indicate the inbeing
   of the Holy Ghost within God and Christ, but the existence and
   subsistence of the Holy Spirit; especially as this sin is distinguished
   from the sin against the Son of Man, which ought not to be done if this
   sin had been perpetrated against an act of the power which exists
   within Christ and is employed by him, and not against the act of the
   powerful and operating Holy Spirit himself; for as there are acts that
   appertain to persons, (though they operate through some natural
   property of their own,) so are there also passions belonging to
   persons. If any man rejects the gracious invitation of God to
   repentance, that sin is said to be committed against an act of the
   mercy of God; and, in this manner, he who has so sinned is said to sin
   against the mercy of God, but so that, by this very act the sin is
   properly committed against God, who is, himself, the author of this
   gracious invitation according to his own gratuitous mercy. Neither
   could he who thus sins against the mercy of God be said not to sin
   against God, but against his mercy; as he who sins against the gracious
   act of the Holy Spirit, is said, in this passage, (Matt. xii. 31,32) to
   sin, not against the Son of Man, against the Holy Spirit. IV. To these
   three questions might be added a FOURTH: "Can the mere thinking upon
   the perpetration of this sin, and the serious deliberation about its
   commission, come under the denomination of the sin itself, and receive
   such an appellation, in the same way as he is called a murderer who is
   angry with his brother, and as that man is said to have committed
   adultery in his heart who has looked upon the wife of his neighbour to
   lust after her?" I reply, that this does not seem to me to be the sin
   itself; for, as long as this deliberation continues, so long flourishes
   in that man the efficacy of the Holy Spirit employed to hinder that
   sin, until he finally and absolutely concludes about the commission of
   this sin, having spurned and rejected the resistance offered by the
   Holy Spirit. Such a conclusion is followed by the sin in that very
   moment, with regard to the refusing and rejection of Christ, not with
   regard to the other devotees enumerated, which the man produces at his
   own opportunities, even if his malice and hatred of Christ did not
   cease to impel him to the completion of those degrees. Amsterdam March
