Prefatory note.

   Owen is an instance that attention to the outward order of the
   sanctuary, and zeal for the general rights of those who worship in it,
   are not incompatible with the cultivation of personal holiness and
   spirituality. In the year 1681, when he had published a tract in
   defence of the Nonconformists, and his laborious "Inquiry into
   Evangelical Churches," the following treatise, so rich in the spiritual
   experience of a renewed heart, was given to the world. During a season
   of indisposition so great that he had been led to anticipate the close
   of his earthly labours, he had composed some meditations for his own
   use; on his recovery he preached the substance of them to his
   congregation; and they were afterwards published in the shape of this
   treatise. This is scarcely one of the more important works of Owen, but
   some authority might be quoted as signifying a preference for it as the
   best of his productions; this treatise, however, would perhaps command
   the greatest number of suffrages in its favour. It evinces the same
   sharp discrimination of human motives and character, but to elevate
   believers above earthly objects and console them amid present trials
   seem to be its prevailing design; and it contains some passages which,
   in solemn tenderness and beauty, are not surpassed in all the writings
   of our author, who is here not so much a Boanerges set for the defence
   of the gospel, as a Barnabas intent on the consolation of the saints.

   "The following treatise of Dr Owen," says Dr Chalmers, "holds a
   distinguished rank among the voluminous writings of this celebrated
   author; and it is characterized by a forcible application of truth to
   the conscience, by a depth of experimental feeling, an accuracy of
   spiritual discernment into the intricacies and operations of the human
   mind, and a skill in exploring the secrecies of the heart, and the
   varieties of affection, and the ever-shifting phases of character,
   which render this admirable treatise not less a test than a valuable
   guide to the honest inquirer, in his scrutiny into the real state of
   his heart and affections."

  Analysis.

   After an explanation of Rom. viii. 6, the duty of being spiritually
   minded is described as including -- 1. The exercise of the mind in its
   thoughts concerning spiritual things; 2. The inclination of the mind in
   its affections towards them; and, 3. The complacency of the mind in
   them, chap. i. The treatise is divided into two parts:-- I. The former
   relating to the first of these heads, -- the nature of spiritual
   thoughts; II. The latter to the two other heads, -- the exercise of
   spiritual affections.

   Part I. As to the character of those thoughts which are the evidence of
   spiritual mindedness, -- 1. They are natural, in the sense of arising
   from ourselves, and as distinguished from thoughts suggested to the
   mind by (1.) impressions constraining it to acts opposed to its
   habitual procedure, and (2.) outward occasions; such as [1.] the
   preaching of the Word, [2.] prayer, and [3.] the discourses and remarks
   of other men. 2. They abound us, filling and engrossing our minds,
   ii.-iv.

   An inquiry follows into the objects of spiritual thoughts; which are,
   -- 1. The dispensations of Providence; 2. Special trials and
   temptations; and 3. Heavenly and eternal realities. In regard to the
   latter, -- (1.) The motives inducing us to fix our thoughts on them are
   mentioned; faith is thereby increased, hope is exercised, preparation
   is made for the cross, and the mind weaned from the world. And (2.)
   Directions for this spiritual exercise are supplied; -- the mind must
   be occupied with right notions of these objects, directed to them with
   intensity, and led to compare the blessedness of an interest in them
   with the opposite state of eternal death and misery, v.,vi. The
   especial objects of ritual contemplation are, -- 1. The person of
   Christ; and, 2. God himself, who must in our thoughts, in opposition to
   atheism, practical infidelity, various inferior degrees and ways of
   forgetting God, and the indulgence of secret lusts. The thoughts which
   are characteristic of spiritual affections are delineated, vii., viii.
   In our consideration of God, we must think of, -- (1.) His being; (2.)
   His omnipresence and omniscience; and, (3.) His omnipotence, ix.
   Various counsels are tendered to such as cannot fix their thoughts with
   steadiness on spiritual and heavenly objects, x.

   Part II. The two divisions of the proposed method respecting the
   inclination of the mind to spiritual thoughts and complacency in them
   are considered together; a preliminary account is given of the various
   ways by which God weans our affections from the world, xi. In order
   that our affections may be spiritual, it is shown, -- I. that in
   principle they must be renewed by grace: which renovation is proved, --
   1. By the universality of the gracious change produced; 2. The delight
   experienced in sacred duties; 3. The assimilating influence exerted on
   the mind by spiritual objects; and, 4. By the circumstance that, if our
   affections are renewed, the person of Christ is the centre of them,
   xii.-xviii. II. Spiritual mindedness in our affections is farther seen
   in the object about which they are conversant, -- God in Christ. The
   considerations endearing the object to us are, -- 1. its infinite
   beauty; 2. the fulness of wisdom in spiritual things; 3. their value as
   perfective of our present condition; and, 4. as constituting in the
   future enjoyment of them our eternal blessedness, xix. III. The soul's
   application to such objects must be firm, accompanied with a spiritual
   relish for them, must afford a continual spring of spiritual
   affections, must be prevailing and victorious, and afford help in
   subduing the remaining vanity to which the heart may be addicted, xx.
   After this copious exposition of the nature of spiritual mindedness,
   the blessings accruing from it are briefly unfolded, -- "life and
   peace," xxi. --Ed.

Preface.

   I think it necessary to give the reader a brief account of the nature
   and design of the ensuing plain discourse, which may both direct him in
   the reading and be some kind of apology for myself in the publishing of
   it. He may know, therefore, that the thoughts here communicated were
   originally private meditations for my own use, in a season wherein I
   was every way unable to do any thing for the edification of others, and
   far from expectation that ever I should be so able any more in this
   world. Receiving, as I thought, some benefit and satisfaction in the
   exercise of my own meditations therein, when God was graciously pleased
   to restore a little strength unto me, I insisted on the same subject in
   the instruction of a private congregation. And this I did, partly out
   of a sense of the advantage I had received myself by being conversant
   in them, and partly from an apprehension that the duties directed and
   pressed unto in the whole discourse were seasonable, from all sorts of
   present circumstances, to be declared and urged on the minds and
   consciences of professors: for, leaving others unto the choice of their
   own methods and designs, I acknowledge that these are the two things
   whereby I regulate my work in the whole course of my ministry. To
   impart those truths of whose power I hope I have had in some measure a
   real experience, and to press those duties which present occasions,
   temptations, and other circumstances, do render necessary to be
   attended unto in a peculiar manner, are the things which I would
   principally apply myself unto in the work of teaching others; for as in
   the work of the ministry in general, the whole counsel of God
   concerning the salvation of the church by Jesus Christ is to be
   declared, so in particular we are not to fight uncertainly, as men
   beating the air, nor shoot our arrows at random, without a certain
   scope and design. Knowledge of the flock whereof we are overseers, with
   a due consideration of their wants, their graces, their temptations,
   their light, their strength and weakness, are required herein. And
   when, in pursuance of that design, the preparation of the word to be
   dispensed proceeds from zeal for the glory of God and compassion unto
   the souls of men, when it is delivered with the demonstration of a due
   reverence unto God whose word it is, and of authority towards them unto
   whom it is dispensed, with a deep sense of that great account which
   both they that preach and they that hear the word preached must shortly
   give before the judgment-seat of Christ, there may be a comfortable
   expectation of a blessed issue of the whole work. But my present design
   is only to declare in particular the reasons why I judged the preaching
   and publishing of this small and plain discourse, concerning "the Grace
   and Duty of being Spiritually Minded," not to be altogether
   unseasonable at this time in the present circumstances of most
   Christians. And the first thing which I would observe unto this end is,
   the present importunity of the world to impose itself on the minds of
   men, and the various ways of insinuation whereby it possesseth and
   filleth them. If it attain hereunto, -- if it can fill the minds, the
   thoughts, and affections of men, with itself, -- it will in some
   fortify the soul against faith and obedience, and in others weaken all
   grace, and endanger eternal ruin. For "if we love the world, the love
   of the Father is not in us;" and when the world fills our thoughts, it
   will entangle our affections. And, first, the present state of all
   public affairs in it, with an apprehended concernment of private
   persons therein, continually exerciseth the thoughts of many, and is
   almost the only subject of their mutual converse; for the world is at
   present in a mighty hurry, and being in many places cast off from all
   foundations of steadfastness, it makes the minds of men giddy with its
   revolutions, or disorderly in the expectations of them.

   Thoughts about these things are both allowable and unavoidable, if they
   take not the mind out of its own power by their multiplicity,
   vehemency, and urgency, until it be unframed as unto spiritual things,
   retaining neither room nor time for their entertainment.

   Hence men walk and talk as if the world were all, when comparatively it
   is nothing.

   And when men come with their warmed affections, reeking with thoughts
   of these things, unto the performance of or attendance unto any
   spiritual duty, it is very difficult for them, if not impossible, to
   stir up any grace unto a due and vigorous exercise. Unless this
   plausible advantage which the world hath obtained of insinuating itself
   and its occasions into the minds of men, so as to fill them and possess
   them, be watched against and obviated, so far, at least, as that it may
   not transform the mind into its own image and likeness, this grace of
   being spiritually minded, which is life and peace, cannot be attained
   nor kept unto its due exercise.

   Nor can we be any of us delivered from this snare, at this season,
   without a watchful endeavour to keep and preserve our minds in the
   constant contemplation of things spiritual and heavenly, proceeding
   from the prevalent adherence of our affections unto them, as will
   appear in the ensuing discourse.

   Again; there are so great and pregnant evidences of the prevalency of
   an earthly, worldly frame of spirit in many who make profession of
   religion, that it is high time they were called unto a due
   consideration how unanswerable they are therein unto the power and
   spirituality of that religion which they do profess. There is no way
   whereby such a frame may be evinced to prevail in many, yea, in the
   generality of such professors, that is not manifest unto all. In their
   habits, attires, and vestments, in their usual converse and misspense
   of time, in their over-liberal entertainment of themselves and others,
   unto the borders of excess, and sundry other things of a like nature,
   there is in many such a conformity unto the world (a thing severely
   forbidden) that it is hard to make a distinction between them. And
   these things do manifest such a predominancy of carnal affections in
   the minds of men as, whatever may be pretended unto the contrary, is
   inconsistent with spiritual peace. To call men off from this evil frame
   of heart and mind, to discover the sin and danger of it, to direct them
   unto the ways and means whereby it may be affected, to supply their
   thoughts and affections with better objects, to discover and press that
   exercise of them which is indispensably required of all believers if
   they design life and peace, is some part of the work of the ensuing
   discourse. It may be it will be judged but a weak attempt as unto the
   attaining of that end; but it cannot be denied to have these two
   advantages, -- first, that it is seasonable, and, secondly, that it is
   sincerely intended. And if it have this only success, that it may
   occasion others who have more ability and opportunity than I have to
   bring in their assistance for an opposition unto the vehement and
   importunate insinuations of the world in these things to have an
   entertainment in the minds of professors, this labour will not be lost.
   But things are come to that pass amongst us that unless a more than
   ordinary vigorous exercise of the ministry of the word, with other
   means appointed unto the same end, be engaged in to recall professors
   unto that strict mortification, that sincerity of conversation, that
   separation from the ways of the world, that heavenly mindedness, that
   delight in the contemplation of spiritual things, which the gospel and
   the whole nature of Christian religion do require, we shall lose the
   glory of our profession, and leave it very uncertain what will be our
   eternal condition. The same may be spoken concerning love of the world,
   as unto the advantages and emoluments which men trust to attain unto
   themselves thereby. This is that which renders men earthly minded, and
   most remote from having their conversation above. In the pursuit of
   this corrupt affection do many professors of religion grow withering,
   useless, sapless, giving no evidence that the love of God abideth in
   them. On these and many other accounts do many Christians evidence
   themselves to be strangers from spiritual mindedness, from a life of
   meditation and holy contemplation on things above; yet unless we are
   found in these things in some good measure, no grace will thrive or
   flourish in us, no duty will be rightly performed by us, no condition
   sanctified or improved, nor are we prepared in a due manner, or "made
   meet for the inheritance of the saints in light." Wherefore, as was
   said, to direct and provoke men unto that which is the only remedy of
   all these evils, which alone is the means of giving them a view into
   and a foretaste of eternal glory, especially unto such who are in my
   own condition, -- namely, in a very near approach unto a departure out
   of this world, -- is the design and scope of the ensuing discourse,
   which is recommended unto the grace of God for the benefit of the
   reader.

   Grace and Duty of Being Spiritually Minded.

Chapter I.

   The words of the text explained: "to be spiritually minded is life and
   peace." Rom. viii. 6.

   The expression in our translation sounds differently from that in the
   original. "To be spiritually minded," say we. In the original it is
   phronema tou pneumatos, as that in the former part of the verse is
   phronema tes sarkos, which we render "to be carnally minded." In the
   margin we read, "the minding of the flesh" and "the minding of the
   Spirit;" and there is great variety in the rendering of the words in
   all translations, both ancient and modern. "Prudentia, sapientia,
   intelligentia, mens, cogitatio, discretio, id quod Spiritus sapit," --
   "The wisdom, the understanding, the mind, the thought or contrivance,
   the discretion of the Spirit, that which the Spirit savoureth," are
   used to express it. All our English translations, from Tindal's, the
   first of them, have constantly used, "To be spiritually minded;"
   neither do I know any words whereby the emphasis of the original,
   considering the design of the apostle in the place, can be better
   expressed. But the meaning of the Holy Ghost in them must be farther
   inquired into.

   In the whole verse there are two entire propositions, containing a
   double antithesis, the one in their subjects, the other in their
   predicates; and this opposition is the highest and greatest that is
   beneath eternal blessedness and eternal ruin.

   The opposite subjects are, the "minding of the flesh" and the "minding
   of the Spirit," or the being "carnally minded" and "spiritually
   minded." And these two do constitute two states of mankind, unto the
   one of which every individual person in the world doth belong; and it
   is of the highest concernment unto the souls of men to know whether of
   them they appertain unto. As unto the qualities expressed by "the
   flesh" and "the Spirit," there may be a mixture of them in the same
   persons at the same time, -- there is so in all that are regenerate;
   for in them "the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
   against the flesh, and these are contrary," Gal. v. 17. Thus different,
   contrary actings in the same subject constitute not distinct states;
   but where either of them is predominant or hath a prevalent rule in the
   soul, there it makes a different state. This distinction of states the
   apostle expresseth, Rom. viii. 9, "But ye are not in the flesh, but in
   the Spirit." Some are "in the flesh, and cannot please God," verse 8;
   they are "after the flesh," verse 5; they "walk after the flesh," verse
   1; they "live after the flesh," verse 13. This is one state. Others are
   "in the Spirit," verse 9; "after the Spirit," verse 5; "walk after the
   Spirit," verse 1. This is the other state. The first sort are "carnally
   minded," the other are "spiritually minded." Unto one of these doth
   every living man belong; he is under the ruling conduct of the flesh or
   of the Spirit; there is no middle state, though there are different
   degrees in each of these as to good and evil.

   The difference between these two states is great, and the distance in a
   manner infinite, because an eternity in blessedness or misery doth
   depend upon it; and this at present is evidenced by the different
   fruits and effects of the principles and their operations which
   constitute these different states, which is expressed in the opposition
   that is between the predicates of the propositions: for the minding of
   the flesh is "death," but the minding of the Spirit is "life and
   peace."

   "To be carnally minded is death." Death, as it is absolutely penal, is
   either spiritual or eternal. The first of these it is formally, the
   other meritoriously. It is formally death spiritual: for they that are
   carnally minded are "dead in trespasses and sins," Eph. ii. 1; for
   those who "fulfil the desires of the flesh and of the mind are by
   nature children of wrath," verse 3, -- are penally under the power of
   spiritual death. They are "dead in sins and the uncircumcision of the
   flesh," Col. ii. 13. And it is death eternal meritoriously: "For if ye
   live after the flesh, ye shall die," Rom. viii. 13; as "the wages of
   sin is death," chap. vi. 23.

   The reason why the apostle denounces so woeful a doom, so dreadful a
   sentence, on the carnal mind, he declares in the two next verses:
   "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject
   to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the
   flesh cannot please God." If it be thus with the carnal mind, it is no
   wonder that "to be carnally minded is death;" it is not meet it should
   be any thing else. That which is enmity against God is under the curse
   of God.

   In opposition hereunto it is affirmed that "to be spiritually minded,"
   or the minding of the Spirit, "is life and peace." And these are the
   things which we are particularly to inquire into, -- namely, What is
   this "minding of the Spirit;" and then, How it is "life and peace."

   1. The " Spirit "in this context is evidently used in a double sense,
   as is usual where both the Holy Spirit himself and his work on the
   souls of men are related unto. (1.) The person of the Spirit of God
   himself, or the Holy Ghost, is intended by it: Rom. viii. 9, "If so be
   that the Spirit of God dwell in you." And so also verse 11, "The Spirit
   of him that raised up Jesus from the dead." He is spoken of as the
   principal efficient cause of all the spiritual mercies and benefits
   here and afterward insisted on. (2.) It is used for the principle of
   spiritual life wrought in all that are regenerate by the Holy Ghost;
   for "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit," John iii. 6.

   It is most probable that the name "Spirit" is here used in the latter
   sense, -- not for the Spirit himself, but for "that which is born of
   the Spirit," the principle of spiritual life in them that are born of
   God; for it is, in its nature, actings, inclinations, and operations,
   opposed unto "the flesh," Rom. viii. 1, 4, 5. But "the flesh" here
   intended is that inherent corrupt principle of depraved nature whence
   ell evil actions do proceed, and wherewith the actions of all evil men
   are vitiated. The opposition between them is the same with that
   mentioned and declared by the apostle, Gal. v. 17, etc. Wherefore "the
   Spirit" in this place is the holy, vital principle of new obedience,
   wrought in the souls of believers by the Holy Ghost, enabling them to
   live unto God.

   2. Unto this Spirit there is phronema ascribed, which, as we have
   intimated, is translated with great variety. Phronesis is the principal
   power and act of the mind. It is its light, wisdom, prudence,
   knowledge, understanding, and discretion. It is not so with respect
   unto speculation or ratiocination merely, which is dianoia or sunesis·
   but this phronesis is its power as it is practical, including the
   habitual frame and inclination of the affections also. It is its
   faculty to conceive of things with a delight in them and adherence unto
   them, from that suitableness which it finds in them unto all its
   affections. Hence we translate phronein sometimes to "think," -- that
   is, to conceive and judge, Rom. xii. 3; sometimes to "set the
   affection," Col. iii. 2, -- to have such an apprehension of things as
   to cleave unto them with our affections; sometimes to "mind," to "mind
   earthly things," Phil. iii. 19, which includeth that relish and savour
   which the mind finds in the things it is fixed on. Nowhere doth it
   design a notional conception of things only, but principally the
   engagement of the affections unto the things which the mind apprehends.

   Phronema, the word here used, expresseth the actual exercise, tes
   phroneseos, of the power of the mind before described. Wherefore, the
   "minding of the Spirit" is the actual exercise of the mind as renewed
   by the Holy Ghost, as furnished with a principle of spiritual life and
   light, in its conception of spiritual things and the setting of its
   affections on them, as finding that relish and savour in them wherewith
   it is pleased and satisfied.

   And something we must yet farther observe, to give light unto this
   description of the "minding of the Spirit," as it is here spoken of:--

   1. It is not spoken of absolutely as unto what it is in itself, but
   with respect unto its power and prevalency in us, significantly
   rendered, "To be spiritually minded;" that is, to have the mind changed
   and renewed by a principle of spiritual life and light, so as to be
   continually acted and influenced thereby unto thoughts and meditations
   of spiritual things, from the affections cleaving unto them with
   delight and satisfaction. So, on the contrary, it is when men "mind
   earthly things." From a principle of love unto them, arising from their
   suitableness unto their corrupt affections, their thoughts,
   meditations, and desires are continually engaged about them. Wherefore,
   --

   2. Three things may be distinguished in the great duty of being
   spiritually minded, under which notion it is here recommended unto
   us:--

   (1.) The actual exercise of the mind, in its thoughts, meditations, and
   desires, about things spiritual and heavenly. So is it expressed in the
   verse foregoing: "They that are after the flesh do mind the things of
   the flesh," -- they think on them, their contrivances are about them,
   and their desires after them; "but they that are after the Spirit the
   things of the Spirit." They mind them by fixing their thoughts and
   meditations upon them.

   (2.) The inclination, disposition, and frame of the mind, in all its
   affections, whereby it adheres and cleaves unto spiritual things. This
   "minding of the Spirit" resides habitually in the affections.
   Wherefore, the phronema of the Spirit, or the mind as renewed and acted
   by a spiritual principle of light and life, is the exercise of its
   thoughts, meditations, and desires, on spiritual things, proceeding
   from the love and delight of its affections in them and engagement unto
   them.

   (3.) A complacency of mind, from that gust, relish, and savour, which
   it finds in spiritual things, from their suitableness unto its
   constitution, inclinations, and desires. There is a salt in spiritual
   things, whereby they are condited and made savoury unto a renewed mind;
   though to others they are as the white of an egg, that hath no taste or
   savour in it. In this gust and relish lies the sweetness and
   satisfaction of spiritual life. Speculative notions about spiritual
   things, when they are alone, are dry, sapless, and barren. In this gust
   we taste by experience that God is gracious, and that the love of
   Christ is better than wine, or whatever else hath the most grateful
   relish unto a sensual appetite. This is the proper foundation of that
   "joy which is unspeakable and full of glory."

   All these things do concur in the minding of the Spirit, or to
   constitute any person spiritually minded. And although the foundation
   of the whole duty included in it lies in the affections, and their
   immediate adherence unto spiritual things, whence the thoughts and
   meditations of the mind about them do proceed, yet I shall treat of the
   distinct parts of this duty in the order laid down, beginning with the
   exercise of our thoughts and meditations about them; for they being the
   first genuine actings of the mind, according unto the prevalency of
   affections in it, they will make the best and most evident discovery of
   what nature the spring is from whence they do arise. And I shall not
   need to speak distinctly unto what is mentioned in the third place,
   concerning the complacency of the mind in what its affections are fixed
   on, for it will fall in with sundry other things that are to be spoken
   unto.

   But before we do proceed, it is not amiss, as I suppose, to put a
   remark upon those important truths which are directly contained in the
   words proposed as the foundation of the present discourse; as, --

   1. To be spiritually minded is the great distinguishing character of
   true believers from all unregenerate persons. As such is it here
   asserted by the apostle. All those who are "carnally minded," who are
   "in the flesh," they are unregenerate, they are not born of God, they
   please him not, nor can do so, but must perish forever. But those who
   are "spiritually minded" are born of God, do live unto him, and shall
   come to the enjoyment of him. Hereon depend the trial and determination
   of what state we do belong unto.

   2. Where any are spiritually minded, there, and there alone, is life
   and peace. What these are, wherein they do consist, what is their
   excellency and pre-eminence above all things in this world, how they
   are the effects and consequents of our being spiritually minded, shall
   be afterwards declared.

   There is neither of these considerations but is sufficient to
   demonstrate of how great concernment unto us it is to be spiritually
   minded, and diligently to inquire whether we are so or no.

   It will therefore be no small advantage unto us to have our souls and
   consciences always affected with and in due subjection unto the power
   of this truth, -- namely, that "to be spiritually minded is life and
   peace;" whence it will follow, that whatever we may think otherwise, if
   we are not so, we have neither of them, neither life nor peace. It
   will, I say, be of use unto us if we are affected with the power of it;
   for many greatly deceive themselves in hearing the word. They admit of
   sacred truths in their understanding, and assent unto them, but take
   not in the power of them on their consciences, nor strictly judge of
   their state and condition by them, which proves their ruin; for hereby
   they seem to themselves to believe that whereof in truth they believe
   not one syllable as they ought. They hear it, they understand it in the
   notion of it, they assent unto it, at least they do not contradict it,
   yea, they commend it oftentimes and approve of it, but yet they believe
   it not; for if they did, they would judge themselves by it, and reckon
   on it that it will be with them at the last day according as things are
   determined therein.

   Or such persons are, as the apostle James declares, "like a man
   beholding his natural face in a glass; for he beholdeth himself, and
   goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was,"
   chap. i. 23, 24. There is a representation made of them, their state
   and condition, unto them in the word; they behold it, and conclude that
   it is even so with them as the word doth declare; but immediately their
   minds are filled with other thoughts, acted by other affections, taken
   up with other occasions, and they forget in a moment the representation
   made of themselves and their condition. Wherefore all that I have to
   offer on this subject will be utterly lost, unless a firm persuasion
   hereof be fixed on our minds, unless we are under the power of it, that
   "to be spiritually minded is life and peace;" so that whatever our
   light and profession be, our knowledge or our duty, without this we
   have indeed no real interest in life and peace.

   These things being premised, I shall more practically open the nature
   of this duty, and what is required unto this frame of spirit. To be
   "spiritually minded" may be considered either as unto the nature and
   essence of it, or as unto its degrees; for one may be so more than
   another, or the same person may be more so at one time than another. In
   the first way it is opposed unto being "carnally minded;" in the other
   unto being "earthly minded."

   "To be carnally minded is," as the apostle speaks, "death;" it is so
   every way; and they who are so are dead in trespasses and sins. This is
   opposed unto being "spiritually minded," as unto its nature or essence.
   When a man, as unto the substance and being of the grace and duty
   intended, is not spiritually minded, he is carnally minded, -- that is,
   under the power of death spiritual, and obnoxious unto death eternal.
   This is the principal foundation we proceed upon, whence we demonstrate
   the indispensable necessity of the frame of mind inquired after.

   There are two ways wherein men are earthly minded. The one is absolute,
   when the love of earthly things is wholly predominant in the mind. This
   is not formally and properly to be carnally minded, which is of a
   larger extent. The one denomination is from the root and principle,
   namely, the flesh; the other from the object, or the things of the
   earth. The latter is a branch from the former, as its root. To be
   earthly minded is an operation and effect of the carnal mind in one
   especial way and instance; and it is as exclusive of life and salvation
   as the carnal mind itself, Phil. iii. 19; 1 John ii. 15, 16. This,
   therefore, is opposed unto the being of spiritual mindedness no less
   than to be carnally minded is. When there is in any a love of earthly
   things that is predominant, whence a person may be rightly denominated
   to be earthly minded, he is not, nor can be, spiritually minded at all;
   he hath no interest in the frame of heart and spirit intended thereby.
   And thus it is evidently with the greatest part of them who are called
   Christians in the world, let them pretend what they will to the
   contrary.

   Again; there is a being earthly minded which consists in an inordinate
   affection unto the things of this world. It is that which is sinful,
   which ought to be mortified; yet it is not absolutely inconsistent with
   the substance and being of the grace inquired after. Some who are
   really and truly spiritually minded, yet may, for a time at least, be
   under such an inordinate affection unto and care about earthly things,
   that if not absolutely, yet comparatively, as unto what they ought to
   be and might be, they may be justly said to be earthly minded. They are
   so in respect of those degrees in being spiritually minded which they
   ought to aim at and may attain unto. And where it is thus, this grace
   can never thrive or flourish, it can never advance unto any eminent
   degree.

   This is the Zoar of many professors, -- that "little one" wherein they
   would be spared. Such an earthly mindedness as is wholly inconsistent
   with being spiritually minded, as unto the state and condition which
   depends thereon, they would avoid; for this they know would be
   absolutely exclusive of life and peace. They cannot but know that such
   a frame is as inconsistent with salvation as living in the vilest sin
   that any man can contract the guilt of. There are more ways of
   spiritual and eternal death than one, as well as of natural. All that
   die have not the plague, and all that perish eternally are not guilty
   of the same profligate sins. The covetous are excluded from the kingdom
   of God no less severely than fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, and
   thieves, 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. But there is a degree in being earthly
   minded which they suppose their interest, advantages, relations, and
   occasions of life do call for, which they would be a little indulged
   in; they may abide in such a frame without a disparagement of their
   profession. And the truth is, they have too many companions to fear an
   especial reflection on themselves. The multitude of the guilty take
   away the sense and shame of the guilt. But, besides, they hope well
   that it is not inconsistent absolutely with being spiritually minded;
   only they cannot well deny but that it is contrary unto such degrees in
   that grace, such thriving in that duty, as is recommended unto them.
   They think well of others who are spiritually minded in an eminent
   degree, at least they do so as unto the thing itself in general; for
   when they come unto particular instances of this or that man, for the
   most part they esteem what is beyond their own measure to be little
   better than pretence. But, in general, to be spiritually minded in an
   eminent degree, they cannot but esteem it a thing excellent and
   desirable; -- but it is for them who are more at leisure than they are;
   their circumstances and occasions require them to satisfy themselves
   with an inferior measure.

   To obviate such pretences, I shall insist on nothing, in the
   declaration of this duty and the necessity of it, but what is incumbent
   on all that believe, and without which they have no grounds to assure
   their conscience before God. And at present in general I shall say,
   Whoever he be who doth not sincerely aim at the highest degree of being
   spiritually minded which the means he enjoyeth would lead him unto, and
   which the light he hath received doth call for, -- whoever judgeth it
   necessary unto his present advantages, occasions, and circumstances, to
   rest in such measures or degrees of it as he cannot but know come short
   of what he ought to aim at, and so doth not endeavour after
   completeness in the will of God herein, -- can have no satisfaction in
   his own mind, hath no unfailing grounds whereon to believe that he hath
   any thing at all of the reality of this grace in him. Such a person
   possibly may have life, which accompanies the essence of this grace,
   but he cannot have peace, which follows on its degree in a due
   improvement. And it is to be feared that far the greatest number of
   them who satisfy themselves in this apprehension, willingly neglecting
   an endeavour after the farther degrees of this grace and growth in this
   duty, which their light or convictions, and the means they enjoy, do
   suggest unto them, are indeed carnally minded and every way obnoxious
   unto death.

Chapter II.

   A particular account of the nature of this grace and duty of being
   spiritually minded -- how it is stated in and evidenced by our
   thoughts.

   Having stated the general concernments of that frame of mind which is
   here recommended unto us, we may proceed to inquire more particularly
   into the nature of it, according unto the description before given in
   distinct propositions, And we shall carry on both these intentions
   together, -- first, to show what it is, and wherein it doth consist;
   and then, how it doth evidence itself, so as that we may frame a right
   judgment whether it be in us or no. And we shall have no regard unto
   them who either neglect or despise these things on any pretence
   whatever; for this is the word according unto which we shall all
   shortly be judged, "To be carnally minded is death; but to be
   spiritually minded is life and peace."

   Thoughts and meditations as proceeding from spiritual affections are
   the first things wherein this spiritual mindedness doth consist, and
   whereby it doth evidence itself. Our thoughts are like the blossoms on
   a tree in the spring. You may see a tree in the spring all covered with
   blossoms, so that nothing else of it appears. Multitudes of them fall
   off and come to nothing. Ofttimes where there are most blossoms there
   is least fruit. But yet there is no fruit, be it of what sort it will,
   good or bad, but it comes in and from some of those blossoms. The mind
   of man is covered with thoughts, as a tree with blossoms. Most of them
   fall off, vanish, and come to nothing, end in vanity; and sometimes
   where the mind doth most abound with them there is the least fruit; the
   sap of the mind is wasted and consumed in them. Howbeit there is no
   fruit which actually we bring forth, be it good or bad, but it proceeds
   from some of these thoughts. Wherefore, ordinarily, these give the best
   and surest measure of the frame of men's minds. "As a man thinketh in
   his heart, so is he," Prov. xxiii. 7. In case of strong and violent
   temptations, the real frame of a man's heart is not to be judged by the
   multiplicity of thoughts about any object, for whether they are from
   Satan's suggestions, or from inward darkness, trouble, and horror, they
   will impose such a continual sense of themselves on the mind as shall
   engage all its thoughts about them; as when a man is in a storm at sea,
   the current of his thoughts run quite another way than when he is in
   safety about his occasions. But ordinarily voluntary thoughts are the
   best measure and indication of the frame of our minds. As the nature of
   the soil is judged by the grass which it brings forth, so may the
   disposition of the heart by the predominancy of voluntary thoughts;
   they are the original actings of the soul, the way whereby the heart
   puts forth and empties the treasure that is in it, the waters that
   first rise and flow from that fountain. Every man's heart is his
   treasury, and the treasure that is in it is either good or evil, as our
   Saviour tells us. There is a good and bad treasure of the heart; but
   whatever a man hath, be it good or evil, there it is. This treasure is
   opening, emptying, and spending itself continually, though it can never
   be exhausted; for it hath a fountain, in nature or grace, which no
   expense can diminish, yea, it increaseth and getteth strength by it.
   The more you spend of the treasure of your heart in any kind, the more
   will you abound in treasure of the same kind. Whether it be good or
   evil, it grows by expense and exercise; and the principal way whereby
   it puts forth itself is by the thoughts of the mind. If the heart be
   evil, they are for the most part vain, filthy, corrupt, wicked,
   foolish; it it be under the power of a principle of grace, and so have
   a good treasure in it, it puts forth itself by thoughts suitable unto
   its nature and compliant with its inclinations.

   Wherefore, these thoughts give the best measure of the frame of our
   minds and hearts, I mean such as are voluntary, such as the mind of its
   own accord is apt for, inclines and ordinarily betakes itself unto. Men
   may have a multitude of thoughts about the affairs of their callings
   and the occasions of life, which yet may give no due measure of the
   inward frame of their hearts. So men whose calling and work it is to
   study the Scripture, or the things revealed therein, and to preach them
   unto others, cannot but have many thoughts about spiritual things, and
   yet may be, and oftentimes are, most remote from being spiritually
   minded. They may be forced by their work and calling to think of them
   early and late, evening and morning, and yet their minds be no way
   rendered or proved spiritual thereby. It were well if all of us who are
   preachers would diligently examine ourselves herein. So is it with them
   who oblige themselves to read the Scriptures, it may be so many
   chapters every day. Notwithstanding the diligent performance of their
   task, they may be most remote from being spiritually minded. See Ezek.
   xxxiii. 31. But there is a certain track and course of thoughts that
   men ordinarily betake themselves unto when not affected with present
   occasions. If these be vain, foolish, proud, ambitious, sensual, or
   filthy, such is the mind and its frame; if they be holy, spiritual, and
   heavenly, such may the frame of the mind be judged to be. But these
   things must be more fully explained.

   It is the great character and description of the frame of men's minds
   in an unregenerate condition, or before the renovation of their
   natures, that "every imagination of the thoughts of their hearts is
   only evil continually," Gen. vi. 5. They are continually coining
   figments and imaginations in their hearts, stamping them into thoughts
   that are vain, foolish, and wicked. All other thoughts in them are
   occasional; these are the natural, genuine product of their hearts.
   Hence the dearest, and sometimes first, discovery of the bottomless
   evil treasure of filth, folly, and wickedness, that is in the heart of
   man by nature, is from the innumerable multitude of evil imaginations
   which are there coined and thrust forth every day. So the wicked are
   said to be "like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters
   cast up mire and dirt," Isa. lvii. 20. There is a fulness of evil in
   their hearts, like that of water in the sea; this fulness is troubled
   or put into continual motion by their lusts and impetuous desires;
   hence the mire and dirt of evil thoughts are continually cast up in
   them.

   It is therefore evident that the predominancy of voluntary thoughts is
   the best and most sure indication of the inward frame and state of the
   mind; for if it be so on the one side as unto the carnal mind, it is so
   on the other as unto the spiritual. Wherefore, to be spiritually
   minded, in the first place, is to have the course and stream of those
   thoughts which we ordinarily retreat unto, which we approve of as
   suited unto our affections, to be about spiritual things. Therein
   consists the minding of the Spirit.

   But because all men, unless horribly profligate, have thoughts about
   spiritual things, yet we know that all men are not spiritually minded,
   we must consider what is required unto such thoughts to render them a
   certain indication of the state of our minds. And there are these three
   things required hereunto:--

   First, That they be natural, arising from ourselves, and not from
   outward occasions. The psalmist mentions the "inward thought" of men,
   Ps. xlix. 11, lxiv. 6; but whereas all thoughts are the inward acts of
   the mind, it should seem that this expression makes no distinction of
   the especial kind of thoughts intended from those of another sort. But
   the difference is not in the formal nature of them, but in the causes,
   springs, and occasions. Inward thoughts are such as arise merely and
   solely from men's inward principles, dispositions, and inclinations,
   that are not suggested or excited by any outward objects. Such in
   wicked men are those actings of their lusts whereby they entice and
   seduce themselves, James i. 14. Their lusts stir up thoughts leading
   and encouraging them to make provision for the flesh. These are their
   "inward thoughts." Of the same nature are those thoughts which are the
   "minding of the Spirit." They are the first natural egress and genuine
   acting of the habitual disposition of the mind and soul.

   Thus in covetous men there are two sorts of thoughts whereby their
   covetousness acts itself:-- First, such as are occasioned by outward
   objects and opportunities. So it was with Achan, Josh. vii. 21. "When,"
   saith he, "I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two
   hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold, then I coveted them."
   His sight of them, with an opportunity of possessing himself of them,
   excited covetous thoughts and desires in him. So is it with others
   every day, whose occasions call them to converse with the objects of
   their lusts. And some by such objects may be surprised into thoughts
   that their minds are not habitually inclined unto; and therefore when
   they are known, it is our duty to avoid them. But the same sort of
   persons have thoughts of this nature arising from themselves only,
   their own dispositions and inclinations, without any outward
   provocations. "The vile person will speak villany, and his heart will
   work iniquity," Isa. xxxii. 6; and this he doth as the "liberal
   deviseth liberal things," verse 8. From his own disposition and
   inclination, he is contriving in his thoughts how to act according to
   them. So the unclean person hath two sorts of thoughts with respect
   unto the satisfaction of his lust:-- First, such as are occasioned in
   his mind by the external objects of it. Hereunto stage plays,
   revellings, dancings, with the society of bold persons, persons of
   corrupt communication, do contribute their wicked service. For the
   avoidance of this snare, Job "made a covenant with his eyes," chap.
   xxxi. 1; and our Saviour gives that holy declaration of the evil of it,
   Matt. v. 28. But he hath an habitual spring of these thoughts in
   himself, constantly inclining and disposing him thereunto. Hence the
   apostle Peter tells us that such persons "have eyes full of an
   adulteress, that cannot cease from sin," 2 Pet. ii. 14. Their own
   affections make them restless in their thoughts and contrivances about
   sin. So is it with them who are given to excess in wine or strong
   drink. They have pleasing thoughts raised in them from the object of
   their lust represented unto them. Hence Solomon gives that advice
   against the occasion of them, Prov. xxiii. 31. But it is their own
   habitual disposition which carries them unto pleasing thoughts of the
   satisfaction of their lust; which he describes, verses 33-35. So is it
   in other cases. The thoughts of this latter sort are men's inward
   thoughts; and such must these be of spiritual things, whence we may be
   esteemed spiritually minded.

   Ps. xlv. 1, saith the psalmist, "My heart is inditing a good matter: I
   speak of the things which I have made touching the King." He was
   meditating on spiritual things, on the things of the person and kingdom
   of Christ. Hence his heart "bubbled up" (as it is in the original) "a
   good matter." It is an allusion taken from a quick spring of living
   waters: from its own life and fulness it bubbles up the water that runs
   and flows from it. So is it with these thoughts in them that are
   spiritually minded. There is a living fulness of spiritual things in
   their minds and affections that springeth up into holy thoughts about
   them.

   From hence doth our Saviour give us the great description of spiritual
   life. It is "a well of living water springing up into everlasting
   life," John iv. 10, 12. The Spirit, with his graces residing in the
   heart of a believer, is a well of living water. Nor is it such a well
   as, content with its own fulness, doth not of its own accord, without
   any instrument or pains in drawing, send out its refreshing waters, as
   it is with most wells, though of living water; for this is spoken by
   our Saviour in answer and opposition unto that objection of the woman,
   upon his mention of giving living water, verse 10: "Sir," saith she,
   "thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; whence wilt thou
   have this water?" verse 11. "True," saith he, "such is the nature of
   this well and water, dead, earthly things, -- they are of no use,
   unless we have instruments, lines and buckets, to draw withal. But the
   living water which I shall give is of another nature. It is not water
   to be kept in a pit or cistern without us, whence it must be drawn; but
   it is within us, and that not dead and useless, but continually
   springing up unto the use and refreshment of them that have it." For so
   is it with the principle of the new creature, of the new nature, the
   Spirit and his graces, in the hearts of them that do believe, -- it
   doth of itself and from itself, without any external influence on it,
   incline and dispose the whole soul unto spiritual actings that tend
   unto eternal life. Such are the thoughts of them that are spiritually
   minded. They arise from the inward principle, inclination, and
   disposition of the soul, -- are the bubblings of this well of living
   water; they are the mindings of the Spirit.

   So our Saviour describes them, Matt. xii. 35, "A good man out of the
   good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things." First, the man
   is good; as he said before, "Make the tree good, or the fruit cannot be
   good," verse 33. He is made so by grace, in the change and renovation
   of his nature; for in ourselves we are every way evil. This good man
   hath a treasure in his heart. So all men have; as the next words are,
   "The evil man out of the evil treasure of the heart." And this is the
   great difference that is between men in this world. Every man hath a
   treasure in his heart; that is, a prevailing, inexhaustible principle
   of all his actings and operations. But in some this treasure is good,
   in others it is evil; that is, the prevailing principle in the heart,
   which carries along with it its dispositions and inclinations, is in
   some good and gracious, in others it is evil. Out of his good treasure
   a good man bringeth forth good things. The first opening of it, the
   first bringing of it forth, is by these thoughts. The thoughts that
   arise out of the heart are of the same nature with the treasure that is
   in it. If the thoughts that naturally arise and spring up in us are for
   the most part vain, foolish, sensual, earthly, selfish, such is the
   treasure that is in our hearts, and such are we; but where the thoughts
   that thus naturally proceed from the treasure that is in the heart are
   spiritual and holy, it is an argument that we are spiritually minded.

   Where it is not thus with our thoughts, they give no such evidence as
   that inquired after. Men may have thoughts of spiritual things, and
   that many of them, and that frequently, which do not arise from this
   principle, but may be resolved into two other causes; -- 1. Inward
   force; 2. Outward occasions.

   1. Inward force, as it may be called. This is by convictions.
   Convictions put a kind of a force upon the mind, or an impression that
   causeth it to act contrary unto its own habitual disposition and
   inclination. It is in the nature of water to descend; but apply an
   instrument unto it that shall make a compression of it and force it
   unto a vent, it will fly upwards vehemently, as if that were its
   natural motion. But so soon as the force of the impression ceaseth, it
   returns immediately unto its own proper tendency, descending towards
   its centre. So is it with men's thoughts ofttimes. They are earthly, --
   their natural course and motion is downwards unto the earth and the
   things thereof; but when any efficacious conviction presseth on the
   mind, it forceth the egress of its thoughts upwards towards heavenly
   things. It will think much and frequently of them, as if that were
   their proper motion and course; but so soon as the power of conviction
   decays or wears off, that the mind is no more sensible of its force and
   impression, the thoughts of it return again unto their old course and
   track, as the water tends downwards.

   This state and frame is graphically described, Ps. lxxviii. 34-37,
   "When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
   inquired early after God. And they remembered that God was their rock,
   and the high God their redeemer. Nevertheless they did flatter him with
   their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. For their heart
   was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant."
   Men in troubles, dangers, sickness, fears of death, or under effectual
   conviction of sin from the preaching of the word, will endeavour to
   think and meditate on spiritual things; yea, they will be greatly
   troubled that they cannot think of them more than they do, and esteem
   it their folly that they think of any thing else: but as freedom and
   deliverance do approach, so these thoughts decay and disappear; the
   mind will not be compelled to give place unto them any more. The
   prophet gives the reason of it, Jer. xiii. 23, "Can the Ethiopian
   change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good,
   that are accustomed to do evil." They have had another haunt, been
   taught another course, the habit and inclination of the mind lies
   another way, and they will no longer tend towards spiritual things than
   an impression is on them from their convictions.

   And it is an argument of very mean attainments, of a low and weak
   degree in this frame of heart, or in our being spiritually minded, when
   our thoughts of spiritual things do rise or fall according unto renewed
   occasional convictions. If when we are under rebukes from God in our
   persons or relations, in fears of death and the like, and withal have
   some renewed convictions of sin in commission, for omission of duties,
   and thereon do endeavour to be more spiritually minded in the constant
   exercise of our thoughts on spiritual things, which we fail in, and
   these thoughts decay as our convictions in the causes of them do wear
   off or are removed, we have attained a very low degree in this grace,
   if we have any interest in it at all.

   Water that riseth and floweth from a living spring runneth equally and
   constantly, unless it be obstructed or diverted by some violent
   opposition; but that which is from thunder-showers runs furiously for a
   season, but is quickly dried up. So are those spiritual thoughts which
   arise from a prevalent internal principle of grace in the heart; they
   are even and constant, unless an interruption be put upon them for a
   season by temptations. But those which are excited by the thunder of
   convictions, however their streams may be filled for a season, they
   quickly dry up and utterly decay.

   2. Such thoughts may arise in the minds of men not spiritually minded,
   from outward means and occasions. Such I intend as are indeed useful,
   yea, appointed of God for this end among others, that they may
   ingenerate and stir up holy thoughts and affections in us. But there is
   a difference in their use and operation. In some they excite the inward
   principle of the mind to act in holy thoughts, according unto its own
   sanctified disposition and prevalent affections. This is their proper
   end and use. In others they occasionally suggest such thoughts unto the
   minds of men, which spring only from the notions of the things proposed
   unto them. With respect unto this end also they are of singular use
   unto the souls of men. Howbeit such thoughts do not prove men to be
   spiritually minded. When you till and manure your land, if it brings
   forth plentiful crops of corn, it is an evidence that the soil itself
   is good and fertile; the dressing of it only gives occasion and
   advantage to put forth its own fruit-bearing virtue. But if in the
   tilling of land, you lay much dung upon it, and it brings forth here
   and there a handful where the dung lay, you will say, "The soil is
   barren; it brings forth nothing of itself." These means that we shall
   treat of are as the tilling of a fruitful soil, which helps it in
   bringing forth its fruit, by exciting its own virtue and power; -- they
   stir up holy affections unto holy thoughts and desires. But in others,
   whose hearts are barren, they only serve, as it were, some of them here
   and there, to stir up spiritual thoughts, which gives no evidence of a
   gracious heart or spirit But because this is a matter of great
   importance, it shall be handled distinctly by itself.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter III.

   Outward means and occasions of such thoughts of spiritual things as do
   not prove men to be spiritually minded -- Preaching of the word --
   Exercise of gifts -- Prayer -- How we may know whether our thoughts of
   spiritual things in prayer are truly spiritual thoughts, proving us to
   be spiritually minded.

   1. Such a means is the preaching of the word itself. It is observed
   concerning many in the gospel, that they heard it willingly, received
   it with joy, and did many things gladly, upon the preaching of it; and
   we see the same thing exemplified in multitudes every day. But none of
   these things can be without many thoughts in the minds of such persons
   about the spiritual things of the word; for they are the effects of
   such thoughts, and, being wrought in the minds of men, will produce
   more of the same nature: yet were they all hypocrites concerning whom
   these things are spoken, and were never spiritually minded.

   The cause of this miscarriage is given us by our Saviour, Matt. xiii.
   20, 21, "He that received the seed into stony places, the same is he
   that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not
   root in himself, but dureth for a while." The good thoughts they have
   proceed not from any principle in themselves. Neither their affections
   nor their thoughts of these things have any internal root whereon they
   should grow. So is it with many who live under the present dispensation
   of the gospel. They have thoughts of spiritual things continually
   suggested unto them, and they do abide with them more or less,
   according as they are affected: for I speak not of them who are either
   despisers of what they hear, or wayside hearers, who understand nothing
   of what they hear, and immediately lose all sense of it, all thoughts
   about it; but I speak of them who attend with some diligence, and
   receive the word with some joy. These insensibly grow in knowledge and
   understanding, and therefore cannot be without some thoughts of
   spiritual things. Howbeit for the most part they are, as was said, but
   like unto waters that run after a shower of rain. They pour out
   themselves, as if they proceeded from some strong, living spring,
   whereas indeed they have none at all. When once the waters of the
   shower are spent, their channel is dry, there is nothing in it but
   stones and dirt. When the doctrine of the word falls on such persons as
   showers of rain, it gives a course, sometimes greater, sometimes less,
   unto their thoughts towards spiritual things; but they have not a well
   of water in them springing up into everlasting life. Wherefore, after a
   while their minds are dried up from such thoughts; nothing remains in
   them but earth, and that perhaps foul and dirty.

   It must be observed, that the best of men, the most holy and
   spiritually minded, may have, nay, ought to have, their thoughts of
   spiritual things excited, multiplied, and confirmed, by the preaching
   of the word. It is one end of its dispensation, one principal use of it
   in them by whom it is received. And it hath this effect two ways:--
   (1.) As it is the spiritual food of the soul, whereby its principle of
   life and grace is maintained and strengthened. The more this is done,
   the more shall we thrive in being spiritually minded. (2.) As it
   adminstereth occasion unto the exercise of grace; for, proposing the
   proper object of faith, love, fear, trust, reverence, unto the soul, it
   draws forth all those graces into exercise. Wherefore, although the
   vigorous actings of spiritual thoughts be occasional from the word, be
   more under and after the preaching of it than at other times, it is no
   more but what ariseth from the nature and use of the ordinance by God's
   own appointment, nor is it any evidence that those with whom it is so
   are not spiritually minded, but, on the contrary, that they are. Yet
   where men have no other thoughts of this matter but what are occasioned
   by the outward dispensation of the word, such thoughts do not prove
   them to be spiritually minded. Their endeavours in them are like those
   of men in a dream. Under some oppression of their spirits, their
   imagination fixeth on some thing or other that is most earnestly to be
   desired or avoided. Herein they seem to themselves to strive with all
   their might, to endeavour to go, run, or contend; but all in vain, --
   every thing fails them, and they are not relieved until they are
   awaked. So, such persons, in impressions they receive from the word,
   seem to strive and contend in their thoughts and resolutions to comply
   with what is proposed unto them; but their strength fails, they find no
   success for want of a principle of spiritual life, and after a time
   give over their endeavours until they are occasionally renewed again.
   Now, the thoughts which, in the dispensation of the word, do proceed
   from an inward principle of grace, excited unto its due exercise, are
   distinguishable from them which are only occasionally suggested unto
   the mind by the word outwardly preached; for, -- (1.) They are especial
   actings of faith and love towards the things themselves that are
   preached. They belong unto our receiving the truth in the love thereof;
   and love respects the goodness of the things themselves, and not merely
   the truth of the propositions wherein they are expressed. The other
   thoughts are only the sense of the mind as affected with light and
   truth, without any cordial love unto the things themselves. (2.) They
   are accompanied with complacency of soul, arising from love, and
   experience, more or less, of the power of them, and their suitableness
   unto the new nature or principle of grace in them; for when our minds
   find that so indeed it is in us as it is in the word, that this is that
   which we would be more conformable unto, it gives a secret complacency,
   with satisfaction, unto the soul. The other thoughts, which are only
   occasional, have none of these concomitants or effects, but are dry and
   barren, unless it be in a few words or transient discourse. (3.) The
   former are means of spiritual growth. So some say the natural growth of
   vegetables is not by insensible motion, but by gusts and sensible
   eruptions of increase. These are both in spiritual growth, and the
   latter consists much in those thoughts which the principle of the new
   nature is excited unto by the word in the latter.

   2. The duty of prayer is another means of the like nature. One
   principal end of it is to excite, stir up, and draw forth, the
   principle of grace, of faith and love in the heart, unto a due exercise
   in holy thoughts of God and spiritual things, with affections suitable
   unto them. Those who design not this end in prayer know not at all what
   it is to pray. Now, all sorts of persons have frequent occasion to join
   with others in prayer, and many are under the conviction that it is
   their own duty to pray every day, it may be, in their families and
   otherwise. And it is hard to conceive how men can constantly join with
   others in prayer, much more how they can pray themselves, but that they
   must have thoughts of spiritual things every day; howbeit, it is
   possible that they may have no root or living spring of them in
   themselves, but they are only occasional impressions on their minds
   from the outward performance of the duty. I shall give some instances
   of the grounds hereof, which, on many reasons, require our diligent
   consideration:--

   (1.) Spiritual thoughts may be raised in a person in his own duty, by
   the exercise of his gifts, when there is no acting of grace in them at
   all; for they lead and guide the mind unto such thing as are the matter
   of prayer, -- that is, spiritual things. Gifts are nothing but a
   spiritual improvement of our natural faculties or abilities; and a man
   cannot speak or utter any thing but what proceeds from his rational
   faculties, by invention or memory, or both, managed in and by his
   thoughts, unless he speak by rote and that which is not rational. What,
   therefore, proceeds from a man's rational faculty in and by the
   exercise of his gifts, that his thoughts must be exercised about.

   A man may read a long prayer that expresseth spiritual things, and yet
   never have one spiritual thought arise in his mind about them; for
   there is no exercise of any faculty of his mind required unto such
   reading, but only to attend unto the words that are to be read. This I
   say may be so; I do not say that it is always so, or that it must be
   so. But, as was said, in the exercise of gifts, it is impossible but
   there must be an exercise of reason, by invention, judgment, and
   memory, and consequently thoughts of spiritual things; yet may they all
   be merely occasional, from the present external performance of the
   duty, without any living spring or exercise of grace. In such a course
   may men of tolerable gifts continue all their days, unto the
   satisfaction of themselves and others, deceiving both them and their
   own souls.

   This being evident from the Scripture and experience, an inquiry may be
   made thereon as unto our own concernment in these things, especially of
   those who have received spiritual gifts of their own, and of them also
   in some degree who usually enjoy the gifts of others in this duty; for
   it may be asked how we shall know whether the thoughts which we have of
   spiritual things in and upon prayer do arise from gifts only, those of
   our own or other men's, giving occasion unto them, or are influenced
   from a living principle and spring of grace in our hearts. A case this
   is (however by some it may be apprehended) of great importance, and
   which would require much time fully to resolve; for there is nothing
   whereby the refined sort of hypocrites do more deceive themselves and
   others, nothing whereby some men do give themselves more countenance in
   aft indulgence unto their lusts, than by this part of the form of
   godliness, when they deny the power thereof. And, besides, it is that
   wherein the best of believers ought to keep a diligent watch over
   themselves in every particular instance of the performance of this
   duty. With respect hereunto, in an especial manner, are they to watch
   unto prayer. If they are at any time negligent herein, they may rest in
   a bare exercise of gifts, when, on a due examination and trial, they
   have no evidence of the acting of grace in what they have done. I
   shall, therefore, with what brevity I can, give a resolution unto this
   inquiry; and to this end observe, --

   It is an ancient complaint, that spiritual things are filled with great
   obscurity and difficulty; and it is true. Not that there is any such
   thing in themselves, for they all come forth from the Father of lights,
   and are full of light, order, beauty, and wisdom; and light and order
   are the only means whereby any thing makes a discovery of itself. But
   the ground of all darkness and difficulty in these things lies in
   ourselves. We can more clearly and steadily see and behold the moon and
   the stars than we can the sun when it shines in its greatest lustre. It
   is not because there is more light in the moon and stars than in the
   sun, but because the light of the sun is greater than our visive
   faculty can directly bear and behold. So we can more clearly discover
   the truth and distinct nature of things moral and natural, than we can
   of things that are heavenly and spiritual. See John iii. 12. Not that
   there is more substance or reality in them, but because the ability of
   our understanding is more suited unto the comprehension of them; the
   others are above us. We know but in part, and our minds are liable to
   be hindered and disordered in their apprehension of things heavenly and
   spiritual by ignorance, temptations, and prejudices of all sorts. In
   nothing are men more subject unto mistakes than in the application of
   things unto themselves, and a judgment of their interest in them. Fear,
   self-love, with the prevalency of temptations and corruptions, do all
   engage their powers to darken the light of the mind and to pervert its
   judgment. In no case doth the deceitfulness of the heart, or of sin
   (which is all one), more act itself. Hence multitudes say "Peace" to
   themselves to whom God doth not speak peace; and some who are children
   of light do yet walk in darkness. Hence is that fervent prayer of the
   apostle for help in this case, Eph. i. 15-19. There is also a great
   similitude between temporary faith and that which is saving and
   durable, and between gifts and graces in their operations; which is
   that that is under present consideration. It is acknowledged,
   therefore, that without the especial light and conduct of the Spirit of
   God, no man can make such a judgment of his state and his actions as
   shall be a stable foundation of giving glory to God and of obtaining
   peace unto his own soul; and therefore the greatest part of mankind do
   constantly deceive themselves in these things.

   But, ordinarily, under this blessed conduct in the search of ourselves
   and the concernments of our duty, we may come unto a satisfaction
   whether they axe influenced by faith and have grace exercised in them,
   especially this duty of prayer, or whether it derive from the power of
   our natural faculties, raised by light and spiritual gifts only; and so
   whether our spiritual thoughts therein do spring from a vital principle
   of grace, or whether they come from occasional impressions on the mind
   by the performance of the duty itself.

   If men are willing to deceive themselves, or to hide themselves from
   themselves, to walk with God at all peradventures, to leave all things
   at hazard, to put off all trials unto that at the last day, and so
   never call themselves unto an account as unto the nature of their
   duties in any particular instance, it is no wonder if they neither do
   nor can make any distinction in this matter as unto the true nature of
   their thoughts in spiritual duties. Two things are required hereunto:--

   [1.] That we impartially and severely examine and try the frames and
   actings of our minds in holy duties by the word of truth, and thereon
   be not afraid to speak that plainly unto our souls which the word
   speaks unto us. This diligent search ought to respect our principles,
   aims, ends, actings, with the whole deportment of our souls in every
   duty. See 2 Cor. xiii. 5. If a man receive much money, and look only on
   the outward form and superscription, when he supposeth that he hath
   great store of current coin in gold and silver, he may have only heaps
   of lead or copper by him; but he that trades in it as the comfort and
   support of his natural life and condition, he will try what he receives
   both by the balance and the touchstone, as the occasion requires,
   especially if it be in a time when much adulterated coin is passant in
   the world. And if a man reckon on his duties by tale and number, he may
   be utterly deceived, and be spiritually poor and a bankrupt, when he
   esteems himself rich, increased in goods, and wanting nothing. Some
   duties may appearingly hold in the balance as to weight, which will not
   hold it at the touchstone as to worth. Both means are to be used, if we
   would not be mistaken in our accounts. Thus God himself, in the midst
   of a multitude of duties, calls the people to try and examine
   themselves whether or no they are such as have faith and grace in them,
   and so like to have acceptance with him, Isa. lviii. 2-7.

   [2.] Add we must unto our own diligent inquiry fervent prayers unto God
   that he would search and try us as unto our sincerity, and discover
   unto us the true frame of our hearts. Hereof we have an express
   example, Ps. cxxxix. 23, 24, "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try
   me, and know my thoughts: and see if there be any wicked way in me, and
   lead me in the way everlasting." This is the only way whereby we may
   have the Spirit of God witnessing unto our sincerity with our own
   spirits. There is need of calling in divine assistance in this matter,
   both from the importance of it and from its difficulty, God alone
   knowing fully and perfectly what is in the hearts of men.

   I no way doubt but that, in the impartial use of these means, a man may
   come to assured satisfaction in his own mind, such as wherein he shall
   not be deceived, whether he doth animate and quicken his thoughts of
   spiritual things in duties with inward vital grace, or whether they are
   impressions on his mind by the occasion of the duty.

   A duty this is of great importance and necessity, now hypocrisy hath
   made so great an inroad on profession, and gifts have defloured grace
   in its principal operations. No persons are in greater danger of
   walking at hazard with God than those who live in the exercise of
   spiritual gifts in duties unto their own satisfaction and [that of]
   others; for they may countenance themselves with an appearance of every
   thing that should be in them in reality and power, when there is
   nothing of it in them. And so it hath fallen out. We have seen many
   earnest in the exercise of this gift who have turned vile and debauched
   apostates. Some have been known to live in sin and in indulgence of
   their lusts, and yet to abide constant in their duties, Isa. i. 10-15.
   And we may hear prayers sometimes that openly discover themselves unto
   spiritual sense to be the labour of the brain, by the help of gifts in
   memory and invention, without an evidence of any mixture of humility,
   reverence, or godly fear, without any acting of faith and love. They
   flow as wine, yet smell and taste of the unsavoury cask from whence
   they proceed. It is necessary, therefore, that we should put ourselves
   on the severest trial, lest we should be found not to be spiritually
   minded in spiritual duties.

   Gifts are gracious vouchsafements of Christ to make grace useful unto
   ourselves and others; yea, they may make them useful unto the grace of
   others who have no grace in themselves. But as unto our own souls, they
   are of no other advantage or benefit but to stir up grace unto its
   proper exercise, and to be a vehicle to carry it on in its proper use.
   If we do not always regard this in their exercise, we had better be
   without them. If instead hereof they once begin to impose themselves
   practically upon us, so as that we rest in spiritual light acting our
   inventions, memories, and judgments, with a ready utterance, or such as
   it is, there is no form of prayer can be more prejudicial unto our
   souls. As wine, if taken moderately and seasonably, helps the stomach
   in digestion, and quickens the natural spirits, enabling the powers of
   nature unto their duty, [and] is useful and helpful unto it; but if it
   be taken in excess it doth not help nature, but oppress it, and takes
   on itself to do what nature should be assisted unto, it fills men's
   carcasses with diseases as well as their souls with sin: so whilst
   spiritual gifts are used and employed only to excite, aid, and assist
   grace in its operations, they are unutterably useful; but if they put
   themselves in the room thereof, to do all that grace should do, they
   are hurtful and pernicious. We have need, therefore, to be very
   diligent in this inquiry whether our spiritual thoughts, even in our
   prayers, be not rather occasioned from the duty than spring from a
   gracious principle in our hearts, or are the actings of real saving
   grace.

   (2.) Where thoughts of spiritual things in prayer are occasional only,
   in the way before described, such prayers will not be a means of
   spiritual growth unto the soul They will not make the soul humble,
   holy, watchful, and diligent in universal obedience. Grace will not
   thrive under the greatest constancy in such duties. It is an
   astonishing thing to see how, under frequency of prayer and a seeming
   fervency therein, many of us are at a stand as to visible thriving in
   the fruits of grace, and it is to be feared without any increase of
   strength in the root of it. "The Lord's hand is not shortened that it
   cannot save, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear." He is the same as
   in the days of old, when our fathers cried unto him and were delivered,
   when they trusted in him and were not confounded. "Jesus Christ is the
   same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever." Prayer is the same that it
   was, and shall lose nothing of its prevalency whilst this world
   endureth. Whence is it, then, that there is so much prayer amongst us,
   and so little success? I speak not with respect unto the outward
   dispensations of divine providence, in afflictions or persecutions,
   wherein God always acts in a way of sovereignty, and ofttimes gives the
   most useful answer unto our prayers by denying our requests; I intend
   that only whereof the psalmist giveth us his experience, Ps. cxxxviii.
   3, "In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me
   with strength in my soul." Where prayers are effectual, they will bring
   in spiritual strength. But the prayers of many seem to be very
   spiritual, and to express all conceivable supplies of grace, and they
   are persisted in with constancy, -- and God forbid we should judge them
   to be hypocritical and wholly insincere, -- yet there is a defect
   somewhere, which should be inquired after, for they are not so answered
   as that they who pray them are strengthened with strength in their
   souls. There is not that spiritual thriving, that growth in grace,
   which might be expected to accompany such supplications.

   I know that a man may pray often, pray sincerely and frequently, for an
   especial mercy, grace, or deliverance from a particular temptation, and
   yet no spiritual supply of strength unto his own experience come in
   thereby. So Paul prayed thrice for the removal of his temptation, and
   yet had the exercise of it continued. In such a case there may be no
   defect in prayer, and yet the grace in particular aimed at may not be
   attained; for God hath other holy ends to accomplish hereby on the
   soul. But how persons should continue in prayer in general according to
   the mind of God, so far as can be outwardly discovered, and yet thrive
   not at all as unto spiritual strength in their souls, is hard to be
   understood.

   And, which is yet more astonishable, men abide in the duty of prayer,
   and that with constancy, in their families and otherwise, and yet live
   in known sins. Whatever spiritual thoughts such men have in and by
   their prayers, they are not spiritually minded. Shall we now say that
   all such persons are gross hypocrites, such as know they do but mock
   God and man, -- know that they have not desires nor aims after the
   things which they mention in their own prayers, but do these things
   either for some corrupt end or at best to satisfy their convictions?
   Could we thus resolve, the whole difficulty of the case were taken off;
   for such "double-minded men" have no reason to "think that they shall
   receive any thing of the Lord," as James speaks, chap. i. 7. Indeed
   they do not; -- they never act faith with reference unto their own
   prayers. But it is not so with all of this sort. Some judge themselves
   sincere and in good earnest in their prayers, -- not without some hopes
   and expectations of success. I will not say of all such persons that
   they are among the number of them concerning whom the Wisdom of God
   says, "Because I called, and they refused; they shall call upon me, but
   I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find
   me," Prov. i. 24, 28.

   And although we may say unto such a person in general, "Either leave
   your sinning or leave your praying," from Ps. l. 16, 17, and that with
   respect unto present scandal and certain miscarriage in the end if both
   be continued in, yet in particular I would not advise any such person
   to leave off his praying until he had left his sin. This were to advise
   a sick man to use no remedies until he were well cured. Who knows but
   that the Holy Spirit, who works when and how he pleaseth, may take a
   time to animate these lifeless prayers, and make them a means of
   deliverance from the power of this sin? In the meantime, the fault and
   guilt is wholly their own, who have effected a consistency between a
   way in sinning and a course in praying; and it ariseth from hence, that
   they have never laboured to fill up their requests with grace. What
   there hath been of earnestness or diligence in them hath been from a
   force put upon them by their convictions and fears; for no man was ever
   absolutely prevailed on by sin who prayed for deliverance according to
   the mind of God. Every praying man that perisheth was a hypocrite. The
   faithfulness of God in his promises will not allow us to judge
   otherwise. Wherefore, the thoughts that such persons have of spiritual
   things, even in their duties, do not arise from within nor are a
   natural emanation of the frames of their hearts and affections.

   (3.) Earnestness and appearing fervency in prayer, as unto the outward
   delivery of the words of it, yea, though the mind be so affected as to
   contribute much thereunto, will not of themselves prove that the
   thoughts of men therein do arise from an internal spring of grace.
   There is a fervency of spirit in prayer that is one of the best
   properties of it, being an earnest acting of love, faith, and desire;
   but there is a fervency wherewith the mind itself may be affected that
   may arise from other causes:--

   [1.] It may do so from the engagement of natural affections unto the
   objects of their prayer, or the things prayed for. Men may be mighty
   earnest and intent in their minds in praying for a dear relation or for
   deliverance from eminent troubles or imminent dangers, and yet all this
   fervour may arise from the vehement actings of natural affections about
   the things prayed for, excited in an especial manner by the present
   duty. Hence God calls the earnest cries of some for temporal things,
   not a "crying unto him," but a "howling," Hos. vii. 14; that is, the
   cry of hungry, ravenous beasts, that would be satisfied.

   [2.] Sometimes it ariseth from the sharpness of convictions, which will
   make men even roar in their prayers for disquietment of heart. And this
   may be where there is no true grace as yet received, nor, it may be,
   ever will be so; for the perplexing work of conviction goes before real
   conversion. And as it produceth many other effects and changes in the
   mind, so it may do this of great fervency in vocal prayers, especially
   if it be accompanied with outward afflictions, pains, or troubles, Ps.
   lxxviii. 34, 35.

   [3.] Ofttimes the mind and affections are very little concerned in that
   fervour and earnestness which appear in the outward performance of the
   duty; but in the exercise of gifts, and through their own utterance,
   men put their natural affections into such an agitation as shall carry
   them out into a great vehemency in their expressions. It hath been so
   with sundry persons, who have been discovered to be rotten hypocrites,
   and have afterward turned cursed apostates. Wherefore, all these things
   may be where there is no gracious spring or vital principle acting
   itself from within in spiritual thoughts.

   Some, it may be, will design an advantage by these conceptions, unto
   the interest of profaneness and scoffing; for if there may be these
   evils under the exercise of the gift of prayer, both in constancy and
   with fervency, -- if there may be a total want of the exercise of all
   true grace with it and under it, -- then, it may be, all that is
   pretended of this gift and its use is but hypocrisy and talk. But I
   say, -- (1.) It may be as well pretended that because the sun shining
   on a dunghill doth occasion offensive and noisome steams, therefore all
   that is said of its influence on spices and flowers, causing them to
   give out their fragrancy, is utterly false. No man ever thought that
   spiritual gifts did change or renew the minds and natures of men; where
   they are alone, they only help and assist unto the useful exercise of
   natural faculties and powers. And therefore, where the heart is not
   savingly renewed, no gifts can stir up a saving exercise of faith; but
   where it is so, they are a means to cause the savour of it to flow
   forth. (2.) Be it so that there may be some evils found under the
   exercise of the gift of prayer, what remedy for them may be proposed?
   Is it that men should renounce their use of it, and betake themselves
   unto the reading of prayers only? [1.] The same may be said of all
   spiritual gifts whatever, for they are all of them liable unto abuse.
   And shall we reject all the powers of the world to come, the whole
   complex of gospel gifts, for the communication whereof the Lord Christ
   hath promised to continue his Spirit with his church unto the end of
   the world, because by some they are abused? [2.] Not only the same, but
   far greater evils, may be found in and under the reading of prayers;
   which needs no farther demonstration than what it gives of itself every
   day. [3.] It is hard to understand how any benefit at all can accrue
   unto any by this relief, when the advantages of the other way are
   evident.

   Wherefore the inquiry remains, How we may know unto our own
   satisfaction that the thoughts we have of spiritual things in the duty
   of prayer are from an internal fountain of grace, and so are an
   evidence that we are spiritually minded, whereunto all these things do
   tend. Some few things I shall offer towards satisfaction herein:--

   (1.) I take it for granted, on the evidence before given, that persons
   who have any spiritual light, and will diligently examine and try their
   own hearts, will be able to discern what real actings of faith, of
   love, and delight in God, there are in their duties, and, consequently,
   what is the spring of their spiritual thoughts. In general we are
   assured that "he that believeth hath the witness in himself," 1 John v.
   10. Sincere faith will be its own evidence; and where there are sincere
   actings of faith, they will evidence themselves, if we try all things
   impartially by the word. But if men do, as for the most part they do,
   content themselves with the performance of any duty, without an
   examination of their principles, frames, and actings of grace in it, it
   is no wonder if they walk in all uncertainty.

   (2.) When the soul finds a sweet spiritual complacency in and after its
   duties, it is an evidence that grace hath been acted in its spiritual
   thoughts and desires. Jer. xxxi., the prophet receiveth a long gracious
   message from God, filled up with excellent promises and pathetical
   exhortations unto the church. The whole is, as it were, summed up in
   the close of it: Verse 25, "For I have satiated the weary soul, and I
   have replenished every sorrowful soul." Whereon the prophet adds, "
   Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me." God's
   gracious message had so composed his spirit and freed his mind from
   trouble as that he was at quiet repose in himself, like a man asleep.
   But after the end of it, he stirs up himself unto a review and
   consideration of what had been spoken unto him: "I awaked, and beheld,"
   or, "I stirred up myself, and considered what had been delivered unto
   me;" "and," saith he, "my sleep was sweet unto me," -- "I found a
   gracious complacency in and refreshment unto my soul from what I had
   heard and received." So is it ofttimes with a soul that hath had real
   communion with God in the duty of prayer. It finds itself, both in it
   and afterward when it is awakened unto the consideration of it,
   spiritually refreshed; it is sweet unto him.

   This holy complacency, this rest and sweet repose of mind, is the
   foundation of the delight of believers in this duty. They do not pray
   only because it is their duty so to do, nor yet because they stand in
   need of it, so as that they cannot live without it, but they have
   delight in it; and to keep them from it is all one as to keep them from
   their daily food and refreshment. Now, we can have no delight in any
   thing but what we have found some sweetness, rest, and complacency in.
   Without any such experience we may do or use any thing, but cannot do
   it with delight. And it ariseth, -- [1.] From the approach that is made
   unto God therein. It is in its own nature an access unto God on a
   throne of grace, Eph. ii. 18, Heb. x. 19, 20; and when this access is
   animated by the actings of grace, the soul hath a spiritual experience
   of a nearness in that approach. Now, God is the fountain and centre of
   all spiritual refreshment, rest, and complacency; and in such an access
   unto him there is a refreshing taste of them communicated unto the
   soul: Ps. xxxvi. 7-9, "How excellent is thy loving-kindness, O God!
   therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy
   wings. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
   house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
   For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see
   light." God is proposed in the excellency of his loving-kindness, which
   is comprehensive of his goodness, grace, and mercy; and so he is also
   as the spring of life and light, all spiritual powers and joys. Those
   that believe are described by putting their "trust under the shadow of
   his wings." In his worship, the "fatness of his house," they make their
   approaches unto him. And the fruit hereof is, that he makes them to
   "drink of the river of his pleasures," the satisfying, refreshing
   streams of his grace and goodness. They approach unto him as unto the
   "fountain of life," so as to drink of that fountain in renewed
   communications of life and grace, and in the "light of God," the light
   of his countenance, to "see light" in satisfying joy. In these things
   doth consist, and from them doth arise, that spiritual complacency
   which the souls of believers do find in their duties [2.] From the due
   exercise of faith, love, and delight, the graces wherein the life of
   the new creature doth principally consist. There is a suitableness unto
   our natural constitution, and a secret complacency of our natures, in
   the proper actings of life natural for its own preservation and
   increase. There is so in our spiritual constitution, in the proper
   actings of the powers of our spiritual life unto its preservation and
   increase. These graces, in their due exercise, do compose and refresh
   the mind, as those which are perfective of its state, and which quell
   and cast out whatever troubles it. Thence a blessed satisfaction and
   complacency befall the soul. Herein "he that believeth hath the witness
   in himself." Besides, faith and love are never really acted on Christ,
   but they prepare and make meet the soul to receive communications of
   love and grace from him; which it never faileth of, although it be not
   always sensible thereof. [3.] From the testimony of conscience, bearing
   witness unto our sincerity, both in aims, ends, and performances of the
   duty. Hence a gracious repose of mind and great satisfactoriness do
   ensue.

   If we have no experience of these things, it is evident that we walk at
   random in the best of our duties; for they are among the principal
   things that we do or ought to pray for. And if we have not experience
   of the effects of our prayers in our hearts, we neither have advantage
   by them nor give glory unto God in them.

   But yet here, as in most other spiritual things, one of the worst of
   vices is ready to impose itself in the room and place of the best of
   our graces; and this is self-pleasing in the performance of the duty.
   This, instead of a grace steeped in humility, as all true grace is, is
   a vile effect of spiritual pride, or the offering of a sacrifice unto
   our own net and drag. It is a glorying in the flesh; for whatever of
   self any doth glory in, it is but flesh. When men have had enlargements
   in their expressions, and especially when they apprehend that others
   are satisfied or affected therewith, they are apt to have a secret
   self-pleasing in what they have done; which, before they are aware,
   turns into pride and a noxious elation of mind. The same may befall men
   in their most secret duties, performed outwardly by the aid of
   spiritual gifts. But this is most remote from and contrary unto that
   spiritual complacency in duty which we speak of, which yet it will
   pretend unto until it be diligently examined. The language of spiritual
   complacency is, "I will go in the strength of the Lord God; I will make
   mention of thy righteousness, of thine only," Ps. lxxi. 16; -- that of
   spiritual pride is, "God, I thank thee that I have done thus and thus;"
   as it was expressed by the Pharisee. That is in God alone; this is in
   self. That draws forth the savour of all graces; this immediately
   covereth and buries them all, if there be any in the soul. That fills
   the soul eminently with humility and self-abasement; this with a
   lifting up of the mind and proud self-conceit. That casts out all
   remembrance of what we have done ourselves, retaining only a sense of
   what we have received from God, of the impressions of his love and
   grace; this blots out all remembrance of what we have freely received
   from God, and retains only what we have done ourselves. Wherever it is,
   there is no due sense either of the greatness or goodness of God.

   Some, it may be, will say that if it be so, they for their parts are
   cut off. They have no experience of any such spiritual rest and
   complacency in God in or after their prayers. At the best, they begin
   them with tears and end them with sorrow; and sometimes they know not
   what is become of them, but fear that God is not glorified by them nor
   their own souls bettered.

   I answer, -- [1.] There is great spiritual refreshment in that godly
   sorrow which is at work in our prayers. Where the Holy Ghost is a
   Spirit of grace and supplication, he causeth mourning, and in that
   mourning there is joy. [2.] The secret encouragement which we receive,
   by praying, to adhere unto God constantly in prayer ariseth from some
   experience of this holy complacency, though we have not a sensible
   evidence of it. [3.] Perhaps some of them who make this complaint, if
   they would awaken and consider, will find that their souls, at least
   sometimes, have been thus refreshed and brought unto a holy rest in
   God. [4.] Then shall ye know the Lord, if ye follow on to know him.
   Abide in seeking after this complacency and satisfaction in God, and ye
   shall attain it.

   (3.) It is a sure evidence that our thoughts of spiritual things in our
   supplications are from an internal spring of grace, and are not merely
   occasioned by the duty itself, when we find the daily fruit and
   advantage of them, especially in the preservation of our souls in a
   holy, humble, watchful frame.

   Innumerable are the advantages, benefits, and effects of prayer, which
   are commonly spoken unto. Growth in grace and consolation is the
   substance of them. Where there is continuance in prayer, there will be
   spiritual growth in some proportion. For men to be earnest in prayer
   and thriftless in grace is a certain indication of prevalent
   corruptions, and want of being spiritually minded in prayer itself. If
   a man eat his daily food, let him eat never so much or so often, if he
   be not nourished by it, his body is under, the power of prevalent
   distempers; and so is his spiritual constitution who thriveth not in
   the use of the food of the new creature. But that which I fix upon,
   with respect unto the present inquiry, is the frame that it preserves
   the soul in. It will keep it humble and upon a diligent watch as unto
   its dispositions and actings. He who prays as he ought will endeavour
   to live as he prays. This none can do who doth not with diligence keep
   his heart unto the things he hath prayed about. To pray earnestly and
   live carelessly is to proclaim that a man is not spiritually minded in
   his prayer. Hereby, then, we shall know what is the spring of those
   spiritual thoughts which our minds are exercised withal in our
   supplications. If they are influenced unto a constant, daily watch for
   the preservation of that frame of spirit, those dispositions and
   inclinations unto spiritual things, which we pray for, they are from an
   internal spring of grace. If there be generally an unsuitableness in
   our minds unto what we seem to contend for in our prayers, the gift may
   be in exercise, but the grace is wanting. If a man be every day on the
   exchange, and there talketh diligently and earnestly about merchandise
   and the affairs of trade, but when he comes home thinks no more of
   them, because, indeed, he hath nothing to do, no interest in them, he
   may be a very poor man notwithstanding his pretences; and he may be
   spiritually very poor who is on occasions fervent in prayer, if, when
   he retires into himself, he is not careful and diligent about the
   matter of it.

   (4.) When spiritual affections and due preparation of heart unto the
   duty do excite and animate the gift of prayer, and not the gift make
   impressions on the affections, then are we spiritually minded therein.
   Gifts are servants, not rulers, in the mind, -- are bestowed on us to
   be serviceable unto grace; not to lead, but to follow it, and to be
   ready with their assistance on its exercise. For the most part, where
   they lead all, they are all alone. This is the natural order of these
   things: grace habitually inclineth and disposeth the heart unto this
   duty; providence and rule give the occasions for its exercise; sense of
   duty calls for preparation. Grace coming into actual exercise, gifts
   come in with their assistance. If they lead, all, all is out of order.
   It may be otherwise sometimes. A person indisposed and lifeless,
   engaging unto prayer in a way of obedience, upon conviction of duty,
   may, in and by the gift, have his affections excited and grace engaged
   unto its proper work. It may be so, I say, but let men take heed how
   they trust unto this order and method; for where it is so, there may be
   little or nothing of the exercise of true grace in all their fervour
   and commotion of affections. But when the genuine actings of faith,
   love, holy reverence, and gracious desires, do stir up the gift unto
   its exercise, calling in its assistance unto the expression of
   themselves, then are the heart and mind in their proper order.

   (5.) It is so when other duties of religion are equally regarded and
   attended unto with prayer itself. He whose religion lies all in prayer
   and hearing, hath none at all. God hath an equal respect unto all other
   duties, and so must we have also. So is it expressed as unto the
   instance of alms, Acts x. 31; and James placeth all religion herein,
   because there is none without it, chap. i. 27. I shall not value his
   prayers at all, be he never so earnest and frequent in them, who gives
   not alms according to his ability. And this in an especial manner is
   required of us who are ministers, that we be not like a hand set up in
   cross-ways, directing others which way to go, but staying behind
   itself.

   This digression about the rise and spring of spiritual thoughts in
   prayer, I judged not unnecessary in such a time and season, wherein we
   ought to be very jealous lest gifts impose themselves in the room of
   grace, and be careful that they are employed only unto their proper
   end, which is, to be serviceable unto grace in its exercise, and not
   otherwise.

   3. There is another occasion of thoughts of spiritual things, when they
   do not spring from a living principle within, and so are no evidence of
   being spiritually minded; and this is the discourse of others. "They
   that fear the Lord will be speaking one to another" of the things
   wherein his glory is concerned, Mal. iii. 16. To declare the
   righteousness, the glory of God, is the delight of his saints: Ps.
   cxlv. 3-8, "Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his
   greatness is unsearchable. One generation shall praise thy works to
   another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the
   glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. And men
   shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy
   greatness. They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great
   goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. The Lord is gracious,
   and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy." And
   accordingly there are some who are ready on all occasions to be
   speaking or making mention of things divine, spiritual, and holy; and
   it is to be wished that there were more of them. All the flagitious
   sins that the world is filled withal are not a greater evidence of the
   degeneracy of the Christian religion than this is, that it is grown
   unusual, yea, a shame or scorn, for men to speak together of the things
   of God. It was not so when religion was in its primitive power and
   glory, nor is it so with them who really fear God and are sensible of
   their duty. Some, I say, there are who embrace all occasions of
   spiritual communication. Those with whom they do converse, if they are
   not profligate, if they have any spiritual light, cannot but so far
   comply with what they say as to think of the things spoken, which are
   spiritual. Ofttimes the track and course of men's thoughts lie so out
   of the way, are so contrary, unto such things, that they seem strange
   unto them, they give them no entertainment. You do but cross their way
   with such discourses, whereon they stand still a little, and so pass
   on. Even the countenances of some men will change hereon, and they
   betake themselves unto an unsatisfied silence until they can divert
   unto other things. Some will make such replies of empty words as shall
   evidence their hearts to be far enough estranged from the things
   proposed unto them. But with others, such occasional discourses will
   make such impressions on their minds as to stir up present thoughts of
   spiritual things. But though frequent occasions hereof may be renewed,
   yet will such thoughts give no evidence that any man is spiritually
   minded; for they are not genuine, from an internal spring of grace.

   From these causes it is that the thoughts of spiritual things are with
   many as guests that come into an inn, and not like children that dwell
   in the house. They enter occasionally, and then there is a great stir
   about them, to provide meet entertainment for them. Within a while they
   are disposed of, and so depart unto their own occasions, being neither
   looked nor inquired after any more. Things of another nature are
   attended unto; new occasions bring in new guests for a season. Children
   are owned in the house, are missed if they are out of the way, and have
   their daily provision constantly made for them. So is it with these
   occasional thoughts about spiritual things. By one means or other they
   enter into the mind, and there are entertained for a season; on a
   sudden they depart, and men hear of them no more. But those that are
   natural and genuine, arising from a living spring of grace in the
   heart, disposing the mind unto them, are as the children of the house.
   They are expected in their places and at their seasons. If they are
   missing, they are inquired after. The heart calls itself unto an
   account whence it is that it hath been so long without them, and calls
   them over into its wonted converse with them.

Chapter IV.

   Other evidences of thoughts about spiritual things arising from an
   internal principle of grace, whereby they are an evidence of our being
   spiritually minded -- The abounding of these thoughts, how far, and
   wherein, such an evidence.

   The second evidence that our thoughts of spiritual things do proceed
   from an internal fountain of sanctified light and affections, or that
   they are acts or fruits of our being spiritually minded, is, that they
   abound in us, that our minds are filled with them. We may say of them
   as the apostle doth of other graces, "If these things be in you, and
   abound, ye shall not be barren." It is well, indeed, when our minds are
   like the land of Egypt in the years of plenty, when it "brought forth
   by handfuls," -- when they flow from the well of living water in us
   with a full stream and current; but there is a measure of abounding
   which is necessary to evidence our being spiritually minded in them.

   There is a double effect ascribed here unto this frame of spirit, --
   first "life," and then "peace." The nature and being of this grace
   depend on the former consideration of it, -- namely, its procedure from
   an internal principle of grace, the effect and consequence whereof is
   "life:" but that it is "peace" also depends on this degree and measure
   of the actings of this part of it in our spiritual thoughts; and this
   we must consider.

   It is the character of all men in the state of depraved nature and
   apostasy from God, that "every imagination of the thoughts of their
   hearts is only evil continually," Gen. vi. 5. All persons in that
   condition are not swearers, blasphemers, drunkards, adulterers,
   idolaters, or the like; these are the vices of particular persons, the
   effects of particular constitutions and temptations. But thus it is
   with them, all and every one of them:-- all the imaginations of the
   thoughts of their hearts are evil, and that continually, some as unto
   the matter of them, some as unto their end, all as unto their
   principle; for out of the evil treasure of the heart can proceed
   nothing but what is evil. That infinite multitude of open sins which is
   in the world doth give a clear prospect or representation of the nature
   and effects of our apostasy from God; but he that can consider the
   numberless number of thoughts which pass through the minds of every
   individual person every day, all evil, and that continually, he will
   have a farther comprehension of it.

   We can therefore have no greater evidence of a change in us from this
   state and condition, than a change wrought in the course of our
   thoughts. A relinquishment of this or that particular sin is not an
   evidence of a translation from this state; for, as was said, such
   particular sins proceed from particular lusts and temptations, and are
   not the immediate universal consequence of that depravation of nature
   which is equal in all. Such alone are the vanity and wickedness of the
   thoughts and imaginations of the heart. A change herein is a blessed
   evidence of a change of state. He who is cured of a dropsy is not
   immediately healthy, because he may have the prevailing seeds and
   matter of other diseases in him, and the next day die of a lethargy;
   but he who, from a state of sickness, is restored, in the temperature
   of the mass of blood and the animal spirits, and all the principles of
   life and health, unto a good crisis and temperature, his state of body
   is changed. The cure of a particular sin may leave behind it the seeds
   of eternal death, which they may quickly effect; but he who hath
   obtained a change in this character, which belongs essentially unto the
   state of depraved nature, is spiritually recovered. And the more the
   stream of our thoughts is turned, the more our minds are filled by
   those of a contrary nature, the greater and more firm is our evidence
   of a translation out of that depraved state and condition.

   There is nothing so unaccountable as the multiplicity of thoughts of
   the minds of men. They fall from them like the leaves of trees when
   they are shaken with the wind in autumn. To have all these thoughts,
   all the several figments of the heart, all the conceptions that are
   framed and agitated in the mind, to be evil, and that continually, what
   a hell of horror and confusion must it needs be! A deliverance from
   this loathsome, hateful state is more to be valued than the whole
   world. Without it neither life, nor peace, nor immortality, nor glory,
   can ever be attained.

   The design of conviction is to put a stop unto these thoughts, to take
   off from their number, and thereby to lessen their guilt. It deserves
   not the name of conviction of sin which respects only outward actions,
   and regards not the inward actings of the mind; and this alone will for
   a season make a great change in the thoughts, especially it will do so
   when assisted by superstition, directing them unto other objects. These
   two in conjunction are the rise of all that devotional religion which
   is in the Papacy. Conviction labours to put some stop and bounds unto
   thoughts absolutely evil and corrupt, and superstition suggests other
   objects for them, which they readily embrace; but it is a vain attempt.
   The minds and hearts of men are continually minting and coining new
   thoughts and imaginations; the cogitative faculty is always at work. As
   the streams of a mighty river running into the ocean, so are the
   thoughts of a natural man, and through self they run into hell It is a
   fond thing to set a dam before such a river, to curb its streams. For a
   little space there may be a stop made, but it will quickly break down
   all obstacles or overflow all its bounds. There is no way to divert its
   course but only by providing other channels for its waters, and turning
   them there into. The mighty stream of the evil thoughts of men will
   admit of no bounds or dams to put a stop unto them. There are but two
   ways of relief from them, the one respecting their moral evil, the
   other their natural abundance. The first [is,] by throwing salt into
   the spring, as Elisha cured the waters of Jericho, -- that is, to get
   the heart and mind seasoned with grace; for the tree must be made good
   before the fruit will be so. The other is, to turn their streams into
   new channels, putting new aims and ends upon them, fixing them on new
   objects: so shall we abound in spiritual thoughts; for abound in
   thoughts we shall, whether we will or no.

   To this purpose is the advice of the apostle, Eph. v. 18, 19, "Be not
   drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
   speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs." When
   men are drunk with wine unto an excess, they make it quickly evident
   what vain, foolish, ridiculous imaginations it filleth their minds
   withal. In opposition hereunto the apostle adviseth believers to be
   "filled with the Spirit," -- to labour for such a participation of him
   as may fill their minds and hearts, as others fill themselves with
   wine. To what end, unto what purpose, should they desire such a
   participation of him, to be so filled with him? It is unto this end,
   namely, that he by his grace may fill them with holy, spiritual
   thoughts, as, on the contrary, men drunk unto an excess are filled with
   those that are foolish, vain, and wicked. So the words of verse 19 do
   declare; for he adviseth us to express our abounding thoughts in such
   duties as will give an especial vent unto them.

   Wherefore, when we are spiritually minded, we shall abound in spiritual
   thoughts, or thoughts of spiritual things. That we have such thoughts
   will not sufficiently evidence that we are so, unless we abound in
   them. And this leads us unto the principal inquiry on this head,
   namely, what measure we ought to assign hereof, how we may know when we
   abound in spiritual thoughts, so as that they may be an evidence of our
   being spiritually minded.

   I answer, in general, among other Scriptures read over Ps. cxix. with
   understanding. Consider therein what David expresseth of himself, as
   unto his constant delight in and continual thoughts of the law of God;
   which was the only means of divine revelation at that season. Try
   yourselves by that pattern; examine yourselves whether you can truly
   speak the same words with him, at least if not in the same degree of
   zeal, yet with the same sincerity of grace. You will say, "That was
   David. It is not for us, it is not our duty, to be like unto him, at
   least not to be equal with him." But as far as I know, we must be like
   him, if ever we intend to come to the place where he is. It will ruin
   our souls, if, when we read in the Scripture how the saints of God
   express their experience in faith, love, delight in God, and constant
   meditation on him, we grant that it was so with them, that they were
   good and holy men, but it is not necessary that it should be so with
   us. These things are not written in the Scripture to show what they
   were, but what we ought to be. All things concerning them were "written
   for our admonition," 1 Cor. x. 11. And if we have not the same delight
   in God as they had, the same spiritual mindedness in thoughts and
   meditations of heavenly things, we can have no evidence that we please
   God as they did, or shall go to that place whither they are gone.
   Profession of the life of God passeth with many at a very low and easy
   rate. Their thoughts are for the most part vain and earthly, their
   communication unsavoury, and sometimes corrupt, their lives at best
   uneven and uncertain as unto the rule of obedience; yet all is well,
   all is life and peace! The holy men of old, who obtained this
   testimony, that they pleased God, did not so walk before him. They
   meditated continually on the law; thought of God in the night seasons;
   spake of his ways, his works, his praise; their whole delight was in
   him, and in all things they "followed hard after him." It is the
   example of David in particular that I have proposed; and it is a
   promise of the grace to be administered by the gospel, that "he that is
   feeble shall be as David," Zech. xii. 8, and if we are not so in his
   being spiritually minded, it is to be feared we are not partakers of
   the promise. But that we may the better judge of ourselves therein, I
   shall add some few rules unto this direction by [way of] example:--

   1. Consider what proportion your thoughts of spiritual things bear unto
   those about other things. Our principal interest and concern, as we
   profess, lies in things spiritual, heavenly, and eternal. Is it not,
   then, a foolish thing to suppose that our thoughts about these things
   should not hold some proportion with those about other things, nay,
   that they should not exceed there? No man is so vain, in earthly
   things, as to pretend that his principal concern lieth in that whereof
   he thinks very seldom in comparison of other things. It is not so with
   men in reference unto their families, their trades, their occasions of
   life. It is a truth not only consecrated by the testimony of him who is
   Truth, but evident also in the light of reason, that "where our
   treasure is, there will our hearts be also;" and the affections of our
   hearts do act themselves by the thoughts of our minds, Wherefore, if
   our principal treasure be, as we profess, in things spiritual and
   heavenly, (and woe unto us if it be not so!) on them will our
   affections, and consequently our desires and thoughts, be principally
   fixed.

   That we may the better examine ourselves by this rule, we must consider
   of what sorts men's other thoughts are; and as unto our present
   purpose, they may be reduced unto these heads:--

   (1.) There are such as are exercised about their callings and lawful
   occasions. These are numberless and endless, especially among a sort of
   men who rise early and go to bed late, and eat the bread of
   carefulness, or are particularly industrious and diligent in their
   ways. These thoughts men approve themselves in, and judge them their
   duty, as they are in their proper place and measure. But no heart can
   conceive the multitude of these thoughts, which partly in contrivances,
   partly in converse, are engaged and spent about these things; and the
   more men are immersed in them, the more do themselves and others esteem
   them diligent and praiseworthy. And there are some who have neither
   necessity nor occasion to be engaged much in the duties of any especial
   calling, who yet by their words and actions declare themselves to be
   confined almost in their thoughts unto themselves, their relations,
   their children, and their self-concerns; which, though most of them are
   very impertinent, yet they justify themselves in them. All sorts may do
   well to examine what proportion their thoughts of spiritual things do
   bear unto those of other things. I fear with most it will be found to
   be very small, -- with many next to none at all. What evidence, then,
   can they have that they are spiritually minded, that their principal
   interest lies in things above? It may be, it will be asked, whether it
   be necessary that men should think as much and as often about things
   spiritual and heavenly as they do about the lawful affairs of their
   callings? I say, more, and more often, if we are what we profess
   ourselves to be. Generally it is the best sort of men, as to the things
   of God and man, who are busied in their callings, some of one sort,
   some of another. But even among the best of these, many will
   continually spend the strength of their minds and vigour of their
   spirits about their affairs all the day long, and, so they can pray in
   the morning and evening, with some thoughts sometimes of spiritual
   things occasionally administered, do suppose they acquit themselves
   very well; as if a man should pretend that his great design is to
   prepare himself for a voyage unto a far country, where is his patrimony
   and his inheritance, but all his thoughts and contrivances are about
   some few trifles, which, if indeed he intend his voyage, he must leave
   behind him, and of his main design he scarce thinketh at all. We all
   profess that we are bound for heaven, immortality, and glory; but is it
   any evidence we really design it, if all our thoughts are consumed
   about the trifles of this world, which we must leave behind us, and if
   we have only occasional thoughts of things above? I shall elsewhere
   show, if God will, how men may be spiritually minded in their earthly
   affairs. If some relief may not be thence obtained, I cannot tell what
   to say or answer for them whose thoughts of spiritual things do not
   hold proportion with, yea, exceed, them which they lay out about their
   callings.

   This whole rule is grounded on that of our Saviour, Matt. vi. 31, 33,
   34, "Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we
   drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? But seek ye first the
   kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be
   added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow." When we have
   done all we can, when we have made the best of them we are able, all
   earthly things, as unto our interest in them, amount to no more but
   what we eat, what we drink, and wherewith we are clothed. About these
   things our Saviour forbids us to take any thought, not absolutely, but
   with a double limitation; as, -- First, That we take no such thought
   about them as should carry along with it a disquietude of mind, through
   a distrust of the fatherly care and providence of God. This is the
   design of the context. Secondly, No thought that, for constancy and
   engagement of spirit, should be like unto those which we ought to have
   about spiritual things. "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness," Let that be the principal thing in your thoughts and
   consciences. We may therefore conclude that at least they must hold an
   exceeding proportion with them.

   Let a man industriously engaged in the way of his calling try himself
   by this rule every evening. Let him consider what have been his
   thoughts about his earthly occasions and what about spiritual things,
   and thereon ask of himself whether he be spiritually minded or no. Be
   not deceived; "as a man thinketh, so is he." And if we account it a
   strange thing that our thoughts should be more exercised about
   spiritual things than about the affairs of our callings, we must not
   think it strange if, when we come to the trial, we cannot find that we
   have either "life" or "peace."

   Moreover, it is known how often, when we are engaged in spiritual
   duties, other thoughts will interpose, and impose themselves on our
   minds. Those which are about men's secular concernments will do so. The
   world will frequently make an inroad on the way to heaven, to disturb
   the passengers and wayfaring men. There is nothing more frequently
   complained of by such as are awake unto their duty and sensible of
   their weakness. Call to mind, therefore, how often, on the other hand,
   spiritual thoughts do interpose, and, as it were, impose themselves on
   your minds whilst you are engaged in your earthly affairs. Sometimes no
   doubt but with all that are true believers it is so. "Or ever I was
   aware," saith the spouse, "my soul made me as the chariots of
   Ammi-nadib," Cant. vi. 12. Grace in her own soul surprised her into a
   ready, willing frame unto spiritual communion with Christ, when she was
   intent on other occasion. But if these thoughts of heavenly things so
   arising in us bear no proportion with the other sort, it is an evidence
   what frame and principle is predominant in us.

   (2.) There are a multitude of thoughts in the minds of men which are
   vain, useless, and altogether unprofitable. These ordinarily, through a
   dangerous mistake, are looked on as not sinful, because, as it is
   supposed, the matter of them is not so; and therefore men rather shake
   them off for their folly than their guilt. But they arise from a
   corrupt fountain, and woefully pollute both the mind and conscience.
   Wherever there are "vain thoughts," there is sin, Jer. iv. 14. Such are
   those numberless imaginations whereby men fancy themselves to be what
   they are not, to do what they do not, to enjoy what they enjoy not, to
   dispose of themselves and others at their pleasure. That our nature is
   liable unto such a pernicious folly, which some of tenacious fancies
   have turned into madness, we are beholding alone to our cursed apostasy
   from God, and the vanity that possessed our minds thereon. Hence the
   prince of Tyrus thought he was a god, and "sat in the seat of God,"
   Ezek. xxviii. 2. So it hath been with others, And in those in whom such
   imaginations are kept unto some better order and bounds, yet, being
   traced unto their original, they will be found to spring some of them
   immediately from pride, some from sensual lusts, some from the love of
   the world, all from self, and the old ambition to be as God, to dispose
   of all things as we think meet. I know no greater misery or punishment
   in this world than the debasing of our nature to such vain
   imaginations, and a perfect freedom from them is a part of the
   blessedness of heaven. It is not my present work to show how sinful
   they are; let them be esteemed only fruitless, foolish, vain, and
   ludicrous. But let men examine themselves what number of these vain,
   useless thoughts night and day do rove up and down in their minds. If
   now it be apprehended too severe, that men's thoughts of spiritual
   things should exceed them that are employed about their lawful
   callings, let them consider what proportion they bear unto those that
   are vain and useless. Do not many give more time unto them than they do
   unto holy meditations, without an endeavour to mortify the one or to
   stir up and enliven the other? are they not more wonted to their
   seasons than holy thoughts are? And shall we suppose that those with
   whom it is so are spiritually minded?

   (3.) There are thoughts that are formally evil; they are so in their
   own nature, being corrupt contrivances to fulfil the desires of the
   flesh in the lusts thereof. These also will attempt the minds of
   believers. But they are always looked on as professed enemies to the
   soul, and are watched against. I shall not, therefore, make any
   comparison between them and spiritual thoughts, for they abound only in
   them that are carnally minded.

   2. The second rule to this purpose is, That we should consider whether
   thoughts of spiritual things do constantly take possession of their
   proper seasons. There are some times and seasons in the course of men's
   lives wherein they retire themselves unto their own thoughts. The most
   busied men in the world have some times of thinking unto themselves;
   and those who design no such thing, as being afraid of coming to be
   wiser and better than they are, do yet spend time therein whether they
   will or no. But they who are wise will be at home as much as they can,
   and have as many seasons for such their retirements as is possible for
   them to attain. If that man be foolish who busieth himself so much
   abroad in the concerns of others that he hath no time to consider the
   state of his own house and family, much more is he so who spendeth all
   his thoughts about other things, and never makes use of them in an
   inquiry how it is with himself and his own soul. However, men can
   hardly avoid but that they must have some seasons, partly stated,
   partly occasional, wherein they entertain themselves with their own
   thoughts. The evening and the morning, the times of waking on the bed,
   those of the necessary cessation of all ordinary affairs, of walking,
   journeying, and the like, are such seasons.

   If we are spiritually minded, if thoughts of spiritual things do abound
   in us, they will ordinarily, and that with constancy, possess these
   seasons, look upon them as those which are their due, which belong unto
   them; for they are expressly assigned unto them in the way of rule,
   expressed in examples and commands. See Ps. xvi. 7, 8, xcii. 2; Deut.
   vi. 7. If they are usually given up unto other ends and occasions, are
   possessed with thoughts of another nature, it is an open evidence that
   spiritual thoughts have but little interest in our minds, little
   prevalency in the conduct of our souls. It is our duty to afford unto
   them stated times, taken away from other affairs that call for them;
   but if, instead thereof, we rob them of what is as it were their own,
   which no other things or business can lay any just claim unto, how
   dwelleth the love of spiritual things in us? Most professors are
   convinced that it is their duty to pray morning and evening, and it is
   to be wished that they were all found in the practice of it; but if
   ordinarily they judge themselves in the performance of that duty to be
   discharged from any farther exercise of spiritual thoughts, applying
   them unto things worldly, useless, or vain, they can make no pretence
   to be spiritually minded.

   And it must be observed (which will be found to be true), that if the
   seasons which are as it were due unto such meditations be taken from
   them, they will be the worst employed of all the minutes of our lives.
   Vain and foolish thoughts, corrupt imaginations, will make a common
   haunt unto the minds of men in them, and habituate themselves unto an
   expectation of entertainment, whence they will grow importunate for
   admission. Hence, with many, those precious moments of time which might
   greatly influence their souls unto life and peace, if they were indeed
   spiritually minded, make the greatest provision for their trouble,
   sorrow, and confusion; for the vain and evil thoughts which some
   persons do accustom themselves unto in such seasons are, or ought to
   be, a burden upon their consciences more than they can bear. That which
   providence tenders unto their good is turned into a snare; and God doth
   righteously leave them unto the fruits of their own folly who so
   despise his gracious provision for their good. If we cannot afford unto
   God our spare time, it is evident that indeed we can afford nothing at
   all. Mic. ii. 1, "They devise iniquity upon their beds," -- the season
   proper for holy contemplation they make use of to fill their minds with
   wicked imaginations; "and when the morning is light they practice it,"
   walking all day on all occasions suitably unto their devices and
   imaginations of the night. Many will have cause to complain unto
   eternity of those leisure times, which might have been improved for
   their advantage unto eternal blessedness.

   If we intend, therefore, to maintain a title unto this grace of being
   spiritually minded, if we would have any evidence of it in ourselves,
   -- without which we can have none of life or peace, and what we pretend
   thereof is but an effect of security, -- we must endeavour to preserve
   the claim and right of spiritual thoughts unto such seasons, and
   actually put them in possession of them.

   3. Consider how we are affected with our disappointments about these
   seasons. Have we by negligence, by temptations, have we by occasional
   diversions or affairs of life, been taken off from thoughts of God, of
   Christ, of heavenly things, when we ought to have been engaged in them?
   how are we affected with a view hereof? A carnal mind is well enough
   satisfied with the omission of any duty, so it have the pretence of a
   necessary occasion. If it hath lost a temporal advantage through
   attendance unto a spiritual duty, it will deeply reflect upon itself,
   and, it may be, like the duty the worse afterward. But a gracious soul,
   one that is truly spiritually minded, will mourn under a review of such
   omissions, and by every one of them is stirred up unto more
   watchfulness for the future. "Alas," will it say, "how little have I
   been with Christ this day! how much time hath passed me without a
   thought of him! How foolish was I to be wanting to such or such an
   opportunity! I am in arrears unto myself, and have no rest until I be
   satisfied."

   I say, if indeed we are spiritually minded, we will duly and carefully
   call over the consideration of those times and seasons wherein we ought
   to have exercised ourselves in spiritual thoughts, and if we have lost
   them, or any of them, mourn over our own negligence. But if we can omit
   and lose such seasons or opportunities from time to time without regret
   or self-reflection, it is to be feared that we wax worse and worse. Way
   will be made hereby for farther omissions, until we grow wholly cold
   about them.

   And, indeed, that woful loss of time that is found amongst many
   professors is greatly to be bewailed. Some lose it on themselves, by a
   continual track of fruitless, impertinent thoughts about their own
   concerns; some in vain converse with others, wherein for the most part
   they edify one another unto vanity. How much of this time might, nay
   ought to be redeemed for holy meditation! The good Lord make all
   professors sensible of their loss of former seasons, that they may be
   the more watchful for the future in this great concernment of their
   souls! Little do some think what light, what assurance, what joy, what
   readiness for the cross or for heaven, they might have attained, had
   they laid hold on all just seasons of exercising their thoughts about
   spiritual things which they have enjoyed, who now are at a loss in all,
   and surprised with every fear or difficulty that doth befall them.

   This is the first thing that belongs unto our being spiritually minded:
   for although it doth not absolutely or essentially consist therein, yet
   it is inseparable from it, and the most undeceiving indication of it;
   and thus of abounding and abiding in thoughts about spiritual things,
   such as arise and spring naturally from a living principle, a spiritual
   frame and disposition of heart within.

Chapter V.

   The objects of spiritual thoughts, or what they are conversant about,
   evidencing them in whom they are to be spiritually minded -- Rules
   directing unto steadiness in the contemplation of heavenly things --
   Motives to fix our thoughts with steadiness in them.

   Before I proceed unto the next general head, and which is the principal
   thing, the foundation of the grace and duty inquired after, some things
   must be spoken to render what hath been already insisted on yet more
   particularly useful; and this is, to inquire what are, or what ought to
   be, the special objects of those thoughts which, under the
   qualifications laid down, are the evidences of our being spiritually
   minded. And, it may be, we may be useful unto many herein, by helping
   them to fix their minds, which are apt to rove into all uncertainty:
   for this is befallen us, through the disorder and weakness of the
   faculties of our souls, that sometimes what the mind guides, leads, and
   directs unto, in things spiritual and heavenly, our wills and
   affections, through their depravation and corruption, will not comply
   withal, and so the good designings of the mind are lost; sometimes what
   the will and affections are inclined unto and ready for, the mind,
   through its weakness and inconstancy, cannot lead them to the
   accomplishment of. So to will is present with us, but how to perform
   that will we know not. So many are barren in this duty because they
   know not what to fix upon, nor how to exercise their thoughts when they
   have chosen a subject for their meditations. Hence they spend their
   time in fruitless desires that they could use their thoughts unto more
   purpose, rather than make any progress in the duty itself. They tire
   themselves, not because they are not willing to go, but because they
   cannot find their way. Wherefore, both these things shall be spoken
   unto, both what are the proper objects of our spiritual thoughts, and
   how we may be steady in our contemplation of them. And I shall unto
   this purpose first give some general rules, and then some particular
   instances in way of direction:--

   1. Observe the especial calls of providence, and apply your minds unto
   thoughts of the duties required in them and by them. There is a voice
   in all signal dispensations of providence: "The Lord's voice crieth
   unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the
   rod, and who hath appointed it," Mic. vi. 9. There is a call, a cry in
   every rod of God, in every chastising providence, and therein [he]
   makes a declaration of his name, his holiness, his power, his
   greatness. This every wise, substantial man will labour to discern, and
   so comply with the call. God is greatly provoked when it is otherwise:
   "Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall
   see, and be ashamed," Isa. xxvi. 11. If, therefore, we would apply
   ourselves unto our present duty, we are wisely to consider what is the
   voice of God in his present providential dispensations in the world.
   Hearken not unto any who would give another interpretation of them, but
   that they are plain declarations of his displeasure and indignation
   against the sins of men. Is not his wrath in them revealed from heaven
   against the ungodliness of men, especially such as retain the truth in
   unrighteousness, or false, hypocritical professors of the gospel? Doth
   he not also signally declare the uncertainty and instability of earthly
   enjoyments, from life itself to a shoe-latchet? as also how vain and
   foolish it is to adhere inordinately unto them? The fingers that
   appeared writing on the wall the doom of Belshazzar did it in
   characters that none could read, and words that none could understand,
   but Daniel; but the present call of God in these things is made plain
   upon tables, that he may run who readeth it. If the heavens gather
   blackness with clouds, and it thunder over us, if any that are on their
   journey will not believe that there is a storm coming, they must bear
   the severity of it.

   Suppose, then, this to be the voice of providence, suppose there be in
   it these indications of the mind and will of God, what are the duties
   that we are called unto thereby? They may be referred unto two heads:--

   (1.) A diligent search into ourselves, and a holy watch over ourselves,
   with respect unto those ways and sins which the displeasure of God is
   declared against. That present providences are indications of God's
   anger and displeasure, we take for granted. But when this is done, the
   most are apt to cast the causes of them on others, and to excuse
   themselves. So long as they see others more wicked and profligate than
   themselves, openly guilty of such crimes as they abhor the thoughts of,
   they cast all the wrath on them, and fear nothing but that they shall
   suffer with them. But, alas! when the storm came on the ship at sea,
   wherein there was but one person that feared God, upon an inquiry for
   whose sake it came, the lot fell on him, Jonah i. 7. The cause of the
   present storm may as well be the secret sins of professors as the open
   provocations of ungodly men. God will punish severely those which he
   hath known, Amos iii. 2. It is therefore certainly our duty to search
   diligently, that nothing be found resting in us against which God is
   declaring his displeasure. Take heed of negligence and security herein.
   When our Saviour foretold his disciples that "one of them should betray
   him," he who alone was guilty was the last that said, "Master, is it
   I?" Let no ground of hopes you have of your spiritual condition and
   acceptance with God, no sense of your sincerity in any of your duties,
   no visible difference between you and others in the world, impose
   themselves on your minds to divert them from diligence in this duty.
   "The Lord's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom will see
   his name."

   (2.) A diligent endeavour to live in a holy resignation of our persons,
   our lives, our families, all our enjoyments, unto the sovereign will
   and wisdom of God, so as that we may be in readiness to part with all
   things upon his call without repining. This, also, is plainly declared
   in the voice of present providences. God is making wings for men's
   riches, he is shaking their habitations, taking away the visible
   defenses of their lives, proclaiming the instability and uncertainty of
   all things here below; and if we are not minded to contend with him, we
   have nothing left to give us rest and peace for a moment but a holy
   resignation of all unto his sovereign pleasure.

   Would you now know what you should fix and exercise your thoughts upon,
   so as that they may be evidences of your being spiritually minded? I
   say, be frequently conversant in them about these things. They lie
   before you, they call upon you, and will find you a just employment.
   Count them part of your business, allow them some part of your time,
   cease not until you have the testimony of your consciences that you
   have in sincerity stated both these duties in your minds; which will
   never be done without many thoughts about them. Unless it be so with
   you, God will be greatly displeased at the neglect of his coming and
   call, now it is so plain and articulate. Fear the woful dooms recorded,
   Prov. i. 24-31, Isa. lxv. 12, lxvi. 4, to this purpose. And if any
   calamity, public or private, do overtake you under a neglect of these
   duties, you will be woefully surprised, and not know which way to turn
   for relief. This, therefore, is the time and season wherein you may
   have an especial trial and experiment whether you be spiritually minded
   or no. It is the wisdom of faith to excite and draw forth grace into
   exercise, according unto present occasions. If this grace be habitually
   resident in you, it will put itself forth in many thoughts about these
   present duties.

   But, alas! for the most part, men are apt to walk contrary to God in
   these things, as the wisdom of the flesh is contrary unto him in all
   things. A great instance we have with respect unto these duties,
   especially the latter of them; for, --

   [1.] Who almost makes a diligent search into and trial of his heart and
   ways with respect unto the procuring causes of the displeasure and
   judgments of God? Generally, when the tokens and evidences of them do
   most abound, the world is full of outrageous, provoking sins. These
   visibly proclaim themselves to be the causes of the "coming of the
   wrath of God on the children of disobedience." Hence most men are apt
   to cast the whole reason of present judgments upon them, and to put it
   wholly from themselves Hence, commonly, there is never less of
   self-examination than when it is called for in a peculiar manner. But
   as I will not deny but that the open, daring sins of the world are the
   procuring cause of the wrath of God against it in temporal judgments,
   so the wisest course for us is to refer them unto the great judgment of
   the last day. This the apostle directs us unto, 2 Thess. i. 6-10. Our
   duty it is to consider on what account "judgment begins at the house of
   God," and to examine ourselves with respect thereunto.

   [2.] Again, the other part of our present duty, in compliance with the
   voice of providence, is an humble resignation of ourselves and all our
   concernments unto the will of God, sitting loose in our affections from
   all earthly, temporal enjoyments. This we neither do nor can do, let us
   profess what we will, unless our thoughts are greatly exercised about
   the reasons for it and motives unto it; for this is the way whereby
   faith puts forth its efficacy unto the mortification of self and all
   earthly enjoyments. Wherefore, without this we can make no resignation
   of ourselves unto the will of God. But, alas! how many at present do
   openly walk contrary unto God herein! The ways, the countenances, the
   discourses of men, do give evidence hereunto. Their love unto present
   things, their contrivances for their increase and continuance, do grow
   and thrive under the calls of God to the contrary. So it was of old:
   "They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
   marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark." Can the generality
   of professors at this day give testimony unto the exercise of their
   thoughts upon such things as should dispose them unto this holy
   resignation? that they meditate on the calls of God, and thence make
   themselves ready to part with all at his time and pleasure? How can
   persons pretend to be spiritually minded, the current of whose thoughts
   lies in direct contrariety unto the mind of God?

   Here lies the ground of their self-deceivings: They are professors of
   the gospel in a peculiar manner, they judge themselves believers, they
   hope they shall be saved, and have many evidences for it. But one
   negative evidence will render a hundred that are positive useless. "All
   these things have I done," saith the young man. "Yet lackest thou one
   thing," saith the Saviour. And the want of that one rendered his "all
   things" of no avail unto him. Many things you have done, many things
   you do, many grounds of hope abide with you, neither yourselves nor
   others do doubt of your condition; but are you spiritually minded? If
   this one thing be wanting, all the rest will not avail you; you have,
   indeed, neither life nor peace. And what grounds have you to judge that
   you are so, if the current of your thoughts lies in direct contrariety
   unto the present calls of God? If, at such a time as this is, your love
   to the world be such as ever it was, and perhaps increased; if your
   desires are strong to secure the things of this life unto you and
   yours; if the daily contrivance of your minds be not how you may attain
   a constant resignation of yourselves and your all unto the will of God,
   which will not be clone without much thoughtfulness and meditations on
   the reasons of it and motives unto it, -- I cannot understand how you
   can judge yourselves to be spiritually minded.

   If any, therefore, shall say that they would abound more in spiritual
   thoughts, only they know not what to fix them upon, I propose this in
   the first place, as that which will lead them unto the due performance
   of present duties.

   2. The special trials and temptations of men call for the exercise of
   their thoughts in a peculiar manner with respect unto them. If a man
   hath a bodily disease, pain, or distemper, it will cause him to think
   much of it whether he will or no, at least, if he be wise he will so
   do; nor will he always be complaining of the smart, but he will inquire
   into the causes, and seek their removal. Yet are there some distempers,
   as lethargies, which in their own nature take away all sense and
   thoughts of themselves; and some are of such a slow, secret progress,
   as hectic fevers, that they are not taken notice of; -- but both these
   are mortal. And shall men be more negligent about the spiritual
   distempers of their souls, so as to have multiplied temptations, the
   cause of all spiritual diseases, and take no thought about them? Is it
   not to be feared that where it is so, they are such as either in their
   own nature have deprived them of spiritual sense, or by their
   deceitfulness are leading on insensibly unto death eternal? Not to have
   our minds exercised about these things is to be stupidly secure, Prov.
   xxiii. 34, 35.

   There is, I confess, some difficulty in this matter, how to exercise
   our thoughts aright about our temptations; for the great way of the
   prevalency of temptations is by stirring up multiplied thoughts about
   their objects, or what they do lead unto. And this is done or
   occasioned several ways:-- (1.) From the previous power of lust in the
   affections. This will fill the mind with thoughts. The heart will coin
   imaginations in compliance therewith. They are the way and means
   whereby lust draws away the heart from duty and enticeth unto sin,
   James i. 14; the means at least whereby men come to have "eyes full of
   adultery," 2 Pet. ii. 14, or to live in constant contemplation of the
   pleasures of sin. (2.) They arise and are occasioned by renewed
   representations of the object of sin. And this is twofold:-- [1.] That
   which is real, as Achan saw the wedge of gold and coveted it, Josh.
   vii. 21; Prov. xxiii. 31. Against this is that prayer of the psalmist,
   "Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity;" and the covenant of Job
   xxxi. 1. [2.] Imaginary, when the imagination, being tainted or
   infected by lust, continually represents the pleasure of sin and the
   actings of it unto the mind. Herein do men "make provision for the
   flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof," Rom. xiii. 14. (3.) From the
   suggestions of Satan, who useth all his wiles and artifices to stir up
   thoughts about that sin whereunto the temptation leads. And temptation
   seldom fails of its end, when it can stir up a multitude of
   unprofitable thoughts about its object; for when temptations do
   multiply thoughts about sin, proceeding from some or all of these
   causes, and the mind hath wonted itself to give them entertainment,
   those in whom they are do want nothing but opportunities and occasions,
   taking off the power of outward restraints, for the commission of
   actual sin. When men have so devised mischief, "they practice it" when
   it is "in the power of their hand," Mic. ii. 1. It is no way safe to
   advise such persons to have many thoughts about their temptations; they
   will all turn to their disadvantage.

   I speak unto them only unto whom their temptations are their affliction
   and their burden. And such persons also must be very careful how they
   suffer their thoughts to be exercised about the matter of their
   temptation, lest it be a snare and be too hard for them. Men may begin
   their thoughts of any object with abhorrency and detestation, and, if
   it be a case of temptation, end them in complacency and approbation.
   The deceitfulness of sin lays hold on something or other that lust in
   the mind stays upon with delectation, and so corrupts the whole frame
   of spirit which began the duty. There have been instances wherein
   persons have entered with a resolution to punish sin, and have been
   ensnared by the occasion unto the commission of the sin they thought to
   punish. Wherefore, it is seldom that the mind of any one exercised with
   an actual temptation is able safely to conflict with it, if it
   entertain abiding thoughts of the matter of it or of the sin whereunto
   it leads; for sin hath "mille nocendi artes," and is able to transfuse
   its poison into the affections from every thing it hath once made a
   bait of, especially if it have already defiled the mind with pleasing
   contemplations of it. Yea, oftentimes a man, that hath some spiritual
   strength, and therein engageth unto the performance of duties, if in
   the midst of them the matter of his temptation is so presented unto him
   as to take hold of his thoughts, in a moment, as if he had seen (as
   they say) Medusa's head, is turned into a stone; his spirits are all
   frozen, his strength is gone, all actings of grace do cease, his armour
   falls from him, and he gives up himself a prey to his temptation. It
   must be a new supply of grace that can give him any deliverance.
   Wherefore, whilst persons are exercised with any temptation, I do not
   advise them to be conversant in their thoughts about the matter of it;
   for sometimes remembrances of former satisfaction of their lusts,
   sometimes present surprisals, with the suitableness of it unto
   corruption not yet mortified, sometimes the craft of Satan fixing their
   imagination on it, will be too hard for them, and carry them unto a
   fresh compliance with that sin which they would be delivered from.

   But this season calls in an especial manner for the exercise of the
   thoughts of men about the ways and means of deliverance from the snare
   wherein they are taken, or the danger they find themselves exposed
   unto. Think of the guilt of sin, that you may be humbled. Think of the
   power of sin, that you may seek strength against it. Think not of the
   matter of sin, the things that are in the world suited unto "the lust
   of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life," lest you be
   more and more entangled. But the present direction is, Think much of
   the ways of relief from the power of your own temptation leading unto
   sin. But this, men, unless they are spiritually minded, are very loath
   to come unto. I speak not of them that love their shackles, that glory
   in their yoke, that like their temptations well enough, as those which
   give the most satisfactory entertainment unto their minds. Such men
   know not well what to do unless they may in their minds converse with
   the objects of their lusts, and do multiply thoughts about them
   continually. The apostle calls it "making provision for the flesh to
   fulfil the lusts thereof." Their principal trouble is, that they cannot
   comply with them to the utmost, by reason of some outward restraints.
   These dwell near unto those fools who make a mock of sin, and will ere
   long take up their habitation among them.

   But I speak, as I said before, of them only whose temptations are their
   afflictions, and who groan for deliverance from them. Acquaint such
   persons with the great, indeed only, way of relief in this distress, as
   it is expressed, Heb. ii. 17, 18, "He is a merciful and faithful high
   priest in things pertaining unto God; for in that he himself hath
   suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted;"
   and chap. iv. 15, 16, "We have not an high priest that cannot be
   touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points
   tempted like as we are, yet without sin; let us therefore come boldly
   unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to
   help in time of need;" -- let them know that the only way for their
   deliverance is by acting faith in thoughts on Christ, his power to
   succour them that are tempted, with the ways whereby he administereth a
   sufficiency of grace unto that end, retreating for relief unto him on
   the urgency of temptations; -- they can hardly be brought unto a
   compliance therewithal. They are ready to say, "Are not Abana and
   Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?' Is
   it not better to betake ourselves and to trust unto our own promises,
   resolutions, and endeavours, with such other ways of escape as are in
   our own power?" I shall speak nothing against any of them in their
   proper place, so far as they are warranted by Scripture rule. But this
   I say, none shall ever be delivered from perplexing temptations, unto
   the glory of God and their own spiritual advantage, but by the acting
   and exercising of faith on Christ Jesus and the sufficiency of his
   grace for our deliverance: But when men are not spiritually minded,
   they cannot fix their thoughts on spiritual things. Therefore do men
   daily pine away under their temptations; they get ground upon them,
   until their breach grows great like the sea, and there be no healing of
   it.

   I mention this only to show the weight and necessity of the duty
   proposed; for when men under the power of conviction are pressed with
   temptation, they will do any thing rather than betake themselves unto
   the only efficacious relief. Some will groan and cry out under their
   vexation from the torture they are put into in the conflict between
   their temptations and convictions; some will betake themselves unto the
   pretended relief that any false religion tenders unto them; but to
   apply themselves in thoughts of faith unto Jesus Christ, whose grace
   alone is sufficient for all, that they will not be persuaded unto.

   We are all of us liable unto temptations. Those who are not sensible of
   it are under the power of what the temptation leads unto. And they are
   of two sorts:-- First, such as are extraordinary, when the hand of God
   is in them in a peculiar manner for our rebuke. It is true, God tempts
   none, as temptation formally leads unto sin; but he orders temptations
   so far forth as they are afflictive and chastisements. Thus it is when
   he suffers an especial corruption within to fall in conjunction with an
   especial temptation without, and to obtain a prevalency thereby. Of
   these there is no doubt but any man not judicially hardened may know
   both his disease and the remedy. But that ordinary course of
   temptations which we are exercised withal needs a diligent attendance
   for their discovery, as well as for our deliverance from them. And it
   is to be feared that many are kept in spiritual weakness, useless, and
   in darkness, all their days, through the power of their temptations,
   yet never know what they are or wherein they consist. These gray hairs
   are sprinkled on them, yet they know it not. Some approve themselves in
   those very things and ways which are their temptations. Yet in the
   exercise of due watchfulness, diligence, and prudence, men may know
   both the plague of their own hearts in their prevailing corruptions,
   and the ways whereby it is excited through temptation, with the
   occasions it makes use of and the advantages it takes. For instance,
   one may have an eminency in gifts, and usefulness or success in his
   labours, which give him great acceptance with others. Such an one shall
   hardly avoid a double temptation, -- first, of spiritual pride and
   self-exaltation. Hence the apostle will not admit "a novice," one
   unexperienced in the ways of grace and deceits of sin, into the office
   of the ministry, lest he should be "lifted up with pride," and "fall
   into the condemnation of the devil," 1 Tim. iii. 6; he himself was not
   without danger hereof, 2 Cor. xii. 1-7. The best of men can hardly
   fortify their minds against the secret workings of pride upon successes
   and applause, unless they keep themselves constantly balanced with
   thoughts of their own vileness in the sight of God. And, secondly,
   remissness unto exact, universal mortification, which they countenance
   themselves against by their acceptance and success above others in the
   ministry. It were much to be desired that all who are ministers would
   be careful in these things; for although some of us may not much please
   others, yet we may so far please ourselves as to expose our souls unto
   these snares. And the effects of negligence herein do openly appear
   unto the disadvantage of the gospel. Others are much conversant in the
   world and the affairs of it. Negligence as unto a spiritual watch,
   vanity in converse, love of earthly things, with conformity unto the
   world, will on all occasions impose themselves upon them. If they
   understand not their temptations herein, spiritual mindedness will be
   impaired in them continually. Those that are rich have their especial
   temptations, which for the most part are many, plausible, and
   effectual; and those that are poor have theirs also. The snares of some
   lie in their constitutions; of others, in their society; of most, in
   the various circumstances of life. Those who are upon their watch in
   any due measure, who exercise any wisdom or observation concerning
   themselves, may know wherein their temptations do lie, what are the
   advantages whereby they perplex their minds and endanger their souls.

   In these cases, generally, men are taught what are the ways and means
   of their deliverance and preservation. Wherefore there are three things
   required unto this duty, and spiritual wisdom unto them all:-- (1.) To
   know what are the especial temptations from whence you suffer, and
   whereby the life of God is obstructed in you. If this be neglected, if
   it be disregarded, no man can maintain either life or peace, or is
   spiritually minded. (2.) To know your remedy, your relief, wherein
   alone it doth consist. Many duties are required of us unto this end,
   and are useful thereunto; but know assuredly that no one of them, not
   all of them in conjunction, will bring in relief, unto the glory of God
   and your own peace, without application by faith unto Him who "is able
   to succour them that are tempted." Wherefore, (3.) Herein lies your
   great duty with respect unto your temptations, namely, in a constant
   exercise of your thoughts on the love, care, compassion, and tenderness
   of Christ, with his ability to help, succour, and save them that do
   believe, so as to strengthen your faith and trust in him; which will
   assuredly prove successful and victorious.

   The same duty is incumbent on us with respect unto any urgent prevalent
   general temptation. There are seasons wherein an hour of temptation
   comes on the earth to try them that dwell therein. What if a man should
   judge that now it is such an hour, and that the power of darkness is
   put forth therein? What if he should be persuaded that a general
   security, coldness, deadness, and decay in grace, especially as to the
   vigorous actings of zeal, love, and delight in God, with an
   indifferency unto holy duties, are the effects of this hour of
   temptation? I do not say determinately that so it is; let others judge
   as they see cause: but if any one do so judge, undoubtedly it is his
   duty to be exercised in his thoughts how he may escape in this day of
   trial, and be counted worthy to stand before the Son of man. He will
   find it his concernment to be conversant in his mind with the reasons
   and motives unto watchfulness, and how he may obtain such supplies of
   grace as may effectually preserve him from such decays.

   3. All things in religion, both in faith and practice, are to be the
   objects of such thoughts. As they are proposed or occur in our minds in
   great variety, on all sorts of occasions, so we ought to give them
   entertainment in our meditations. To hear things, to have them proposed
   unto us, it may be in the way of a divine ordinance, and to let them
   slip out, or flow from us as water that is poured into a leaking
   vessel, is the ruin of many souls. I shall therefore choose out some
   instances, as was before proposed, of those things which I judge that
   they who would be spiritually minded ought to abide and abound in
   thoughts concerning.

   It is our duty greatly to mind the things that are above, eternal
   things, both as unto their reality, their present state, and our future
   enjoyment of them. Herein consists the life of this grace and duty. To
   be heavenly minded, -- that is, to mind the things of heaven, -- and to
   be spiritually minded, is all one; or it is the effect of being
   spiritually minded as unto its original and essence, or the first
   proper actings of it. It is the cause of it as unto its growth and
   degrees, and it is the evidence of it in experience. Nor do I
   understand how it is possible for a man to place his chief interest in
   things above, and not have many thoughts of them. It is the great
   advice of the apostle, on a supposition of our interest in Christ and
   conformity unto him, Col. iii. 1, 2, "If ye then be risen with Christ,
   seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right
   hand of God. Set your affection on" (or your thoughts), mind much,
   "things above." It becomes those who, through the virtue of the
   resurrection of Christ, are raised unto newness of life to have their
   thoughts exercised on the state of things above, with respect unto the
   presence of Christ among them. And the singular use of our prospect
   into these things, or our meditations on them, he instructs us in: 2
   Cor. iv. 16-18, "For which cause we faint not; but though our outward
   man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light
   affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things
   which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things
   which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are
   eternal." Not to faint under the daily decays of our outward man, and
   the approaches of death thereby, to bear afflictions as things light
   and momentary, to thrive under all in the inward man, are unspeakable
   mercies and privileges. Can you attain a better frame? Is there any
   thing that you would more desire, if you are believers? Is it not
   better to have such a mind in us than to enjoy all the peace and
   security that the world can afford? One principal means whereby we are
   made partakers of these things is a due meditation on things unseen and
   eternal. These are the things that are within the veil, whereon we
   ought to cast the anchor of our hope in all the storms we meet withal,
   Heb. vi. 19, 20, whereof we shall speak more afterward.

   Without doubt, the generality of Christians are greatly defective in
   this duty, partly for want of light into them, partly for want of
   delight in them; they think little of an eternal country. Wherever men
   are, they do not use to neglect thoughts of that country wherein their
   inheritance lies. If they are absent from it for a season, yet will
   they labour to acquaint themselves with the principal concernments of
   it. But this heavenly country, wherein lies our eternal inheritance, is
   not regarded. Men do not exercise themselves as they ought unto
   thoughts of things eternal and invisible. It were impossible, if they
   did so, that their minds should be so earthly, and their affections
   cleave so as they do unto present things. He that looks steadily on the
   sun, although he cannot bear the lustre of its beams fully, yet his
   sight is so affected with it that when he calls off his eyes from it,
   he can see nothing as it were of the things about him; they are all
   dark unto him. And he who looks steadily in his contemplations on
   things above, eternal things, though he cannot comprehend their glory,
   yet a veil will be cast by it on all the desirable beauties of earthly
   things, and take off his affections from them.

   Men live and act under the power of a conviction that there is a state
   of immortality and glory to come. With a persuasion hereof they much
   relieve themselves in their sorrows, sufferings, and temptations; yet
   with many it is only a reserve when they can be here no more. But as
   unto daily contemplation of the nature and causes of it, or as unto any
   entrance into it by faith and hope, the most are strangers thereunto.
   If we are spiritually minded, nothing will be more natural unto us than
   to have many thoughts of eternal things, as those wherein all our own
   principal concerns do lie, as well as those which are excellent and
   glorious in themselves. The direction thereon is, that we would make
   heavenly things, the things of the future state of blessedness and
   glory, a principal object of our thoughts, that we would think much
   about them, that we would meditate much upon them. Many are discouraged
   herein by their ignorance and darkness, by their want of due
   conceptions and steady apprehensions of invisible things. Hence one of
   these two things doth befall them when they would meditate on things
   above:-- 1. The glory of them, the glory of God in them, being
   essentially infinite and incomprehensible, doth immediately overwhelm
   them, and, as it were, in a moment put them unto an utter loss, so that
   they cannot frame one thought in their minds about them. Or, 2. They
   want skill and ability to conceive aright of invisible things, and to
   dispose of them in such order in their minds as that they may sedately
   exercise their thoughts about them. Both these shall be afterward
   spoken unto. At present I shall only say, that, --

   Whosoever shall sincerely engage in this duty according unto what he
   hath, and shall abide constant therein, he will make such a refreshing
   progress in his apprehension of heavenly things as he will be greatly
   satisfied withal. We are kept in darkness, ignorance, and unsteadiness
   of meditations about them, not from the nature of the things
   themselves, but from our own sloth, negligence, and readiness to be
   turned aside by apprehensions of difficulties, of the lion in the way.
   Wherefore, I shall consider two things: (1.) What are the principal
   motives unto this duty of fixing our thoughts on the things that are
   above, and the advantages which we receive thereby. (2.) Give some
   directions how, and on what in particular, we may exercise our thoughts
   on those things above:--

   (1.) [1.] Faith will be increased and strengthened by it. Invisible
   things are the proper objects of faith. It is "the evidence of things
   not seen," Heb. xi. 1. Wherefore, in our thoughts of them faith is in
   its proper exercise; which is the principal means of its growth and
   increase. And hereon two things will ensue:--

   1st. The soul will come unto a more satisfactory, abiding sense of the
   reality of them. Things of imagination, which maintain a value of
   themselves by darkness, will not bear a diligent search into them. They
   lose of their reputation on every serious inquiry. If rational men
   would but give themselves the liberty of free indagation by their own
   thoughts, it would quickly cashier the fool's paradise of Mohammed, the
   purgatory of the Papists, and all such creatures of imagination and
   superstition. But where things are real and substantial, the more they
   are inquired into, the more they evidence their being and subsistence.
   It is not, therefore, every profession of a faith of a future state of
   blessedness that will realize it in our minds; and therefore, for the
   most part, it is rather a notion that men have of heavenly things,
   which they do not contradict, than any solid satisfaction in or
   spiritual sense of their reality: for these are things that "eye hath
   not seen, nor ear heard, nor will enter into the heart of man to
   conceive," -- whose existence, nature, and real state, are not easily
   comprehended. But through the continual exercise of holy thoughts about
   them, the soul obtains an entrance into the midst of them, finding in
   them both durable substance and riches. There is no way, therefore, to
   strengthen faith unto any degree but by a daily contemplation on the
   things themselves. They who do not think of them frequently shall never
   believe them sincerely. They admit not of any collateral evidence,
   where they do not evidence themselves unto our souls. Faith, as we
   said, thus exercised, will give them a subsistence; not in themselves,
   which they have antecedent thereunto, but in us, in our hearts, in the
   minds of them that do believe. Imagination creates its own object;
   faith finds it prepared beforehand. It will not leave a bare notion of
   them in the understanding, but give them a spiritual subsistence in the
   heart, as Christ himself dwells in our hearts by faith. And there are
   two things that will discover this subsistence of them in us:-- (1st.)
   When we find them in a continual readiness to rise up in our minds on
   all occasions wherein the thoughts and remembrance of them are needful
   and useful unto us. There are many seasons (some whereof shall be
   immediately spoken unto) and many duties, wherein and whereunto the
   faith and thoughts of things invisible and eternal are needful unto us,
   so as that we cannot fill up those seasons nor perform those duties in
   a due manner without them. If on all such occasions they do, from the
   inward frame of our minds, present themselves unto us, or, through our
   acquaintance and familiarity with them, we recur in our thoughts unto
   them, they seem to have a real subsistence given unto them in our
   souls. But if on such occasions, wherein alone they will yield us help
   and relief, we accustom ourselves to other thoughts, if those
   concerning them are, as it were, out of the way, and arise not in our
   minds of their own accord, we are yet strangers unto this effect of
   faith. (2dly.) They are realized unto us, they have a subsistence in
   us, when the soul continually longeth to be in them. When they have
   given such a relish unto our hearts, as the first-fruits of glory, that
   we cannot but desire on all opportune occasions to be in the full
   enjoyment of them, faith seems to have had its effectual work herein
   upon us. For want of these things do many among us walk in
   disconsolation all their days.

   2dly. It will gradually give the heart an acquaintance with the
   especial nature and use of these things. General thoughts and notions
   of heaven and glory do but fluctuate up and down in the mind, and very
   little influence it unto other duties; but assiduous contemplation will
   give the mind such distinct apprehensions of heavenly things as shall
   duly affect it with the glory of them.

   The more we discern of the glory and excellency of them in their own
   nature; of their suitableness unto ours, as our only proper rest and
   blessedness, as the perfection and complement of what is already begun
   in us by grace; of the restless tendency of all gracious dispositions
   and inclinations of our hearts towards their enjoyment, -- the more
   will faith be established in its cleaving unto them. So in the
   contemplation of these things consists the principal food of faith,
   whereby it is nourished and strengthened. And we are not to expect much
   work where there is not provision of proper food for them that labour.
   No wonder if we find faith faint and weak in the work it hath to do,
   which ofttimes is great and weighty, if we neglect to guide it daily
   unto that which should administer strength unto it.

   [2.] It will give life and exercise unto the grace of hope. Hope is a
   glorious grace, whereunto blessed effects are ascribed in the
   Scripture, and an effectual operation unto the supportment and
   consolation of believers. By it are we purified, sanctified, saved.
   And, to sum up the whole of its excellency and efficacy, it is a
   principal way of the working of Christ as inhabiting in us: Col. i. 27,
   "Christ in you the hope of glory." Where Christ evidenceth his presence
   with us, he gives us an infallible hope of glory; he gives us an
   assured pledge of it, and worketh our souls into an expectation of it.
   Hope in general is but an uncertain expectation of a future good which
   we desire; but as it is a gospel grace, all uncertainty is removed from
   it, which would hinder us of the advantage intended in it. It is an
   earnest expectation, proceeding from faith, trust, and confidence,
   accompanied with longing desires of enjoyment. From a mistake of its
   nature it is that few Christians labour after it, exercise themselves
   unto it, or have the benefit of it; for, to live by hope they suppose
   infers a state not only beneath the life of faith and all assurance in
   believing, but also exclusive of them. They think to hope to be saved
   is a condition of men who have no grounds of faith or assurance; but
   this is to turn a blessed fruit of the Spirit into a common affection
   of nature. Gospel hope is a fruit of faith, trust, and confidence; yea,
   the height of the actings of all grace issues in a well-grounded hope,
   nor can it rise any higher, Rom. v. 2-5.

   Now, the reason why men have no more use of, no more benefit by, this
   excellent grace, is because they do not abide in thoughts and
   contemplation of the things hoped for. The especial object of hope is
   eternal glory, Col. i. 27; Rom. v. 2. The peculiar use of it is to
   support, comfort, and refresh the soul, in all trials, under all
   weariness and despondencies, with a firm expectation of a speedy
   entrance into that glory, with an earnest desire after it. Wherefore,
   unless we acquaint ourselves, by continual meditation, with the reality
   and nature of this glory, it is impossible it should be the object of a
   vigorous, active hope, such as whereby the apostle says "we are saved."
   Without this we can neither have that evidence of eternal things, nor
   that valuation of them, nor that preparedness in our minds for them, as
   should keep us in the exercise of gracious hope about them.

   Suppose sundry persons engaged in a voyage unto a most remote country,
   wherein all of them have an apprehension that there is a place of rest
   and an inheritance provided for them. Under this apprehension they all
   put themselves upon their voyage, to possess what is so prepared.
   Howbeit some of them have only a general notion of these things; they
   know nothing distinctly concerning them, and are so busied about other
   affairs that they have no leisure to inquire into them, or do suppose
   that they cannot come unto any satisfactory knowledge of them in
   particular, and so are content to go on with general hopes and
   expectations. Others there are who by all possible means acquaint
   themselves particularly with the nature of the climate whither they are
   going, with the excellency of the inheritance and provision that is
   made for them. Their voyage proves long and wearisome, their
   difficulties many, and their dangers great, and they have nothing to
   relieve and encourage themselves with but the hope and expectation of
   the country whither they are going. Those of the first sort will be
   very apt to despond and faint, their general hopes will not be able to
   relieve them; but those who have a distinct notion and apprehension of
   the state of things whither they are going, and of their incomparable
   excellency, have always in a readiness wherewith to cheer their minds
   and support themselves.

   In that journey or pilgrimage wherein we are engaged towards a heavenly
   country, we are sure to meet with all kinds of dangers, difficulties,
   and perils. It is not a general notion of blessedness that will excite
   and work in us a spiritual, refreshing hope. But when we think and
   meditate on future glory as we ought, that grace which is neglected for
   the most pare as unto its benefit, and dead as unto its exercise, will
   of all others be most vigorous and active, putting itself forth on all
   occasions. This, therefore, is an inestimable benefit of the duty
   exhorted unto, and which they find the advantage of who are really
   spiritually minded.

   [3.] This alone will make us ready for the cross, for all sorts of
   sufferings that we may be exposed unto.

   There is nothing more necessary unto believers at this season than to
   have their minds furnished with provision of such things as may prepare
   them for the cross and sufferings. Various intimations of the mind of
   God, circumstances of providence, the present state of things in the
   world, with the instant peril of the latter days, do all call them
   hereunto. If it be otherwise with them, they will at one time or other
   be woefully surprised, and think strange of their trials, as if some
   strange thing did befall them. Nothing is more useful unto this end
   than constant thoughts and contemplations of eternal things and future
   glory. From hence alone can the soul have in a readiness what to lay in
   the balance against all sorts of sufferings. When a storm begins to
   arise at sea, the mariners bestir themselves in the management of the
   tackling of the ship, and other applications of their art, for their
   safety; but if the storm increase and come to extremity, they are
   forced to forego all other means and betake themselves unto a
   sheet-anchor, to hold their ship steady against its violence. So when a
   storm of persecution and troubles begins to arise, men have various
   ways and considerations for their relief; but if it once come to
   extremity, -- if sword, nakedness, famine, and death, are inevitably
   coming upon them, -- they have nothing to betake themselves unto that
   will yield them solid relief but the consideration and faith of things
   invisible and eternal.

   So the apostle declares this state of things, 2 Cor. iv. 16-18 (the
   words before insisted on), "For which cause we faint not; but though
   our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For
   our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far
   more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the
   things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the
   things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen
   are eternal." He lays all sorts of afflictions in one scale, and, on
   the consideration of them, declares them to be "light" and "but for a
   moment." Then he lays glory in the other scale, and finds it to be
   ponderous, weighty, and "eternal," -- "an exceeding weight of glory."
   In the one is sorrow for a little while, in the other eternal joy; in
   the one pain for a few moments, in the other everlasting rest; in the
   one is the loss of some few temporary things, in the other the full
   fruition of God in Christ, who is all in all.

   Hence the same apostle casts up the account of these things, and gives
   us his judgment concerning them, Rom. viii. 18, "I reckon that the
   sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the
   glory that shall be revealed in us." There is no comparison between
   them, as if one had as much evil and misery in them as the other hath
   of good and blessedness; as though his state were any way to be
   complained of who must undergo the one whilst he hath an interest in
   the other; or as though to escape the one he hazard the enjoyment of
   the other.

   It is inseparable from our nature to have a fear of and aversation from
   great, distressing sufferings, that are above the power of nature to
   bear. Even our Lord Jesus himself, having taken on him all the sinless
   properties of our nature, had a fear and aversation, though holy and
   gracious, with respect unto his own. Those who, through a
   stout-heartedness, do contemn them before their approach, boasting in
   themselves of their abilities to undergo them, censuring such as will
   not unadvisedly engage in them, are such as seldom glorify God when
   they are really [called] to conflict with them. Peter alone trusted
   unto himself that he would not forsake his Master, and seemed to take
   the warning ill that they should all do so, and he alone denied him.
   All church stories are filled with instances of such as, having borne
   themselves high before the approach of trials, have shamefully
   miscarried when their trials have come. Wherefore, it is moreover
   allowed unto us to use all lawful means for the avoiding of them. Both
   rules and examples of the Scripture give sufficient warranty for it.
   But there are times and seasons wherein, without any tergiversation,
   they are to be undergone unto the glory of God and in the discharge of
   our duty, confessing Christ before men, as we would be owned by him
   before his Father in heaven. All things do now call us to prepare for
   such a season, to be martyrs in resolution, though we should never
   really lose our lives by violence. Nothing will give us this
   preparation but to have our minds exercised in the contemplation of
   heavenly things, of things that are invisible and eternal. He who is
   thus spiritually minded, who hath his thoughts and affections set on
   things above, will have always in a readiness what to oppose unto any
   circumstance of his sufferings.

   Those views which such an one hath had by faith of the uncreated
   glories above, of the things in heavenly places where Christ sits at
   the right hand of God, of the glory within the veil, whereby they have
   been realized and made present unto his soul, will now visit him every
   moment, abide with him continually, and put forth their efficacy unto
   his supportment and refreshment. Alas! what will become of many of us,
   who are grovelling continually on the earth, whose bellies cleave unto
   the dust, who are strangers unto the thoughts of heavenly things, when
   distressing troubles shall befall us? Why shall we think that
   refreshing thoughts of things above will then visit our souls, whet we
   resisted their admittance in days of peace? "Do ye come to me in your
   distress," saith Jephthah, "when in the time of your peace ye drove me
   from you?" When we would thus think of heavenly things to our
   refreshment, we shall hardly get them to make an abode with us. I know
   God can come in by the mighty power of his Spirit and grace to support
   and comfort the souls of them who are called and even surprised into
   the greatest of sufferings; yet do I know also that it is our duty not
   to tempt him in the neglect of the ways and means which he hath
   appointed for the communication of his grace unto us.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, as "the author and finisher of our
   faith, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross,
   despising the shame," Heb. xii. 2. His mediatory glory in the salvation
   of the church was the matter of the joy set before him. This he took
   the view and prospect of in all his sufferings, unto his refreshment
   and supportment. And his example, as "the author and finisher of our
   faith," is more efficaciously instructive than any other rule or
   precept. Eternal glory is set before us also; it is the design of God's
   wisdom and grace that by the contemplation of it we should relieve
   ourselves in all our suffering, yea, and rejoice with joy unspeakable
   and full of glory. How many of those blessed souls now in the enjoyment
   of God and glory, who passed through fiery trials and great
   tribulations, were enabled to sing and rejoice in the flames by
   prepossession of this glory in their minds through believing! yea, some
   of them have been so filled with them as to take off all sense of pain
   under the most exquisite tortures. When Stephen was to be stoned, to
   encourage him in his suffering and comfort him in it, "the heavens were
   opened, and he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God." Who can
   conceive what contempt of all the rage and madness of the Jews, what a
   neglect of all the pains of death, this view raised his holy soul unto?
   To obtain, therefore, such views frequently by faith, as they do who
   are truly spiritually minded, is the most effectual way to encourage us
   unto all our sufferings. The apostle gives us the force of this
   encouragement in a comparison with earthly things: 1 Cor. ix. 25,
   "Every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.
   Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible."
   If men, when a corruptible crown of vain honour and applause is
   proposed unto them, will do and endure all that is needful for the
   attainment of it, and relieve themselves in their hardships with
   thoughts and imaginations of attaining it, grounded on uncertain hopes,
   shall not we, who have a crown immortal and invisible proposed unto us,
   and that with the highest assurance of the enjoyment of it, cheerfully
   undergo, endure, and suffer, what we are to go through in the way unto
   it.

   [4.] This is the most effectual means to wean the heart and affections
   from things here below, to keep the mind unto an undervaluation, yea, a
   contempt of them, as occasion shall require; for there is a season
   wherein there is such a contempt required in us of all relations and
   enjoyments as our Saviour calleth the "hating" of them, -- that is, not
   absolutely, but comparatively, in comparison of him and the gospel,
   with the duties which belong unto our profession: Luke xiv. 26, "If any
   man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and
   children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he
   cannot be my disciple." Some, I fear, if they did but consider it,
   would be apt to say, "This is a hard saying, who can bear it?" and
   others would cry out, with the disciples in another case, "Lord, who
   then can be saved?" but it is the word whereby we must be judged, nor
   can we be the disciples of Christ on any other terms. But here, in an
   especial manner, lies the wound and weakness of faith and profession in
   these our days: "The bellies of men cleave unto the dust," or their
   affections unto earthly things.

   I speak not of those who, by rapine, deceit, and oppression, strive to
   enrich themselves; nor of those who design nothing more than the
   attainment of greatness and promotion in the world, though not by ways
   of open wickedness; least of all of them who make religion, and perhaps
   their ministry therein, a means for the attaining of secular ends and
   preferments. No wise man can suppose such persons, any of them, to be
   spiritually minded, and it is most easy to disprove all their
   pretences. But I intend only those at present whose ways and means of
   attaining riches are lawful, honest, and unblamable; who use them with
   some moderation, and do profess that their portion lies in better
   things, so as it is hard to fasten a conviction on them in the matter
   of their conversation. Whatever may seem to reflect upon them, they
   esteem it to be that whose omission would make them foolish in their
   affairs or negligent in their duty. But even among these also there is
   ofttimes that inordinate love unto present things, that esteem and
   valuation of them, that concernment in them, as are not consistent with
   their being spiritually minded. With some their relations, with some
   their enjoyments, with most both in conjunction, are an idol which they
   set up in their hearts and secretly bow down unto. About these are
   their hopes and fears exercised, on them is their love, in them is
   their delight. They are wholly taken up with their own concerns, count
   all lost that is not spent on them, and all time misspent that is not
   engaged about them. Yet the things which they do they judge to be good
   in themselves; their hearts do not condemn them as to the matter of
   them. The valuation they have of their relations and enjoyments they
   suppose to be lawful, within the bounds which they have assigned unto
   it. Their care about them is, in their own minds, but their duty. It is
   no easy matter, it requires much spiritual wisdom, to fix right
   boundaries unto our affections and their actings about earthly things.
   But let men plead and pretend what they please, I shall offer one rule
   in this case, which will not fail; and this is, that when men are so
   confident in the good state and measure of their affections and their
   actings towards earthly things as that they will oppose their
   engagements into them unto known duties of religion, piety, and
   charity, they are gone into a sinful excess. Is there a state of the
   poor that requires their liberality and bounty, -- you must excuse
   them, they have families to provide for; when what is expected from
   them signifies nothing at all as unto a due provision for their
   families, nor is what would lessen their inheritances or portions one
   penny in the issue. Are they called to an attendance on seasons of
   religious duties? -- they are so full of business that it is impossible
   for them to have leisure for any such occasions. So by all ways
   declaring that they are under the power of a prevalent, predominant
   affection unto earthly things. This fills all places with lifeless,
   sapless, useless professors, who approve themselves in their condition,
   whilst it is visibly unspiritual and withering.

   The heart will have something whereon, in a way of pre-eminence, it
   will fix itself and its affections. This, in all its perpetual motions,
   it seeks for rest and satisfaction in. And every man hath an edge; the
   edge of his affections is set one way or other, though it be more keen
   in some than others. And whereas all sorts of things that the heart can
   fix upon or turn the edge of its affections unto are distributed by the
   apostle into "things above" and "things beneath," things heavenly and
   things earthly, if we have not such a view and prospect of heavenly
   things as to cause our hearts to cleave unto them and delight in them,
   let us pretend what we will, it is impossible but that we shall be
   under the power of a predominant affection unto the things of this
   world.

   Herein lies the great danger of multitudes at this present season; for,
   let men profess what they will, under the power of this frame their
   eternal state is in hazard every moment. And persons are engaged in it
   in great variety of degrees; and we may cast them under two heads:--

   1st. Some do not at all understand that things are amiss with them, or
   that they are much to be blamed. They plead, as was before observed,
   that they are all lawful things which their hearts do cleave unto, and
   which it is their duty to take care of and regard. "May they not
   delight in their own relations, especially at such a time, when others
   break and cancel all duties and bonds of relation in the service of and
   provision they make for their lusts? May they not be careful, in good
   and honest ways of diligence, about the things of the world, when the
   most either lavish their time away in the pursuit of bestial lusts, or
   heap them up by deceit and oppression? May they not contrive for the
   promotion of their children in the world, to add the other hundred or
   thousand pounds unto their advancement, that they may be in as good
   condition as others, seeing he is worse than an infidel who provides
   not for his own family," By such reasonings and secret thoughts do many
   justify themselves in their earthly mindedness. And so fixed they are
   in the approbation of themselves, that if you urge them to their duty,
   you shall lose their acquaintance, if they do not become your enemies
   for telling them the truth. Yea, they will avoid one duty that lieth
   not against their earthly interest, because it leads unto another; --
   they will not engage in religious assemblies, or be constant unto their
   duty in them, for fear duties of charity should be required of them or
   expected from them. On what grounds such persons can satisfy themselves
   that they are spiritually minded, I know not. I shall leave only one
   rule with persons that are thus minded:-- Where our love unto the world
   hath prevailed, by its reasonings, pleas, and pretences, to take away
   our fear and jealousy over our own hearts lest we should inordinately
   love it, there it is assuredly predominant in us.

   2dly. Others are sensible of the evil of their hearts, at least are
   jealous and afraid lest it should be found that their hearts do cleave
   inordinately unto these things. Hence they endeavour to contend against
   this evil, sometimes by forcing themselves unto such acts of piety or
   charity as are contrary unto that frame, and sometimes by labouring a
   change of the frame itself; especially they will do so when God is
   pleased to awaken them by trials and afflictions, such as write vanity
   and emptiness on all earthly enjoyments. But, for the most part, they
   strive not lawfully, and so obtain not what they seem to aim at.

   This disease with many is mortal, and will not be thoroughly cured in
   any but by the due exercise of this part of spiritual mindedness. There
   are other duties required also unto the same end, -- namely, of the
   mortification of our desires and affections unto earthly things, --
   whereof I have treated elsewhere; but without this, or a fixed
   contemplation on the desirableness, beauty, and glory, of heavenly
   things, it will not be attained. Farther to evince the truth hereof, we
   may observe these two things:-- (1st.) If by any means a man do seem to
   have taken off his heart from the love of present things, and be not at
   the same time taken up with the love of things that are heavenly, his
   seeming mortification is of no advantage unto him. So persons
   frequently, through discontent, disappointments, or dissatisfaction
   with relations, or mere natural weariness, have left the world, the
   affairs and cares of it, as unto their wonted conversations in it, and
   have betaken themselves to monasteries, convents, or other retirements
   suiting their principles, without any advantage to their souls. (2dly.)
   God is no such severe lord and master as to require us to take off our
   affections from and mortify them unto those things which the law of our
   nature makes dear unto us, as wives, children, houses, lands, and
   possessions, and not propose unto us somewhat that is incomparably more
   excellent to fix them upon. So he invites the elect of the Gentiles
   unto Christ: Ps. xlv. 10, "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and
   incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's
   house;" that is, "Come into the faith of Abraham, who forsook his
   country and his father's house to follow God whithersoever he pleased."
   But he proposeth this for their encouragement, verse 11, "So shall the
   King greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou
   him." The love of the great King is an abundant satisfactory recompense
   for parting with all things in this world. So when Abraham's servant
   was sent to take Rebekah for a wife unto Isaac, he required that she
   should immediately leave father and mother, brothers, and all
   enjoyments, and go along with him; but withal, that she might know
   herself to be no loser thereby, he not only assured her of the
   greatness of his master, but also at present he gave her "jewels of
   silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment," Gen. xxiv. 53. And when our
   Saviour requires that we should part with all for his sake and the
   gospel, he promiseth a hundredfold in lieu of them, even in this life,
   -- namely, in an interest in things spiritual and heavenly. Wherefore,
   without an assiduous meditation on heavenly things, as a better, more
   noble, and suitable object for our affections to be fixed on, we can
   never be freed in a due manner from an inordinate love of the things
   here below.

   It is sad to see some professors, who will keep up spiritual duties in
   churches and in their families, who will speak and discourse of
   spiritual things, and keep themselves from the open excesses of the
   world, yet, when they come to be tried by such duties as intrench on
   their love and adherence unto earthly things, quickly manifest how
   remote they are from being spiritually minded in a due manner. Were
   they to be tried as our Saviour tried the young man who made such a
   profession of his conscientious and religious conversation, "Go sell
   what thou hast, give to the poor, and follow me," something might be
   pleaded in excuse for their tergiversation; but, alas! they will
   decline their duty when they are not touched unto the hundredth part of
   their enjoyments.

   I bless God I speak not thus of many of my own knowledge, and may say
   with the apostle unto the most unto whom I usually speak in this
   manner, "But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and
   things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak," Heb. vi. 9.
   Yea, the same testimony may be given of many in this city which the
   same apostle gives unto the churches of Macedonia: 2 Cor. viii. 1-3,
   Understand "the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; how
   that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and
   their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. For to
   their power, and beyond their power, they were willing of themselves."
   There hath been nothing done amongst us that may or can be boasted of;
   yet, considering all circumstances, it may be there have not been more
   instances of true, evangelical charity in any age or place for these
   many years. For them who have been but useful and helpful herein, the
   Lord remember them for good, and spare them according to the multitude
   of his mercies! It is true, they have not, many of them, founded
   colleges, built hospitals, or raised works of state and magnificence;
   for very many of them are such as whose deep poverty comparatively hath
   abounded unto the riches of their liberality. The backs and bellies of
   multitudes of poor and needy servants of Christ have been warmed and
   refreshed by them, blessing God for them. "Thanks be unto God," saith
   the apostle in this case, "for his unspeakable gift," 2 Cor. ix. 15.
   Blessed be God, who hath not left the gospel without this glory, nor
   the profession of it without this evidence of its power and efficacy!
   Yea, God hath exalted the glory of persecutions and afflictions; for
   many, since they have lost much of their enjoyments by them, and have
   all endangered continually, have abounded in duties of charity beyond
   what they did in the days of their fulness and prosperity. So "out of
   the eater there hath come forth meat." And if the world did but know
   what fruits, in a way of charity and bounty, unto the praise of God and
   glory of the gospel, have been occasioned by their making many poor, it
   would abate of their satisfaction in their successes.

   But with many it is not so. Their minds are so full of earthly things,
   they do so cleave unto them in their affections, that no sense of duty,
   no example of others, no concernment of the glory of God or the gospel,
   can make any impressions on them. If there be yet in them so much life
   and light of grace as to design a deliverance from this woful
   condition, the means insisted on must be made use of.

   Especially this advice is needful unto those who are rich, who have
   large possessions, or abound in the goods of this world. The poor, the
   afflicted, the sorrowful, are prompted from their outward
   circumstances, as well as excited by inward grace, frequently to
   remember and to think of the things above, wherein lies their only
   reserve and relief against the trouble and urgency of their present
   condition; but the enjoyment of these things in abundance is
   accompanied with a twofold evil, lying directly contrary unto this
   duty:--

   A desire of increase and adding thereunto. Earthly enjoyments enlarge
   men's earthly desires, and the love of them grows with their income. A
   moderate stock of waters, sufficient for our use, may be kept within
   ordinary banks; but if a flood be turned into them, they know no
   bounds, but overflow all about them. The increase of wealth and riches
   enlargeth the desires of men after them beyond all bounds of wisdom,
   sobriety, or safety. He that labours hard for his daily bread hath
   seldom such earnest, vehement desires of an addition unto what he hath,
   as many have who already have more than they know how to use or almost
   what to do withal. This they must have more, and the last advantage
   serves for nothing but to stir them up to look out for another. And yet
   such men would, on other accounts, be esteemed good Christians, and
   spiritually minded, as all good Christians are.

   They draw the heart to value and esteem them, as those which bring in
   their satisfaction, and make them to differ from those whom they see to
   be poor and miserable. Now, these things are contrary unto, and, where
   they are habitually prevalent, inconsistent utterly with, being
   spiritually minded. Nor is it possible that any who in the least degree
   are under their power can ever attain deliverance, unless their
   thoughts are fixed upon, and their minds thereby possessed with, due
   apprehensions of invisible things and eternal glory.

   These are some few of those many advantages which we may obtain by
   fixing our thoughts and meditations, and thereby our affections, on the
   things that are above. And there are some things which make me willing
   to give some few directions for the practice of this duty; for whatever
   else we are and do, we neither are nor can be truly spiritually minded,
   whereon life and peace depend, unless we do really exercise our
   thoughts unto meditations of things above. Without it all our religion
   is but vain. And as I fear men are generally wanting and defective
   herein in point of practice, so I do also that many, through the
   darkness of their minds, the weakness of their intellectuals, and
   ignorance of the nature of all things unseen, do seldom set themselves
   unto the contemplation of them. I shall therefore give some few
   directions for the practice of this duty.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter VI.

   Directions unto the exercise of our thoughts on things above, things
   future, invisible, and eternal; on God himself; with the difficulties
   of it, and oppositions unto it, and the way of their removal -- Right
   notions of future glory stated.

   (2.) We have treated in general before of the proper objects of our
   spiritual thoughts as unto our present duty. That which we were last
   engaged in is an especial instance in heavenly things, -- things future
   and invisible, -- with the fountain and spring of them all in Christ
   and God himself. And because men generally are unskilled herein, and
   great difficulties arise in the way of the discharge of this part of
   the duty in hand, I shall give some especial directions concerning
   it:--

   [1.] Possess your minds with right notions and apprehensions of things
   above, and of the state of future glory. We are in this duty to "look
   at the things which are not seen," 2 Cor. iv. 18. It is faith only
   whereby we have a prospect of them; for "we walk by faith, and not by
   sight." And faith can give us no interest in them unless we have due
   apprehensions of them; for it doth but assent and cleave unto the truth
   of what is proposed unto it. And the greatest part of mankind do both
   deceive themselves and feed on ashes in this matter. They fancy a
   future state, which hath no foundation but in their own imaginations.
   Wherefore the apostle, directing us to seek and mind the "things that
   are above," adds, for the guidance of our thoughts, the consideration
   of the principal concernment of them, "where Christ sitteth on the
   right hand of God," Col. iii. 1, 2. He would lead us unto distinct
   apprehensions of those heavenly things, especially of the presence of
   Christ in his exaltation and glory. Wherefore the true notion of these
   things which we are to possess our minds withal may here be
   considered:--

   1st. All that have an apprehension of a future state of happiness do
   agree in this matter, that it contains in it, or is accompanied with, a
   deliverance and freedom from all that is evil. But in what is so they
   are not agreed. Many esteem only those things that are grievous,
   troublesome, wasting and destructive unto nature, to be so; that is,
   what is penal, in pain, sickness, sorrow, loss, poverty, with all kinds
   of outward troubles, and death itself, are evil. Wherefore they suppose
   that the future state of blessedness will free them from all these
   things, if they can attain unto it. This they will lay in the balance
   against the troubles of life, and sometimes, it may be, against the
   pleasures of it, which they must forego; yea, persons profane and
   profligate will, in words at least, profess that heaven will give them
   rest from all their troubles: but it is no place of rest for such
   persons.

   Unto all others also, unto believers themselves, these things are evil,
   such as they expect a deliverance from in heaven and glory. And there
   is no doubt but it is lawful for us and meet that we should contemplate
   on them, as those which will give us a deliverance from all outward
   troubles, death itself, and all that leads thereunto. Heaven is
   promised as "rest" unto them that are "troubled," 2 Thess. i. 7. It is
   our duty, under all our sufferings, reproaches, persecutions, troubles,
   and sorrows, to raise up our minds unto the contemplation of that state
   wherein we shall be freed from them all. It is a blessed notion of
   heaven, that "God shall therein wipe away all tears from our eyes,"
   Rev. vii. 17, or remove far from us all causes of sorrow. And it would
   be unto our advantage if we did accustom our minds more unto this kind
   of relief than we do, -- if, upon the incursion of fears, dangers,
   sorrows, we did more readily retreat unto thoughts of that state
   wherein we shall be freed from them all. Even this most inferior
   consideration of it would render the thoughts of it more familiar, and
   the thing itself more useful unto us. Much better it were than on such
   occasions to be exercised with heartless complaints, uncertain hopes,
   and fruitless contrivances.

   But there is that which, unto them who are truly spiritually minded,
   hath more evil in it than all these things together; and that is sin.
   Heaven is a state of deliverance from sin, from all sin, in all the
   causes, concomitants, and effects of it. He is no true believer unto
   whom sin is not the greatest burden, sorrow, and trouble. Other things,
   as the loss of dear relations, or extraordinary pains, may make deeper
   impressions on the mind, by its natural affections, at some seasons
   than ever our sins did at any one time in any one instance, -- so a man
   may have a greater trouble in sense of pain by a fit of the toothache,
   which will be gone in an hour, than in a hectic fever or consumption,
   which will assuredly take away his life, -- but take in the whole
   course of our lives, and all the actings of our souls, in spiritual
   judgment as well as in natural affection, and I do not understand how a
   man can be a sincere believer unto whom sin is not the greatest burden
   and sorrow.

   Wherefore, in the first place, it belongs unto the true notion of
   heaven, that it is a state wherein we shall be eternally freed from sin
   and all the concernments of it; but only [through] the exaltation of
   the glory of God's grace in Christ by the pardon of it. He that truly
   hates sin and abhors it, whose principal desire and design of life is
   to be freed from it so far as it is possible, who walks in
   self-abasement through a sense of his many disappointments, when he
   hoped it should act in him no more, cannot, as I judge, but frequently
   betake himself for refreshment unto thoughts of that state wherein he
   shall be freed from it, and triumph over it unto eternity. This is a
   notion of heaven that is easily apprehended and fixed on the mind, and
   which we may dwell upon unto the great advantage and satisfaction of
   our souls.

   Frequent thoughts and meditations on heaven under this notion do argue
   a man to be spiritually minded; for it is a convincing evidence that
   sin is a burden unto him, that he longs to be delivered from it and all
   its consequents, that no thoughts are more welcome unto him than those
   of that state wherein sin shall be no more. And although men are
   troubled about their sins, and would desirously be freed from them, so
   far as they perplex their minds and make their consciences uneasy, yet
   if they are not much in the prospect of this relief, if they find not
   refreshment in it, I fear their trouble is not such as it ought to be.
   Wherefore, when men can so wrangle and wrestle with their convictions
   of sin, and yet take up the best of their relief in hopes that it will
   be better with them at some time or other in this world, without
   longing desires after that state wherein sin shall be no more, they can
   give no evidence that they are spiritually minded.

   It is quite otherwise with sincere believers in the exercise of this
   duty. The consideration of the grace and love of God, of the blood of
   Christ, of the purity and holiness of that good Spirit that dwelleth in
   them, of the light, grace, and mercy, which they have attained through
   the promises of the gospel, are those which make the remainders of sin
   most grievous and burdensome unto them. This is that which even breaks
   their hearts, and makes some of them go mourning all the day long, --
   namely, that any thing of that which alone God hates should be found in
   them or be remaining with them. It is, in this condition, an evidence
   that they are spiritually minded, if, together with watchful endeavours
   for the universal mortification of sin, and utter excision of it, both
   root and branch, they constantly add these thoughts of that blessed
   state wherein they shall be absolutely and eternally freed from all
   sin, with refreshment, delight, and complacency.

   These things belong unto our direction for the fixing of our thoughts
   and meditations on things above. This the meanest and weakest person
   who hath the least spark of sincerity and grace is capable of
   apprehending and able to practice; and it is that which the sense they
   have of the evil of sin will put them on every day, if they shut not
   their eyes against the light of the refreshment that is in it. Let them
   who cannot rise in their minds unto fixed and stable thoughts of any
   other notion of these invisible things dwell on this consideration of
   them, wherein they will find no small spiritual advantage and
   refreshment unto their souls.

   2dly. As unto the positive part of this glorious future state, the
   thoughts and apprehensions of men are very various; and that we may
   know as well what to avoid as what to embrace, we shall a little
   reflect on some of them:--

   (1st.) Many are able to entertain no rational conceptions about a
   future state of blessedness and glory, no notions wherein either faith
   or reason is concerned. Imagination they have of something that is
   great and glorious, but what it is they know not. No wonder if such
   persons have no delight in, no use of, thoughts of heaven. When their
   imaginations have fluctuated up and down in all uncertainties for a
   while, they are swallowed up in nothing. Glorious, and therefore
   desirable, they take it for granted that it must be. But nothing can be
   so unto them but what is suitable unto their present dispositions,
   inclinations, and principles; and hereof there is nothing in the true
   spiritual glory of heaven or in the eternal enjoyment of God. These
   things are not suited unto the will of their minds and of the flesh;
   and therefore they cannot rise up unto any constant desires of them.
   Hence, to please themselves, they begin to imagine what is not; but
   whereas what is truly heaven pleaseth them not, and what doth please
   them is not heaven, nor there to be found, they seldom or never
   endeavour in good earnest to exercise their thoughts about it.

   It were well if darkness and ignorance of the true nature of the future
   state and eternal glory did not exceedingly prejudice believers
   themselves as unto their delight in them and meditations about them.
   They have nothing fixed or stated in their minds, which they can betake
   themselves unto in their thoughts when they would contemplate about
   them. And, by the way, whatever doth divert the minds of men from the
   power and life of spiritual worship, as do all pompous solemnities in
   the performance of it, doth greatly hinder them as unto right
   conceptions of a future state. There was a promise of eternal life
   given unto the saints under the old testament; but whereas they were
   obliged unto a worship that was carnal and outwardly pompous, they
   never had clear and distinct apprehensions of the future state of
   glory, for "life and immortality were brought to light by the gospel."
   Wherefore, although no man living can see or find out the infinite
   riches of eternal glory, yet it is the duty of all to be acquainted
   with the nature of it in general, so as that they may have fixed
   thoughts of it, love unto it, earnest desires after it; all under its
   own true and proper notion.

   (2dly.) So great a part of mankind as the Mohammedans, unto whom God
   hath given all the principal and most desirable parts of the world to
   inhabit and possess, do conceive the state of future blessedness to
   consist in the full satisfaction of their sensual lusts and pleasures.
   And evidence this is that the religion which they profess hath no power
   or efficacy on their minds, to change them from the love of sin, or
   from placing their happiness in fulfilling the desires of the flesh. It
   doth not at all enlighten their minds to discern a beauty in spiritual
   things, nor excite their affections unto the love of them, nor free the
   soul to look after blessedness in such things as alone are suited unto
   its rational constitution; for if it did, they would place their
   happiness and blessedness in them. Wherefore, it is nothing but an
   artifice of the god of this world to blind the eyes of men, unto their
   eternal destruction.

   (3dly.) Some of the philosophers of old did attain an apprehension that
   the blessedness of men in another world doth consist in the soul's full
   satisfaction in the goodness and beauty of the divine nature. And there
   is a truth in this notion, which contemplative men have adorned with
   excellent and rational discourses; and sundry who have been and are
   learned among Christians have greatly improved this truth by the light
   of the Scripture. From reason they take up with thoughts of the
   goodness, the amiableness, the self-sufficiency, the all-sufficient
   satisfactoriness of the infinite perfections of the divine nature.
   These things shine in themselves with such a glorious light as that
   there is no more required unto a perception of them but that men do not
   willfully shut their eyes against it through bestial sensuality and
   love of sin. From reason also do they frame their conceptions
   concerning the capacity of the souls of men for the immediate enjoyment
   of God, and what is suited therein unto their utmost blessedness. No
   more is required unto these things but a due consideration of the
   nature of God and man, with our relation unto him and dependence on
   him. By the light of the Scripture they frame these things into that
   which they call the "beatifical vision;" whereby they intend all the
   ways whereby God, in the highest and immediate instances, can and doth
   communicate of himself unto the souls of men, and the utmost elevation
   of their intellectual capacities to receive those communications. It is
   such an intellectual apprehension of the divine nature and perfections,
   with ineffable love, as gives the soul the utmost rest and blessedness
   which its capacities can extend unto.

   These things are so, and they have been by many both piously and
   elegantly illustrated; howbeit they are above the capacities of
   ordinary Christians, -- they know not how to manage them in their
   minds, nor exercise their thoughts about them. They cannot reduce them
   unto present usefulness, nor make them subservient unto the exercise
   and increase of grace. And the truth is, the Scripture gives us another
   notion of heaven and glory, not contrary unto this, not inconsistent
   with it, but more suited unto the faith and experience of believers,
   and which alone can convey a true and useful sense of these things unto
   our minds This, therefore, is diligently to be inquired into, and
   firmly stated in our thoughts and affections.

   (4thly.) The principal notion which the Scripture gives us of the state
   of heavenly blessedness, and which the meanest believers are capable of
   improving in daily practice, is, that faith shall be turned into sight,
   and grace into glory. "We walk by faith, and not by sight," saith the
   apostle, 2 Cor. v. 7. Wherefore, this is the difference between our
   present and our future state, that sight hereafter shall supply the
   room of faith,1 John iii. 2; and if sight come into the place of faith,
   then the object of that sight must be the same with the present object
   of our faith. So the apostle informs us, 1 Cor. xiii. 9, 10, 12, "We
   know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect
   is come, that which is in part shall be done away. For now we see
   through a glass, darkly; but then face to face." Those things which we
   now see darkly, as in a glass, we shall then have an immediate sight
   and full comprehension of; for that which is perfect must come and do
   away that which is in part. What, then, is the principal present object
   of faith as it is evangelical, into whose room sight must succeed? Is
   it not the manifestation of the glory of the infinite wisdom, grace,
   love, kindness, and power of God in Christ, the revelation of the
   eternal counsels of his will and the ways of their accomplishment, unto
   the eternal salvation of the church, in and by him, with the glorious
   exaltation of Christ himself? Wherefore, in the full, satisfactory
   representation of these things unto our souls, received by sight, or a
   direct, immediate intuition of them, doth the glory of heaven
   principally consist. We behold them now darkly, as in a glass, -- that
   is the utmost which by faith we can attain unto; in heaven they shall
   be openly and fully displayed. The infinite, incomprehensible
   excellencies of the divine nature are not proposed in Scripture as the
   immediate object of our faith; nor shall they be so unto sight in
   heaven. The manifestation of them in Christ is the immediate object of
   our faith here, and shall be of our sight hereafter. Only through this
   manifestation of them we are led even by faith ultimately to acquiesce
   in them, as we shall in heaven be led by love perfectly to adhere unto
   them with delight ineffable. This is our immediate objective glory in
   heaven; we hope for no other. And this, if God will, I shall shortly
   more fully explain.

   Whoever live in the exercise of faith, and have any experience of the
   life, power, and sweetness, of these heavenly things, unto whom they
   are a spring of grace and consolation, they are able to meditate on the
   glory of them in their full enjoyment. Think much of heaven, as that
   which will give you a perfect view and comprehension of the wisdom, and
   love, and grace of God in Christ, with those other things which shall
   be immediately declared.

   Some perhaps will be ready to say, that if this be heaven, they can see
   no great glory in it, no such beauty as for which it should be desired.
   It may be so, for some have no instrument to take a view of invisible
   things but carnal imaginations. Some have no light, no principle, no
   disposition of mind or soul, whereunto these things are either
   acceptable or suitable. Some will go no farther in the consideration of
   the divine excellencies of God, and the faculties and actings of our
   souls, than reason will guide them; which may be of use. But we look
   for no other heaven, we desire none, but what we are led unto and
   prepared for by the light of the gospel; that which shall perfect all
   the beginnings of God's grace in us, not what shall be quite of another
   nature and destructive of them. We value not that heaven which is
   equally suited unto the desires and inclinations of the worst of men as
   well as of the best; for we know that they who like not grace here,
   neither do nor can like that which is glory hereafter. No man who is
   not acquainted experimentally, in some measure, with the life, power,
   and evidence of faith here, hath any other heaven in his aim but what
   is erected in his own imagination. The glory of heaven which the gospel
   prepares us for, which faith leads and conducts us unto, which the
   souls of believers long after, as that which will give full rest,
   satisfaction, and complacency, is the full, open, perfect manifestation
   of the glory of the wisdom, goodness, and love of God in Christ, in his
   person and mediation, with the revelation of all his counsels
   concerning them, and the communication of their effects unto us. He
   that likes it not, unto whom it is not desirable, may betake himself
   unto Mohammed's paradise or the philosophers' speculations; in the
   gospel heaven he hath no interest. These are the things which we see
   now darkly, as in a glass, by faith; in the view of them are our souls
   gradually changed into the likeness of God, and the comprehension of
   them is that which shall give us our utmost conformity and likeness
   unto him whereof our natures are capable. In a sense and experience of
   their reality and goodness, given us by the Holy Ghost, do all our
   spiritual consolations and joys consist. The effects produced by them
   in our souls are the first-fruits of glory. Our light, sense,
   experience, and enjoyment of these things, however weak and frequently
   interrupted; our apprehensions of them, however dark and obscure, --
   are the only means whereby we are "made meet for the inheritance of the
   saints in light."

   To have the eternal glory of God in Christ, with all the fruits of his
   wisdom and love, whilst we are ourselves under the full participation
   of the effects of them, immediately, directly revealed, proposed, made
   known unto us, in a divine and glorious light, our souls being
   furnished with a capacity to behold and perfectly comprehend them, --
   this is the heaven which, according unto God's promise, we look for.
   But, as was said, these things shall be elsewhere more fully treated
   of.

   It is true that there are sundry other things in particular that belong
   unto this state of glory; but what we have mentioned is the fountain
   and spring of them all. We can never have an immediate enjoyment of God
   in the immensity of his nature, nor can any created understanding
   conceive any such thing. God's communications of himself unto us and
   our enjoyment of him shall be in and by the manifestation of his glory
   in Christ. He who can see no glory, who is sensible of no blessedness,
   in these things, is a stranger unto that heaven which the Scripture
   reveals and which faith leads unto.

   It may be inquired, What is the subjective glory, or what change is to
   be wrought in ourselves that we may enjoy this glory? Now, that
   consists principally as unto our souls, in the perfection of all grace
   which is initially wrought and subjectively resides in us in this
   world. The grace which we have here shall not be done away as unto its
   essence and nature, though somewhat of it shall cease as unto the
   manner of its operation. What soul could think with joy of going to
   heaven, if thereby he must lose all his present light, faith, and love
   of God, though he be told that he should receive that in lieu of them
   which is more excellent, whereof he hath no experience, nor can
   understand of what nature it is? When the saints enter into rest, their
   good works do follow them; and how can they do so if their grace do not
   accompany them, from whence they proceed? The perfection of our present
   graces, which are here weak and interrupted in their operations, is a
   principal eminency of the state of glory. Faith shall be heightened
   into vision, as was proved before; which doth not destroy its nature,
   but cause it to cease as unto its manner of operation towards things
   invisible. If a man have a weak, small faith in this life, with little
   evidence and no assurance, so that he doubts of all things, questions
   all things, and hath no comfort from what he doth believe; if
   afterward, through supplies of grace, he hath a mighty prevailing
   evidence of the things believed, is filled with comfort and assurance;
   this is not by a faith or grace of another kind than what he had
   before, but by the same faith raised unto a higher degree of
   perfection. When our Saviour cured the blind man and gave him his
   sight, Mark viii., at first he saw all things obscurely and
   imperfectly, -- he saw "men as trees, walking," verse 24; but on
   another application of virtue unto him, "he saw every man clearly,"
   verse 25. It was not a sight of another kind which he then received
   than what he had at first; only its imperfection, whereby he "saw men
   as trees, walking," was taken away. Nor will our perfect vision of
   things above be a grace absolutely of another kind from the light of
   faith which we here enjoy; only what is imperfect in it will be done
   away, and it will be made meet for the present enjoyment of things here
   at a distance and invisible. Love shall have its perfection also, and
   the least alteration in its manner of operation of any grace whatever;
   and there is nothing that should more excite us to labour after a
   growth in love to God in Christ than this, that it shall to all
   eternity be the same in its nature and in all its operations, only both
   the one and the other shall be made absolutely perfect. The soul will
   by it be enabled to cleave unto God unchangeably, with eternal delight,
   satisfaction, and complacency. Hope shall be perfect in enjoyment,
   which is all the perfection it is capable of. So shall it be as unto
   other graces.

   This subjective perfection of our nature, especially in all the
   faculties, powers, and affections of our souls and all their
   operations, belongs unto our blessedness, nor can we be blessed without
   it. All the objective glory in heaven would not, in our beholding and
   enjoyment of it (if it were possible), make us blessed and happy, if
   our own natures were not made perfect, freed from all disorder,
   irregular motions, and weak, imperfect operations. What is it, then,
   that must give our natures this subjective perfection? It is that grace
   alone whose beginnings we are here made partakers of; for therein
   consists the renovation of the image of God in us, and the perfect
   communication of that image unto us is the absolute perfection of our
   natures, the utmost which their capacity is suited unto. And this gives
   us the last thing to be inquired into, -- namely, by what means in
   ourselves we shall eternally abide in that state; and this is, by the
   unalterable adherence of our whole souls unto God, in perfect love and
   delight. This is that whereby alone the soul reacheth unto the essence
   of God, and the infinite, incomprehensible perfections of his nature.
   For the perfect nature hereof, divine revelation hath left it under a
   veil, and so must we do also; nor do I designedly handle these things
   in this place, but only in the way of a direction how to exercise our
   thoughts about them.

   This is the notion of heaven which those who are spiritually minded
   ought to be conversant withal; and the true stating of it by faith is a
   discriminating character of believers. This is no heaven unto any
   others. Those who have not an experience of the excellency of these
   things in their initial state in this world, and their incomparable
   transcendency unto all other things, cannot conceive how heavenly glory
   and blessedness should consist in them. Unskilful men may cast away
   rough unwrought diamonds as useless stones; they know not what
   polishing will bring them unto. Nor do men unskilful in the mysteries
   of godliness judge there can be any glory in rough unwrought grace;
   they know not what lustre and beauty the polishing of the heavenly hand
   will give unto it.

   It is generally supposed that however men differ in and about religion
   here, yet they agree well enough about heaven; they would all go to the
   same heaven. But it is a great mistake; they differ in nothing more;
   they would not all go to the same heaven. How few are they who value
   that heavenly state which we have treated of, or do understand how any
   blessedness can consist in the enjoyment of it! But this, and no other
   heaven, would we go unto. Other notions there may be, there are of it;
   which being but fruits and effects of men's own imaginations, the more
   they dwell in the contemplation of them, the more carnal they may grow,
   at best the more superstitious. But spiritual thoughts of this heaven,
   consisting principally in freedom from all sin, in the perfection of
   all grace, in the vision of the glory of God in Christ, and all the
   excellencies of the divine nature as manifested in him, are an
   effectual means for the improvement of spiritual life and the increase
   of all graces in us; for they cannot but effect an assimilation in the
   mind and heart unto the things contemplated on, when the principles and
   seeds of them are already inlaid and begun. This is our first
   direction.

   2. Having fixed right notions and apprehensions of heavenly things in
   our minds, it is our duty to think and contemplate greatly on them and
   our own concernment in them. Without this all our speculations
   concerning the nature of eternal things will be of no use unto us. And
   unto your encouragement and direction take these few short rules
   relating unto this duty:-- 1st. Here lies the great trial whether we
   are spiritually minded or no, by virtue of this rule, "If we are risen
   with Christ, we will mind the things that are above," Col. iii. 1.
   2dly. Here lies the great means whereby we may attain farther degrees
   in that blessed frame of mind, if it be already formed in us, by virtue
   of that rule, "Beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, we are
   changed into the same image from glory to glory," 2 Cor. iii. 18. 3dly.
   Here lies the great evidence whether we have a real interest in the
   things above or no, whether we place our portion and blessedness in
   them, by virtue of that rule, "Where our treasure is, there will our
   hearts be also." Are they our treasure, our portion, our reward, in
   comparison whereof all other things are "but loss and dung?" -- we
   shall assuredly be conversant in our minds about them. 4thly. It cannot
   be imagined that a man should have in him a principle cognate and
   suited unto things above, of the same kind and nature with them, that
   his soul should be under the conduct of those habits of grace which
   strive and naturally tend unto perfection, labouring greatly here under
   the weight of their own weaknesses, as it is with all who are truly
   spiritually minded, and yet not have his thoughts greatly exercised
   about these things, 1 John iii. 2, 3.

   It were well if we would try ourselves by things of so uncontrollable
   evidence. What can any object unto the truth of these things or the
   necessity of this duty? If it be otherwise with us, it is from one of
   these two causes:-- either we are not convinced of the truth and
   reality of them, or we have no delight in them because we are not
   spiritually minded. Do we think that men may turmoil themselves in
   earthly thoughts all the day long, and, when they are freed of their
   affairs, betake themselves unto those that are vain and useless,
   without any stated converse with things above, and yet enjoy life and
   peace? We must take other measures of things if we intend to live unto
   God, to be like him, and to come unto the enjoyment of him.

   What is the matter with men that they are so stupid? They all generally
   desire to go to heaven, at least when they can live here no longer.
   Some, indeed, have no other regard unto it but only that they would not
   go to hell. But most would "die the death of the righteous," and have
   their "latter end like his;" yet few there are who endeavour to attain
   a right notion of it, to try how it is suited unto their principles and
   desires, but content themselves with such general notions of it as
   please their imaginations. It is no wonder if such persons seldom
   exercise their minds or thoughts about it; nor do they so much as
   pretend to be spiritually minded. But as for those who are instructed
   in these things, who profess their chiefest interest to lie in them,
   not to abound in meditation concerning them, it argues, indeed, that
   whatever they profess, they are earthly and carnal.

   [3.] Again; meditate and think of the glory of heaven so as to compare
   it with the opposite state of death and eternal misery. Few men care to
   think much of hell, and the everlasting torments of the wicked therein.
   Those do so least who are in the most danger of falling thereinto. They
   put far from them the evil day, and suppose their covenant with death
   and hell to be sure. Some begin to advance an opinion that there is no
   such place; because it is their interest and desire that there should
   be none. Some, out of profaneness, make a scoff at it, as though a
   future judgment were but a fable. Most seem to think that there is a
   severity in thoughts about it, which it is not fit we should be too
   much terrified withal. Some transient thoughts they will have of it,
   but [they do] not suffer them to abide in their minds, lest they should
   be too much discomposed; or they think it not consistent with the
   goodness of Christ to leave any men in that condition, whereas there is
   more spoken directly of hell, its torments and their eternity, by
   himself than in all the Scripture besides. These thoughts, in most,
   proceed from an unwillingness to be troubled in their sins, and are
   useful unto none. It is the height of folly for men to endeavour the
   hiding of themselves for a few moments from that which is unavoidably
   coming upon them unto eternity, and the due consideration whereof is a
   means for an escape from it. But I speak only of true believers; and
   the more they are conversant in their thoughts about the future state
   of eternal misery, the greater evidence they have of the life and
   confidence of faith. It is a necessary duty to consider it, as what we
   were by nature obnoxious unto, as being "children of wrath;" what we
   have deserved by our personal sins, as "the wages of sin is death;"
   what we are delivered from through Jesus the deliverer, who "saves us
   from the wrath to come;" what expression it is of the indignation of
   God against sin, who hath "ordained Tophet of old," -- that we may be
   delivered from sin, kept up to an abhorrency of it, walking in
   humility, self-abasement, and the admiration of divine grace. This,
   therefore, is required of us, that in our thoughts and meditations we
   compare the state of blessedness and eternal glory, as a free and
   absolute effect of the grace of God in and through Christ Jesus, with
   that state of eternal misery which we had deserved; and if there be any
   spark of grace or of holy thankfulness in our hearts, it will be
   stirred up unto its due exercise.

   Some, it may be, will say that they complained before that they cannot
   get their minds fixed on these things. Weakness, weariness, darkness,
   diversions, occasions, do prevalently obstruct their abiding in such
   thoughts. I shall speak farther unto this afterward. At present I shall
   only suggest two things:-- First, If you cannot attain, yet continue to
   follow after. Get your minds in a perpetual endeavour after an abode in
   spiritual thoughts. Let your minds be rising towards them every hour,
   yea, a hundred times a day, on all occasions, in a continual sense of
   duty; and sigh within yourselves for deliverance when you find
   disappointments, or a not-continuance in them. It is the sense of that
   place, Rom. viii. 23-26. Secondly, Take care you go not backwards and
   lose what you have wrought. If you neglect these things for a season,
   you will quickly find yourselves neglected by them. So I observe it
   every day in the hearing of the word. Whilst persons keep up themselves
   to a diligent attendance on it, where they find it preached unto their
   edification, they find great delight in it, and will undergo great
   difficulties for the enjoyment of it; -- let them be diverted from it
   for a season, after a while it grows indifferent unto them; any thing
   will satisfy them that pretends unto the same duty.

Chapter VII.

   Especial objects of spiritual thoughts on the glorious state of heaven,
   and what belongs thereunto -- First, of Christ himself -- Thoughts of
   heavenly glory in opposition unto thoughts of eternal misery -- The use
   of such thoughts -- Advantage in sufferings.

   It will be unto our advantage, having stated right notions of the glory
   of the blessed state above in our minds, to fix on some particulars
   belonging unto it as the especial objects of our thoughts and
   meditations. As, --

   I. Think much of him who unto us is the life and centre of all the
   glory of heaven; that is, Christ himself. I shall be very brief in
   treating hereof, because I have designed a peculiar treatise on this
   subject, of beholding the glory of Christ, both here and unto eternity.
   [1] At present, therefore, a few things only shall be mentioned,
   because on this occasion they are not to be omitted. The whole of the
   glory of the state above is expressed by being "ever with the Lord,
   where he is, to behold his glory;" for in and through him is the
   beatifical manifestation of God and his glory made for evermore, and
   through him are all communications of inward glory unto us. The present
   resplendency of heavenly glory consists in his mediatory ministry, as I
   have at large elsewhere declared; [2] and he will be the means of
   all-glorious communications between God and the church unto eternity.

   Wherefore, if we are spiritually minded, we should fix our thoughts on
   Christ above, as the centre of all heavenly glory. To help us herein,
   we may consider the things that follow:--

   1. Faith hath continual recourse unto him, on the account of what he
   did and suffered for us in this world; for thereon pardon of sin,
   justification, and peace with God, do depend. This ariseth, in the
   first place, from a sense of our own wants. But love of him is no less
   necessary unto us than faith in him; and although we have powerful
   motives unto love from what he did and was in this world, yet the
   formal reason of our adherence unto him thereby is what he is in
   himself as he is now exalted in heaven. If we rejoice not at the
   remembrance of his present glory, if the thoughts of it be not frequent
   with us and refreshing unto us, how dwelleth his love in us?

   2. Our hope is that ere long we shall be ever with him; and if so, it
   is certainly our wisdom and duty to be here with him as much as we can.
   It is a vain thing for any to suppose that they place their chiefest
   happiness in being for ever in the presence of Christ, who care not at
   all to be with him here as they may. And the only way of our being
   present with him here is, by faith and love acting themselves in
   spiritual thoughts and affections. And it is an absurd thing for men to
   esteem themselves Christians who scarce think of Christ all the day
   long; yet some, as one complained of old, scarce ever think or speak of
   him but when they swear by his name. I have read of them who have lived
   and died in continual contemplation on him, so far as the imperfection
   of our present state will admit; I have known them, I do know them, who
   call themselves unto a reproof if at any time he hath been many minutes
   out of their thoughts; and it is strange that it should be otherwise
   with them who love him in sincerity. Yet I wish I did not know more who
   give evidences that it is a rare thing for them to be exercised in
   serious thoughts and meditations about him; yea, there are some who are
   not averse upon occasions to speak of God, of mercy, of pardon, of his
   power and goodness, who, if you mention Christ unto them, with any
   thing of faith, love, trust in him, they seem unto them as a strange
   thing. Few there are who are sensible of any religion beyond what is
   natural. The things of the wisdom and power of God in Christ are
   foolishness unto them. Take some directions for the discharge of this
   duty:-- In your thoughts of Christ, be very careful that they are
   conceived and directed according to the rule of the word, lest you
   deceive your own souls, and give up the conduct of your affections unto
   vain imaginations. Spiritual notions befalling carnal minds did once,
   by the means of superstition, ruin the power of religion. A conviction
   men had that they must think much of Jesus Christ, and that this would
   make them conformable unto him; but having no real evangelical faith,
   nor the wisdom of faith to exercise it in their thoughts and affections
   in a due manner, nor understanding what it was to be truly like unto
   him, they gave up themselves unto many foolish inventions and
   imaginations, by which they thought to express their love and
   conformity unto him. They would have images of him, which they would
   embrace, adore, and bedew with their tears. They would have crucifixes,
   as they called them, which they would carry about them, and wear next
   unto their hearts, as if they resolved to lodge Christ always in their
   bosoms. They would go in pilgrimage to the place where he died and rose
   again, through a thousand dangers, and purchase a feigned chip of a
   tree whereon he suffered, at the price of all they had in the world.
   They would endeavour, by long thoughtfulness, lastings, and watchings,
   to cast their souls into raptures and ecstasies, wherein they fancied
   themselves in his presence. They came at last to make themselves like
   him, in getting impressions of wounds on their sides, their hands, and
   feet. Unto all these things, and sundry others of a like nature and
   tendency, did superstition abuse and corrupt the minds of men, from a
   pretence of a principle of truth; for there is no more certain gospel
   truth than this, that believers ought continually to contemplate on
   Christ by the actings of faith in their thoughts and affections, and
   that thereby they are changed and transformed into his image, 2 Cor.
   iii. 18. And we are not to forego our duty because other men have been
   mistaken in theirs, nor part with practical, fundamental principles of
   religion because they have been abused by superstition. But we may see
   herein how dangerous it is to depart in any thing from the conduct of
   Scripture light and rule, when for want thereof the best and most noble
   endeavours of the minds of men, even to love Christ and to be like unto
   him, do issue in provocations of the highest nature.

   Pray, therefore, that you may be kept unto the truth in all things, by
   a diligent attendance unto the only rule thereof and conscientious
   subjection of soul unto the authority of God in it; for we ought not to
   suffer our affections to be entangled with the paint or artificial
   beauty of any way or means of giving our love unto Christ which are not
   warranted by the word of truth. Yet I must say that I had rather be
   among them who, in the actings of their love and affection unto Christ,
   do fall into some irregularities and excesses in the manner of
   expressing it (provided their worship of him be neither superstitious
   nor idolatrous), than among those who, professing themselves to be
   Christians, do almost disavow their having any thoughts of or affection
   unto the person of Christ. But there is no need that we should
   foolishly run into either of these extremes. God hath in the Scripture
   sufficiently provided against them both. He hath both showed us the
   necessity of our diligent acting of faith and love on the person of
   Christ, and hath limited out the way and means whereby we may so do;
   and let our designs be what they will, where in any thing we depart
   from his prescriptions, we are not under the conduct of his Spirit, and
   so are sure to lose all that we do.

   Wherefore, two things are required that we may thus think of Christ and
   meditate on him according to the mind and will of God:-- (1.) That the
   means of bringing him to mind be what God hath promised and appointed.
   (2.) That the continued proposal of him as the object of our thoughts
   and meditations be of the same kind. For both these ends the
   superstitious minds of men invented the ways of images and crucifixes,
   with their appurtenances, before mentioned; and this rendered all their
   devotion an abomination. That which tends unto these ends among
   believers is the promise of the Spirit and the institutions of the
   word. Would you, then, think of Christ as you ought, take these two
   directions:-- (1.) Pray that the Holy Spirit may abide with you
   continually, to mind you of him; which he will do in all in whom he
   doth abide, for it belongs unto his office. (2.) For more fixed
   thoughts and meditations, take some express place of Scripture wherein
   he is set forth and proposed, either in his person, office, or grace,
   unto you, Gal. iii. 1.

   3. This duty lies at the foundation of all that blessed communion and
   intercourse that is between Jesus Christ and the souls of believers.
   This, I confess, is despised by some, and the very notion of it
   esteemed ridiculous; but they do therein no leas than renounce
   Christianity, and turn the Lord Christ into an idol, that neither
   knoweth, seeth, nor heareth. But I speak unto them who are not utter
   strangers unto the life of faith, who know not what religion is unless
   they have real spiritual intercourse and communion with the Lord Christ
   thereby. Consider this, therefore, as it is in particular exemplified
   in the book of Canticles. There is not one instance of it to be found
   which doth not suppose a continued thoughtfulness of him. And in answer
   unto them, as they are actings of faith and love, wherein he is
   delighted, doth he by his Spirit insinuate into our minds and hearts a
   gracious sense of his own love, kindness, and relation unto us. The
   great variety wherein these things are mutually carried on between him
   and the church, the singular endearments which ensue thereon, and
   blessed estate in rest and complacency, do make up the substance of
   that holy discourse. No thoughts of Christ, then, proceeding from
   faith, accompanied with love and delight, shall be lost. They that sow
   this seed shall return with their sheaves; Christ will meet them with
   gracious intimations of his acceptance of them and delight in them, and
   return a sense of his own love unto them. He never will be, he never
   was, behind with any poor soul in returns of love. Those gracious and
   blessed promises which he hath made of "coming unto them" that believe
   in him, of "making his abode with them," and of "supping with them," --
   all expressions of a gracious presence and intimate communion, -- do
   all depend on this duty. Wherefore, we may consider three things
   concerning these thoughts of Christ:-- (1.) That they are exceeding
   acceptable unto him, as the best pledges of our cordial affection:
   Cant. ii. 14, "O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the
   secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear
   thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely." When
   a soul through manifold discouragements and despondencies withdraws,
   and as it were hides itself from him, he calleth to see a poor,
   weeping, blubbered face, and to hear a broken voice, that scarce goes
   beyond sighs and groans. (2.) These thoughts are the only means whereby
   we comply with the gracious invitations of his love mentioned before.
   By them do we hear his knocking, know his voice, and open the door of
   our hearts to give him entrance, that he may abide and sup with us.
   Sometimes, indeed, the soul is surprised into acts of gracious
   communion with Christ, Cant. vi. 12; but they are not to be expected
   unless we abide in those ways and means which prepare and make our
   souls meet for the reception and entertainment of him. Wherefore, (3.)
   Our want of experience in the power of this holy intercourse and
   communion with Christ ariseth principally from our defect in this duty.
   I have known one who, after a long profession of faith and holiness,
   fell into great darkness and distress merely on this account, that he
   did not experience in himself the sweetness, life, and power, of the
   testimonies given concerning the real communications of the love of
   Christ unto, and the intimation of his presence with, believers. He
   knew well enough the doctrine of it, but did not feel the power of it;
   at least he understood there was more in it than he had experience of.
   God carried him by faith through that darkness, but taught him withal
   that no sense of these things was to be let in to the soul but by
   constant thoughtfulness and contemplations on Christ. How many blessed
   visits do we lose by not being exercised unto this duty! See Cant. v.
   1-3. Sometimes we are busy, sometimes careless and negligent, sometimes
   slothful, sometimes under the power of temptations, so that we neither
   inquire after nor are ready to receive them. This is not the way to
   have our joys abound.

   4. Again (I speak now with especial respect unto him in heaven); the
   glory of his presence, as God and man eternally united; the discharge
   of his mediatory office, as he is at the right hand of God; the glory
   of his present acting for the church, as he is the minister of the
   sanctuary and the true tabernacle which God hath fixed and not man; the
   love, power, and efficacy of his intercession, whereby he takes care
   for the accomplishment of the salvation of the church; the approach of
   his glorious coming unto judgment, -- are to be the objects of our
   daily thoughts and meditations. Let us not mistake ourselves. To be
   spiritually minded is, not to have the notion and knowledge of
   spiritual things in our minds; it is not to be constant, no, nor to
   abound, in the performance of duties: both which may be where there is
   no grace in the heart at all. It is to have our minds really exercised
   with delight about heavenly things, the things that are above,
   especially Christ himself as at the right hand of God.

   5. Again; so think of eternal things as continually to lay them in the
   balance against all the sufferings of this life. This use of it I have
   spoken unto somewhat before, and it is necessary it should be pressed
   upon all occasions. It is very probable that we shall yet suffer more
   than we have done. Those who have gone before us have done so; it is
   foretold in the Scripture that if we will live godly in Christ Jesus we
   must do so; we stand in need of it, and the world is prepared to bring
   it on us. And as we must suffer, so it is necessary, unto the glory of
   God and our own salvation, that we suffer in a due manner. Mere
   sufferings will neither commend us unto God nor any way advantage our
   own souls. When we suffer according to the will of God, it is an
   eminent grace, gift, and privilege, Phil. i. 29. But many things are
   required hereunto. It is not enough that men suppose themselves to
   suffer for conscience' sake, -- though if we do not so suffer all our
   sufferings are in vain; nor is it enough that we suffer for this or
   that way of profession in religion, which we esteem to be true and
   according to the mind of God, in opposition unto what is not so. The
   glory of sufferings on these accounts solely hath been much sullied in
   the days wherein we live. It is evident that persons, out of a natural
   courage, accompanied with deep radicate persuasions, and having their
   minds influenced with some sinister ends, may undergo things hard and
   difficult in giving testimony unto what is not according to the mind of
   God. Examples we have had hereof in all ages, and in that wherein we
   live in an especial manner. See 1 Pet. iv. 14-16. We have had enough to
   take off all paint and appearance of honour from them who in their
   sufferings are deceived in what they profess. But men may from the same
   principles suffer for what is indeed according to the mind of God, yea,
   may give their bodies to be burned therein, and yet not to his glory
   nor their own eternal advantage. Wherefore we are duly to consider all
   things that are requisite to make our sufferings acceptable unto God
   and honourable unto the gospel.

   I have observed in many a frame of spirit with respect unto sufferings
   that I never saw good event of when it was tried to the uttermost.
   Boldness, confidence, a pretended contempt of hardships, and scorning
   other men whom they suppose defective in these things, are the garments
   or livery they wear on this occasion. Such principles may carry men out
   in a bad cause, they will never do so in a good cause. Evangelical
   truth will not be honourably witnessed unto but by evangelical grace.
   Distrust of ourselves, a due apprehension of the nature of the evils to
   be undergone and of our own frailty, with continual prayers to be
   delivered from them or supported under them, and prudent care to avoid
   them without an inroad on conscience or neglect of duty, are much
   better preparations for an entrance into a state of suffering. Many
   things belong unto our learning aright this first and last lesson of
   the gospel, namely, of bearing the cross, or undergoing all sorts of
   sufferings for the profession of it; but they belong not unto our
   present occasion. This only is that which we now press as an evidence
   of our sincerity in our sufferings, and an effectual means to enable us
   cheerfully to undergo them, which is, to have such a continual prospect
   of the future state of glory as to lay it in the balance against all
   that we may undergo; for, --

   1. To have our minds filled and possessed with thoughts thereof will
   give us an alacrity in our entrance into sufferings in a way of duty.
   Other considerations will offer themselves unto our relief, which will
   quickly fade and disappear. They are like a cordial water, which gives
   a little relief for a season, and then leaves the spirits to sink
   beneath what they were before it was taken. Some relieve themselves
   from the consideration of the nature of their sufferings; they are not
   so great but that they may conflict with them and come off with safety.
   But there is nothing of that kind so small as will not prove too hard
   and strong for us unless we have especial assistance. Some do the same
   from their duration; they are but for ten days or six months, and then
   they shall be free; -- some from the compassion and esteem of men.
   These and the like considerations are apt to occur unto the minds of
   all sorts of persons, whether they are spiritually minded or no. But
   when our minds are accustomed unto thoughts of the "glory that shall be
   revealed," we shall cheerfully entertain every way and path that leads
   thereunto, as suffering for the truth doth in a peculiar manner.
   Through this medium we may look cheerfully and comfortably on the loss
   of name, reputation, goods, liberty, life itself, as knowing in
   ourselves that we have better and more abiding comforts to betake
   ourselves unto. And we can no other way glorify God by our alacrity in
   the entrance of sufferings than when it ariseth from a prospect into
   and valuation of those invisible things which he hath promised as an
   abundant recompense for all we can lose in this world.

   2. The great aggravation of sufferings is their long continuance,
   without any rational appearance or hope of relief. Many who have
   entered into sufferings with much courage and resolution have been
   wearied and worn out with their continuance. Elijah himself was hereby
   reduced to pray that God would take away his life, to put an end unto
   his ministry and calamities. And not a few in all ages have been hereby
   so broken in their natural spirits, and so shaken in the exercise of
   faith, as that they have lost the glory of their confession, in seeking
   deliverance by sinful compliances in the denial of truth. And although
   this may be done out of mere weariness (as it is the design of Satan to
   "wear out the saints of the Most High"), with reluctance of mind, and a
   love yet remaining unto the truth in their hearts, yet hath it
   constantly one of these two effects:-- Some, by the overwhelming sorrow
   that befalls them on the account of their failure in profession, and
   out of a deep sense of their unkindness unto the Lord Jesus, are
   stirred up immediately unto higher acts of confession than ever they
   were before engaged in, and unto a higher provocation of their
   adversaries, until their former troubles are doubled upon them, which
   they frequently undergo with great satisfaction. Instances of this
   nature occur in all stories of great persecutions. Others being cowed
   and discouraged in their profession, and perhaps neglected by them
   whose duty it was rather to restore them, have by the craft of Satan
   given place to their declensions, and become vile apostates. To prevent
   these evils, arising from the duration of sufferings without a prospect
   of deliverance, nothing is more prevalent than a constant contemplation
   on the future reward and glory. So the apostle declares it, Heb. xi.
   35. When the mind is filled with the thoughts of the unseen glories of
   eternity, it hath in readiness what to lay in the balance against the
   longest continuance and duration of sufferings, which in comparison
   thereunto, at their utmost extent, are "but for a moment."

   I have insisted the longer on these things, because they are the
   peculiar objects of the thoughts of them that are indeed spiritually
   minded.

Chapter VIII.

   Spiritual thoughts of God himself -- The opposition unto them and
   neglect of them, with their causes and the way of their prevalency --
   Predominant corruptions expelling due thoughts of God, how to be
   discovered, etc. -- Thoughts of God, of what nature, and what they are
   to be accompanied withal, etc.

   II. I have spoken very briefly unto the first particular instance of
   the heavenly things that we are to fix our thoughts upon, namely, the
   person of Christ; and I have done it on the reason before mentioned,
   namely, that I intend a peculiar treatise on that subject, or an
   inquiry how we may behold the glory of Christ in this life, and how we
   shall do so unto eternity. That which I have reserved unto the last
   place, as unto the exercise of their thoughts about who are spiritually
   minded, is that which is the absolute foundation and spring of all
   spiritual things, namely, God himself. He is the fountain whence all
   these things proceed, and the ocean wherein they issue; he is their
   centre and circumference, wherein they all begin, meet, and end. So the
   apostle issues his profound discourse of the counsels of the divine
   will and mysteries of the gospel, Rom. xi. 36, "Of him, and through
   him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever." All things
   arise from his power, and are all disposed by his wisdom into a
   tendency unto his glory: "Of him, and through him, and to him, are all
   things." Under that consideration alone are they to be the objects of
   our spiritual meditation, -- namely, as they come from him and tend
   unto him. All other things are finite and limited, but they begin and
   end in that which is immense and infinite. So God is "all in all." He
   therefore is, or ought to be, the only supreme, absolute object of our
   thoughts and desires; other things are from and for him only. When our
   thoughts do not either immediately and directly, or mediately and by
   just consequence, tend unto and end in him, they are not spiritual, 1
   Pet. i. 21.

   To make way for directions how to exercise our thoughts on God himself,
   something must be premised concerning a sinful defect herein, with the
   causes of it:--

   First, it is the great character of a man presumptuously and
   flagitiously wicked that "God is not in all his thoughts," Ps. iv.;
   that is, he is in none of them. And of this want of thoughts of God
   there are many degrees, for all wicked men are not equally so forgetful
   of him:--

   1. Some are under the power of atheistical thoughts. They deny or
   question, or do not avowedly acknowledge, the very being of God. This
   is the height of what the enmity of the carnal mind can rise unto. To
   acknowledge God, and yet to refuse to be subject to his law or will, a
   man would think were as bad, if not worse, than to deny the being of
   God; but it is not so. That is a rebellion against his authority, this
   a hatred unto the only Fountain of all goodness, truth, and being; and
   that because they cannot own it but withal they must acknowledge it to
   be infinitely righteous, holy, and powerful, which would destroy all
   their desires and security. Such may be the person in the psalm; for
   the words may be read, "All his thoughts are that there is no God:"
   howbeit the context describes him as one who rather despiseth his
   providence than denieth his being. But such there are, whom the same
   psalmist elsewhere brands for fools, though themselves seem to suppose
   that wisdom was born and will die with them, Ps. xiv. 1, liii. 1.

   It may be, never any age since the flood did more abound with open
   atheism, among such as pretended unto the use and improvement of
   reason, than that wherein we live. Among the ancient civilized heathen,
   we hear ever and anon of a person branded for an atheist, yet we are
   not certain whether it was done justly or no; but in all nations of
   Europe at this day, cities, courts, towns, fields, armies, abound with
   persons who, if any credit may be given unto what they say or do,
   believe not that there is a God. And the reason hereof may be a little
   inquired into.

   Now this is no other, in general, but that men have decocted and wasted
   the light and power of Christian religion. It is the fullest revelation
   of God that ever he made; it is the last that ever he will make in this
   world. If this be despised, if men rebel against the light of it, if
   they break the cords of it, and are senseless of its power, nothing can
   preserve them from the highest atheism that the nature of man is
   capable of. It is in vain to expect relief or preservation from
   inferior means when the highest and most noble are rejected. Reason or
   the light of nature gives evidences unto the being of God, and
   arguments are still well pleaded from them to the confusion of
   atheists; and they were sufficient to retain men in an acknowledgment
   of the divine power and Godhead who had no other, no higher evidences
   of them. But where men have had the benefit of divine revelation, where
   they have been educated in the principles of Christian religion, have
   had some knowledge and made some profession of them, and have, through
   the love of sin and hatred of every thing that is truly good, rejected
   all convictions from them concerning the being, power, and rule of God,
   they will not be kept unto a confession of them by any considerations
   that the light of nature can suggest.

   There are therefore, among others, three reasons why there are more
   atheists among them who live where the Christian religion is professed
   and the power of it rejected, than among any other sort of men, even
   than there were among the heathens themselves:--

   (1.) God hath designed to magnify his word above all his name, or all
   other ways of the revelation of himself unto the children of men, Ps.
   cxxxviii. 2. Where, therefore, this is rejected and despised, he will
   not give the honour unto reason or the light of nature, that they shall
   preserve the minds of men from any evil whatever. Reason shall not have
   the same power and efficacy on the minds of men who reject the light
   and power of divine revelation by the word, as it hath or may have on
   them whose best guide it is, who never enjoyed the light of the gospel;
   and therefore there is ofttimes more common honesty among civilized
   heathens and Mohammedans than amongst degenerate Christians; and for
   the same reason the children of professors are sometimes irrecoverably
   profligate. It will be said, "Many are recovered unto God by
   afflictions who have despised the word." But it is otherwise. Never any
   were converted unto God by afflictions who had rejected the word. Men
   may by afflictions be recalled unto the light of the word, but none are
   immediately turned unto God by them; -- as a good shepherd, when a
   sheep wanders from the flock, and will not hear his call, sends out his
   dog, which steps him and bites him; hereon he looks about him, and,
   hearing the call of the shepherd, returns again to the flock, Job
   xxxiii. 19-25. But with this sort of persons it is the way of God, that
   when the principal means of the revelation of himself, and wherein he
   doth most glorify his wisdom and his goodness, are despised, he will
   not only take off the efficacy of inferior means, but judicially harden
   the hearts and blind the eyes of men, that such means shall be of no
   use unto them. See Isa. vi. 9, 10; Acts xiii. 40, 41; Rom. i. 21, 28; 2
   Thess. ii. 11, 12.

   (2.) The contempt of gospel light and Christian religion, as it is
   supernatural (which is the beginning of transgression unto all atheists
   among us), begets in and leaves on the mind such a depraved, corrupt
   habit, such a congeries of all evils that the hatred of the goodness,
   wisdom, and grace of God can produce, that it cannot but be wholly
   inclined unto the worst of evils, as all our original vicious
   inclinations succeeded immediately on our rejection and loss of the
   image of God. The best things, corrupted, yield the worst savour; as
   manna stunk and bred worms. The knowledge of the gospel being rejected,
   stinking worms take the place of it in the mind, which grow into vipers
   and scorpions. Every degree of apostasy from gospel truth brings in a
   proportionate degree of inclination unto wickedness into the hearts and
   minds of men, 2 Pet. ii. 21; and that which is total, unto all the
   evils that they are capable of in this world. Whereas, therefore,
   multitudes, from their darkness, unbelief, temptation, love of sin,
   pride and contempt of God, do fall off from all subjection of soul and
   conscience unto the gospel, either notionally or practically, deriding
   or despising all supernatural revelations, they are a thousand times
   more disposed unto downright atheism than persons who never had the
   light or benefit of such revelations. Take heed of decays! Whatever
   ground the gospel loseth in our minds, sin possesseth it for itself and
   its own ends.

   Let none say it is otherwise with them. Men grow cold and negligent in
   the duties of gospel worship, public and private; which is to reject
   gospel light. Let them say and pretend what they please, that in other
   things, in their minds and conversations, it is well with them: indeed
   it is not so. Sin will, sin doth, one way or other, make an increase in
   them proportionate unto these decays, and will sooner or later discover
   itself so to do; and themselves, if they are not utterly hardened, may
   greatly discover it, inwardly in their peace, or outwardly in their
   lives.

   (3.) Where men are resolved not to see, the greater the light is that
   shines about them the faster they must close their eyes. All atheism
   springs from a resolution not to see things invisible and eternal. Love
   of sin, a resolved continuance in the practice of it, the effectual
   power of vicious inclinations in opposition unto all that is good, make
   it the interest of such men that there should be no God to call them to
   an account; for a supreme, unavoidable judge, an eternal rewarder of
   good and evil, is inseparable from the first notion of a Divine Being.
   Whereas, therefore, the most glorious light and uncontrollable evidence
   of these things shines forth in the Scripture, men that will abide by
   their interest to love and live in sin must close their eyes with all
   the arts and powers that they have, or else it will pierce into their
   minds unto their torment. This they do by downright atheism, which
   alone pretends to give them security against the light of divine
   revelation. Against all other convictions they might take shelter from
   their fears under less degrees of it.

   It is not, therefore, unto the disparagement but honour of the gospel
   that so many avow themselves to be atheists, in those places wherein
   the truth of it is known and professed; for none can have the least
   inclination or temptation thereunto until they have beforehand rejected
   the gospel, which immediately exposeth them unto the worst of evils.

   Nor is there any means for the recovery of such persons. The opposition
   that hath been made unto atheism, with arguments for the divine being
   and existence of God, taken from reason and natural light, in this and
   other ages, hath been of good use to cast contempt on the pretences of
   evil men to justify themselves in their folly; but that they have so
   much as changed the minds of any I much doubt. No man is under the
   power of atheistical thoughts, or can be so long, but he that is
   ensnared into them by his desire to live securely and uncontrollably in
   sin. Such persons know it to be their interest that there should be no
   God, and are willing to take shelter under the bold expressions and
   reasonings of them who by the same means have hardened and blinded
   their minds into such foolish thoughts. But the most rational arguments
   for the being of the Deity will never prove an effectual cure unto a
   predominant love of and habitual course in sin, in them who have
   resisted and rejected the means and motives unto that end declared in
   divine revelation; and unless the love of sin be cured in the heart,
   thoughts in the acknowledgment of God will not be fixed in the mind.

   2. There are those of whom also it may be said that "God is not in all
   their thoughts," though they acknowledge his essence and being; for
   they are not practically influenced in any thing by the notions they
   have of him. Such is the person of whom this is affirmed, Ps. x. 4. He
   is one who, through pride and profligacy, with hardness in sin, regards
   not God in the rule of the world, verses 4, 5, 11, 13. Such is the
   world filled withal at this day, as they are described, Tit. i. 16,
   "They profess that they know God, but in works deny him, being
   abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate." They
   think, they live, they act in all things as if there were no God, at
   least as if they never thought of him with fear and reverence. And, for
   the most part, we need not seek far for evidences of their disregard of
   God, -- the "pride of their countenances testifies against them," Ps.
   x. 4; and if they are followed farther, cursed oaths, licentiousness of
   life, and hatred of all that is good, will confirm and evidence the
   same. Such as these may own God in words, may be afraid of him in
   dangers, may attend outwardly on his worship; but they think not of God
   at all in a due manner, -- "he is not in all their thoughts."

   3. There are yet less degrees of this disregard of God and
   forgetfulness of him. Some are so filled with thoughts of the world and
   the occasions of life that it is impossible they should think of God as
   they ought; for as the love of God and the love of the world in
   prevalent degrees are inconsistent, (for if a man love this world, how
   dwelleth the love of God in him?) so thoughts of God and of the world
   in the like degree are inconsistent. This is the state of many, who yet
   would be esteemed spiritually minded: They are continually conversant
   in their minds about earthly things. Some things impose themselves on
   them under the notion of duty; they belong unto their callings, they
   must be attended unto. Some are suggested unto their minds from daily
   occasions and occurrences. Common converse in the world engageth men
   into no other but worldly thoughts. Love and desire of earthly things,
   their enjoyment and increase, exhaust the vigour of their spirits all
   the day long. In the midst of a multitude of thoughts, arising from
   these and the like occasions, whilst their hearts and heads are reeking
   with the steam of them, many fall immediately in their seasons unto the
   performance of holy duties. Those times must suffice for thoughts of
   God. But notwithstanding such duties, what through the want of a due
   preparation for them, what through the fulness of their minds and
   affections with other things, and what through a neglect of exercising
   grace in them, it may be said comparatively that "God is not in all
   their thoughts."

   I pray God that this, at least as unto some degrees of it, be not the
   condition of many among us. I speak not now of men who visibly and
   openly live in sin, profane in their principles, and profligate in
   their lives. The prayers of such persons are an abomination unto the
   Lord, neither have they ever any thoughts of him which he doth accept.
   But I speak of them who are sober in their lives, industrious in their
   callings, and not openly negligent about the outward duties of
   religion. Such men are apt to approve of themselves, and others also to
   speak well of them, for these things are in themselves commendable and
   praiseworthy; but if they are traced home, it will be found, as to many
   of them, that "God is not in all their thoughts" as he ought to be.
   Their earthly conversation, their vain communication, with their
   foolish designs, do all manifest that the vigour of their spirits and
   most intense contrivances of their minds are engaged unto things below.
   Some refuse, transient, unmanaged thoughts are sometimes cast away on
   God; which he despiseth.

   4. Where persons do cherish secret predominant lusts in their hearts
   and lives, God is not in their thoughts as he ought to be. He may be,
   he often is, much in the words of such persons, but in their thoughts
   he is not, he cannot be, in a due manner. And such persons no doubt
   there are. Ever and anon we hear of one and another whose secret lusts
   break forth into a discovery. They flatter themselves for a season, but
   God ofttimes so orders things in his holy providence that their
   iniquity shall be found out to be hateful. Some hateful lust discovers
   itself to be predominant in them: one is drunken, another unclean, a
   third an oppressor. Such there were ever found among professors of the
   gospel, and that in the best of times: among the apostles one was a
   traitor, "a devil." Of the first professors of Christianity, there were
   those "whose god was their belly, whose end was destruction, who minded
   earthly things," Phil. iii. 18, 19. Some may take advantage of this
   acknowledgment that there are such evils among such as are called
   professors; and it must be confessed that great scandal is given hereby
   unto the world, casting both them that give it and them to whom it is
   given under a most dreadful woe: but we must bear the reproach of it as
   they did of old, and commit the issue of all things unto the watchful
   care of God. However, it is good in such a season to be jealous over
   ourselves and others, to "exhort one another daily, while it is called
   To-day, lest any be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin," Heb.
   iii. 13. See chap. xii. 13-17. And because those with whom it is thus
   cannot be spiritually minded, [and] yet are there some difficulties in
   the case, as unto the predominancy of a secret lust or sin, I shall
   consider it somewhat more distinctly:--

   (1.) We must distinguish between a time of temptation in some and the
   ordinary state of mind and affections in others. There may be a season
   wherein God, in his holy, wise ordering of all things towards us, and
   for his own glory, in his holy, blessed ends, may suffer a lust or
   corruption to break loose in the heart, to strive, tempt, suggest,
   tumultuate, unto the great trouble and disquietude of the mind and
   conscience; neither can it be denied but that, falling in conjunction
   with some vigorous temptation, it may proceed so far as to surprise the
   person in whom it is into actual sin, unto his defilement and
   amazement. In this case no man can say, "I am tempted of God;" for "God
   tempteth no man, but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his
   own lust, and enticed." But yet temptations, of what sort soever they
   be, so far as they are afflictive, corrective, or penal, are ordered
   and disposed by God himself; for there is no evil of that nature and he
   hath not done it. And where he will have the power of any corruption to
   be afflictive in any instance, two things may safely be ascribed to
   him:--

   [1.] He withholds the supplies of that grace whereby it might be
   effectually mortified and subdued. He can give in a sufficiency of
   efficacious grace to repel any temptation, to subdue any or all our
   lusts and sins; for he can and doth work in us to will and to do
   according to his pleasure. Ordinarily he doth so in them that believe;
   so that although their lusts may rebel and war, they cannot defile or
   prevail. But unto the continual supplies of this actual prevailing
   grace he is not obliged. When it may have a tendency unto his holy
   ends, he may and doth withhold it. When, it may be, a proud soul is to
   be humbled, a careless soul to be awakened, an unthankful soul to be
   convinced and rebuked, a backsliding soul to be recovered, a froward,
   selfish, passionate soul to be broken and meekened, he can leave them
   for a season unto the sore exercise of a prevalent corruption; which,
   under his holy guidance, shall contribute greatly unto his blessed
   ends. It was so in the temptation of Paul, 2 Cor. xii. 7-9. If a man,
   through disorder and excesses, is contracting many habitual distempers
   of body, which gradually and insensibly tend unto his death, it may be
   an advantage to be cast into a violent fever, which threatens
   immediately to take away his life; for he will hereby be thoroughly
   awakened unto the consideration of his danger, and not only labour to
   be freed from his fever, but also for the future to watch against those
   disorders and excesses which cast him into that condition. And
   sometimes a loose, careless soul, that walks in a secure, formal
   profession, contracts many spiritual diseases, which tend unto death
   and ruin. No arguments or considerations can prevail with him to awaken
   himself, to "shake himself out of the dust," and to betake himself unto
   a more diligent and humble walking before God. In this state, it may
   be, through the permission of God, he is surprised into some open,
   actual sin. Hereon, through the vigorous actings of an enlightened
   conscience, and the stirrings of any sparks of grace which yet remain,
   he is amazed, terrified, and stirs up himself to seek after
   deliverance.

   [2.] God may and doth in his providence administer objects and
   occasions of men's lusts, for their trial. He will place them in such
   relations, in such circumstances, as shall be apt to provoke their
   affections, passions, desires, and inclinations, unto those objects
   that are suited unto them.

   In this state any lust will quickly get such power in the mind and
   affections as to manage continual solicitations unto sin. It will not
   only dispose the affections towards it, but multiply thoughts about it,
   and darken the mind as unto those considerations which ought to prevail
   unto its mortification. In this condition it is hard to conceive how
   God should be in the thoughts of man in a due manner. However, this
   state is very different from the habitual prevalency of any secret sin
   or corruption in the ordinary course of men's walking in the world, and
   therefore I do not directly intend it.

   If any one shall inquire how we may know this difference, namely, that
   is between the occasional prevalency of any lust or corruption in
   conjunction with a temptation, and the power of sin in any instance
   habitually and constantly complied withal, or indulged in the mind, I
   answer, --

   1st. It is no great matter whether we are able to distinguish between
   them or no; for the end why God suffers any corruption to be such a
   snare and temptation, such a thorn and brier, is, to awaken the souls
   of men out of their security, and to humble them for their pride and
   negligence. The more severe their apprehensions concerning it, the more
   effectual it will be unto this end and purpose. It is good, it may be,
   that the soul should apprehend more of what is sinful in it as it is a
   corruption than of what is afflictive in it as it is a temptation; for
   if it be conceived as a predominant lust, if there be any spark of
   grace remaining in the soul, it will not rest until in some measure it
   be subdued. It will also immediately put it upon a diligent search into
   itself, which will issue in deep self-abasement, the principal end
   designed. But, --

   2dly. For the relief of them that may be perplexed in their minds about
   their state and condition, I say there is an apparent difference
   between these things. A lust or corruption arising up or breaking forth
   into a violent temptation is the continual burden, grief, and
   affliction of the soul wherein it is. And as the temptation, for the
   most part, which befalls such a person will give him no rest from its
   reiterated solicitations, so he will give the temptation no rest, but
   will be continually conflicting with it and contending against it. It
   fills the soul with an amazement at itself and continual
   self-abhorrency, that any such seeds of filth and folly should be yet
   remaining in it. With them in whom any sin is ordinarily prevalent it
   is otherwise. According to their light and renewed occasional
   convictions, they have trouble about it; they cannot but have so,
   unless their consciences are utterly seared. But this trouble respects
   principally, if not solely, its guilt and effects. They know not what
   may ensue on their compliance with it, in this world and another.
   Beyond this they like it well enough, and are not willing to part with
   it. It is this latter sea of persons of whom we speak at present.

   (2.) We must distinguish between the perplexing solicitation of any
   lust and the conquering predominancy of it. The evil that is present
   with us will be soliciting and pressing unto sin of its own accord,
   even where there is no such especial temptation as that spoken of
   before. So is the case stated, so are the nature and operations of it
   described, Rom. vii., Gal. v. 17. And sometimes an especial, particular
   lust may be so warmed and fomented by men's constitutions within, or be
   so exposed unto provoking, exciting occasions without, as to bring
   perpetual trouble on the mind; yet this may be where no sin hath the
   predominancy inquired after. And the difference between the perplexing
   solicitation of any corruption unto sin and the conquering prevalency
   of it lies in this, that under the former, the thoughts, contrivances,
   and actings of the mind, are generally disposed and inclined unto an
   opposition unto it, and a conflict with it, how it may be obviated,
   defeated, destroyed, how an absolute victory may be obtained against
   it; yea, death itself is sweet unto such persons, under this notion, as
   it is that which will deliver them from the perplexing power of their
   corruptions. So is the state of such a soul at large represented, Rom.
   vii.. In the other case, namely, of its predominancy, it disposeth of
   the thoughts actually, for the most part, to make provision for the
   flesh, and to fulfil it in the lusts thereof. It fills the mind with
   pleasing contemplations of its object, and puts it on contrivances for
   satisfaction; yea, part of the bitterness of death unto such persons
   is, that it will make an everlasting separation between them and the
   satisfaction they have received in their lusts. It is bitter in the
   thoughts of it unto a worldly-minded man, because it will take him from
   all his enjoyments, his wealth, profits, and advantages. It is so unto
   the sensual person, as that which finally determines all his pleasures.

   (3.) There is a difference in the degrees of such a predominant
   corruption. In some it taints the affections, vitiates the thoughts,
   and works over the will unto acts of a secret complacency in sin, but
   proceeds no farther. The whole mind may be vitiated by it, and
   rendered, in the multitude of its thoughts, vain, sensual, or worldly,
   according as is the nature of the prevailing corruption; yet here God
   puts bounds unto the raging of some men's corruptions, and says to
   their proud waves, "Thus far shall ye proceed, and no farther." He
   either lays a restraint on their minds, that when lust hath fully
   conceived it shall not bring forth sin, or he sets a hedge before them
   in his providence, that they shall not be able in their circumstances
   to find their way unto what perhaps they do most earnestly desire. A
   woful life it is that such persons lead. They are continually tortured
   between their corruptions and convictions, or the love of sin and fear
   of the event. With others it pursues its course into outward actual
   sins: which in some are discovered in this world, in others they are
   not; for some men's sins go before them unto judgment, and some follow
   after. Some fall into sin upon surprisal, from a concurrence of
   temptation with corruption and opportunities. Some habituate themselves
   unto a course in sin. Though in many it be not discovered, in some it
   is. But among those who have received any spiritual light, and made
   profession of religion thereon, this seldom falls out but from the
   great displeasure of God; for when men have long given way unto the
   prevalency of sin in their affections, inclinations, and thoughts, and
   God hath set many a hedge before them to give bounds unto their
   inclinations and to shut up the womb of sin, sometimes by afflictions,
   sometimes by fears and dangers, sometimes by the word, and yet the bent
   of their spirits is towards their sin, God takes off his hand of
   restraint, removes his hinderances, and gives them up unto their own
   hearts' lusts, to do the things that are not convenient. All things
   hereon suit their desires, and they rush into actual sins and follies,
   setting their feet in the paths that go down to the chambers of death.
   The uncontrollable power of sin in such persons, and the greatness of
   God's displeasure against them, make their condition most deplorable.

   Those that are in this state, of either sort, the first or the latter,
   are remote from being spiritually minded, nor is "God in all their
   thoughts" as he ought to be; for, --

   First, They will not so think and meditate on God. Their delight is
   turned another way. Their affections, which are the spring of their
   thoughts, which feed them continually, do cleave unto the things which
   are most adverse unto him. Love of sin is gotten to be the spring in
   them, and the whole stream of the thoughts which they choose and
   delight in are towards the pleasures of it. If any thoughts of God come
   in, as a faint tide for a few minutes, and drive back the other stream,
   they are quickly repelled and carried away with the strong current of
   those which proceed from their powerful inclinations. Yet may such
   persons abide in the performance of outward holy duties, or attendance
   unto them. Pride of, or satisfaction in, their gifts may give them
   delight in their own performances, and something in those of others
   they may be exceedingly pleased withal, as it is expressly affirmed,
   Ezek. xxxiii. 31, 32. But in these things they have no immediate real
   thoughts of God, none that they delight in, none that they seek to stir
   up in themselves; and those which impose themselves on them they
   reject.

   Secondly, As they will not, so they dare not, think of God. They will
   not, because of the power of their lusts; they dare not, because of
   their guilt. No sooner should they begin to think of him in good
   earnest, but their sin would lose all its desirable forms and
   appearances, and represent itself in the horror of guilt alone. And in
   that condition all the properties of the divine nature are suited to
   increase the dread and terror of the sinner. Adam had heard God's voice
   before with delight and satisfaction; but on the hearing of the same
   voice after he had sinned, he hid himself and cried that he was afraid.
   There is a way for men to think of God with the guilt of sin upon them
   which they intend to forsake, but none for any to do it with the guilt
   of sin which they resolve to continue in. Wherefore, of all these sorts
   of persons it may be said that "God is not in all their thoughts," and
   therefore are they fax enough from being spiritually minded; for unless
   we have many thoughts of God we cannot be so. Yea, moreover, there are
   two things required unto those thoughts which we have of God, that
   there be an evidence of our being so:--

   [1.] That we take delight in them: Ps. xxx. 4, "Sing unto the Lord, O
   ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness."
   The remembrance of God delighteth and refresheth the hearts of his
   saints, and stirs them up unto thankfulness:--

   1st. They rejoice in what God is in himself. Whatever is good, amiable,
   or desirable; whatever is holy, just, and powerful; whatever is
   gracious, wise, and merciful, and all that is so, -- they see and
   apprehend in God. That God is what he is, is the matter of their
   chiefest joy. Whatever befalls them in this world, whatever troubles
   and disquietment they are exercised withal, the remembrance of God is a
   satisfactory refreshment unto them; for therein they behold all that is
   good and excellent, the infinite centre of all perfections. Wicked men
   would have God to be any thing but what he is; nothing that God is
   really and truly pleaseth them. Wherefore, they either frame false
   notions of him in their minds, as Ps. l. 21, or they think not of him
   at all, at least [not] as they ought, unless sometimes they tremble at
   his anger and power. Some benefit they suppose may be had by what he
   can do, but how there can be any delight in what he is they know not;
   yea, all their trouble ariseth from hence, that he is what he is. It
   would be a relief unto them if they could make any abatement of his
   power, his holiness, his righteousness, his omnipresence; but his
   saints, as the psalmist speaks, "give thanks at the remembrance of his
   holiness."

   And when we can delight in the thoughts of what God is in himself, of
   his infinite excellencies and perfections, it gives us a threefold
   evidence of our being spiritually minded:-- (1st.) In that it is such
   an evidence that we have a gracious interest in those excellencies and
   perfections, whereon we can say with rejoicing in ourselves, "This
   God," thus holy, thus powerful, thus just, good, and gracious, "is our
   God for ever and ever; he will be our guide unto death." So the
   psalmist, under the consideration of his own frailty and apprehensions
   of death in the midst of his years, comforts and refresheth himself
   with thoughts of God's eternity and immutability, with his interest in
   them, Ps. cii. 23-28. And God himself proposeth unto us his infinite
   immutability as the ground whereon we may expect safety and
   deliverance, Mal. iii. 6. When we can thus think of God and of what he
   is with delight, it is, I say, an evidence that we have a gracious
   covenant interest even in what God is in himself; which none have but
   those who are spiritually minded. (2dly.) It is an evidence that the
   image of God is begun to be wrought in our own souls, and that we
   approve of and rejoice in it more than in all other things whatever.
   Whatever notions men may have of the divine goodness, holiness,
   righteousness, and purity, they are all but barren, jejune, and
   fruitless, unless there be a similitude and conformity unto them
   wrought in their minds and souls. Without this they cannot rejoice in
   the thoughts and remembrance of the divine excellencies. Wherefore,
   when we can do so, when such meditations of God are sweet unto us, it
   is an evidence that we have some experience in ourselves of the
   excellency of the image of those perfections, and that we rejoice in
   them above all things in this world. (3dly.) They are so also in that
   they manifest that we do discern and judge that our eternal blessedness
   doth consist in the full manifestation and our enjoyment of God in what
   he is, and of all his divine excellencies. This men for the most part
   take for granted, but how it should be so they know not. They
   understand it in some measure whose hearts are here deeply affected
   with delight in them; they are able to believe that the manifestation
   and enjoyment of the divine excellencies will give eternal rest,
   satisfaction, and complacency unto their souls. No wicked man can look
   upon it otherwise than as a torment, to abide for ever with "eternal
   holiness," Isa. xxxiii. 14. And we ourselves can have no present
   prospect into the fulness of future glory, when God shall be all in
   all, but through the delight and satisfaction which we have here in the
   contemplation of what God is in himself as the centre of all divine
   perfections.

   I would therefore press this unknown, this neglected duty on the minds
   of those of us in an especial manner who are visibly drawing nigh unto
   eternity. The days are coming wherein what God is in himself (that is,
   as manifested and exhibited in Christ), shall alone be, as we hope, the
   eternal blessedness and reward of our souls. Is it possible that any
   thing should be more necessary for us, more useful unto us, than to be
   exercised in such thoughts and contemplations? The benefits we may have
   hereby are not to be reckoned; some of them only may be named: as, --
   [1st.]We shall have the best trial of ourselves how our hearts really
   stand affected towards God; for if upon examination we find ourselves
   not really to delight and rejoice in God for what he is in himself, and
   that all perfections are eternally resident in him, how dwelleth the
   love of God in us? But if we can truly "rejoice at the remembrance of
   his holiness," in the thoughts of what he is, our hearts are upright
   with him. [2dly.] This is that which will effectually take off our
   thoughts and affections from things here below. One spiritual view of
   the divine goodness, beauty, and holiness, will have more efficacy to
   raise the heart unto a contempt of all earthly things than any other
   evidences whatever. [3dly.] It will increase the grace of being
   heavenly minded in us, on the grounds before declared. [4thly.] It is
   the best, I had almost said it is the only, preparation for the future
   full enjoyment of God. This will gradually lead us into his presence,
   take away all fears of death, increase our longing after eternal rest,
   and ever make us groan to be unclothed. Let us not, then, cease
   labouring with our hearts, until, through grace, we have a
   spiritually-sensible delight and joy in the remembrances and thoughts
   of what God is in himself.

   2dly. In thoughts of God, his saints rejoice at the remembrance of what
   he is, and what he will be unto them. Herein have they regard unto all
   the holy relations that he hath taken on himself towards them, with all
   the effects of his covenant in Christ Jesus. To that purpose were some
   of the last words of David: 2 Sam. xxiii. 5, "Although my house be not
   so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered
   in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my
   desire." In the prospect he had of all the distresses that were to
   befall his family, he triumphantly rejoiced in the everlasting covenant
   that God had made with him. In these thoughts his saints take delight;
   they are sweet unto them, and full of refreshment: "Their meditations
   of him are sweet," and they are "glad in the Lord," Ps. civ. 34. Thus
   is it with them that are truly spiritually minded. They not only think
   much of God, but they take delight in these thoughts, -- they are sweet
   unto them; and not only so, but they have no solid joy or delight but
   in their thoughts of God, which therefore they retreat unto
   continually. They do so especially on great occasions, which of
   themselves are apt to divert them from them. As suppose a man hath
   received a signal mercy, with the matter whereof he is exceedingly
   affected and delighted; the minds of some men are apt on such occasions
   to be filled with thoughts of what they have received, and their
   affections to be wholly taken up with it, but he who is spiritually
   minded will immediately retreat unto thoughts of God, placing his
   delight and taking up his satisfaction in him. And so, on the other
   side, great distresses, prevalent sorrows, strong pains, violent
   distempers, are apt of themselves to take up and exercise all the
   thoughts of men about them; but those who are spiritually minded will
   in and under them all continually betake themselves unto thoughts of
   God, wherein they find relief and refreshment against all that they
   feel or fear. In every state, their principal joy is in "the
   remembrance of his holiness."

   [2.] That they be accompanied with godly fear and reverence. These are
   required of us in all wherein we have to do with God, Heb. xii. 28, 29;
   and as the Scripture doth not more abound with precepts unto any duty,
   so the nature of God and our own, with the infinite distance between
   them, make it indispensably necessary even in the light of the natural
   conscience. Infinite greatness, infinite holiness, infinite power, all
   which God is, command the utmost reverential fear that our natures are
   capable of. The want hereof is the spring of innumerable evils; yea,
   indeed, of all that is so. Hence are blasphemous abuses of the holy
   name of God in cursed oaths and execrations; hence it is taken in vain,
   in ordinary exclamations; hence is all formality in religion.

   It is the spiritual mind alone that can reconcile those things which
   are prescribed to us as our duty towards God. "To delight and rejoice
   in him always, to triumph in the remembrance of him, to draw nigh unto
   him with boldness and confidence," are on the one hand prescribed unto
   us; and on the other it is so "that we fear and tremble before him,
   that we fear that great and dreadful name the Lord our God, that we
   have grace to serve him with reverence and godly fear, because he is a
   consuming fire." These things carnal reason can comprehend no
   consistency in; -- what it is afraid of it cannot delight in; and what
   it delights in it will not long fear. But the consideration of faith,
   concerning what God is in himself, and what he will be unto us, gives
   these different graces their distinct operations, and a blessed
   reconciliation in our souls. Wherefore, all our thoughts of God ought
   to be accompanied with a holy awe and reverence, from a due sense of
   his greatness, holiness, and power. Two things will utterly vitiate all
   thoughts of God and render them useless unto us, -- vain curiosity and
   carnal boldness.

   1st. It is unimaginable how the subtile disquisitions and disputes of
   men about the nature, properties, and counsels of God, have been
   corrupted, rendered sapless and useless, by vain curiosity, and
   striving for an artificial accuracy in the expression of men's
   apprehensions. When the wits and minds of men are engaged in such
   thoughts, "God is not in all their thoughts," even when all their
   thoughts are concerning him. When once men are got into their
   metaphysical curiosities and logical niceties in their contemplations
   about God and his divine properties, they bid farewell, for the most
   part, unto all godly fear and reverence. 2dly. Others are so under the
   power of carnal boldness, that they think of God with no other respect
   than if they thought of worms of the earth like themselves. There is no
   holy awfulness upon their minds and souls in the mention of his name.
   By these things may our thoughts of God be so vitiated that the heart
   shall not in them be affected with a reverence of him, nor any evidence
   be given that we are spiritually minded.

   It is this holy reverence that is the means of bringing in sanctifying
   virtue into our souls from God, upon our thoughts of him. None that
   thinks of God with a due reverence but he shall be sensible of
   advantage by it. Hereby do we sanctify God in our access unto him; and
   when we do so, he will sanctify and purify our hearts by those very
   thoughts in which we draw nigh to him.

   We may have many sudden, occasional, transient thoughts of God, that
   are not introduced into our minds by a preceding reverential fear; but
   if they leave not that fear on our hearts in proportion unto their
   continuance with us, they are of no value, but will insensibly
   habituate us unto a common, bold frame of spirit, which he despises.

   So is it in the case of thoughts of a contrary nature. Thoughts of sin,
   of sinful objects, may arise in our minds from the remainders of
   corruption, or be occasioned by the temptations and suggestions of
   Satan. If these are immediately rejected and cast out of us, the soul
   is not more prejudiced by their entrance than it is advantaged by their
   rejection, through the power of grace. But if they make frequent
   returns into the minds of men, or make any abode or continuance in
   their soliciting of the affections, they greatly defile the mind and
   conscience, disposing the person unto the farther entertainment of
   them. So, if our occasional thoughts of God do immediately leave us,
   and pass away without much affecting our minds, we shall have little or
   no benefit by them; but if, by their frequent visits and some
   continuance with us, they dispose our souls unto a holy reverence of
   God, they are a blessed means of promoting our sanctification. Without
   this, I say, there may be thoughts of God unto no advantage of the
   soul.

   There is implanted on our nature such a sense of a divine Power and
   Presence as that on all sudden occasions and surprisals it will act
   itself according unto that sense and apprehension. There is "vox naturæ
   clamantis ad Dominum naturæ," -- a voice in nature itself, upon any
   thing that is suddenly too hard for it, which cries out immediately
   unto the God of nature. So men, on such occasions, without any
   consideration, are surprised into a calling on the name of God and
   crying unto him. And from the same natural apprehension it is that
   wicked and profane persons will break forth on all occasions into
   cursed swearing by his name. So men in such ways have thoughts of God
   without either reverence or godly fear, without giving any glory unto
   him, and, for the most part, unto their own disadvantage. Such are all
   thoughts of God that are not accompanied with holy fear and reverence.

   There is scarce any duty that ought at present to be more pressed on
   the consciences of men than this of keeping up a constant holy
   reverence of God in all wherein they have to do with him, both in
   private and public, in their inward thoughts and outward communication.
   Formality hath so prevailed on religion, and that under the most
   effectual means of its suppression, that very many do manifest that
   they have little or no reverence of God in the most solemn duties of
   his worship, and less, it may be, in their secret thoughts. Some ways
   that have been found out to keep up a pretence and appearance of it
   have been and are destructive unto it.

   But herein consists the very life of all religion. The fear of God is,
   in the Old Testament, the usual expression of all the due respect of
   our souls unto him, and that because where that is not in exercise,
   nothing is accepted with him. And hence the whole of our wisdom is said
   to consist therein; and if it be not in a prevalent exercise in all
   wherein we have to do with him immediately, all our duties are utterly
   lost, as to the ends of his glory and the spiritual advantage of our
   own souls.

Chapter IX.

   What of God or in God we are to think and meditate upon -- His being --
   Reasons of it; oppositions to it; the way of their conquest -- Thoughts
   of the omnipresence and omniscience of God peculiarly necessary -- The
   reasons hereof -- As also of his omnipotence -- The use and benefit of
   such thoughts.

   These things mentioned have been premised in general as unto the
   nature, manner, and way of exercise, of our thoughts on God. That which
   remains is, to give some particular instances of what we are to think
   upon in an especial manner, and what we will be conversant withal in
   our thoughts, if so be we are spiritually minded. And I shall not
   insist at present on the things which concern his grace and love in
   Christ Jesus, which belong unto another head, but on those which have
   an immediate respect unto the divine nature itself, and its holy
   essential properties.

   First, Think much of the being and existence of God. Herein lies the
   foundation of all our relation and access unto him: Heb. xi. 6, "He
   that cometh to God must believe that he is." This is the first object
   of faith, and it is the first act of reason; and being the sole
   foundation of all religion, it is our duty to be exercised unto
   multiplied thoughts about it, renewed on all occasions: for many who
   are not direct atheists, yet live without any solid, well-grounded
   assent unto the divine being; they do not so believe it as to be
   practically influenced with the consideration of it. It is granted that
   the inbred light of nature, in the due exercise of reason, will give
   any rational creature satisfaction in the being of God; but there is in
   the most an anticipation of any thoughts of this nature by tradition
   and education, which hath united men into an assent unto it they know
   not how. They never called it into question, nor have, as they suppose,
   any cause so to do. Nature itself startles at the first thought of
   denying it. But if ever such persons, on any urgent occasions, come to
   have real thoughts about it, they are at a loss and fluctuate in their
   minds, as not having any certain, indubitable conviction of its truth.
   Wherefore, as our knowledge of the Divine Being is, as to the
   foundation of it, laid in the light of nature, the operation of
   conscience, and the due exercise of reason about the works and effects
   of infinite power and wisdom, so it ought to be increased and rendered
   useful by faith in divine revelations, and the experience of divine
   power through them. By this faith we ought to let in frequent thoughts
   of the divine being and existence, and that on two reasons, rendering
   the duty necessary in an eminent manner in this age wherein we live:--

   1. The abounding of atheism, both notional and practical. The reasons
   of it have been given before, and the matter of fact is evident unto
   any ordinary observation. And on two accounts with respect hereunto we
   ought to abound in thoughts of faith concerning the being of God:--
   (1.) An especial testimony is required in us in opposition to this
   cursed effect of hell. He, therefore, who is spiritually minded, cannot
   but have many thoughts of the being of God, thereby giving glory to
   him: Isa. xliii. 9-12, "Let all the nations be gathered together, and
   let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show
   us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may
   be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are my
   witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye
   may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there
   was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the
   Lord; and beside me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have
   saved, and I have showed, when there was no strange god among you:
   therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God." Chap.
   xliv. 8, "Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from
   that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a
   God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any." (2.) We shall
   have occasion of them continually administered unto us. Those
   atheistical impieties, principles and practices, which abound amongst
   us, are grievous provocations unto all pious souls. Without frequent
   retreat unto thoughts of the being of God, there is no relief nor
   refreshment to be had under them. Such was the case of Noah in the old
   world, and of Lot in Sodom; which rendered their graces illustrious.

   2. Because of the unaccountable confusions that all things are filled
   withal at this day in the world. Whatever in former times hath been a
   temptation in human affairs unto any of the people of God, it abounds
   at this day. Never had men profane and profligate greater outward
   appearances to strengthen them in their atheism, nor those that are
   godly greater trials for their faith, with respect unto the visible
   state of things in the world. The psalmist of old on such an occasion
   was almost surprised into unbelieving complaints, Ps. lxxiii. 2-5,
   etc.; and such surprisals may now also befall us, that we may be ready
   to say with him, "Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
   my hands in innocency. For all the day long have I been plagued, and
   chastened every morning." Hence, when the prophet Habakkuk was
   exercised with thoughts about such a state of things as is at this day
   in the world, which he declares, chap. i. 6-10, he lays the foundation
   of his consideration in the fresh exercise of faith on the being and
   properties of God, verses 12, 13; and David makes that his retreat on
   the like occasion, Ps. xi. 3-5.

   In such a season as this is, upon both the accounts mentioned, those
   who are spiritually minded will much exercise their thoughts about the
   being and existence of God. They will say within themselves, "Verily
   there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God who judgeth in
   the earth." Hence will follow such apprehensions of the immensity of
   his nature, of his eternal power and infinite wisdom, of his absolute
   sovereignty, as will hold their souls firm anal steadfast in the
   highest storms of temptation that may befall them.

   Yet are there two things that the weaker sort of believers may be
   exercised with, in their thoughts of the divine being and existence,
   which may occasion them some trouble:--

   (1.) Satan, knowing the weakness of our minds in the immediate
   contemplation of things infinite and incomprehensible, will sometimes
   take advantage to insinuate blasphemous imaginations in opposition unto
   what we would fix upon and relieve ourselves withal. He will take that
   very time, trusting unto our weakness and his own methods of subtlety,
   to suggest his temptations unto atheism by ensnaring inquiries, when we
   go about to refresh our souls with thoughts of the divine being and
   excellencies, "But is there a God indeed? how do you know that there is
   a God? and may it not be otherwise?" will be his language unto our
   minds; for from his first temptation, by way of an ensnaring question,
   "Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" he
   proceeds still much in the same method. So he did with our Saviour
   himself, "If thou be the Son of God." "Is there a God? how if there
   should be none?" In such a case the rule is given us by the apostle:
   "Above all, take the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to
   quench all the fiery darts of the wicked," Eph. vi. 16, Tou ponerou,
   "of the wicked one;" that is, the devil. And two ways will faith act
   itself on this occasion:--

   [1.] By a speedy rejection of such diabolical suggestions with
   detestation. So did our Saviour in a case not unlike it: "Get thee
   behind me, Satan." Wherefore, if any such thoughts are suggested or
   seem to arise in your minds, know assuredly that they are no less
   immediately from the devil than if he personally stood before you and
   visibly appeared unto you. If he did so, there is none of you but would
   arm yourselves with an utter defiance of what he should offer unto you.
   It is no less necessary on this occasion, when you may feel him, though
   you may see him not. Suffer not his fiery darts to abide one moment
   with you; entertain no parley or dispute about them; reject them with
   indignation; and strengthen your rejection of them with some pertinent
   testimony of Scripture, as our Saviour did. If a man have a grenado or
   fire-ball cast into his clothes by his enemy, he doth not consider
   whether it will burn or no, but immediately shakes it off from him.
   Deal no otherwise with these fiery darts, lest by their abode with you
   they inflame your imagination unto greater disturbance.

   [2.] In case they depart not utterly upon this endeavour for their
   exclusion and casting out, return immediately without farther dispute
   unto your own experience. When the devil hath asked you the question,
   if you answer him you will be ensnared; but if thereon you ask
   yourselves the question, and apply yourselves unto your own experience
   for an answer unto it, you will frustrate all his designs.

   There are arguments to be taken, as was said, from the light of nature,
   and reason in its proper exercise, sufficient to defeat all objections
   of that kind; but these are not our proper weapons in case of our own
   temptation, which alone is now under consideration. It requires longer
   and more sedate reasoning than such a state will admit of; nor is it a
   sanctified medium for our relief.

   It is what is suited unto suggestions on the occasion of our
   meditations that we inquire after. In them we are not to argue on such
   principles, but to take the shield of faith to quench these fiery
   darts. And if, on such occasions, Satan can divert us into long
   disputes about the being of God, he hath his end, by carrying us off
   from the meditation on him which we did design; and after a while he
   will prevail to make it a common road and trade, that no sooner shall
   we begin to think of God but immediately we must dispute about his
   being.

   Therefore the way in this case, for him who is really a believer, is,
   to retreat immediately unto his own experience; which will pour shame
   and contempt on the suggestions of Satan. There is no believer, who
   hath knowledge and time to exercise the wisdom of faith in the
   consideration of himself and of God's dealings with him, but hath a
   witness in himself of his eternal power and Godhead, as also of all
   those other perfections of his nature which he is pleased to manifest
   and glorify by Jesus Christ. Wherefore, on this suggestion of Satan
   that there is no God, he will be able to say, "He might better tell me
   that I do not live nor breathe, that I am not fed by my meat nor warmed
   by my clothes, that I know not myself nor any thing else; for I have
   spiritual sense and experience of the contrary:" like him of old, who,
   when a cunning sophister would prove unto him by syllogisms that there
   was no such a thing as motion, gave no answer unto his arguments, but
   rose up and walked! "How often," will he say, "have I had experience of
   the power and presence of God in prayer, as though I had not only heard
   of him by the hearing of the ear, but also seen him by the seeing of
   the eye! How often hath he put forth his power and grace in me by his
   Spirit and his word, with an uncontrollable evidence of his being,
   goodness, love, and grace! How often hath he refreshed my conscience
   with the sense of the pardon of sin, speaking that peace unto my soul
   which all the world could not communicate unto me! In how many
   afflictions, dangers, troubles, hath he been a present help and relief!
   What sensible emanations of life and power from him have I obtained in
   meditation on his grace and glory!" As he who had been blind answered
   the Pharisees unto their ensnaring and captious questions, "Be it what
   it will, one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see:'" so,
   "Whatever," saith such a soul, "be in this temptation of Satan, one
   thing I know full well, that whereas I was dead, I am alive, whereas I
   was blind, now I see, and that by the effect of divine power."

   This shield of faith, managed in the hand of experience, will quench
   the fiery darts of Satan, and he will fall under a double defeat:--
   lst. His temptations will be repelled by the proper way of resistance,
   whereon he will not only desist in his attempt, but even flee from you.
   "Resist the devil," saith the apostle, "and he will flee from you." He
   will not only depart and cease to trouble you, but will depart as one
   defeated and confounded. And it is for want of this resistance, lively
   made use of, that many hang so long in the briers of this temptation.
   2dly. Recalling the experiences we have had of God will lead us unto
   the exercise of all kind of graces; which is the greatest
   disappointment of our adversary.

   (2.) In thoughts of the divine being and existence, we are apt to be at
   a loss, to be as it were overwhelmed in our minds, because the object
   is too great and glorious for us to contemplate on. Eternity and
   immensity, every thing under the notion of infinite, take off the mind
   from its distinct actings, and reduce it as it were unto nothing.
   Hereon in some, not able to abide in the strict reasons of things, vain
   and foolish imaginations are apt to arise, and inquiries how those
   things can be which we cannot comprehend. Others are utterly at a loss,
   and turn away their thoughts from them, as they would do their eyes
   from the bright beams of the sun. Two things are advisable in this
   case:--

   [1.] That we betake ourselves unto a holy admiration of what we cannot
   comprehend. In these things we cannot see God and live; nay, in life
   eternal itself they are not absolutely to be comprehended. Only what is
   infinite can fully comprehend what is so. Here they are the objects of
   faith and worship; in them we may find rest and satisfaction when
   inquiries and reasonings will disquiet us, and, it may be, overwhelm
   us. Infinite glory forbids us any near approach but only by faith. The
   soul thereby bowing down itself unto God's adorable greatness and
   incomprehensible perfections, finding ourselves to be nothing and God
   to be all, will give us rest and peace in these things, Rom. xi. 33-36.
   We have but unsteady thoughts of the greatness of the world and all the
   nations and inhabitants of it; yet are both it and these "but as the
   small dust of the balance and the drop of a bucket, as vanity, as
   nothing," compared with God. What, then, can our thoughts concerning
   him issue in but holy admiration?

   [2.] In case we are brought unto a loss and disorder in our minds on
   the contemplation of any one infinite property of God, it is good to
   divert our thoughts unto the effects of it, such as whereof we have or
   may have experience; for what is too great or high for us in itself is
   made suitable to our understandings in its effects. So the "invisible
   things of God" are known in and by the things that are seen. And there
   is, indeed, no property of the divine nature but we may have an
   experience of it, as unto some of its effects, in and upon ourselves.
   These we may consider, and in the streams taste of the fountain which
   we cannot approach. By them we may be led unto a holy admiration of
   what is in itself infinite, immense, incomprehensible. I cannot
   comprehend the immensity of God's nature; it may be I cannot understand
   the nature of immensity: yet if I find by experience, and do strongly
   believe, that he is always present wherever I am, I have the faith of
   it and satisfaction in it.

   Secondly, With thoughts of the Divine Being, those of his omnipresence
   and omniscience ought continually to accompany us. We cannot take one
   step in a walk before him unless we remember that always and in all
   places he is present with us, that the frame of our hearts and our
   inward thoughts are continually in his view, no less than our outward
   actions. And as we ought to be perpetually under an awe of and in the
   fear of God in these apprehensions, so there are some seasons wherein
   our minds ought to be in the actual conception and thoughts of them,
   without which we shall not be preserved in our duty.

   1. The first season of this nature is when times, places, with other
   occasions of temptation, and consequently of sinning, do come and meet.
   With some, company doth constitute such a season; and with some,
   secrecy with opportunity do the same. There are those who are ready,
   with a careless boldness, to put themselves on such societies as they
   do know have been temptations unto them and occasions of sin. Every
   such entrance into any society or company, unto them who know how it
   hath formerly succeeded, is their actual sin; and it is just with God
   to leave them to all the evil consequents that do ensue. Others, also,
   do either choose or are frequently cast on such societies; and no
   sooner are they engaged in them but they forget all regard unto God,
   and give themselves up not only unto vanity, but unto various sorts of
   excess. David knew the evil and danger of such occasions, and gives us
   an account of his behaviour in them: Ps. xxxix. 1-3, "I said, I will
   take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my
   mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. I was dumb with
   silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred. My
   heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned; then spake
   I with my tongue." As for their evil words and ways, he would have no
   communication with them; and as unto good discourse, he judged it
   unreasonable to "cast pearls before swine." He was therefore silent as
   unto that also, though it was a grief and trouble to him. But this
   occasioned in him afterward those excellent meditations which he
   expresseth in the following verses. In the entrance of these occasions,
   if men would remember the presence of God with them in these places,
   with the holy severity of the eye that is upon them, it would put an
   awe upon their spirits, and imbitter those jollities whose relish is
   given them by temptation and sin. He doth neither walk humbly nor
   circumspectly who, being necessarily cast on the society of men wicked
   or profane, -- on such occasions wherein the ordinary sort of men give
   more than ordinary liberty unto corrupt communication or excess in any
   kind, -- doth not in his entrance of them call to mind the presence and
   all-seeing eye of God, and at his departure from them consider whether
   his deportment hath been such as became that presence and his being
   under that eye. But, alas! pretences of business and necessary
   occasions, engagements of trade, carnal relations, and the common
   course of communication in the world, with a supposition that all sorts
   of society are allowed for diversion, have cast out the remembrance of
   God from the minds of most, even then when men cannot be preserved from
   sin without it.

   This hath sullied the beauty of gospel conversation amongst the most,
   and left in very few any prevalent evidence of being spiritually
   minded.

   Wherefore, as unto them who, either by their voluntary choice or
   necessity of their occasions, do enter and engage promiscuously into
   all societies and companies, let them know assuredly that if they awe
   not their hearts and spirits continually with the thoughts and
   apprehensions of the omnipresence and omniscience of God, that he is
   always with them and his eye always upon them, they will not be
   preserved from snares and sinful miscarriages.

   Yea, such thoughts are needful unto the best of us all, and in the best
   of our societies, that we behave not ourselves indecently in them at
   any time.

   Again; unto some, privacy, secrecy, and opportunity, are occasions of
   temptation and sin. They are so unto persons under convictions, not
   wholly turned to God. Many a good beginning hath been utterly ruined by
   this occasion and temptation. Privacy and opportunity have overthrown
   many such persons in the best of their resolutions. And they are so
   unto all persons not yet flagitiously wicked. Cursed fruits proceed
   every day from these occasions. We need no other demonstration of their
   power and efficacy in tempting unto sin but the visible effects of
   them. And what they are unto any, they may be unto all, if not
   diligently watched against. So the apostle reflects on the shameful
   things that are done in the dark, in a concurrence of secrecy and
   opportunity. This, therefore, gives a just season unto thoughts of the
   omnipresence and omniscience of God, and they will not be wanting in
   some measure in them that are spiritually minded. God is in this place;
   the darkness is no darkness unto him, light and darkness are with him
   both alike, -- are sufficient considerations to lay in the balance
   against any temptation springing out of secrecy and opportunity. One
   thought of the actual presence of the holy God and the open view of his
   all-seeing eye will do more to cool those affections which lust may put
   into a tumult on such occasions than any other consideration whatever.
   A speedy retreat hereunto, upon the first perplexing thought wherewith
   temptation assaults the soul, will be its strong tower, where it shall
   be safe.

   2. A second season calling for the exercise of our minds in thoughts of
   the omnipresence and omniscience of God is made up of our solitudes and
   retirements. These give us the most genuine trials whether we are
   spiritually minded or no. What we are in them, that we are, and no
   more. But yet in some of them, as in walking and journeying, or the
   like, vain thoughts and foolish imaginations are exceeding apt to
   solicit our minds. Whatever is stored up in the affections or memory
   will at such a time offer itself for our present entertainment; and
   when men have accustomed themselves unto any sort of things, they will
   press on them for the possession of their thoughts, as it were whether
   they will or no. The psalmist gives us the way to prevent this evil:
   Ps. xvi. 7, 8, "I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my
   reins also instruct me in the night seasons. I have set the Lord always
   before me: because he is at my right hand," etc. His "reins," -- that
   is, his affections and secret thoughts, -- gave him counsel and
   instructed him in all such seasons. But whence had they that wisdom and
   faithfulness? In themselves they are the seat of all lusts and
   corruptions, nor could do any thing but seduce him into an evil frame.
   It was from hence alone, that "he set the Lord always before him."
   Continual apprehensions of the presence of God with him kept his mind,
   his heart and affections, in that awe and reverence of him as that they
   always instructed him unto his duty. But, as I remember, I spake
   somewhat as unto the due management of our thoughts in this season
   before.

   3. Times of great difficulties, dangers, and perplexities of mind
   thereon, are a season calling for the same duty. Suppose a man is left
   alone in his trials for the profession of the gospel, as it was with
   Paul, when "all men forsook him, and no man stood by him;" suppose him
   to be brought before princes, rulers, or judges, that are failed with
   rage and armed with power against him, all things being disposed to
   affect him with dread and terror; -- it is the duty of such an one to
   call off his thoughts from all things visibly present, and to fix them
   on the omnipresence and omniscience of God. He sits amongst those
   judges, though they acknowledge him not; he rules over them at his
   pleasure; he knows the cause of the oppressed, and justifies them
   whenever the world condemns, and can deliver them when he pleaseth.
   With the thoughts hereof did those holy souls support themselves when
   they stood before the fiery countenance of the bloody tyrant on the one
   hand, and the burning fiery furnace on the other: Dan. iii. 17, 18,
   "Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery
   furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not,
   be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor
   worship the golden image which thou hast set up." Thoughts of the
   presence and power of God gave them not only comfort and supportment
   under their distress, when they were alone and helpless, but courage
   and resolution to defy the tyrant to his face. And when the apostle was
   brought before Nero, that monster of cruelty and villainy, and "all men
   forsook him," he affirms that "the Lord stood by him and strengthened
   him," 2 Tim. iv. 17. He refreshed himself with thoughts of his
   presence, and had the blessed fruit of it.

   Wherefore, on such occasions, when the hearts of men are ready to
   quake, when they see all things about them filled with dread and
   terror, and all help far away, it is, I say, their duty and wisdom to
   abstract and take off their thoughts from all outward and present
   appearances, and to fix them on the presence of God. This will greatly
   change the scene of things in their minds, and they will find that
   strength, and power, and wisdom, are on their side alone, all that
   appears against them being but vanity, folly, and weakness.

   So when the servant of Elisha saw the place where they were compassed
   with a host, both horses and chariots, that came to take them, he cried
   out for fear, "Alas, my master! how shall we do?" But upon the prayer
   of the prophet, the Lord opening the eyes of the young man to see the
   heavenly guard that he had sent unto him, the mountain being full of
   horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha, his fear and trouble
   departed, 2 Kings vi. 15-17. And when, in the like extremity, God opens
   the eye of faith to behold his glorious presence, we shall no more be
   afraid of the dread of men. Herein did the holy martyrs triumph of old,
   and even despised their bloody persecutors. Our Saviour himself made it
   the ground of his supportment on the like occasion: John xvi. 32,
   "Behold," saith he to his disciples, his only friends, "the hour
   cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every one to his
   own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the
   Father is with me." Can we but possess our souls with the apprehension
   that when we are left alone, in our trials and dangers, from any
   countenance of friends or help of men, yet that indeed we are not
   alone, because the Father is with us, it will support us under our
   despondencies, and enable us unto our duties.

   4. Especial providential warnings call for thoughts of God's
   omnipresence and omniscience. So Jacob in his night vision instantly
   made this conclusion, "God is in this place, and I knew it not." We
   have frequently such warnings given unto us. Sometimes we have so in
   the things which are esteemed accidental, whence, it may be, we are
   strangely delivered; sometimes we have so in the things which we see to
   befall others, by thunder, lightning, storms at sea or land: for all
   the works of God, especially those that are rare and strange, have a
   voice whereby he speaks unto us. The first thing suggested unto a
   spiritual mind in such seasons will be. "God is in this place," -- "He
   is present that liveth and seeth," as Hagar confessed on the like
   occasion, Gen. xvi. 13, 14.

   Thirdly, Have frequent thoughts of God's omnipotency, or his almighty
   power. This most men, it may be, suppose they need not much exhortation
   unto; for none ever doubted of it. Who doth not grant it on all
   occasions? Men grant it, indeed, in general; for eternal power is
   inseparable from the first notion of the Divine Being. So are they
   conjoined by the apostle: "His eternal power and Godhead," Rom. i. 20.
   Yet few believe it for themselves and as they ought. Indeed, to believe
   the almighty power of God with reference unto ourselves and all our
   concernments, temporal and eternal, is one of the highest and most
   noble acts of faith, which includes all others in it: for this is that
   which God at first proposed alone as the proper object of our faith in
   our entrance into covenant with him, Gen. xvii. 1, "I am the Almighty
   God;" that which Job arrived unto after his long exercise and trial. "I
   know," saith he, "that thou canst do every thing, and no thought of
   thine can be hindered," chap. xlii. 2. "God hath spoken once," saith
   the psalmist; "twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God,"
   Ps. lxii. 11. It was that which God saw it necessary frequently to
   instruct him in; for we are ready to be affected with the appearances
   of present power in creatures, and to suppose that all things will go
   according unto their wills because of their power. But it is quite
   otherwise; all creatures are poor feeble ciphers, that can do nothing.
   Power belongs unto God; it is a flower of his crown imperial, which he
   will suffer none to usurp. If the proudest of them go beyond the bounds
   and limits of his present permission, he will send worms to eat them
   up, as he did to Herod.

   It is utterly impossible we should walk before God, unto his glory, or
   with any real peace, comfort, or satisfaction in our own souls, unless
   our minds are continually exercised with thoughts of his almighty
   power. Every thing that befalls us, every thing that we hear of which
   hath the least of danger in it, will discompose our minds, and either
   make us tremble like the leaves of the forest that are shaken with the
   wind, or betake ourselves to foolish or sinful relief, unless we are
   firmly established in the faith hereof. Consider the promises of God
   unto the church which are upon record, and as yet unaccomplished;
   consider the present state of the church in the world, with all that
   belongs unto it, in all the fears and dangers they are exposed unto, in
   all the evils they are exercised withal, -- and we shall quickly find
   that unless this sheet-anchor be well fixed, we shall be tossed up and
   down at all uncertainties, and exposed to most violent temptations,
   Rev. xix. 6. Unto this end are we called hereunto by God himself in his
   answer unto the despondent complaints of the church in its greatest
   dangers and calamities: Isa. xl. 28-31, "Hast thou not known? hast thou
   not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends
   of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of
   his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have
   no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be
   weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon
   the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
   eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not
   faint."

   Take one instance, which is the continual concernment of us all. We are
   obnoxious unto death every moment. It is never the farther from any of
   us because we think not of it as we ought. This will lay our bodies in
   the dust, from whence they will have no more disposition nor power in
   themselves to rise again than any other part of the mould of the earth.
   Their recovery must be an act of external almighty power, when God
   shall have a desire to the work of his hands, when he shall call, and
   we shall answer him out of the dust. And it will transmit the soul into
   an invisible world, putting a final end unto all relations, enjoyments,
   and circumstances here below. I speak not of them who are stout-hearted
   and far from righteousness, who live and die like beasts, or under the
   power of horrible presumption, without any due thoughts of their future
   and eternal state; but as unto others, what comfort or satisfaction can
   any man have in his life, whereon his all depends, and which is passing
   from him every moment, unless he hath continual thoughts of the mighty
   power of God, whereby he is able to receive his departing soul and to
   raise his body out of the dust?

   Not to insist on more particulars, thus is it with them who are
   spiritually minded; thus must it be with us all if we pretend a title
   unto that privilege: They are filled with thoughts of God, in
   opposition unto that character of wicked men, that "God is not in all
   their thoughts." And it is greatly to be feared that many of us, when
   we come to be weighed in this balance, will be found too light. Men may
   be in the performance of outward duties; they may hear the word with
   delight, and do many things gladly; they may escape the pollutions that
   are in the world through lust, and not run out into the same compass of
   excess and riot with other men: yet may they be strangers unto inward
   thoughts of God with delight and complacency. I cannot understand how
   it can be otherwise with them whose minds are over and over filled with
   earthly things, however they may satisfy themselves with pretences of
   their callings and lawful enjoyments, or that they are not any way
   inordinately set on the pleasures or profits of the world.

   To "walk with God," to "live unto him," is not merely to be found in an
   abstinence from outward sins, and in the performance of outward duties,
   though with diligence in the multiplication of them. All this may be
   done upon such principles, for such ends, with such a frame of heart,
   as to find no acceptance with God. It is our hearts that he requireth,
   and we can no way give them unto him but by our affections and holy
   thoughts of him with delight. This it is to be spiritually minded, this
   it is to walk with God. Let no man deceive himself; unless he thus
   abound in holy thoughts of God, unless our meditation of him be sweet
   unto us, all that we else pretend unto will fail us in the day of our
   trial.

   This is the first thing wherein we may evidence ourselves unto
   ourselves to be under the conduct of the minding of the Spirit, or to
   be spiritually minded; and I have insisted the longer on it, because it
   contains the first sensible egress of the Spirit of living waters in
   us, the first acting of spiritual life unto our own experience. I
   should now proceed unto the consideration of our affections, of whose
   frame and state these thoughts are the only genuine exposition; but
   whereas there are, or may be, some who are sensible of their own
   weakness and deficiency in the discharge of that part of this duty in
   being spiritually minded which we have passed through, and may fall
   under discouragements thereon, we must follow Him, as we are able, who
   "will not quench the smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed," by
   offering something unto the relief of them that are sincere under the
   sense of their own weakness.

Chapter X.

   Sundry things tendered unto such as complain that, they know not how,
   they are not able to abide in holy thoughts of God and spiritual or
   heavenly things, for their relief, instruction, and direction -- Rules
   concerning stated spiritual meditation.

   Some will say, yea, on many occasions do say, that there is not any
   thing in all their duty towards God wherein they are more at a loss
   than they are in this one, of fixing or exercising their thoughts or
   meditations on things heavenly or spiritual. They acknowledge it a
   duty; they see an excellency in it, with inexpressible usefulness: but
   although they often try and attempt it, they cannot attain unto any
   thing but what makes them ashamed both of it and themselves. Their
   minds, they find, are unsteady, apt to rove and wander, or give
   entertainment unto other things, and not to abide on the object which
   they design their meditation towards. Their abilities are small, their
   invention barren, their memories frail, and their judgments, to dispose
   of things into right order, weak and unable. They know not what to
   think on, for the most part; and when they fix on any thing, they are
   immediately at a loss as unto any progress, and so give over. Hence
   other thoughts, or thoughts of other things, take advantage to impose
   themselves on them, and what began in spiritual meditation ends in
   carnal vanity. On these considerations ofttimes they are discouraged to
   enter on the duty, ofttimes give it over so soon as it is begun, and
   are glad if they come off without being losers by their endeavours,
   which often befalls them. With respect unto other duties it is not so
   with them. Unto such as are really concerned in these things, unto whom
   their want and defect is a burden, who mourn under it, and desire to be
   freed from it or refreshed in their conflict with it, I shall offer the
   things that ensue:--

   First, That sense of the vanity of our minds which this consideration
   duly attended unto will give us, ought greatly to humble and abase our
   souls. Whence is it thus with us, that we cannot abide in thoughts and
   meditations of things spiritual and heavenly? Is it because they are
   such things as we have no great concernment in? It may be they are
   things worthless and unprofitable, so that it is to no purpose to spend
   our thoughts about them. The truth is, they alone are worthy, useful,
   and desirable; all other things in comparison of them are but "loss and
   dung." Or is it because the faculties and powers of our souls were not
   originally suited unto the contemplation of them and delight in them?
   This also is otherwise; they were all given unto us, all created of God
   for this end, all fitted with inclinations and power to abide with God
   in all things, without aversation or weariness. Nothing was so natural,
   easy, and pleasant unto them, as steadiness in the contemplation of God
   and his works. The cause, therefore, of all this evil lies at our own
   door. All this, therefore, and all other evils, came upon us by the
   entrance of sin. And therefore Solomon, in his inquiry after all the
   causes and effects of vanity, brings it under this head, "Lo, this only
   have I found, that God made man upright; but they have sought out many
   inventions," Eccles. vii. 29: for hereby our minds, that were created
   in a state of blessed adherence unto God, were wholly turned off from
   him, and not only so, but filled with enmity against him. In this
   state, that vanity which is prevalent in them is both their sin and
   their punishment: their sin, in a perpetual inclination unto things
   vain, foolish, sensual, and wicked, -- so the apostle describes it at
   large, Eph. iv. 17-19, Tit. iii. 3; and their punishment, in that,
   being turned off from the chiefest good, wherein alone rest is to be
   found, they are filled with darkness, confusion, and disquietment,
   being "like the troubled sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast up
   mire and dirt."

   By grace our minds are renewed, -- that is, changed and delivered from
   this frame; but they are so partially only. The principle of vanity is
   no longer predominant in us, to alienate us from the life of God, or to
   keep us in enmity against him. Those who are so renewed do not "walk in
   the vanity of their minds," as others do, Eph. iv. 17. They go up and
   down, in all their ways and occasions, with a stream of vain thoughts
   in their minds. But the remainders of it are effectually operative in
   us, in all the actings of our minds towards God, affecting them with
   uncertainty and instability: as he who hath received a great wound in
   any principal part of his body, though it may be so cured as that death
   shall not immediately ensue thereon, yet it may make him go weak and
   lame all his days, and hinder him in the exercise of all the powers of
   life. The vanity of our minds is so cured as to deliver us from
   spiritual death; but yet such a wound, such a weakness doth remain, as
   both weakens and hinders us in all the operations of spiritual life.
   Hence those who have made any progress in grace are sensible of their
   vanity as the greatest burden of their souls, and do groan after such a
   complete renovation of their minds as whereby they may be perfectly
   freed from it. This is that which they principally regard in that
   complaining desire, Rom. vii. 24, "O wretched man that I am! who shall
   deliver me from this body of death?" Yea, they groan under a sense of
   it every day, nor is any thing such a trouble unto them, observing how
   it defeats them in their designs to contemplate on heavenly things, how
   it frustrates their best resolutions to abide in the spiritual actings
   of faith and love, how they are imposed on by it with thoughts of
   things which, either in themselves or in their consequences, they most
   abhor. Nothing are they so afraid of, nothing is so grievous and
   burdensome unto them, nothing do they more groan for deliverance from.
   When there is war in any place, it behoveth them that are concerned to
   have an eye and regard unto all their enemies and their attempts
   against them; but if they are vigilant and diligent in their opposition
   unto those that are without that visibly contend with them, and in the
   meantime neglect such as traitorously act within among themselves,
   betraying their counsels and weakening their strength, they will be
   undoubtedly ruined. Wise men do first take care of what is within, as
   knowing if they are there betrayed, all they do against their open
   enemies is to no purpose. In the warfare wherein we are engaged, we
   have enemies of all sorts that openly and visibly, in various
   temptations, fight against our souls. These it is our duty to watch
   against, to conflict with, and to seek a conquest over. But it is this
   internal vanity of mind that endeavours in all things to betray us, to
   weaken us in all our graces, or to hinder their due operation, and to
   open the doors of our hearts unto our cursed enemies. If our principal
   endeavour be not to discover, suppress, and destroy this traitor, we
   shall not succeed in our spiritual warfare.

   This, therefore, being the original cause of all that disability of
   mind, as unto steadiness in holy thoughts and meditations, whereof you
   do complain, when you are affected therewith turn unto the
   consideration of that from whence it doth proceed. Labour to be humbled
   greatly, and to walk humbly, under a sense of the remainders of this
   vanity of mind. So some wholesome fruit may be taken from this bitter
   root, and meat may come out of this eater. If, when you cannot abide in
   holy thoughts of God and your relation unto him, you reflect on this
   cause of it, to your farther humiliation and self-abasement, your good
   design and purpose are not lost. Let such an one say, "I began to think
   of God, of his love and grace in Christ Jesus, of my duty towards him;
   and where now, in a few minutes, do I find myself? I am got unto the
   ends of the earth, into things useless and earthly, or am at such a
   loss as that I have no mind to proceed in the work wherein I was
   engaged. O wretched man that I am!' what a cursed enemy have I within
   me! I am ashamed of myself, weary of myself, I loathe myself. Who shall
   deliver me from this body of death?'" Such thoughts may be as useful
   unto him as those which he first designed.

   True it is, we can never be freed absolutely from all the effects of
   this vanity and instability of mind in this world. Unchangeable
   cleaving unto God always, in all the powers and affections of our
   minds, is reserved for heaven. But yet great degrees may be attained in
   the conquest and expulsion of it, such as I fear few have experience
   of, yet ought all to labour after. If we apply ourselves as we ought to
   the increase of spiritual light and grace; if we labour diligently to
   abide and abound in thoughts of spiritual things, and that in love to
   them and delight in them; if we watch against the entertainment and
   approbation of such thoughts and things in our minds as whereby this
   vain frame is pleased and confirmed, -- there is, though not an
   absolute perfection, yet a blessed degree of heavenly mindedness to be
   attained, and therein the nearest approach unto glory that in this
   world we are capable of. If a man cannot attain an athletic
   constitution of health, or a strength like that of Samson, yet, if he
   be wise, he will not omit the use of such means as may make him to be
   useful in the ordinary duties of life; and although we cannot attain
   perfection in this matter, -- which yet is our duty to be continually
   pressing after, -- yet, if we are wise, we will be endeavouring such a
   cure of this spiritual distemper as that we may be able to discharge
   all the duties of the life of God. But if men in all other things feed
   the vanity of their own minds; if they permit them to rove continually
   after things foolish, sensual, and earthly; if they willfully supply
   them with objects unto that end, and labour not by all means for the
   mortification of this evil frame, -- in vain shall they desire or
   expect to bring them at any time, on any occasion, to be steady in the
   thoughts of heavenly things. If it be thus with any, as it is to be
   feared it is with many, it is their duty to mind the words of our Lord
   Jesus Christ in the first place, "Make the tree good, and the fruit
   will be good," and not before. When the power of sanctifying grace hath
   made the mind habitually spiritual and heavenly, thoughts of such
   things will be natural unto it, and accompanied with delight; but they
   will not be so until the God of peace have sanctified us in our whole
   spirits, souls, and bodies, whereby we may be preserved blameless unto
   the coming of Jesus Christ.

   Secondly, Be always sensible of your own insufficiency to raise in your
   minds or to manage spiritual thoughts, or thoughts of things spiritual
   and heavenly, in a due manner. But in this case men are apt to suppose
   that as they may so they can think of what they please. Thoughts are
   their own, and therefore, be they of what sort they will, they need no
   assistance for them. They cannot think as they ought, they can do
   nothing at all; and nothing will convince them of their folly until
   they are burdened with an experience of the contrary, as unto spiritual
   things. But the advice given is expressly laid down by the apostle, in
   the instance of himself: 2 Cor. iii. 5, "Not that we are sufficient of
   ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of
   God." He speaks principally of ministers of the gospel, and that of
   such as were most eminently furnished with spiritual gifts and graces,
   as he declares, verse 6. And if it be so with them, and that with
   respect unto the work and duties of their calling, how much more is it
   so with others who have not their graces nor their office! Wherefore if
   men, without regard unto the present actual grace of God and the
   supplies of his Spirit, do suppose that they can of themselves exercise
   their minds in spiritual thoughts, and so only fret at themselves when
   they fall into disappointment, not knowing what is the matter with
   them, they will live in a lifeless, barren frame all their days.

   By the strength of their natural abilities, men may frame thoughts of
   God and heavenly things in their minds, according unto the knowledge
   they have of them. They may methodize them by rules of art, and express
   them elegantly unto others. But even while they do so, they may be far
   enough from being spiritually minded; for there may be in their
   thoughts no actings of faith, love, or holy delight in God, or any
   grace at all. But such alone are the things which we inquire after;
   they are such only as wherein the graces of the Spirit are in their
   proper exercise. With respect unto them we have no sufficiency in
   ourselves; all our sufficiency must be of God. There is no truth, among
   persons of light and knowledge, more generally granted in the notion of
   it than this, that of ourselves we can do nothing, and none more
   neglected in daily practice. Men profess they can do nothing of
   themselves, and yet go about their duties as if they could do all
   things.

   Thirdly, Remember that I have not at present treated of solemn stated
   meditation, concerning which other rules and instructions ought to be
   given. By solemn or stated meditation, I intend the thoughts of some
   subject spiritual and divine, with the fixing, forcing, and ordering of
   our thoughts about it, with a design to affect our own hearts and souls
   with the matter of it, or the things contained in it. By this design it
   is distinguished from the study of the word, wherein our principal aim
   is to learn the truth, or to declare it unto others; and so also from
   prayer, whereof God himself is the immediate object. But in meditation
   it is the affecting of our own hearts and minds with love, delight, and
   humiliation. At present I have only showed what it is to be spiritually
   minded, and that in this instance of our thoughts as they proceed from
   the habitual frame of our hearts and affections, or of what sort the
   constant course of our thoughts ought to be with respect unto all the
   occasions of the life of God. This persons may be in a readiness for
   who are yet unskilful in and unable for stated meditation; for there is
   required thereunto such an exercise of our natural faculties and
   abilities as some, through their weakness and ignorance, are incapable
   of. But as unto what we have hitherto insisted on, it is not
   unattainable by any in whom is the Spirit of faith and love; for it is
   but the frequent actings of them that I intend. Wherefore, do your
   hearts and affections lead you unto many thoughts of God and spiritual
   things? do they spring up in you as water in a well of living waters?
   are you ready on all occasions to entertain such thoughts, and to be
   conversant with them as opportunity doth offer itself? do you labour to
   have in a readiness what is useful for you with respect unto
   temptations and duties? is God in Christ, and the things of the gospel,
   the ordinary retreat of your souls? -- though you should not be able to
   carry on an orderly, stated meditation in your minds, yet you may be
   spiritually minded.

   A man may not have a capacity and ability to carry on a great trade of
   merchandise in the world, -- the knowledge of all sorts of commodities
   and seasons of the world and nations of it, with those contrivances and
   accounts which belong unto such trade, may be above his comprehension,
   and he may quickly ruin himself in undertaking such an employment, --
   yet may the abilities of this man serve him well enough to carry on a
   retail trade in a private shop, wherein perhaps he may thrive as well
   and get as good an estate as any of those whose greater capacities lead
   them forth unto more large and hazardous employments. So it may be with
   some in this case. The natural faculties of their minds are not
   sufficient to enable them unto stated meditation; they cannot cast
   things into that method and order which is required thereunto, nor
   frame the conceptions of their minds into words significant and
   expressive: yet as unto frequency of thoughts of God, and a disposition
   of mind thereunto, they may thrive and be skillful beyond most others
   of greater natural abilities. Howbeit, because even stated meditation
   is a necessary duty, yea, the principal way whereby our spiritual
   thoughts do profitably act themselves, I shall have regard thereunto in
   the following direction. Wherefore, --

   Fourthly, Whatever principle of grace we have in our minds, we cannot
   attain unto a ready exercise of it, in a way of spiritual meditation,
   or otherwise, without great diligence, nor without great difficulty.

   It was showed at the entrance of this discourse that there is a
   difference in this grace, between the essence, substance, or reality of
   it, which we would not exclude men from under many failings or
   infirmities, and the useful degrees of it, wherein it hath its
   principal exercise; as there is a difference in life natural and its
   actings in a weak, diseased, sickly body, and in that which is of a
   good constitution and in a vigorous health. Supposing the first, the
   reality of this grace, be wrought in us or implanted in our minds by
   the Holy Ghost, as a principal part of that new nature which is the
   workmanship of God, created in Christ Jesus unto good works; yet unto
   the growth and improvement of it, as of all other graces, our own
   diligent care, watchfulness, and spiritual striving in all holy duties,
   are required. Unless the most fruitful ground be manured, it will not
   bring forth a useful crop. Let not any think that this frame of a
   spiritual mind, wherein there is a disposition unto and a readiness for
   all holy thoughts of God, of Christ, of spiritual and heavenly things,
   at all times and on all occasions, will befall him and continue with
   him he knows not how. As good it is for a poor man to expect to be rich
   in this world without industry, or for a weak man to be strong and
   healthy without food and exercise, as to be spiritually minded without
   an earnest endeavour after it. It may be inquired what is requisite
   thereunto; and we may name some of those things without which such a
   holy frame will not be attained: as, --

   1. A continual watch is to be kept in and on the soul against the
   incursions of vain thoughts and imaginations, especially in such
   seasons wherein they are apt to obtain advantage. If they are suffered
   to make an inroad into the mind, if we accustom ourselves to give them
   entertainment, if they are wont to lodge within, in vain shall we hope
   or desire to be spiritually minded. Herein consists a principal part of
   that duty which our Saviour so frequently, so emphatically chargeth on
   us all, namely, to "watch," Mark xiii. 37. Unless we keep a strict
   watch herein, we shall be betrayed into the hands of our spiritual
   enemies; for all such thoughts are but making provision for the flesh,
   to fulfil its desires in the lusts thereof, however they may be
   disappointed as unto actual sin. This is the substance of the advice
   given us in charge, Prov. iv. 23, "Keep thy heart with all diligence;
   for out of it are the issues of life."

   2. Careful avoidance of all societies and businesses of this life which
   are apt, under various pretences, to draw and seduce the mind unto an
   earthly or sensual frame. If men will venture on those things which
   they have found by experience, or may find by their observation, that
   they seduce and draw off their minds from a heavenly frame unto that
   which is contrary thereunto, and will not watch unto their avoidance,
   they will be filled with the fruit of their own ways. Indeed, the
   common converse of professors among themselves and others, walking,
   talking, and behaving themselves like other men, being as full of the
   world as the world is of itself, hath lost the grace of being
   spiritually minded within, and stained the glory of profession without.
   The rule observed by David will manifest how careful we ought to be
   herein: Ps. xxxix. 1-3, "I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I
   sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the
   wicked is before me. I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even
   from good; and my sorrow was stirred. My heart was hot within me, while
   I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue;" -- which
   place was spoken unto before.

   3. A holy constraint put on the mind to abide in the duty of spiritual
   thoughts and meditations, pressing it continually with the
   consideration of their necessity and usefulness. The mind will be apt
   of itself to start aside from duties purely spiritual, through the
   mixture of the flesh abiding in it. The more inward and purely
   spiritual any duty is which hath no outward advantages, the more prone
   will the mind be to decline from it. It will be so more from private
   prayer than public, more from meditation than prayer. And other things
   will be apt to draw it aside, by objects without, and various stirrings
   of the affections within. A holy constraint is to be put upon it, with
   a sudden rejection of what rises up to its diversion or disturbance.
   Wherefore, we are to call in all constraining motives, such as the
   consideration of the love of Christ, 2 Cor. v. 14, to keep the mind
   steady unto its duty.

   4. Diligent use of means to furnish the soul with that light and
   knowledge of heavenly things which may administer continual matter of
   holy thoughts and meditations from within ourselves. This hath been
   spoken unto at large before. And the want hereof is that which keeps
   many from the least proficiency in these duties: as a man may have some
   skill or ability for a trade, yet if he have no materials to work upon,
   he must sit still, and let his trade alone. And so must men do as unto
   the work of holy meditation. Whatever be the ability of the natural
   faculties, their inventions or memories, if they are not furnished with
   knowledge of things spiritual and heavenly, which are the
   subject-matter of such meditations, they must let their work alone.
   Hence the apostle prays for the Colossians, that "the word of Christ
   might dwell in them richly in all wisdom," chap. iii. 16; that is, that
   they might abound in the knowledge of the mind of Christ, without which
   we shall be unfit for this duty.

   5. Unweariedness in our conflict with Satan, who, by various artifices
   and the injection of fiery darts, labours continually to divert us from
   these duties. He is seldom or never wanting unto this occasion. He who
   is furnished in any measure with spiritual wisdom and understanding may
   find him more sensibly at work in his craft and opposition with respect
   unto this duty than any other way. When we stand thus before the Lord,
   he is always at our right hand to resist us, and ofttimes his strength
   is great. Hence, as was observed, ofttimes men design really to
   exercise themselves in holy thoughts, but end in vain imaginations, and
   rather take up with trifles than continue in this duty. Steadiness in
   the resistance of him on these occasions is one great part of our
   spiritual warfare. And we may know that he is at work by his engines
   and methods; for they consist in his suggestions of vain, foolish, or
   corrupt imaginations. When they begin to rise in our minds at such
   times as we would engage them in spiritual meditation, we may know
   assuredly from whence they are.

   6. Continual watchful care that no root of bitterness spring up and
   defile us, that no lust or corruption be predominant in us. When it is
   so, if persons, in compliance with their convictions, do endeavour
   sometimes to be exercised in these duties, they shall labour in the
   very fire, where all their endeavours will be immediately consumed.

   7. Mortification unto the world in our affections and desires, with
   moderation in our endeavours after the needful things of it, are also
   necessary hereunto, yea, to that degree that without them no man can in
   any sense be said to be spiritually minded; for otherwise our
   affections cannot be so preserved under the power of grace as that
   spiritual things may be always savoury unto us.

   Some, it may be, will say, that if all these things are required
   thereunto, it will take up a man's whole life and time to be
   spiritually minded. They hope they may attain it at an easier rate, and
   not forego all other advantages and sweetnesses of life, which a strict
   observation of these things would cast them upon.

   I answer, that however it may prove a hard saying unto some, yet I must
   say it, and my heart would reproach me if I should not say, that if the
   principal part of our time be not spent about these things, whatever we
   suppose, we have indeed neither life nor peace. The first-fruits of all
   were to be offered unto God; and in sacrifices he required the blood
   and the fat of the inwards. If the best be not his, he will have
   nothing. It is so as to our time. Tell me, I pray you, how you can
   spend your time and your lives better, or to better purpose, and I
   shall say, Go on and prosper. I am sure some spend so much of their
   time so much worse as it is a shame to see it. Do you think you came
   into this world to spend your whole time and strength in your
   employments, your trades, your pleasures, unto the satisfaction of the
   "wills of the flesh and of the mind?" Have you time enough to eat, to
   drink, to sleep, to talk unprofitably, it may be corruptly, in all
   sorts of unnecessary societies, but have not enough to live unto God in
   the very essentials of that life which consists in these things? Alas!
   you came into the world under this law, "It is appointed to men once to
   die, and after this the judgment," Heb. ix. 27; and the end why your
   life is here granted unto you is that you may be prepared for that
   judgment. If this be neglected, if the principal part of your time be
   not improved with respect unto this end, you will fall under the
   sentence of it unto eternity.

   But men are apt to mistake in this matter. They may think that these
   things tend to take them off from their lawful employments and
   recreations, which they are generally afraid of, and unwilling to
   purchase any frame of mind at so dear a rate. They may suppose that to
   have men spiritually minded, we would make them mopes, and to disregard
   all the lawful occasions of life. But let not any be mistaken; I am not
   upon a design that will be easily, or, it may be, honestly defeated.
   Men are able to defend themselves in their callings and enjoyments, and
   to satisfy their consciences against any persuasions to the contrary:
   yet there is a season wherein we are obliged to part with all we have,
   and to give up ourselves wholly to follow Christ in all things, Matt.
   xix. 21; and if we neglect or refuse it in that season, it is an
   evidence that we are hypocrites. And there was a time when superstition
   had so much power on the minds of men, that multitudes were persuaded
   to forsake, to give up, all their interest in relations, callings,
   goods, possessions, and betake themselves unto tedious pilgrimages,
   yea, hard services in war, to comply with that superstition; and it is
   not to the glory of our profession that we have so few instances of men
   parting with all, and giving up themselves unto heavenly retirement.
   But I am at present on no such design; I aim not to take men out of
   their lawful earthly occasions, but to bring spiritual affections and
   thoughts into the management of them all. The things mentioned will
   deprive you of no time you can lay a claim unto, but sanctify it all.

   I confess he must be a great proficient in spirituality who dares
   venture on an absolute retirement, and he must be well satisfied that
   he is not called unto a usefulness among men inconsistent therewith:
   unto them it may prove a disadvantage. Yet this also is attainable, if
   other circumstances do concur. Men under the due exercise of grace and
   the improvement of it may attain unto that fixedness in heavenly
   mindedness, that unconcernment in all things here below, as to give
   themselves up entirely and continually unto heavenly meditation, unto a
   blessed advancement of all grace, and a near approach unto glory. And I
   would hope it was so with many of them in ancient times who renounced
   the world, with all circumstances of relations, state, inheritances,
   and betook themselves unto retirement in wildernesses, to abide always
   in divine contemplation. But afterward, when multitudes, whose minds
   were not so prepared by a real growth in all grace and mortification
   unto the world as they were, betook themselves under the same pretences
   unto a monastical retirement, the devil, the world, sensual lusts,
   superstition, and all manner of evils, pursued them, found them out,
   possessed them, unto the unspeakable damage and scandal of religion.

   This, therefore, is not that which I invite the common sort of
   believers unto. Let them that are able and free receive it. The
   generality of Christians have lawful callings, employments, and
   businesses, which ordinarily they ought to abide in. That they also may
   live unto God in their occasions, they may do well to consider two
   things:--

   (1.) Industry in men's callings is a thing in itself very commendable.
   If in nothing else, it hath an advantage herein, that it is a means to
   preserve men from those excesses in lust and riot which otherwise they
   are apt to run into. And if you consider the two sorts of men whereinto
   the generality of mankind are distributed, -- namely, of them who are
   industrious in their affairs, and those who spend their time, so far as
   they are able, in idleness and pleasure, -- the former sort are far
   more amiable and desirable. Howbeit it is capable of being greatly
   abused. Earthly mindedness, covetousness, devouring things holy as to
   times and seasons of duty, uselessness, and the like pernicious vices,
   do invade and possess the minds of men. There is no lawful calling that
   doth absolutely exclude this grace of being spiritually minded in them
   that are engaged in it, nor any that doth include it. Men may be in the
   meanest of lawful callings and be so, and men may be in the best and
   highest and not be so. Consider the calling of the ministry: The work
   and duty of it calls on those that are employed in it to have their
   minds and thoughts conversant about spiritual and heavenly things. They
   are to study about them, to meditate on them, to commit them to memory,
   to speak them out unto others. It will be said, "Surely such men must
   needs be spiritually minded." If they go no farther than what is
   mentioned, I say they must needs be so as printers must needs be
   learned, who are continually conversant about letters. A man may with
   great industry engage himself in these things, and yet his mind be most
   remote from being spiritual. The event doth declare that it may be so.
   And the reasons of it are manifest. It requires as much if not more
   watchfulness, more care, more humility, for a minister to be
   spiritually minded in the discharge of his calling, than for any other
   sort of men in theirs; and that, as for other reasons, so because the
   commonness of the exercise of such thoughts, with their design upon
   others in their expression, will take off their power and efficacy. And
   he will have little benefit by his own ministry who endeavours not in
   the first place an experience in his own heart of the power of the
   truths which he doth teach unto others. And there is evidently as great
   a failing herein among us as among any other sort of Christians, as
   every occasion of trial doth demonstrate.

   (2.) Although industry in any honest calling be allowable, yet unless
   men labour to be spiritually minded in the exercise of that industry,
   they have neither life nor peace. Hereunto all the things before
   mentioned are necessary; I know not how any of them can be abated; yea,
   more is required than is expressed in them. If you burn this roll,
   another must be written, and many like things must be added unto it.
   And the objection from the expense of time in the observance of them is
   of no force; for a man may do as much work whilst he is spiritually
   minded as whilst he is carnal. Spiritual thoughts will no more hinder
   you in your callings than those that are vain and earthly, which all
   sorts of men can find leisure for in the midst of their employments. If
   you have filled a vessel with chaff, yet you may pour into it a great
   deal of water, which will be contained in the same space and vessel;
   and if it be necessary that you should take in much of the chaff of the
   world into your minds, yet are they capable of such measures of grace
   as shall preserve them sincere unto God.

   Fifthly, This frame will never be preserved, nor the duties mentioned
   ever be performed in a due manner, unless we dedicate some part of our
   time peculiarly unto them. I speak unto them only concerning whom I
   suppose that they do daily set apart some portion of time unto holy
   duties, as prayer and reading of the word, and they find by experience
   that it succeeds well with them. For the most part, if they lose their
   seasons they lose their duties; for some have complained that the
   urgency of business and multiplicity of occasions driving them at first
   from the fixed time of their duties, hath brought them into a course of
   neglecting duty itself. Wherefore it is our wisdom to set apart
   constantly some part of our time unto the exercise of our thoughts
   about spiritual things in the way of meditation. And I shall close this
   discourse with some directions in this particular unto them who
   complain of their disability for the discharge of this duty:--

   1. Choose and separate a fit time or season, a time of freedom from
   other occasions and diversions. And because it is our duty to redeem
   time with respect unto holy duties, such a season may be the more
   useful the more the purchase of it stands us in. We are not at any time
   to serve God with what costs us nought, nor with any time that comes
   within the same rule. If we will allow only the refuse of our time unto
   this duty, when we have nothing else to do, and, it may be, through
   weariness of occasions are fit for nothing else, we are not to expect
   any great success in it. This is one pregnant reason why men are so
   cold and formal, so lifeless in spiritual duties, -- namely, the times
   and seasons which they allot unto them. When the body is wearied with
   the labour and occasions of the day, and, it may be, the mind in its
   natural faculties indisposed, even by the means of necessary
   refreshment, men think themselves meet to treat with God about the
   great concernments of his glory and their own souls! This is that which
   God condemneth by his prophet: Mal. i. 8, "If ye offer the blind for
   sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not
   evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or
   accept thy person?" Both the law of nature and all the laws of holy
   institutions do require that we should serve God with the best that we
   have, as all the fat of the inwards was to be offered in sacrifice; and
   shall we think to offer that time unto God wherein we are unmeet to
   appear before an earthly ruler? Yet such, in my account, are the
   seasons, especially the evening seasons, that most men choose for the
   duties of their holy worship. And you may do well to consider beyond
   the day and time which he hath taken unto himself by an everlasting
   law, how little of the choice of your time you have offered unto God as
   a free-will offering, that you may be excited to future diligence. If,
   therefore, you seriously intend this duty, choose the seasons for it
   wherein you are most fit, when even the natural vigour of your spirits
   is most free and active. Possibly some will say this may be such a time
   as when the occasions of the world do call most earnestly for your
   attendance unto them. I say that is the season I would recommend; and
   if you can conquer your minds to redeem it for God at any rate, your
   endeavours in it will be prosperous. However, trust not to times that
   will offer themselves. Take them not up at hazard. Let the time itself
   be a free-will offering to God, taken from the top of the heap, or the
   choicest part of your useful time.

   2. Preparation of mind unto a due reverence of God and spiritual things
   is required previously hereunto. When we go about this duty, if we rush
   into thoughts of heavenly things without a due reverential preparation,
   we shall quickly find ourselves at a loss See the rule, Eccles. v. 1,
   2. "Grace to serve God with reverence and godly fear" is required in
   all things wherein we have to do with him, as in this duty we have in
   an immediate and especial manner. Endeavour, therefore, in the first
   place, to get your hearts deeply affected with an awful reverence of
   God, and a holy regard unto the heavenly nature of the things you would
   meditate upon. Hereby your minds will be composed, and the roots of
   other thoughts, be they vain or earthly, which are apt to arise and
   divert you from this duty, will be cast out. The principles of these
   contrary thoughts are like Jacob and Esau; they struggle in the same
   womb, and oftentimes Esau will come first forth, and for a while seem
   to carry the birthright. If various thoughts do conflict in our minds,
   some for this world and some for another, those for this world may
   carry it for a season; but where a due reverence of God hath "cast out
   the bondwoman and her children," the workings of the flesh in its vain
   thoughts and imaginations, the mind will be at liberty to exercise
   itself on spiritual things.

   3. Earnest desires after a renewed sense and relish of spiritual things
   are required hereunto. If we engage into this duty merely on a
   conviction of the necessity of it, or set ourselves about it because we
   think we ought to do so, and it will not be well done utterly to
   neglect it, we may not expect to be successful in it; but when the soul
   hath at any time tasted that the Lord is gracious, when its meditations
   on him have been sweet, when spiritual things have had a savour and
   relish in the mind and affections, and hereon it comes unto this duty
   with earnest desires to have the like tastes, the like experience, yea,
   to have them increased, then is it in the way of a hopeful progress And
   this also will make us persevere in our endeavours to go through with
   what we undertake, -- namely, when we do know by former experience what
   is to be attained by it, if we dig and search for it as for a treasure.
   If you shall think that the right discharge of this duty may be
   otherwise attained, if you suppose that it deserves not all this cost
   and charge about it, judge by what is past whether it be not advisable
   to give it over and let it alone. As good lie quietly on the ground as
   continually attempt to rise and never once effect it. Remember how many
   successless attempts you have made upon it, and all have come to
   nothing, or that which is as bad as nothing. I cannot say that in this
   way you shall always succeed; but I fear you will never have success in
   this duty without such things as are of the same nature and use with
   it.

   When, after this preparation, you find yourselves yet perplexed and
   entangled, not able comfortably to persist in spiritual thoughts unto
   your refreshment, take these two directions for your relief:--

   1. Cry and sigh to God for help and relief. Bewail the darkness,
   weakness, and instability of your minds, so as to groan within
   yourselves for deliverance. And if your designed meditations do issue
   only in a renewed gracious sense of your own weakness and
   insufficiency, with application unto God for supplies of strength, they
   are by no means lost as unto a spiritual account. The thoughts of
   Hezekiah in his meditations did not seem to have any great order or
   consistency when he so expressed them: "Like a crane or a swallow, so
   did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking
   upward: O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me," Isa. xxxviii. 14.
   When the soul labours sincerely for communion with God, but sinks into
   broken, confused thoughts under the weight of its own weakness, yet if
   he look to God for relief, his chattering and mourning will be accepted
   with God and profitable unto himself.

   2. Supply the brokenness of your thoughts with ejaculatory prayers,
   according as either the matter of them or your defect in the management
   of them doth require. So was it with Hezekiah in the instance before
   mentioned. When his own meditations were weak and broken, he cries out
   in the midst of them, "O Lord, I am oppressed; undertake for me." And
   meditation is properly a mixture of spiritual apprehension of God and
   heavenly things in the thoughts and conceptions of the mind, with
   desires and supplications thereon.

   It is good and profitable to have some special designed subject of
   meditation in our thoughts. I have at large declared before what things
   are the proper objects of the thoughts of them that are spiritually
   minded; but they may be more peculiarly considered as the matter of
   designed meditation. And they may be taken out of some especial
   spiritual experience that we have lately had, or some warnings we have
   received of God, or something wherewith we have been peculiarly
   affected in the reading or preaching of the word, or what we find the
   present posture and frame of our minds and souls to require, or that
   which supplies all most frequently, -- the person and grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. If any thing of this nature be peculiarly designed
   antecedently unto this duty, and a season be sought for it with respect
   thereunto, the mind will be fixed and kept from wandering after a
   variety of subjects, wherein it is apt to lose itself and bring nothing
   to perfection.

   Lastly, Be not discouraged with an apprehension that all you can attain
   unto in the discharge of this duty is so little, so contemptible, as
   that it is to no purpose to persist in it; nor be wearied with the
   difficulties you meet withal in its performance. You have to do with
   Him only in this matter who "will not break the bruised reed, nor
   quench the smoking flax," whose will it is that none should "despise
   the day of small things." And "if there be" in this duty "a ready mind,
   it is accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what
   he hath not." He that can bring into this treasury only the mites of
   broken desires and ejaculatory prayers, so they be his best, shall not
   come behind them who cast into it out of their greater abundance in
   ability and skill. To faint and give out because we cannot rise unto
   such a height as we aim at is a fruit of pride and unbelief. He who
   finds himself to gain nothing by continual endeavours after holy, fixed
   meditations, but only a living, active sense of his own vileness and
   unworthiness, is a sufficient gainer by all his pains, cost, and
   charge. But ordinarily it shall not be so; constancy in the duty will
   give ability for it. Those who conscientiously abide in its performance
   shall increase in light, wisdom, and experience, until they are able to
   manage it with great success.

   These few plain directions may possibly be of some use unto the weaker
   sort of Christians, when they find a disability in themselves unto the
   discharge of this duty, wherein those who are spiritually minded ought
   to be peculiarly exercised.

Chapter XI.

   The seat of spiritual mindedness in the affections -- The nature and
   use of them -- The ways and means used by God himself to call the
   affections of men from the world.

   In the account given at the entrance of this discourse of what it is to
   be spiritually minded, it was reduced under three heads:--

   The first was, The habitual frame, disposition, and inclination of the
   mind in its affections.

   The second was, The usual exercise of the mind in its thoughts,
   meditations, and desires, about heavenly things.

   Whereunto, thirdly, was added, The complacency of mind in that relish
   and savour which it finds in spiritual things so thought and meditated
   on.

   The second of these hath hitherto alone been spoken unto, as that which
   leads the way unto the others, and gives the most sensible evidence of
   the state inquired after. Therein consists the stream, which, rising in
   the fountain of our affections, runs into a holy rest and complacency
   of mind.

   The first and last I shall now handle together, and therein comprehend
   the account of what it is to be spiritually minded.

   Spiritual affections, whereby the soul adheres unto spiritual things,
   taking in such a savour and relish of them as wherein it finds rest and
   satisfaction, is the peculiar spring and substance of our being
   spiritually minded. This is that which I shall now farther explain and
   confirm.

   The great contest of heaven and earth is about the affections of the
   poor worm which we call man. That the world should contend for them is
   no wonder; it is the best that it can pretend unto. All things here
   below are capable of no higher ambition than to be possessed of the
   affections of men; and, as they lie under the curse, it can do us no
   greater mischief than by prevailing in this design. But that the holy
   God should as it were engage in the contest and strive for the
   affections of man, is an effect of infinite condescension and grace.
   This he doth expressly: "My son," saith he, "give me thine heart,"
   Prov. xxiii. 26. It is our affections he asketh for, and comparatively
   nothing else. To be sure, he will accept of nothing from us without
   them; the most fat and costly sacrifice will not be accepted if it be
   without a heart. All the ways and methods of the dispensation of his
   will by his word, all the designs of his effectual grace, are suited
   unto and prepared for this end, -- namely, to recover the affections of
   man unto himself. So he expresseth himself concerning his word: Deut.
   x. 12, "And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee,
   but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,
   and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy
   soul?" And as unto the word of his grace, he declares it unto the same
   purpose: chap. xxx. 6, "And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine
   heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all
   thine heart, and with all thy soul."

   And, on the other side, all the artifices of the world, all the paint
   it puts on its face, all the great promises it makes, an the false
   appearances and attires it clothes itself withal by the help of Satan,
   have no other end but to draw and keep the affections of men unto
   itself. And if the world be preferred before God in this address which
   is made unto us for our affections, we shall justly perish with the
   world unto eternity, and be rejected by him whom we have rejected,
   Prov. i. 24-31.

   Our affections are upon the matter our all. They are all we have to
   give or bestow; the only power of our souls whereby we may give away
   ourselves from ourselves and become another's. Other faculties of our
   souls, even the most noble of them, are suited to receive in unto our
   own advantage; by our affections we can give away what we are and have.
   Hereby we give our hearts unto God, as he requireth. Wherefore, unto
   him we give our affections unto whom we give our an, -- ourselves and
   all that we have; and to whom we give them not, whatever we give, upon
   the matter we give nothing at all.

   In what we do unto or for others, whatsoever is good, valuable, or
   praiseworthy in it, proceeds from the affection wherewith we do it. To
   do any thing for others without an animating affection, is but a
   contempt of them; for we judge them really unworthy that we should do
   any thing for them. To give to the poor upon their importunity without
   pity or compassion, to supply the wants of the saints without love or
   kindness, with other actings and duties of the like nature, are things
   of no value, things that recommend us neither unto God nor men. It is
   so in general with God and the world. Whatsoever we do in the service
   of God, whatever duty we perform on his command, whatever we undergo or
   suffer for his name's sake, if it proceed not from the cleaving of our
   souls unto him by our affections, it is despised by him; he owns us
   not. As "if a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
   it would utterly be contemned," Cant. viii. 7, -- it is not to be
   bought or purchased with riches; so if a man would give to God an the
   substance of his house without love, it would in like manner be
   despised. And however, on the other hand, we may be diligent,
   industrious, and sedulous, in and about the things of this world, yet
   if it have not our affections, we are not of the world, we belong not
   unto it. They are the seat of all sincerity, which is the jewel of
   divine and human conversation, the life and soul of every thing that is
   good and praiseworthy. Whatever men pretend, as their affections are,
   so are they. Hypocrisy is a deceitful interposition of the mind, on
   various reasons and pretences, between men's affections and their
   profession, whereby a man appears to be what he is not. Sincerity is
   the open avowment of the reality of men's affections; which renders
   them good and useful.

   Affections are in the soul as the helm in the ship; if it be laid hold
   on by a skillful hand, he turneth the whole vessel which way he
   pleaseth. If God hath the powerful hand of his grace upon our
   affections, he turns our souls unto a compliance with his institutions,
   instructions, in mercy, afflictions, trials, all sorts of providences,
   and holds them firm against all winds and storms of temptation, that
   they shall not hurry them on pernicious dangers. Such a soul alone is
   tractable and pliable unto all intimations of God's will.

   All others are stubborn and obstinate, stout-hearted and far from
   righteousness. And when the world hath the hand on our affections, it
   turns the mind, with the whole industry of the soul, unto its interest
   and concerns. And it is in vain to contend with any thing that hath the
   power of our affections in its disposal; it will prevail at last.

   On all these considerations it is of the highest importance to consider
   aright how things are stated in our affections, and what is the
   prevailing bent of them. "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the
   countenance of his friend," saith the wise man, Prov. xxvii. 17. Every
   man hath his edge, which may be, sharpened by outward helps and
   advantages. The predominant inclination of a man's affections is his
   edge. According as that is set, so he cutteth and works; that way he is
   sharp and keen, but blunt unto all other things.

   Now, because it must be that our affections are either spiritual or
   earthly in a prevailing degree, that either God hath our hearts or the
   world, that our edge is towards heaven or towards things here below,
   before I come to give an account of the nature and operations of
   spiritual affections, I shall consider and propose some of those
   arguments and motives which God is pleased to make use of to call off
   our affections from the desirable things of this world; for as they are
   weighty and cogent, such as cannot be neglected without the greatest
   contempt of divine wisdom and goodness, so they serve to press and
   enforce those arguments and motives that are proposed unto us to set
   our affections on things that are above, which is to be spiritually
   minded.

   First, He hath, in all manner of instances, poured contempt on the
   things of this world, in comparison of things spiritual and heavenly.
   All things here below were at first made beautiful and in order, and
   were declared by God himself to be exceeding good, and that not only in
   their being and nature, but in the use whereunto they were designed.
   They were then desirable unto men, and the enjoyment of them would have
   been a blessing, without danger or temptation; for they were the
   ordinance of God to lead us unto the knowledge of him and love unto
   him. But since the entrance of sin, whereby the world fell under the
   curse and into the power of Satan, the things of it, in his management,
   are become effectual means to draw off the heart and affections from
   God; for it is the world and the things of it, as summed up by the
   apostle,1 John ii. 15, 16, that strive alone for our affections, to be
   the objects of them. Sin and Satan do but woo for the world, to take
   them off from God. By them doth the god of this world blind the eyes of
   them that believe not; and the principal way whereby he worketh in them
   is by promises of satisfaction unto all the lusts of the minds of men,
   with a proposal of whatever is dreadful and terrible in the want of
   them. Being now in this state and condition, and used unto this end,
   through the craft of Satan and the folly of the minds of men, God hath
   showed, by various instances, that they are all vain, empty,
   unsatisfactory, and every way to be despised in comparison of things
   eternal:--

   1. He did it most eminently and signally in the life, death, and cross
   of Christ. What can be seen or found in this world, after the Son of
   God hath spent his life in it, not having where to lay his head, and
   after he went out of it on the cross? Had there been aught of real
   worth in things here below, certainly he had enjoyed it; if not crowns
   and empires, which were all in his power, yet such goods and
   possessions as men of sober reasonings and moderate at: affections do
   esteem a competency. But things were quite otherwise disposed, to
   manifest that there is nothing of value or use in these things, but
   only to support nature unto the performance of service unto God;
   wherein they are serviceable unto eternity. He never attained, he never
   enjoyed, more than daily supplies of bread out of the stores of
   providence; and which alone he hath instructed us to pray for, Matt.
   vi. 11. In his cross the world proclaimed all its good qualities and
   all its powers, and hath given unto them that believe its naked face to
   view and contemplate; nor is it now one jot more comely than it was
   when it had gotten Christ on the cross. Hence is that inference and
   conclusion of the apostle: Gal. vi. 14, "God forbid that I should
   glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is
   crucified unto me, and I unto the world;" -- "Since I have believed,
   since I have had a sense of the power and virtue of the cross of
   Christ, I have done with all things in this world; it is a dead thing
   unto me, nor have I any affection for it." This is that which made the
   difference between the promises of the old covenant and the new: for
   they were many of them about temporal things, the good things of this
   world and this life; those of the new are mostly of things spiritual
   and eternal. God would not call off the church wholly from a regard
   unto these things, until he had given a sufficient demonstration of
   their emptiness, vanity, and insufficiency, in the cross of Christ, 2
   Cor. iv. 16-18.

   Whither so fast, my friend? What meaneth this rising so early and going
   to bed late, eating the bread of carefulness? Why this diligence, why
   these contrivances, why these savings and hoardings of riches and
   wealth? To what end is all this care and counsel? "Alas!" saith one,
   "it is to get that which is enough in and of this world for me and my
   children, to prefer them, to raise an estate for them, which, if not so
   great as others, may yet be a competency; to give them some
   satisfaction in their lives and some reputation in the world." Fair
   pretences, neither shall I ever discourage any from the exercise of
   industry in their lawful callings; but yet I know that with many this
   is but a pretence and covering for a shameful engagement of their
   affections unto the world. Wherefore, in all these things, be persuaded
   sometimes to have an eye to Jesus, the author and finisher of our
   faith. Behold how he is set before us in the gospel, poor, despised,
   reproached, persecuted, nailed to the cross, and all by this world.
   Whatever be your designs and aims, let his cross continually interpose
   between your affections and this world. If you are believers, your
   hopes are within a few days to be with him for evermore. Unto him you
   must give an account of yourselves, and what you have done in this
   world. Will it be acceptable with him to declare what you have saved of
   this world, what you have gained, what you have preserved and embraced
   yourselves in, and what you have left behind you? Was this any part of
   his employment and business in this world? hath he left us an example
   for any such course? Wherefore, no man can set his affections on things
   here below who hath any regard unto the pattern of Christ, or is in any
   measure influenced with the power and efficacy of his cross. "My love
   is crucified," said a holy martyr of old: he whom his soul loved was
   so, and in him his love unto all things here below. Do you, therefore,
   find your affections ready to be engaged unto, or too much entangled
   with, the things of this world? are your desires of increasing them,
   your hopes of keeping them, your fears of losing them, your love unto
   them and delight in them, operative in your minds, possessing your
   thoughts and influencing your conversations? -- turn aside a little,
   and by faith contemplate the life and death of the Son of God; a
   blessed glass will it be, where you may see what contemptible things
   they are which you perplex yourselves about. Oh, that any of us should
   love or esteem the things of this world, the power, riches, goods, or
   reputation of it, who have had a spiritual view of them in the cross of
   Christ!

   It may be it will be said that the circumstances mentioned were
   necessary unto the Lord Christ, with respect unto the especial work he
   had to do as the Saviour and Redeemer of the church; and therefore it
   doth not hence follow that we ought to be poor and want all things, as
   he did. I confess it doth not, and therefore do all along make an
   allowance for honest industry in our callings. But this follows
   unavoidably hereon, that what he did forego and trample on for our
   sake, that ought not to be the object of our affections; nor can such
   affections prevail in us if he dwell in our hearts by faith.

   2. He hath done the same in his dealings with the apostles, and
   generally with all that have been most dear unto him and instrumental
   unto the interest of his glory in the world, especially since life and
   immortality were brought to light by the gospel. He had great work to
   do by the apostles, and that of the greatest use unto his interest, and
   kingdom. The laying of the foundations of the glorious kingdom of
   Christ in the world was committed unto them. Who would not think that
   he should provide for them, if not principalities or popedoms, yet at
   least archbishoprics and bishoprics, with other good ecclesiastical
   dignities and preferments? Hereby might they have been made meet to
   converse with princes, and been freed from the contempt of the vulgar.
   But Infinite Wisdom did otherwise dispose of them and their concerns in
   this world; for as God was pleased to exercise them with the common
   afflictions and calamities of this life, which he makes use of to take
   off the sweetness of present enjoyments, so they lived and died in a
   condition of poverty, distress, persecution, and reproach. God set them
   forth as examples unto other ends, -- namely, of light, grace, zeal,
   and holiness in their lives, -- so as to manifest of how little
   concernment unto our own blessedness or an interest in his love is the
   abundance of all things here below, as also that the want of them all
   may consist with the highest participation of his love and favour: 1
   Cor. iv. 9, 11-13, "I think that God hath set forth us the apostles
   last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto
   the world, and to angels, and to men. Even unto this present hour we
   both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no
   certain dwelling-place; and labour, working with our own hands: being
   reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it; being defamed, we
   entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring
   of all things unto this day." And if the consideration hereof be not of
   weight with others, undoubtedly it ought to be so with them who are
   called to preach the gospel, and are the successors to the apostles.
   There can be nothing more uncouth, absurd, and shameful, nothing more
   opposite unto the intimation of the wisdom and will of God in his
   dealings with those first and most honourable dispensers of it, than
   for such persons to seek and follow greedily after secular advantages,
   in worldly power, riches, wealth, and honour. Hence there hath been in
   former ages an endeavour to separate such persons as were by any means
   dedicated unto the ministry of the gospel from all secular dignities
   and revenues; yea, some maintained that they were to enjoy nothing of
   their own, but were to live on alms or the free contributions of the
   people. But this was quickly condemned as heresy in Wycliffe and
   others. Yet another sort set up that would pretend thereunto as unto
   themselves, though they would not oblige all others unto the same rule.
   This produced some swarms of begging friars, whom they of the church,
   who were in possession of wealth and power, thought meet to laugh at
   and let alone. Of late years this contest is at an end. The clergy have
   happily gotten the victory, and esteem all due unto them that they can
   by any ways obtain; nor is there any greater crime than for a man to be
   otherwise minded. But these things are not our present concernment.
   From the beginning it was not so; and it is well if, in such a way, men
   are able to maintain the frame of mind inquired after, which is life
   and peace.

   3. God continues to cast contempt on these things, by giving always
   incomparably the greatest portion of them unto the vilest men and his
   own avowed enemies. This was a temptation under the old covenant, but
   is highly instructive under the new. None will judge those things to be
   of real value which a wise man casts out daily unto swine, making
   little or no use of them in his family. Those monsters of men, Nero and
   Heliogabalus, had more interest in, and more power over, the things of
   this world than ever had the best of men; -- such villains in nature,
   so pernicious unto human society, that their not-being was the interest
   of mankind; but yet more of the world poured on them than they knew
   either how to enjoy, possess, use, or abuse. Look on all the principal
   treasures and powers of this world as in the hand of one of these
   monsters, and there disposed of by divine providence, and you may see
   at what rate God values them.

   At this day, the greatest, most noble, wealthy, and fruitful parts of
   the earth are given unto the great Turk, with some other eastern
   potentates, either Mohammedans or Pagans, who are prepared for eternal
   destruction. And if we look nearer home, we may see in whose hands is
   the power of the chiefest nations of Europe, and unto what end it is
   used. The utmost of what some Christian professors among ourselves are
   intent and designing upon, as that which would render them wondrous
   happy, in their own apprehensions, put hundreds of them together, and
   it would not answer the waste made by the forementioned beasts every
   day.

   Doth not God proclaim herein that the things of this world are not to
   be valued or esteemed? If they were so, and had a real worth in
   themselves, would the holy and righteous God make such a distribution
   of them? The most of those whom he loves, who enjoy his favour, not
   only have comparatively the meanest share of them, but are exercised
   with all the evils that the destitution and want of them can be
   accompanied withal. His open and avowed enemies, in the meantime, have
   more than they know what to do withal Who would set his heart and
   affections on those things which God poureth into the bosoms of the
   vilest men, to be a snare unto them here and an aggravation of their
   condemnation forever? It seems you may go and take the world, and take
   the curse, death and hell, along with it, but "what will it profit a
   man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" What can any man do
   on the consideration hereof, who will not forego all his hopes and
   expectations from God, but retreat unto the faith of things spiritual
   and eternal, as containing an excellency in them incomparably above all
   that he enjoyed here below?

   4. He doth continue to give perpetual instances of their uncertainty
   and unsatisfactoriness, in the utter disappointment of men that have
   had expectations from them. The ways hereof are so various, and the
   instances so multiplied, as that most men in the world, -- unless they
   are like the fool in the Gospel, who bade his soul take its ease for
   many years, because his barns were full, -- live in perpetual fears and
   apprehensions that they shall speedily lose whatever they enjoy, or are
   under the power of stupid security. But as unto this consideration of
   them, there is such an account given by the wise man as unto which
   nothing can be added, or which no reason or experience is able to
   contradict, Eccles. ii.. By these and the like ways doth God cast
   contempt on all things here below, discovering the folly and falseness
   of the promises which the world makes use of to allure our affections
   unto itself. This, therefore, is to be laid as the foundation in all
   our considerations unto what or whom we shall cleave by our affections,
   that God hath not only declared the insufficiency of these things to
   give us that rest and happiness which we seek after, but also poured
   contempt upon them, in his holy, wise disposal of them in the world.

   Secondly, God hath added unto their vanity by shortening the lives of
   men, reducing their continuance in this world unto so short and
   uncertain a season as it is impossible they should take any solid
   satisfaction in what they enjoy here below. So it is expressed by the
   psalmist, "Behold, thou hast made my days as an hand-breadth; and mine
   age is as nothing before thee." Hence he draws two conclusions:-- 1.
   That "every man at his best state is altogether vanity." 2. That "every
   man walketh in a vain show: surely they are disquieted in vain: he
   heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them," Ps. xxxix.
   5, 6. The uncertainty and shortness of the lives of men render all
   their endeavours and contrivances about earthly things both vain and
   foolish. When men lived eight or nine hundred years, they had
   opportunity to suck out all the sweetness that was in
   creature-comforts, to make large provisions of them, and to have long
   projections about them; but when they had so, they all issued in that
   violence, oppression, and wickedness, which brought the flood on the
   world of ungodly men. And it still so abides. The more of and the
   longer men enjoy these things, the more, without the sovereign
   preservative of grace, will they abound in sin and provocation of God.
   But God hath reduced the life of man unto the small pittance of seventy
   years, casting what may fall out of a longer continuance into travail
   and sorrow. Besides, that space is shortened with the most, by various
   and innumerable incidences and occasions. Wherefore, in these seventy
   years, consider how long it is before men begin to have a taste or gust
   of the things of this life; how many things fall in cross, to make us
   weary of them before the end of our days; how few among us (not one of
   a thousand) attain that age; what is the uncertainty of all men living
   as to the continuance of their lives unto the next day; and we shall
   see that the holy, wise God hath left no such season for their
   enjoyment as might put a value upon them. And when, on the other hand,
   it is remembered that this man, who is of such short continuance in
   this world, is yet made for eternity, eternal blessedness or misery,
   which state depends wholly on his interest on things above, and setting
   his affections on them, they must forfeit all their reason, as well as
   bid defiance unto the grace of God, who give them up unto things below.

   Thirdly, God hath openly and fully declared the danger that is in these
   things, as unto their enjoyment and use. And what multitudes of souls
   miscarry by an inordinate adherence unto them! for they are the matter
   of those temptations whereby the souls of men are ruined forever; the
   fuel that supplies the fire of their lusts, until they are consumed by
   it.

   Men under the power of spiritual convictions fall not into sin, fail
   not eternally, but by the means of temptation; that is the mire wherein
   this rush doth grow. [As] for others, who live and die in the madness
   and wildness of nature, without any restraint in their minds from the
   power of convictions, they need no external temptations, but only
   opportunities to exert their lusts. But [as] for those who, by any
   means, are convinced of sin, righteousness, and judgment, so as to
   design the ordering of their lives with respect unto the sense they
   have of them, they fall not into actual sin but upon temptations. That,
   whatever it be, which causeth, occasioneth, and prevaileth on, a
   convinced person unto sin, that is temptation. Wherefore, this is the
   great means of the ruin of the souls of men.

   Now, though there are many principles of temptation, many causes that
   actually concur unto its efficacy, as sin, Satan, and other men, yet
   the matter of almost all ruinous temptations is taken out of this world
   and the things of it. Thence doth Satan take all his darts; thence do
   evil men derive all the ways and means whereby they corrupt others; and
   from thence is all the fuel of sin and lust taken. And, which adds unto
   this evil, all that is in the world contributes its utmost thereunto.
   "All that is in the world" is "the lust of the flesh, and the lust of
   the eyes, and the pride of life," 1 John ii. 16. It is not a direct,
   formal annumeration of the things that are in the world, nor a
   distribution of them under several heads, but it is so of the principal
   lusts of the minds of men, whereunto all things in the world are
   subservient. Wherefore, not only the matter of all temptations is taken
   out of the world, but every thing that is in the world is apt and fit
   to be abused unto that end; for it were easy to show that there is
   nothing desirable or valuable in this whole world, but it is reducible
   unto a subserviency unto one or other of these lusts, and is applicable
   unto the interest and service of temptations and sins.

   When men hear of these things, they are apt to say, "Let the dream be
   unto them that are openly wicked, and the interpretation of it unto
   them that are profligate in sin." Unto unclean persons, drunkards,
   oppressors, proud, ambitious persons, it may be it is so; but as unto
   them, they use the things of this world with a due moderation, so as
   they are no snare unto them! But to own they are used unto what end
   soever, if the affections of men are set upon them, one way or other,
   there is nothing in the world but is thus a snare and temptation.
   However, we should be very careful how we adhere unto or undervalue
   that which is the cause and means of the ruin of multitudes of souls.
   By the warnings given us hereof doth God design, as unto the use of
   means, to teach us the vanity and danger of fixing our affections on
   things below.

   Fourthly, Things are so ordered in the holy, wise dispensation of God's
   providence, that it requires much spiritual wisdom to distinguish
   between the use and the abuse of these things, between a lawful care
   about them and an inordinate cleaving unto them. Few distinguish aright
   here, and therefore in these things will many find their great mistake
   at the last day. [For] the disappointments that they will fall under,
   as to what concerns their earthly enjoyments, and the use of them
   wherewith they were intrusted, see Matt. xxv. 34, to the end of the
   chapter.

   It is granted that there is a lawful use of these things, a lawful care
   and industry about them; so it is also acknowledged, it cannot be
   denied, that there is an abuse of them, springing from an inordinate
   love and cleaving unto them. But here men deceive themselves, taking
   their measures by the most crooked, uncertain rules. Some make their
   own inclinations the rule and measure of what is lawful and allowable;
   some, the example of others; some, the course of the world; some, their
   own real or pretended necessities. They confess that there is an
   inordinate love of those things, and an abuse of them, in excesses of
   various sorts, which the Scripture plainly affirms, and which
   experience gives open testimony unto; but as unto their state and
   circumstances, their care, love, and industry are all allowable. That
   which influenceth all these persons is self-love, which inveterate,
   corrupt affections and false reasonings do make an application of unto
   these occasions.

   Hence we have men approving of themselves as just stewards of their
   enjoyments, whilst others judge them hard, covetous, earthly-minded, no
   way laying out what they are intrusted withal unto the glory of God in
   any due proportion. Others also think not amiss of themselves in this
   kind, who live in palpable excesses, either of pride of life, or
   sensual pleasures, vain apparel, or the like. So, in particular, most
   men in their feastings and entertainments walk in direct contempt of
   the rule which our Saviour gives in that case, Luke xiv. 12-14, and yet
   approve themselves therein.

   But what if any of us should be mistaken in our rule and the
   application of it unto our conditions? Men at sea may have a fair gale
   of wind, wherewith they may sail freely and smoothly for a season, and
   yet, instead of being brought into a port, be cast by it at last on
   destructive shelves or rocks.

   And what if that which we esteem allowable love, care, and industry,
   should prove to be the fruit of earthly affections, inordinate and
   predominant in us? What if we miss in our measures, and that which we
   approve of in ourselves should be disapproved of God? We are cast
   forever; we belong unto the world; and with the world we shall perish.

   It may be said, that "if it be so difficult to distinguish between
   these things, -- namely, the lawful use of things here below and their
   abuse, the allowable industry about them and the inordinate love of
   them, -- on the knowledge whereof our eternal condition depends, it is
   impossible but men must spend their time in solicitous anxiety of mind,
   as not knowing when they have aright discharged their duty."

   Ans. 1. I press these things at present no farther but only to allow
   how dangerous a thing it is for any to incline in his affections unto
   the things of this world, wherein an excess is ruinous and hardly
   discoverable. Surely no wise man will venture freely and frequently
   unto the edge of such a precipice. He will be jealous of his measures,
   lest they will not hold by the rule of the word. And a due sense hereof
   is the best preservative of the soul from cleaving inordinately unto
   things below. And when God in any instance, by afflictions or
   otherwise, shows unto believers their transgression herein, and how
   they have exceeded, Job xxxvi. 8, 9, it makes them careful for the
   future. They will now or never be diligent that they fall not under
   that peremptory rule, 1 John ii. 15.

   2. When the soul is upright and sincere, there is no need in this case
   of any more solicitousness or anxiety of mind than there is unto or
   about other duties; but when it is biassed and acted by self-love, and
   its more strong inclinations unto things present, it is impossible men
   should enjoy solid peace, or be free from severe reflections on them by
   their own consciences, in such seasons wherein they are awakened unto
   their duty and the consideration of their state, nor have I any thing
   to tender for their relief. With others it is not so, and therefore I
   shall so far digress in this place as to give some directions unto
   those who, in sincerity, would be satisfied in this lawful use and
   enjoyment of earthly things, so as not to adhere unto them with
   inordinate affection:--

   1. Remember always that you are not proprietors or absolute possessors
   of those things, but only stewards of them. With respect unto men, you
   are or may be just proprietors of what you enjoy; but with respect unto
   Him who is the great possessor of heaven and earth, you are but
   stewards. This stewardship we are to give an account of, as we are
   taught in the parable, Luke xvi. 1, 2. This rule always attended unto
   will be a blessed guide in all instances and occasions of duty.

   But if a man be left in trust with houses and large possessions, as a
   steward for the right lord, owner, and proprietor of them, if he fall
   into a pleasing dream that they are all his own, and use them
   accordingly, it will be a woful surprisal unto him when he shall be
   called to account for all that he hath received and laid out, whether
   he will or no, and when indeed he hath nothing to pay. It will scarce
   be otherwise with them at the great day who forget the trust which is
   committed to them, and suppose they may do what they will with what
   they call their own.

   2. There is nothing, in the ways of getting, enjoying, or using of
   these things, but giveth its own evidence unto spiritual wisdom whether
   it be within the bounds of duty or no. Men are not lightly deceived
   herein, but when they are evidently under the power of corrupt
   affections, or will not at all attend unto themselves and the language
   of their own consciences. It is a man's own fault alone if he know not
   wherein he doth exceed.

   A due examination of ourselves in the sight of God with respect unto
   these things, the frame and actings of our minds in them, will greatly
   give check unto our corrupt inclinations and discover the folly of
   those reasonings whereby we deceive ourselves into the love of earthly
   things, or justify ourselves therein, and bring to light the secret
   principle of self-love, which is the root of all this evil.

   3. If you would be able to make a right judgment in this case, be sure
   that you have another object for your affections, which hath a
   predominant interest in your minds, and which will evidence itself so
   to have on all occasions. Let a man be never so observant of himself as
   unto all outward duties required of him with respect unto these earthly
   things; let him be liberal in the disposal of them on all occasions;
   let him be watchful against all intemperance and excesses in the use of
   them, -- yet if he hath not another object for his affections, which
   hath a prevailing influence upon them, if they are not set upon the
   things that are above, one way or other it is the world that hath the
   possession of his heart: for the affections of our minds will and must
   be placed in chief on things below or things above. There will be a
   predominant love in us; and therefore, although all our actions should
   testify another frame, yet if God and the things of God be not the
   principal object of our affections, by one way or other unto the world
   we do belong. This is that which is taught us so expressly by our
   Saviour, Luke xvi. 9-13, "And I say unto you, Make to yourselves
   friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may
   receive you into everlasting habitations. He that is faithful in that
   which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the
   least is unjust also in much. If therefore ye have not been faithful in
   the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?
   And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who
   shall give you that which is your own? No servant can serve two
   masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else
   he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and
   mammon."

   4. Labour continually for the mortification of your affections unto the
   things of this world. They are, in the state of corrupted nature, set
   and fixed on them, nor will any reasonings or considerations
   effectually divert them, or take them off in a due manner, unless they
   are mortified unto them by the cross of Christ. Whatever change be
   otherwise wrought in them, it will be of no advantage unto us. It is
   mortification alone that will take them off from earthly things unto
   the glory of God. Hence the apostle, having given us that charge, "Set
   your affection on things above, and not on things on the earth," Col.
   iii. 2, adds this as the only way and means we may do so, "Mortify
   therefore your members which are upon the earth," verse 5. Let no man
   think that his affections will fall off from earthly things of their
   own accord. The keenness and sharpness of them in many things may be
   abated by the decay of their natural powers in age and the like; they
   may be mated by frequent disappointments, by sicknesses, pains, and
   afflictions, as we shall see immediately; they may be willing unto a
   distribution of earthly enjoyments, to have the reputation of it,
   wherein they still cleave unto the world, but under another shape and
   appearance; or they may be startled by convictions, so as to do many
   things gladly that belong to another frame: but, on one pretence or
   other, under one appearance or other, they will for ever adhere or
   cleave unto earthly things, unless they are mortified unto them through
   faith in the blood and cross of Christ, Gal. vi. 14. Whatever thoughts
   you may have of yourselves in this matter, unless you have the
   experience of a work of mortification on your affections, you can have
   no refreshing ground of assurance that you are in any thing spiritually
   minded.

   5. In all the instances of duty belonging unto your stewardship of
   earthly things, attend diligently unto the rule of the word. Without
   this the grace exhorted unto may be abused. So of old, under a pretence
   of a relinquishment of the things of this world, because of the danger
   in adhering unto them, their own superstition and the craft of other
   men prevailed with many to part with all they had unto the service of
   others, not better, it may be not so good as themselves. This evil
   wholly arose from want of attendance unto the rule of truth, which
   gives no such direction in ordinary cases. But there is not much seen
   in these days of an excess in this kind; but, on the other hand, in all
   instances of duties of this nature, most men's minds are habitually
   influenced with pretences, reasonings, and considerations, that turn
   the scales as unto what they ought to do, in proportion in this duty,
   on the side of the world. If you would be safe, you must, in all
   instances of duty, -- as in works of charity, piety, and compassion, --
   give authority in and over your souls unto the rule of the word. Let
   neither self, nor unbelief, nor the custom and example of others, be
   heard to speak; but let the rule alone be attended unto, and to what
   that speaks yield obedience.

   Unless these things are found in us, none of us, no man living, if it
   be not so with him, can have any refreshing evidence or assurance that
   he is not under the power of an inordinate, yea, and predominant love
   unto this world.

   And, indeed, to add a little farther on the occasion of this
   digression, it is a sad thing to have this exception made against the
   state of any man on just grounds, "Yea, but he loves the world." He is
   sober and industrious, he is constant in duties of religion; it may be,
   an earnest preacher of them; a man of sound principles, and blameless
   as unto the excesses of life; -- "but he loves the world!" The question
   is, How doth this appear? it may be, what you say is but one of those
   evil surmises which all things are filled withal. Wherefore, I speak it
   not at all to give countenance unto the rash judging of others, which
   none are more prone unto than those who, one way or other, are
   eminently guilty themselves; but I would have every man judge himself,
   that we be none of us condemned of the Lord. If, notwithstanding the
   things mentioned, any of us do centre in self, which is supplied and
   filled with the world, -- if we prefer self above all other things, do
   aim at the satisfaction of self in what we do well or ill, are useless
   unto the only good and blessed end of these earthly things, in
   supplying the wants of others according unto the proportions wherewith
   we are intrusted, -- it is to be feared that the world and the things
   that are in it have the principal interest in our affections.

   And the danger is yet greater with them who divert on the other
   extreme. Such are they who, in the pride of life, vanity in apparel,
   excess in drinking, pampering the flesh every day, tread close on the
   heels of the world, if they do not also fully keep company with it.
   Altogether in vain is it for such persons to countenance themselves
   with an appearance of other graces in them, or the sedulous performance
   of other duties. This one rule will eternally prevail against them: "If
   any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." And, by
   the way, let men take heed how they walk in any instance against the
   known judgment and practice of the wiser or more experienced sort of
   Christians, to their regret and sorrow, if not unto their offence and
   scandal, or in any way whereunto they win the consent of their own
   light and conscience by such reasonings and considerations as will not
   hold weight in the balance of the sanctuary. Yet thus and no otherwise
   is it with all them who, under a profession of religion, do indulge
   unto any excesses wherein they are conformed unto the world.

   Fifthly, God makes a hedge against the excess of the affections of men
   rational and any way enlightened unto the things of this world, by
   suffering the generality of men to carry the use of them, and to be
   carried by the abuse of them, into actings so filthy, so abominable, so
   ridiculous, as reason itself cannot but abhor. Men by them transform
   themselves into beasts and monsters, as might be manifested by all
   sorts of instances. Hence the wise man prayed against riches, lest he
   should not be able to manage the temptations wherewith they are
   accompanied, Prov. xxx. 8, 9.

   Lastly, To close this matter, and to show us what we are to expect in
   case we set our affections on things here below, and they have thereby
   a predominant interest in our hearts, God hath positively determined
   and declared that if it be so, he will have nothing to do with us, nor
   will accept of those affections which we pretend we can and do spare
   for him and spiritual things. "If we abstain from open sins, if we
   abhor the lewdness and uncleanness of men in the world, if we are
   constant in religious duties, and give ourselves up to walk after the
   most strict sort in religion, like Paul in his Pharisaism, may we not,"
   will some say or think, "find acceptance with God, though our hearts
   cleave inordinately unto the things of this world?" I say, God hath
   peremptorily determined the contrary; and if other arguments will not
   prevail with us, he leaves us at last unto this, "Go, love the world
   and the things of it; but know assuredly you do it unto the eternal
   loss of your souls," 1 John ii. 15; James iv. 4.

   These few instances have I given of the arguments and motives whereby
   God is pleased to deter us from fixing our affections on things here
   below; and they are most of them such only as he maketh use of in the
   administration of his providence. There are two other heads of things
   that offer themselves unto our consideration:--

   1. The ways, means, arguings, and enticements, which the world makes
   use of to draw, keep, and secure, the affections of men unto itself. 2.
   The secret, powerful efficacy of grace, in taking off the heart from
   these things, and turning and drawing it unto God, with the arguments
   and motives that the Holy Spirit maketh use of in and by the word unto
   this end; wherein we must show what is the act of conquering grace,
   whereby the heart is finally prevailed on to choose and adhere unto God
   in love immutable. But these things cannot be handled in any measure,
   according to their nature and importance, without such length of
   discourse as I cannot here divert unto. I shall therefore proceed unto
   that which is the proper and peculiar subject before us.

Chapter XII.

   What is required in and unto our affections that they may be spiritual
   -- A three-fold work on the affections described.

   To declare the interest of our affections in this frame of being
   spiritually minded, and what they contribute thereunto, I shall do
   these three things:-- First, Declare what is required hereunto, that
   our affections may be spiritual, wherein lies the foundation of the
   whole duty; secondly, What are their actings when they are so
   spiritual; thirdly, What are the means whereby they may be kept and
   preserved in that frame; with sundry other things of the like nature.

   How our affections are concerned in or do belong unto the frame of mind
   inquired after hath been before declared. Without spiritual affections
   we cannot be spiritually minded. And that they may be of this use,
   three things are required:-- I. Their principle; II. Their object; III.
   The way and manner of their application unto their proper object by
   virtue of that principle.

   I. As unto the principle acting in them, that our affections may be
   spiritual and the spring of our being spiritually minded, it is
   required that they be changed, renewed, and inlaid with grace,
   spiritual and supernatural. To clear the sense hereof, we must a little
   consider what is their state by nature, and then by what means they may
   be wrought upon as unto a change or a renovation; for they are like
   unto some things which in themselves and their own nature are
   poisonous, but being corrected, and receiving a due temperament from a
   mixture of other ingredients, become medicinal and of excellent use.

   By nature our affections, all of them, are depraved and corrupted.
   Nothing in the whole nature of man, no power or faculty of the soul, is
   fallen under greater disorder and depravation by the entrance of sin
   than our affections are. In and by them is the heart wholly gone and
   turned off from God, Tit. iii. 3. It were a long work to set forth this
   depravation of our affections, nor doth it belong unto our present
   design. Some few things I shall briefly observe concerning it, to make
   way unto what is proposed concerning their change:--

   1. This is the only corruption and depravation of our nature by the
   fall evident in and unto reason or the light of nature itself. Those
   who were wise among the heathen both saw it and complained of it. They
   found a weakness in the mind, but saw nothing of its darkness and
   depravation as unto things spiritual. But they were sensible enough of
   this disorder and tumult of the affections in things moral, which
   renders the minds of men "like the troubled sea, whose waters cast up
   mire and dirt." This greatly aggravates the neglect of them who are not
   sensible of it in themselves, seeing it is discernible in the light of
   nature.

   2. They are, as depraved, the seat and subject of all lusts, both of
   the flesh and of the spirit; yea, lust or evil concupiscence is nothing
   but the irregular motion and acting of our affections as depraved,
   defiled, corrupted, Rom. vii. 8. Hence no one sin can be mortified
   without a change wrought in the affections.

   3. They are the spring, root, and cause of all actual sin in the world,
   Matt. xv. 19. The "evil heart," in the Scripture, is the corrupt
   affections of it, with the imaginations of the mind, whereby they are
   excited and acted, Gen. vi. 5. These are they which at this time fill
   the whole world with wickedness, darkness, confusion, and terror; and
   we may learn what is their force and efficacy from these effects. So
   the nature of the plague is most evident when we see thousands dying of
   it every week.

   4. They are the way and means whereby the soul applies itself unto all
   sinful objects and actings. Hence are they called our "members,'' our
   "earthly members;" because as the body applies itself unto its
   operations by its members, so doth the soul apply itself unto what
   belongs unto it by its affections, Rom. vi. 13; Col. iii. 5.

   5. They will not be under the conduct of the mind, its light or
   convictions. Rebellion against the light of the mind is the very form
   whereby their corruption acts itself, Job xxiv. 13. Let the
   apprehensions of the mind and its notions of good and evil be what they
   will, they reject them, and lead the soul in pursuit of their
   inclinations. Hence, no natural man whatsoever doth in any measure
   answer the light of his mind or the convictions of his understanding,
   but he sees and approves of better things, following those that are
   worse; and there is no greater spiritual judgment than for men to be
   given up unto themselves and their own evil affections, Rom. i. 26.

   Many other instances might be given of the greatness of that
   depravation which our affections are fallen under by sin; these may
   suffice as unto our present purpose.

   In general, this depravation of our affections by nature may be reduced
   unto two heads:--

   1. An utter aversation from God and all spiritual things. In this lies
   the spring of all that dislike of God and his ways that the hearts of
   men are filled withal; yea, they do not only produce an aversation from
   them and dislike of them, but they fill the mind with an enmity against
   them. Therefore men say in their hearts unto God, "Depart from us; for
   we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. What is the Almighty, that we
   should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?"
   Job xxi. 14, 15. See Rom. i. 28, viii. 7.

   2. An inordinate cleaving unto things vain, earthly, and sensual,
   causing the soul to engage into the pursuit of them as the horse rushes
   into the battle.

   Whilst our affections are in this state and condition we are far enough
   from being spiritually minded, nor is it possible to engage them into
   an adherence unto or delight in spiritual things.

   In this state they may be two ways wrought upon, and yet not so renewed
   as to be serviceable unto this end:--

   1. There may be various temporary impressions made on them. Sometimes
   there is so by the preaching of the word. Hereon men may hear it with
   joy, and do many things gladly. Sometimes it is so by judgments,
   dangers, sicknesses, apprehensions of the approach of death, Ps.
   lxxviii. 35-37. These things take men off for a season from their
   greedy delight in earthly things, and the pursuit of the interest of
   lust in making provision for the flesh. On many other occasions, by
   great variety of causes, there may be temporary impressions made on the
   affections, that shall seem for a season to have turned the stream of
   them. And thereon we have many who any day will be wholly, as it were,
   for God, resolved to forsake sin and all the pleasures of it, but the
   next return unto all their former excesses; for this is the effect of
   those impressions, that whereas men ordinarily are predominantly acted
   by love, desire, and delight, which lead them to act according unto the
   true natural principles of the soul, now they are for a season acted by
   fear and dread, which put a kind of force on all their inclinations.
   Hereon they have other thoughts of good and evil, of things eternal and
   temporal, of God and their own duty, for a season. And hereon some of
   them may and do persuade themselves that there is a change in their
   hearts and affections, which there is not; like a man who persuades
   himself that he hath lost his ague because his present fit is over. The
   next trial of temptation carries them away again unto the world and
   sin.

   There are sometimes sudden impressions made on spiritual affections,
   which are always of great advantage to the soul, renewing its
   engagements unto God and duty. So was it with Jacob, Gen. xxviii.
   16-20; so is it often with believers in hearing the word, and on other
   occasions. On all of them they renew their clearings unto God with love
   and delight. But the effect of these impressions on unrenewed
   affections are neither spiritual nor durable; yea, for the most part,
   they are but checks given in the providence of God unto the raging of
   their lusts, Ps. ix. 20.

   2. They are liable unto an habitual change. This the experience of all
   ages gives testimony to. There may be an habitual change wrought in the
   passions and affections of the mind, as unto the inordinate and violent
   pursuit of their inclinations, without any gracious renovation of them.
   Education, philosophy, or reason, long afflictions, spiritual light and
   gifts, have wrought this change. So Saul, upon his call to be king,
   became "another man." Hereby persons naturally passionate and furious
   have been made sedate and moderate, and those who have been sensual
   have become temperate, yea, and haters of religion to be professors of
   it. All these things, and many more of the like nature, have proceeded
   from a change wrought upon the affections only, whilst the mind, will,
   and conscience, have been totally unsanctified.

   By this change, when it is alone, no man ever became spiritually
   minded; for whereas there are two parts of the depravation of our
   affections, that whereby they are turned off from God, and that whereby
   they inordinately cleave unto other things, their change principally,
   if not only, respects the latter. They are brought into some order with
   respect unto present things. The mind is not continually tossed up and
   down by them as the waves of the sea, that are troubled, and east up
   mire and dirt. They do not carry those in whom they are into vicious,
   sensual actions, but they allow them to make virtue in moderation,
   sobriety, temperance, fidelity, and usefulness in several ways, to be
   their design; and it is admirable to think what degrees of eminency in
   all sorts of moral virtues, upon this one principle of moderating the
   affections, even many among the heathens attained unto. But as unto
   their aversation from God and spiritual things, in the true spiritual
   notion of them, they are not cured by this change; at least this change
   may be, and yet this latter not be wrought.

   Again; this alteration doth but turn the course or stream of men's
   affections, it doth not change the nature of them. They are the same in
   their spring and fountain as ever they were, only they are habituated
   unto another course than what of themselves they are inclined unto. You
   may take a young whelp of the most fierce and savage creature, as of a
   tiger or a wolf, and by custom or usage make it as tame and harmless as
   any domestic creature, -- a dog, or the like: but although it may be
   turned into quite another way or course of acting than what it was of
   itself inclined unto, yet its nature is not changed; and therefore
   frequently, on occasion, opportunity, or provocation, it will fall into
   its own savage inclination, and having tasted of the blood of
   creatures, it will never be reclaimed. So is it with the depraved
   affections of men with respect unto their change: their streams are
   turned, they are habituated unto a new course; but their nature is not
   altered, at least not from rational unto spiritual, from earthly unto
   heavenly. Yet this is that which was most beautiful and desirable in
   nature, the glory of it, and the utmost of its attainments. He who has
   by any means proceeded unto such a moderation of his affections as to
   render him kind, benign, patient, useful, preferring public good before
   private, ordinate and temperate in all things, will rise up in judgment
   against those who, professing themselves to be under the conduct of the
   light of grace, do yet, by being morose, angry, selfish, worldly,
   manifest that their affections are not subdued by the power of that
   grace. Wherefore, that we may be spiritually minded, there is yet
   another work upon our affections required, which is their internal
   renovation, whereby not only the course of their actings is changed,
   but their nature is altered and spiritually renewed. I intend that
   which is expressed in that great evangelical promise, Isa. xi. 6-9,
   "The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down
   with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
   and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall
   feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat
   straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the
   asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
   They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain." A change and
   alteration is promised in the natures, principles, and first
   inclinations, of the worst and most savage sinners who pass under the
   power of gospel grace.

   This is that which is required of us in a way of duty, Eph. iv. 23, "Be
   ye renewed in the spirit of your mind." There is a renovation of the
   mind itself, by the communication of spiritual, saving light and
   understanding thereunto, whereof I have treated elsewhere at large. See
   Rom. xii. 2; Eph. i. 17, 18. But "the spirit of the mind," that whereby
   it is enlivened, led, and disposed unto its actings, that is to be
   renewed also. "The spirit of the mind" is in this place opposed unto
   "the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts," or
   depraved affections, Eph. iv. 22. These, therefore, are that "spirit of
   the mind," which inclines, bends, and leads it to act suitably unto its
   inclinations, which is to be renewed. And when our affections are
   inclined by the saving grace of the Holy Spirit, then are they renewed,
   and not else. No other change will give them a spiritual renovation.
   Hereby those things which are only natural affections in themselves, in
   them that believe become fruits of the Spirit: Gal. v. 22, 23, "The
   fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace," etc. They continue the same
   as they were in their essence, substance, and natural powers; but are
   changed in their properties, qualities, inclinations, whenever a new
   nature is given unto them. So the waters at Marah were the same waters
   still before and after their cure. But of themselves and in their own
   nature they were bitter, so as that the people could not drink them; on
   the casting of a tree into them, they were made sweet and useful, Exod.
   xv. 25. So was it with the waters of Jericho, which were cured by
   casting salt into them, 2 Kings ii. 19-22. Our affections continue the
   same as they were in their nature and essence; but they are so cured by
   grace as that their properties, qualities, and inclinations, are all
   cleansed or renewed. The tree or salt that is cast into these waters,
   whereby the cure is wrought, is the love of God above all, proceeding
   from faith in him by Christ Jesus.

Chapter XIII.

   The work of the renovation of our affections -- How differenced from
   any other impression on or change wrought in them, and how it is
   evidenced so to be -- The first instance, in the universality
   accompanying of affections spiritually renewed -- The order of the
   exercise of our affections with respect unto their objects.

   That which is our concernment herein is, to inquire of what nature that
   work is which hath been on our own affections, or in them, and how it
   differs from those which, whatever they do or effect, yet will not
   render us nor themselves spiritual.

   And we ought to use the best of our diligence herein, because the great
   means whereby multitudes delude and deceive their own souls, persuading
   themselves that there has been an effectual work of the grace of the
   gospel in them, is the change that they find in their affections; which
   may be on many occasions without any spiritual renovation:--

   1. As unto the temporary and occasional impressions on the affections
   before mentioned, whether from the word or any other divine warning by
   afflictions or mercies, they are common unto all sorts of persons. Some
   there are whose "consciences are seared with a hot iron," 1 Tim. iv. 2,
   "who" thereon, "being past feeling" (senseless of all calls, warnings,
   and rebukes), "have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work
   all uncleanness with greediness," Eph. iv. 19. Such persons, having
   hardened themselves in a long course of sin, and being given up unto a
   reprobate mind, or vile affections, in a way of judgment, have, it may
   be, no such impressions on their affections on any occasion as to move
   them with a sense of things spiritual and eternal. They may be
   terrified with danger, sudden judgments, and other revelations of the
   wrath of God from heaven against the ungodliness of men, but they are
   not drawn to take shelter in thoughts of spiritual things. Nothing but
   hell will awaken them unto a due consideration of themselves and things
   eternal.

   It is otherwise with the generality of men who are not profligate and
   impudent in sinning; for although they are in a natural condition and a
   course of sin, in the neglect of known duties, yet, by one means or
   other, -- most frequently by the preaching of the word, -- their
   affections are stirred towards heavenly things.

   Sometimes they are afraid, sometimes they have hopes and desires about
   them. These put them on resolutions, and some temporary endeavours to
   change their lives, to abstain from sin and to perform holy duties.
   But, as the prophet complains, "their goodness is as a morning cloud,
   and as the early dew, it goeth away." Yet by means hereof do many poor
   ignorant souls deceive themselves, and cry "Peace, peace, when there is
   no peace." And they will sometimes so express how they are affected,
   with complaints of themselves as unto their long neglect of spiritual
   things, that others may entertain good hopes concerning them; but all
   comes to nothing in the trial.

   There is no difficulty unto spiritual light to distinguish between
   these occasional impressions on the affections and that spiritual
   renovation of them which we inquire after. This alone is sufficient to
   do it, that they are all of them temporary and evanid. They abide "for
   a while" only, as our Saviour speaks, and every occasion defeats all
   their efficacy. They may be frequently renewed, but they never abide.
   Some of them immediately pass away, and are utterly lost between the
   place where they hear the word and their own habitations; and in vain
   shall they inquire after them again, -- they are gone forever. Some
   have a larger continuance, endure longer in the mind, and produce some
   outward effects. None of them will hold any trial or shock of
   temptation.

   Yet I have somewhat to say unto those who have such impressions on
   their affections, and warnings by them:--

   (1.) Despise them not, for God is in them. Although he may not be in
   them in a way of saving grace, yet he is in them in that which may be
   preparatory thereto. They are not common human accidents, but especial
   divine warnings.

   (2.) Labour to retain them, or a sense of them, upon your hearts and
   consciences. You have got nothing by losing so many of them already;
   and if you proceed in their neglect, after a while you will hear of
   them no more.

   (3.) Put no more in them than belongs unto them. Do not presently
   conclude that your state is good, because you have been affected at the
   hearing of the word, or under a sickness, or in a danger. Hereon you
   may think that now all is well with them, wherewith they please
   themselves, until they are wholly immersed in their former security.

   2. We may consider the difference that is between the habitual change
   of the affections before described, and that renovation by grace which
   renders them spiritual. And this is of great concernment unto us all,
   to inquire into it with diligence. Multitudes are herein deceived, and
   that unto their ruin; for they resolve their present peace into, and
   build their hopes of eternal life on, such a change in themselves as
   will not abide the trial. This difference, therefore, is to be examined
   by Scripture light and the experience of them that do believe. And, --

   (1.) There is a double universality with respect unto the spiritual
   renovation of our affections, -- that which is subjective, with respect
   unto the affections themselves; and that which is objective, with
   respect unto spiritual things.

   [1.] Sanctification extends itself unto the "whole spirit, and soul,
   and body," 1 Thess. v. 23. When we say that we are sanctified in part
   only, we do not say that any part, power, or faculty of the soul is
   unsanctified, but only that the work is not absolutely perfect in any
   of them. All sin may retain power in some one affection, as anger,
   fear, or love, as unto actual eruptions and effects, more than in all
   the rest, as one affection may be more eminently sanctified in some
   than in others; for it may have advantages unto this end from men's
   natural tempers and various outward circumstances. Hence, some find
   little difficulty in the mortification of all other lusts or
   corruptions in comparison of what they meet withal in some one
   inordinate affection or corruption. This, it may be, David had regard
   unto, Ps. xviii. 23. I have known persons shining exemplarily in all
   other graces who have been scarce free from giving great scandal by the
   excess of their passions and easy provocation thereunto. And yet they
   have known that the setting themselves unto the sincere, vigorous
   mortification of that disorder is the most eminent pledge of their
   sincerity in other things; for the trial of our self-denial lies in the
   things that our natural inclinations lie strongest toward. Howbeit, as
   was said, there is no affection where there is this work of renovation
   but it is sanctified and renewed; none of them is left absolutely unto
   the service of sin and Satan. And therefore, whereas, by reason of the
   advantages mentioned, sin doth greatly contend to use some of them unto
   its interest and service in a peculiar manner, yet are they enabled
   unto and made meet for gracious actings, and do in their proper seasons
   put forth themselves accordingly. There is no affection of the mind
   from whence the soul and conscience hath received the greatest damage,
   -- that was, as it were, the field whereon the contest is managed
   between sin and grace, -- but hath its spiritual use and exercise when
   the mind is renewed.

   There are some so inordinately subject to anger, and passion therein,
   as if they were absolutely under the power and dominion of it; yet do
   they also know how to be "angry and sin not," in being angry at sin in
   themselves and others: "Yea, what indignation; yea, what revenge!"
   etc., 2 Cor. vii. 11. Yea, God is pleased sometimes to leave somewhat
   more than ordinary of the power of corruption in one affection, that it
   may be an occasion of the continual exercise of grace in the other
   affections. Yet are they all sanctified in their degree, that which is
   relieved as well as that which doth relieve. And therefore, as the
   remainder of sin in them that believe is called "the old man," which is
   to be crucified in all the members of it, because of its adherence unto
   the whole person in all its powers and faculties; so the grace
   implanted in our natures is called "the new man," there being nothing
   in us that is not seasoned and affected with it. As nothing in our
   natures escaped the taint of sin, so nothing in our natures is excepted
   from the renovation that is by grace. He in whom any one affection is
   utterly unrenewed hath no one graciously renewed in him. Let men take
   heed how they indulge to any depraved affection, for it will be an
   unavoidable impeachment of their sincerity. Think not to say, with
   Naaman, "God be merciful unto me in this thing; in all others I will be
   for him."

   He requires the whole heart, and will have it or none. The chief work
   of a Christian is to make all his affections, in all their operations,
   subservient unto the life of God, Rom. vi. 17, 18; and he who is wise
   will keep a continual watch over those wherein he finds the greatest
   reluctancy thereunto. And every affection is originally sanctified
   according unto the use it is to be of in the life of holiness and
   obedience.

   To be entire for God, to "follow him fully," to "cleave unto him with
   purpose of heart," to have the "heart circumcised to love him," is to
   have all our affections renewed and sanctified; without which we can do
   none of them. When it is otherwise, there is a "double heart," "a heart
   and a heart," which he abhors: "Their heart is divided; now shall they
   be found faulty," Hos. x. 2.

   So it is in the other change mentioned. Whatever is or may be wrought
   upon our affections when they are not spiritually renewed, that very
   change, as unto the extent of it, is not universal. It doth not affect
   the whole mind, in all its powers and affections, until a vital,
   prevailing principle and habit of grace is implanted in the soul. Sin
   will not only radically adhere unto all the faculties, powers, and
   affections, but it will, under any change that may befall them, refer
   the rule and dominion in some of them unto itself. So was it with the
   young man that came unto our Lord Jesus Christ to know what he should
   do to obtain eternal life, Mark x. 17-22.

   Thus there are many who in other things are reduced unto moderation,
   sobriety, and temperance, yet there remaineth in them "the love of
   money" in a predominant degree; which to them is "the root of all
   evil," as the apostle speaks. Some "seem to be religious," but they
   "bridle not their tongues;" through anger, envy, hatred, and the like,
   "their religion is vain."

   The most of men, in their several ways of profession, pretend not only
   unto religion, but unto zeal in it, yet set no bounds unto their
   affections unto earthly enjoyments. Some of old, who had most eminently
   in all other things subdued their passions and affections, were the
   greatest enemies unto and persecutors of the gospel.

   Some who seem to have had a mighty change wrought in them by a
   superstitious devotion, do yet walk in the spirit of Cain towards all
   the disciples of Christ, -- as it is with the principal devotionists of
   the church of Rome; and elsewhere we may see some go soberly about the
   persecution and destruction of other Christians. Some will cherish one
   secret lust or other, which they cannot but know to be pernicious unto
   their souls. Some love the praise of men, which will never permit them
   to be truly spiritually minded: so our Saviour testifieth of some, that
   they "could not believe, because they loved the praise of men." This
   was the known vice of all the ancient philosophers. They had, many of
   them, on the principles of reason and by severe exercise, subdued their
   affections unto great moderation about temporary things, but in the
   meantime were all of them slaves to vain-glory and the praise of men,
   until by the public observation of it, and some contradictions in their
   lives unto their pretences unto virtue, they lost that also among wise
   and considerative men. And, generally, if men not spiritually renewed
   were able to search themselves, they would find that some of their
   affections are so far from having any change wrought in them, as that
   they are a quiet habitation for sin, where it exerciseth its rule and
   dominion.

   [2.] There is a universality that is objective in spiritual things,
   with respect unto the renovation of our affections; that is, affections
   spiritually renewed do fix themselves upon and cleave unto all
   spiritual things, in their proper places, and unto their proper ends:
   for the ground and reason of our adherence unto any one of them is the
   same with respect unto them all, -- that is, their relation unto God in
   Christ. Wherefore, when our affections are renewed, we make no choice
   in spiritual things, cleaving unto some and refusing others, making use
   of Naaman's restraint; but our adherence is the same unto them all in
   their proper places and degrees. And if, by reason of darkness and
   ignorance, we know not any of them to be from God, -- as, for instance,
   the observation of the Lord's day, -- it is of unspeakable disadvantage
   unto us. An equal respect is required in us unto all God's commands.
   Yet there are various distinctions in spiritual things, and thereon a
   man may and ought to value one above another as unto the degrees of his
   love and esteem, although he is to be sincere with respect unto them
   all:--

   1st. God himself, -- that is, as revealed in and by Christ, -- is in
   the first and chiefest place the proper and adequate object of our
   affections as they are renewed, lie is so for himself, or his own sake
   alone. This is the spring, the centre, and chief object of our love. He
   that loves not God for himself, -- that is, for what he is in himself,
   and what from himself alone he is and will be unto us in Christ (which
   considerations are inseparable), -- hath no true affection for any
   spiritual thing whatever. And not a few do here deceive themselves, or
   are deceived; which should make us the more diligent in the examination
   of ourselves They suppose that they love heaven and heavenly things,
   and the duties of divine worship, -- which persuasion may befall them
   on many grounds and occasions which will not endure the trial, -- but
   as unto God himself, they can give no evidence that they have any love
   to him, either on the account of the glorious excellencies of his
   nature, with their natural relation unto him and dependence on him, or
   on the account of the manifestation of himself in Christ, and the
   exercise of his grace therein. But whatever may be pretended, there is
   no love unto God whereof these things are not the formal reason, that
   proceeds not from these springs. And because all men pretend that they
   love God, and defy them that think them so vile as not to do so, though
   they live in open enmity against him and hatred of him, it becomes us
   strictly to examine ourselves on what grounds we pretend so to do. Is
   it because indeed we see an excellency, a beauty, a desirableness, in
   the glorious properties of his nature, such as our souls are refreshed
   and satisfied with the thoughts of, by faith, and in whose enjoyment
   our blessedness will consist, so that we always rejoice at the
   remembrance of his holiness? Is it our great joy and satisfaction that
   God is what he is? Is it from the glorious manifestation that he hath
   made of himself and all his holy excellencies in Christ, with the
   communication of himself unto us in and by him? If it be so indeed,
   then is our love generous and gracious, from the renovation of our
   affections But if we say we love God, yet truly know not why, or upon
   principles of education, and because it is esteemed the height of
   wickedness to do otherwise, we shall be at a loss when we are called
   unto our trial. This is the first object of our affections.

   2dly. In other spiritual things, renewed affections do cleave unto them
   according as God is in them. God alone is loved for himself; all other
   things for him, in the measure and degree of his presence in them. This
   alone gives them pre-eminence in renewed affections. For instance, God
   is in Christ, in the human nature of the man Christ Jesus, in a way and
   manner singular, in concern alike, incomprehensible, so as he is in the
   same kind in nothing else. Therefore is the Lord Christ, even as unto
   his human nature, the object of our affections in such a way and degree
   as no other thing, spiritual or eternal, but God himself, is or ought
   to be. All other spiritual things become so from the presence of God in
   them, and from the degree of that presence have they their nature and
   use. Accordingly are they, or ought to be, the object of our affections
   as unto the degree of their exercise. Evidences of the presence of God
   in things and persons are the only attractives of renewed affections.

   3dly. In those things which seem to stand in an equality as unto what
   is of God in them, yet on some especial occasions and reasons our love
   may go forth eminently unto one more than another. Some particular
   truth, with the grace communicated by it, may have been the means of
   our conversion unto God, of our edification in an especial manner, of
   our consolation in distress; it cannot be but that the mind will have a
   peculiar respect unto and valuation of such truths and the grace
   administered by them. And so it is as unto duties. We may have found
   such a lively intercourse and communion with God in some of them as may
   give us a peculiar delight in them.

   But, notwithstanding these differences, affections spiritually renewed
   do cleave unto all spiritual things as such; for the true formal reason
   of their so doing is the same in them all, -- namely, God in them: only
   they have several ways of acting themselves towards them, whereof I
   shall give one instance.

   Our Saviour distributes spiritual things into those that are heavenly
   and those that are earthly, that is comparatively so: John iii. 12, "If
   I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye
   believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?"

   The "heavenly things" are the deep and mysterious counsels of the will
   of God. These renewed affections cleave unto with holy admiration and
   satisfactory submission, captivating the understanding unto what it
   cannot comprehend. So the apostle declares it, Rom. xi. 33-36, "O the
   depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how
   unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who
   hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor? or
   who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him
   again? For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom
   be glory for ever. Amen." What the mind cannot comprehend the heart
   doth admire and adore, delighting in God, and giving glory unto him in
   all.

   The "earthly things" intended by our Saviour in that place are the work
   of God upon the souls of men in their regeneration, wrought here in the
   earth. Toward these the affections act themselves with delight and with
   great thanksgiving. The experience of the grace of God in and upon
   believers is sweet unto their souls. But one way or other they cleave
   unto them all; they have not a prevailing aversation unto any of them.
   They have a regard unto all God's precepts, a delight in all his
   counsels, a love to himself and all his ways.

   Whatever other change is wrought on the affections, if they be not
   spiritually renewed, it is not so with them; for as they do not cleave
   unto any spiritual things, in their own true proper nature, in a due
   manner, because of the evidences of the presence of God in them, so
   there are always some of them whereunto those whose affections are not
   renewed do maintain an aversation and an enmity. And although this
   frame doth not instantly discover itself, yet it will do so upon any
   especial trial. So was it with the hearers of our Saviour, John vi..
   There was a great impression made on their affections by what he taught
   them concerning "the bread of God, which came down from heaven and gave
   life unto the world;" for they cried thereon, "Lord, evermore give us
   this bread," verse 34: but when the mystery of it was farther explained
   unto them, they liked it not, but cried, "This is an hard saying, who
   can hear it?" verse 60; and thereon fell off both from him and his
   doctrine, although they had followed him so long as to be esteemed his
   disciples, verse 66. I say, therefore, whensoever men's affections are
   not renewed, whatever other change may have been wrought upon them, as
   they have no true delight in any spiritual things or truths for
   themselves and in their own nature, so there are some instances wherein
   they will maintain their natural enmity and aversation unto them.

   This is the first difference between affections spiritually renewed and
   those which, from any other causes, may have some kind of change
   wrought in them.

Chapter XIV.

   The second difference between affections spiritually renewed and those
   which have been only changed by light and conviction -- Grounds and
   reasons of men's delight in duties of divine worship, and of their
   diligence in their performance, whose minds are not spiritually
   renewed.

   The second difference lieth herein, that there may be a change in the
   affections, wherein men may have delight in the duties of religious
   worship and diligence in their observance; but it is the spiritual
   renovation of the affections that gives delight in God through Christ,
   in any duty of religious worship whatever.

   Where the truth of the gospel is known and publicly professed, there is
   great variety in the minds, ways, and practices, of men about the
   duties of religious worship. Many are profane in their minds and lives,
   who, practically at least, despise or wholly neglect the observance of
   them. These are stout-hearted and far from righteousness, Tit. i. 16.
   Some attend unto them formally and cursorily, from the principles of
   their education, and, it may be, out of some convictions they have of
   their necessity. But many there are who, in the way they choose and are
   pleased withal, are diligent in their observance, and that with great
   delight, who yet give no evidence of the spiritual renovation of their
   minds; yea, the way whereby some express their devotion in them, being
   superstitious and idolatrous, is inconsistent with that or any other
   saving grace. This, therefore, we must diligently inquire into, or
   search into the grounds and reasons of men's delight in divine worship,
   according unto their convictions of the way of it, [while they] yet
   continue in their minds altogether unrenewed. And, --

   1. Men may be greatly affected with the outward part of divine worship,
   and the manner of the performance thereof, who have no delight in what
   is internal, real, and spiritual therein: John v. 35, "He was a burning
   and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his
   light." So, many were delighted in the preaching of Ezekiel, because of
   his eloquence and the elegancy of his parables, chap. xxxiii. 31, 32.
   This gave them both delight and diligence in hearing, whereon they
   called themselves the people of God, though they continued to live in
   sin; their hearts went after covetousness. The same may befall many at
   present with reference unto the spiritual gifts of those by whom the
   word of God is dispensed. I deny not but that men may be more
   delighted, more satisfied, with the gifts, the preaching, of one than
   another, and yet be sincere in their delight in the dispensation of the
   word; for they may find more spiritual advantage thereby than in the
   gifts of others, and things so prepared as to be more suited unto their
   edification than elsewhere: but that which at present we insist on hath
   respect only unto some outward circumstances, pleasing the minds of
   men, 2 Tim. iii. 5.

   This was principally evident under the old testament, whilst they had
   carnal ordinances and a worldly sanctuary. Ofttimes under that
   dispensation the people were given up unto all sorts of idolatry and
   superstition; and when they were not so, yet were the body of them
   carnal and unholy, as is evident from the whole tract of God's dealing
   with them, by his prophets and in his providences: yet had they great
   delight in the outward solemnities of their worship, placing all their
   trust of acceptance with God therein. They who did really and truly
   believe looked through them all unto Christ, whom they did foresignify,
   without which the things were a yoke unto them and a burden almost
   insupportable, Acts xv. 10; but those who were carnal delighted in the
   things themselves, and for their sakes rejected Him who was the life
   and substance of them all. And this proved the great means of the
   apostasy of the Christian church also: for, to maintain some appearance
   of spiritual affections, men introduced carnal incitations of them into
   evangelical worship, such as singing, with music and pompous
   ceremonies; for they find such things needful to reconcile the worship
   of God unto their minds and affections, and through them they appear to
   have great delight therein. Could some men but in their thoughts
   separate divine service from that outward order, those methods of
   variety, show, and melody, wherewith they are affected, they would have
   no delight in it, but look upon it as a thing that must be endured. How
   can it be otherwise conceived of among the Papists? They will with much
   earnestness, many evidences of devotion, sometimes with difficulty and
   danger, repair unto their solemn worship, and when they are present
   understand not one word whereby their minds might be excited unto the
   real actings of faith, love, and delight in God! Only order, ceremony,
   music, and other incentives of carnal affections, make great impression
   on them. Affections spiritually renewed are not concerned in these
   things; yea, if those in whom they are should be engaged in the use of
   them, they would find them means of diverting their minds from the
   proper work of divine worship, rather than an advantage therein. It
   will also appear so unto themselves, unless they are content to lose
   their spiritual affections, acting themselves in faith and love,
   embracing in their stead a carnal, imaginary devotion. Hence, two
   persons may at the same time attend unto the same ordinances of divine
   worship, with equal delight, on very distinct principles: as if two men
   should come into the same garden, planted and adorned with a variety of
   herbs and flowers, one ignorant of the nature of them, the other a
   skillful herbalist; both may be equally delighted, the one with the
   colours and smell of the flowers, the other with the consideration of
   their various natures, their uses in physical remedies, or the like. So
   may it be in the hearing of the word. For instance, one may be
   delighted with the outward administration, another with its spiritual
   efficacy, at the same time. Hence Austin tells us that singing in the
   church was laid aside by Athanasius at Alexandria; not the people's
   singing of psalms, but a kind of singing in the reading of the
   Scripture and some offices of worship, which began then to be
   introduced in the church. And the reason he gave why he did it was,
   that the modulation of the voice and musical tune might not divert the
   minds of men from that spiritual affection which is required of them in
   sacred duties. What there is of real order in the worship of God, was
   there is that order which is an effect of divine wisdom, -- it is
   suited and useful unto spiritual affections, because proceeding from
   the same Spirit whereby they are internally renewed: "Beholding your
   order," Col. ii. 5. Every thing of God's appointment is both helpful
   and delightful unto them. None can say with higher raptures of
   admiration, "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!" Ps.
   lxxxiv. 1, 2, than they whose affections are renewed; yet is not their
   delight terminated on them, as we shall see immediately.

   2. Men may be delighted in the performance of outward duties of divine
   worship, because in them they comply with and give some kind of
   satisfaction unto their convictions. When conscience is awakened unto a
   sense of the necessity of such duties, -- namely, of those wherein
   divine worship doth consist, -- it will give the mind no rest or peace
   in the neglect of them. Let them be attended unto in the seasons which
   light, conviction, and custom call for, it will be so far satisfied as
   that the mind shall find present ease and refreshment in it. And when
   the soul is wonted unto this relief, it will not only be diligent in
   the performance of such duties, it will not only not omit them, but it
   will delight in them as those which bring it in great advantage. Hence
   many will not omit the duty of prayer every morning, who upon the
   matter are resolved to live in sin all the day long. And there are but
   few who sedulously endeavour to live and walk in the frame of their
   hearts and ways answerable unto their own prayers; yet all that is in
   our prayers beyond our endeavours to answer it in a conformity of heart
   and life, is but the exercise of gifts in answer to convictions Others
   find an allay of troubles in them, like that which sick persons may
   find by drinking cold water in a fever, whose flames are assuaged for a
   season by it. They make them as an antidote against the poison and
   sting of sin, which allayeth its rage but cannot expel its venom.

   Or these duties are unto them like the sacrifices for sin under the
   law. They gave a guilty person present ease: but, as the apostle
   speaks, they made not men perfect; they took not away utterly a
   conscience condemning for sin. Presently, on the first omission of
   duty, a sense of sin again returned on them, and that not only as the
   fact, but as the person himself, was condemned by the law. Then were
   the sacrifices to be repeated, for a renewed propitiation. This gave
   that carnal people such delight and satisfaction in those sacrifices
   that they trusted unto them for righteousness, life, and salvation. So
   it is with persons who are constant in spiritual duties merely from
   conviction. The performance of those duties gives them a present relief
   and ease; though it heals not their wound, it assuageth their pain and
   dispelleth their present fears. Hence are they frequent in them, and
   that ofttimes not without delight, because they find ease thereby. And
   their condition is somewhat dangerous who, upon the sense of the guilt
   of any sin, do betake themselves for relief unto their prayers, which
   having discharged, they are much at ease in their minds and
   consciences, although they have obtained no real sense of the pardon of
   sin nor any strength against it.

   It will be said, "Do not all men, the best of men, perform all
   spiritual duties out of a conviction of their necessity? do not they
   know it would be their sin to omit them, and so find satisfaction in
   their minds upon their performance?" I say, They do: but it is one
   thing to perform a duty out of conviction of a necessity as it is God's
   ordinance, which conviction respects only the duty itself; another
   thing to perform it to give satisfaction unto convictions of other
   sins, or to quiet conscience under its trouble about them; which latter
   we speak unto. This begins and ends in self; self-satisfaction is the
   sole design of it. By it men aim at some rest and quietness in their
   own minds, which otherwise they cannot attain. But in the performance
   of duties in faith, from a conviction of their necessity as God's
   ordinance, and their use in the way of his grace, the soul begins and
   ends in God. It seeks no satisfaction in them, nor finds it from them,
   but in and from God alone by them.

   3. The principal reason why men whose affections are only changed, not
   spiritually renewed, do delight in holy duties of divine worship, is,
   because they place their righteousness before God in them, whereon they
   hope to be accepted with him. They know not, they seek not after, any
   other righteousness but what is of their own working out. Whatever
   notions they may have of the righteousness of faith, of the
   righteousness of Christ, that which they practically trust unto is
   their own: and it discovers itself so to be in their own consciences on
   every trial that befalls them; yea, when they cry unto the Lord, and
   pretend unto faith in Christ, they quickly make it evident that their
   principal trust is resolved into themselves. Now, in all that they can
   plead in a way of duties or obedience, nothing carrieth a fairer
   pretence unto a righteousness than what they do in the worship of God,
   and the exercise of the acts of religion towards him. This is that
   which he expects at their hands, what is due unto him in the light of
   their consciences, the best that they can do to please him; which
   therefore they must put their trust in, or nothing. They secretly
   suppose not only that there is a righteousness in these things which
   will answer for itself, but such also as will make compensation in some
   measure for their sins; and therefore, whereas they cannot but
   frequently fall into sin, they relieve themselves from the reflection
   of their consciences by a multiplication of duties, and renewed
   diligence in them.

   It is inconceivable what delight and satisfaction men will take in any
   thing that seems to contribute so much unto a righteousness of their
   own; for it is suitable unto and pleaseth all the principles of nature
   as corrupt, after it is brought under the power of a conviction
   concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.

   This made the Jews of old so pertinaciously adhere unto the ceremonies
   and sacrifices of the law, and to prefer them above the gospel "the
   kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof," Rom. x. 3. They looked
   and sought for righteousness by them. Those who for many generations
   were kept up with great difficulty unto any tolerable observance of
   them, when they had learned to place all their hopes of a righteousness
   in them, would and did adhere unto them unto their temporal and eternal
   ruin, Rom. ix. 31-33. And when men were persuaded that righteousness
   was to be attained by works of munificence and supposed charity, in the
   dedication of their substance unto the use of the church, they who
   otherwise were covetous, and greedy and oppressing, would lavish gold
   out of the bag, and give up their whole patrimony, with all their
   ill-gotten goods, to attain it; so powerful an influence hath the
   desire of self-righteousness upon the minds of men. It is the best
   fortification of the soul against Christ and the gospel, -- the last
   reserve whereby it maintains the interest of self against the grace of
   God.

   Hence, I say, those that place their righteousness, or that which is
   the principal part of it, in the duties of religious worship, will not
   only be diligent in them, but ofttimes abound in a multiplication of
   them. Especially will they do so if they may be performed in such a way
   and manner as pleaseth their affections with a show of humility and
   devotion, requiring nothing of the exercise of faith or sincere divine
   love therein. So is it with many in all kinds of religion, whether the
   way of their worship be true or false, whether it be appointed of God
   or rejected by him. And the declaration hereof is the subject of the
   discourse of the prophet, Isa. i. 11-17; also, Mic. vi. 6-8. 4. The
   reputation of devotion in religious duties may insensibly affect the
   unrenewed minds of men with great diligence and delight in their
   performance. However men are divided in their apprehension and practice
   about religion, however different from and contrary unto each other
   their ways of divine worship are; yet it is amongst all sorts of men,
   yea, in the secret thoughts of them who outwardly contemn these things,
   a matter of reputation to be devout, to be diligent, to be strict, in
   and about those duties of religion which, according to their own light
   and persuasion, they judge incumbent on them. This greatly affects the
   minds of men whilst pride is secretly predominant in them, and they
   love the praise of men more than the praise of God.

   Especially will this consideration prevail on them when they suppose
   that the credit and honour of the way which they profess, in
   competition with others, depend much on their reputation as to their
   strictness in duties of devotion; for then will they not only be
   diligent in themselves, but zealous in drawing others unto the same
   observances. These two principles, their own reputation and that of
   their sect, constituted the life and soul of Pharisaism of old.
   According as the minds of men are influenced with these apprehensions,
   so will a love unto and a delight in those duties whereby their
   reputation is attained thrive and grow in them.

   I am far from apprehending that any men are (at least, I speak not of
   them who are) such vile hypocrites as to do all that they do in
   religion to be seen and praised of men, being influenced in all public
   duties thereby; which some among the Pharisees were given up unto. But
   I speak of them who, being under the convictions and motives before
   mentioned, do also yet give admittance unto this corrupt end of desire
   of reputation or the praise of men; for every such end, being admitted
   and prevalent in the mind, will universally influence the affections
   unto a delight in those duties whereby that end may be attained, until
   the person with whom it is so be habituated unto them with great
   satisfaction.

   5. I should, in the last place, insist on superstition. As this is an
   undue fear of the divine nature, will, and operations, built on false
   notions and apprehensions of them, it may befall the minds of men in
   all religions, true and false. It is an internal vice of the mind. As
   it respects the outward way and means of religious service, and
   consists in the devout performance of such duties as God indeed accepts
   not, but forbids, so it belongs only to religion as it is false and
   corrupt. How in both respects it will engage the minds of men into the
   performance of religious duties, and for the most part with the most
   scrupulous diligence, and sometimes with prodigious attempts to exceed
   the measures of human nature in what they do design, is too long a work
   here to be declared. It may suffice to have mentioned it among the
   causes and reasons why men whose affections are not spiritually renewed
   may yet greatly delight in the diligent performance of the outward
   duties of religion. Our design in these things is, the discovery of the
   true nature of this grace and duty of being spiritually minded.
   Hereunto we have declared that it is necessary that our affections be
   spiritually and supernaturally renewed; and because there may be a
   great change wrought on the affections of men with respect unto
   spiritual things where there is nothing of this supernatural
   renovation, our present inquiry is, What are the differences that are
   between the actings of the affections of the one sort and of the other,
   whether spiritually renewed or occasionally changed? And whereas the
   great exercise of them consists in the duties of religious worship, I
   have declared what are the grounds and reasons whence men of unrenewed
   minds do delight ofttimes in the duties of divine worship and are
   diligent in the performance of them.

   From these and the like considerations, it may be made manifest that
   the greatest part of the devotion that is in the world doth not spring
   from the spiritual renovation of the minds of men; without which it is
   not accepted with God. That which remains to give in instance, farther
   evidence unto the discovery we are in the pursuit of, is, what are the
   grounds and reasons whereon those whose minds and affections are
   spiritually renewed do delight in the institutions of divine worship,
   and attend unto their observance with great heed and diligence. And
   because this is an inquiry of great importance, and is of great use to
   be stated in other cases as well as that before us, I shall treat of it
   by itself in the ensuing chapter, that the reader may the more
   distinctly comprehend it, both in the nature of the doctrine concerning
   it and in the place it holds in our present discourse.

Chapter XV.

   Delight of believers in the holy institutions of divine worship -- The
   grounds and reasons thereof -- The evidence of being spiritually minded
   thereby, etc.

   That all true believers, whose minds are spiritually renewed, have a
   singular delight in all the institutions and ordinances of divine
   worship is fully evident, both in the examples of the saints in the
   Scripture and their own experience, which they will never forego; for
   this hath been the greatest cause of their suffering persecution, and
   martyrdom itself, in all ages. If the primitive Christians under the
   power of the pagan emperors, or the witnesses for Christ under the
   antichristian apostasy, would or could have omitted the observance of
   them (according to the advice and practice of the Gnostics), they might
   have escaped the rage of their adversaries. But they loved not their
   lives in comparison unto that delight which they had in the observance
   of the commands of Christ as unto the duties of evangelical worship.
   David gives us frequently an instance hereof in himself: Ps. xlii. 1-4,
   "As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after
   thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall
   I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,
   while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God? When I remember
   these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the
   multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy
   and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday." Ps. lxiii. 1-5, "O
   God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for
   thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no
   water is; to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
   sanctuary. Because thy loving-kindness is better than life, my lips
   shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up
   my hands in thy name My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and
   fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips." Ps. lxxxiv.
   1-4, "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My soul
   longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my
   flesh crieth out for the living God. Yea, the sparrow hath found an
   house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young,
   even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God. Blessed are
   they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah."

   But "a greater than David is here." Our Lord Jesus Christ himself did,
   upon all occasions, declare his delight in and zeal for all the
   ordinances of divine worship which were then in force by virtue of
   divine institution and command; for although he severely reproved and
   rejected whatever men had added thereunto, under the pretence of a
   supererogating strictness of outward order, laying it all under that
   dreadful sentence, "Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not
   planted shall be plucked up," and so cast into the fire, yet as unto
   what was of divine appointment, his delight therein was singular, and
   exemplary unto all his disciples. With respect hereunto was it said of
   him, that "the zeal of God's house had eaten him up," by reason of the
   affliction which he had in his spirit to see the worship of it
   neglected, polluted, and despised. This caused him to cleanse the
   temple, the seat of divine worship, from the polluters and pollutions
   of it, not long before his sufferings, in the face and unto the high
   provocation of all his adversaries. So with earnest desire he longed
   for the celebration of his last passover: Luke xxii. 15, "With desire
   have I desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer." And it
   is a sufficient evidence of the frame of spirit and practice of his
   disciples afterward, in reference to the duties of evangelical worship
   by his appointment, that the apostle gives it as an assured token of an
   unsound condition, and that which tendeth to final, cursed apostasy,
   when any fall into a neglect of them, Heb. x. 25-27.

   These things are manifest and unquestionable. But our present inquiry
   is only, what it is which believers do so delight in in the ordinances
   and institutions of divine gospel worship, and what it is that engageth
   their hearts and minds into a diligent observance of them, as also how
   and wherein they do exercise their love and delight. And I say, in
   general, that their delight in all ordinances of divine worship, -- as
   is evident in the testimonies before produced, -- is in Christ himself,
   or God in Christ. This alone is that which they seek after, cleave
   unto, and are satisfied withal. They make use of the streams, but only
   as means of communication with the spring. When men are really renewed
   in the spirit of their minds it is so. Their regard unto ordinances and
   duties of divine worship is, as they are appointed of God a blessed
   means of communion and intercourse between himself in Christ and their
   souls. By them doth Christ communicate of his love and grace unto us;
   in and by them do we act faith and love on him. It is the treasure hid
   in the field, which when a man bath found he purchaseth the whole
   field; but it is that he may enjoy the treasure which is bid therein,
   Matt. xiii. 44. This field is the gospel and all the ordinances of it.
   This men do purchase sometimes at a dear rate, even with the loss of
   all they enjoy; but yet if they obtain nothing but the field, they will
   have little cause to rejoice in their bargain. It is Christ the
   treasure alone, that pearl of great price, that will eternally enrich
   the soul. The field is to be used only [so] as to find and dig up the
   treasure that is in it. It is, I say, Christ alone that, in the
   preaching of the gospel, renewed affections do cleave unto as the
   treasure, and unto all other things according as their relation is unto
   him or as they have a participation of him. Wherefore, in all duties of
   religion, in all ordinances of worship, their inquiry is after him whom
   their souls do love, Cant. i. 7.

   But yet we must treat more particularly and distinctly of these things.
   Those whose affections are spiritually renewed do love, adhere unto,
   and delight in, ordinances of divine service and duties of worship, on
   the grounds and reasons ensuing:--

   1. In general they do so as they find faith, and love, and delight in
   God through Christ, excited and acted in and by them. This is the first
   and immediate end in their institution. It is a pernicious mistake to
   suppose that any external duties of worship, as hearing the word,
   prayer, or the sacraments, are appointed for themselves or accepted for
   themselves.

   Such thoughts the Jews of old had concerning their sacrifices, --
   namely, that they were appointed for their own sake, and were
   acceptable service unto God merely on their own account. Wherefore God,
   to deliver them from this pernicious mistake, affirms ofttimes that he
   never appointed them at all; that is, for any such end, Jer. vii. 22,
   23, Isa. i. 12-14, etc. And now, under the gospel, sundry things
   destructive to the souls of men have proceeded from such a supposition.
   Some hereon have always satisfied and contented themselves with the
   external observance of them, without desiring or endeavouring any holy
   communion with God in them or by them. This constitutes the state and
   condition mentioned, Rev. iii. 1. And by following this track the
   generality of Christians do wander out of the way; they cannot leave
   them, nor do they know how to use them unto their advantage, until they
   come wholly unto that woful state, Isa. xxix. 13. And some, to
   establish this deceit, have taught that there is much more in the
   outward work of these duties than ever God put into them, and that they
   are sanctified merely by virtue of the work wrought.

   But all the duties of the second commandment, as are all instituted
   ordinances of worship, are but means to express and exercise those of
   the first, as faith, love, fear, trust, and delight in God. The end of
   them all is, that through them and by them we may act those graces on
   God in Christ. Where this is not attended unto, when the souls of men
   do not apply themselves unto this exercise of grace in them, let them
   be never so solemn as to their outward performance, be attended unto
   with diligence, be performed with earnestness and delight, they are
   neither acceptable unto God nor beneficial unto themselves, Isa. i. 11.
   This, therefore, is the first general spring of the love of believers,
   of them whose affections are spiritually renewed, unto the ordinances
   of divine worship, and their delight in them: They have experience that
   in and by them their faith and love are excited unto a gracious
   exercise of themselves on God in Christ; and when they find it
   otherwise with them, they can have no rest in their souls. For this end
   are they ordained, sanctified, and blessed of God; and therefore are
   effectual means of it, when their efficacy is not defeated by unbelief.

   And those who have no experience hereof in their attendance unto them
   do, as hath been said, fall into pernicious extremes. Some continue
   their observance with little regard unto God, in cursed formality. So
   they make them a means of their ruin by countenancing of them in their
   security. Others utterly reject them, at least the most solemn of them,
   -- and therein both the wisdom, and grace, and authority of God, by
   whom they are appointed, -- because, through the power of their own
   unbelief, they find nothing in them.

   This being the immediate end of all divine institutions; this being the
   only way whereby we may give glory unto God in their observance, which
   is their ultimate end in this world; and this being the design in
   general of believers in that obedience they yield unto the Lord Christ
   in their diligent observation of them, -- we may consider how, in what
   way, and by what means, those whose affections are spiritually renewed
   do and ought to apply their minds and souls unto their observance. And
   we may consider herein, first, what they do design, and then what they
   endeavour to be found in the exercise and practice of in their use and
   enjoyment:--

   (1.) They come unto them with this desire, design, and expectation, --
   namely, to be enabled, directed, and excited by them unto the exercise
   of divine faith and love. When it is not so with any, where there is
   not this design, they do in various degrees take the name of God in
   vain in their observance. These are "approximationes Dei," the "ways of
   drawing nigh unto God," as they are everywhere called in Scripture. To
   suppose that a drawing nigh unto God may consist merely in the outward
   performance of duty, whatever be its solemnity, is to reject all due
   reverence of him. "Forasmuch," saith the Lord, "as this people draw
   near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
   removed their heart far from me, therefore, behold, I will proceed
   against them," Isa. xxix. 13, 14. The mouth and lips are put, by a
   synecdoche, for all the means of outward worship and honour. These men
   may use, diligently attend unto, whilst their hearts are far from God,
   -- that is, when they do not draw nigh to him by faith and love; but
   all this worship is rejected of God with the highest tokens of his
   displeasure and indignation against it.

   Our souls, then, have no way of approach unto God in duties of worship
   but by faith; no way of adherence or cleaving unto him but by love; no
   way of abiding in him but by fear, reverence, and delight. Whenever
   these are not in exercise, outward duties of worship are so far from
   being a means of such an approach unto him, as that they set us at a
   greater distance from him than we were before; at least they are
   utterly useless and fruitless unto us. So, indeed, they are unto the
   most who come unto them they know not why, and behave themselves under
   them they care not how; nor is there any evil in the hearts and ways of
   men whereof God complaineth more in his word, as that which is
   accompanied with the highest contempt of him. And because these
   ordinances of divine worship are means which the wisdom and grace of
   God hath appointed unto this end, namely, the exercise and increase of
   divine faith and love, and therefore doth sanctify and bless them
   thereunto, I do not believe that they have any delight in the exercise
   of these graces, nor do design growth in them, by whom these great
   means of them are despised or neglected.

   And although I have seen those valleys of public worship forsaken,
   either on pretences of higher attainments in faith, light, and love,
   than to stand in need of them any more; or on a foolish opinion that
   they cease upon the dispensation of the Spirit, which is given unto us
   to make them useful and effectual; or on some provocations that have
   been given unto some men, or which they have taken unto themselves,
   which they have thought they could revenge by a neglect of public
   administrations; or through slavish peace and negligence in times of
   difficulty, as is the manner of some who forsake the assemblies of the
   saints, Heb. x. 25; -- yet I never saw but it issued in a great decay,
   if not in an utter loss, of all exercise of faith and love, and
   sometimes in open profaneness: for such persons contemn the way and
   means which God, in his infinite wisdom and goodness, hath appointed
   for their exercise and increase, and this shall not prosper. We may
   therefore do well to consider that the principal way whereby we may
   sanctify the name of God in all duties of his worship, and obtain the
   benefit of them to our own souls, is by a conscientious approach unto
   them, with a holy desire and design to be found in the exercise of
   faith and love on God in Christ, and to be helped and guided therein by
   them.

   To be under an efficacious influence from this design is the best
   preparation for any duty. So David expresseth his delight in the
   worship of God: "How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My
   soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the Lord: my heart
   and my flesh crieth out for the living God," Ps. lxxxiv. 1, 2. He
   longed for the tabernacle and the courts of it; but it was the
   enjoyment of God himself, the living God, that he desired and sought
   after. This was that which made him so fervent in his desires after
   those ordinances of God. So he expresseth it, Ps. lxiii. 2, "To see thy
   power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary," David
   had had great communion with and delight in God, by faith and love, in
   the solemn duties of his worship; and this was that which inflamed him
   with desires after renewed opportunities unto the same end.

   (2.) This design is not general, inactive, useless, and slothful; but
   such persons diligently endeavour, in the use of these ordinances and
   attendance unto them, to be found in the exercise of these graces. They
   have not only an antecedent design to be so, but a diligent actual
   endeavour after it, not suffering their minds by any thing to be
   diverted from the pursuit of that design, Eccles. v. 1. Whatever is not
   quickened and enlivened hereby they esteem utterly lost. Neither
   outward administrations nor order will give them satisfaction when
   these things are wanting in themselves. Without the internal actings of
   the life of faith, external administrations of ordinances of worship
   are but dead things, nor can any believer obtain real satisfaction in
   them or refreshment by them without an inward experience of faith and
   love in them and by them; and it is that which, if we are wise, we
   shall continually attend unto the consideration of. A watchful
   Christian will be careful lest he lose any one duty by taking up with
   the carcass of it. And the danger of so doing is not small. Our
   affections are renewed but in part; and as they are still liable to be
   diverted and seduced from spirituality in duty even by things earthly
   and carnal, through the corruption that remaineth in them, so there is
   a disposition abiding in them to be pleased with those external things
   and religious duties which others, as we have showed before, who are no
   way graciously renewed, do satisfy themselves withal. The grace and
   oratory of the speaker in preaching of the word, especially in these
   days wherein the foppery of fine language, even in sacred things, is so
   much extolled; the order and circumstances of other duties; with
   inclination and love unto a party, -- are apt to insinuate themselves
   with great complacency into our affections so far as they are
   unrenewed.

   And these things discover the true grounds whence it is that the
   ordinances of divine worship are so useless as they are to many who
   seem to attend unto them with diligence. They may be referred unto
   these three heads:-- [1.] They do not come unto them as the means
   appointed of God for the exercise of faith and love unto Christ, so as
   to make it their design in their approaches to them; without which all
   that is spoken of advantage in and by other duties is utterly lost.
   [2.] They do not, in and under them, labour to stir up faith and love
   unto their due exercise. [3.] They suffer their minds to be diverted
   from the exercise of these graces, partly by occasional temptations,
   partly by attendance unto what is outward only in the ordinances
   themselves.

   Spiritual affections find no place of rest in any of these things, Such
   proposals of God in Christ, of his will and their own duty, as may draw
   out their faith, love, godly fear, and delight, into their due
   exercise, are that which they inquire after and acquiesce in.

   Two things alone doth faith regard in all duties of worship, as unto
   the outward administration of it, -- the one absolutely, the other
   comparatively, -- both with respect unto the ends mentioned, or the
   exercise, growth, and increase of grace in us, The first is, that they
   may be of divine appointment. Where their original and observance are
   resolved into divine authority, there, and there alone, will they have
   a divine efficacy. In all these things faith hath regard to nothing but
   divine precepts and promises, Whatever hath regard to any thing else is
   not faith, but fancy; and therefore those uncommanded duties in
   religion, which so abound in the papal church as that if not the whole
   yet all the principal parts of their worship consist in them, are such
   as in whose discharge it is impossible faith should be in a due
   exercise. That which it hath comparative respect unto is, the spiritual
   gifts of them unto whom the administration of the ordinances of the
   gospel in the public worship of the church is committed. With respect
   unto them, believers may have more delight and satisfaction in the
   ministry of one than of another, as was touched before. But this is not
   because one is more learned than another or more elegant than another,
   hath more ability of speech than another or more fervency in utterance
   than another, is more fervent or earnest in his delivery; but because
   they find the gifts of one more suited and more effectual to stir up
   faith and love unto a holy exercise in their minds and hearts than what
   they find in some others. Hence they have a peculiar value for and
   delight in the ministry of such persons, especially when they can enjoy
   it in due order, and without the offence of others. And ministers that
   are wise will, in holy administrations, neglect all other things, and
   attend unto this alone, how they may be helpful unto the faith, and
   love, and joy of believers, so far as they are the object of their
   ministry.

   This is the first reason and ground whereon affections spiritually
   renewed cleave unto ordinances of divine worship with delight and
   satisfaction, -- namely, because they are the means appointed and
   blessed of God for the exercise and increase of faith and love, with an
   experience of their efficacy unto that end.

   2. The second is, because they are the means of the communication of a
   sense of divine love and supplies of divine grace unto the souls of
   them that do believe. So far as our affections are renewed, this is the
   most principal attractive to cleave unto them with delight and
   complacency.

   They are, as was observed before, the ways of our approaching unto God.
   Now, we do not draw nigh to God, as himself speaks, as to a "dry heath
   or a barren wilderness," where no refreshment is to be obtained. To
   make a pretence of coming unto God, and not with expectation of
   receiving good and great things from him, is to despise God himself, to
   overthrow the nature of the duty, and deprive our own souls of all
   benefit thereby. And want hereof is that which renders the worship of
   the most useless and fruitless unto themselves. We are always to come
   unto God as unto an eternal spring of goodness, grace, and mercy, of
   all that our souls do stand in need of, of all we can desire in order
   unto our everlasting blessedness. And all these things, as unto
   believers, may be reduced unto the two heads before mentioned:--

   (1.) They come for a communication of a sense of his love in Jesus
   Christ. Hence doth all our peace, consolation, and joy, all our
   encouragement to do and suffer according to the will of God, all our
   supportments under our sufferings, solely depend; in these things do
   our souls live; and without them we are of all men the most miserable.

   It is the Holy Spirit who is the immediate efficient cause of all these
   things in us. He "sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts," Rom. v.
   5; he witnesseth our adoption unto us, chap. viii. 15, 16; and thereby
   an interest in the love of the Father, in God as he is love. But the
   outward way and means whereby he ordinarily communicates these things
   unto us, and effects them in us, is by the dispensation of the gospel,
   or the preaching of it. He doth the same work also in prayer, and
   ofttimes in other holy administrations. For this end, for a
   participation of this grace, of these mercies, do believers come unto
   God by them. They use them as means to "draw water from the wells of
   salvation," and to receive in that spiritual sense of divine love which
   God by them will communicate.

   So Christ by his word knocks at the door of the heart. If it be opened
   by faith, he cometh in and suppeth with men, giving them a gracious
   refreshment, by the testimony of his own love and the love of the
   Father, Rev. iii. 20; John xiv. 23. This believers look for in, and
   this they do in various measures receive by, the ordinances of divine
   worship. And although some, through their fears and temptations, are
   not sensible hereof, yet do they secretly receive those blessed,
   gracious supplies whereby their souls are held in life, without which
   they would pine away and perish. So he dealeth with them, Cant. iv. 5,
   6. These are the gardens and galleries of Christ, wherein he gives us
   of his love, Cant. vii. 12. Those who are humble and sincere know how
   often their souls have been refreshed in them, and how long sometimes
   the impressions they have received of divine grace and love have
   continued with them, unto their unspeakable consolation. They remember
   what they have received in the opening and application of the
   "exceeding great and precious promises" that are given unto them,
   whereby they are gradually more and more "made partakers of the divine
   nature," -- how many a time they have received light in darkness,
   refreshment under despondencies, relief in their conflicts with dangers
   and temptations, in and by them. For this cause do affections that are
   spiritually renewed cleave unto them. Who can but love and delight in
   that which he hath found by experience to be the way and means of
   communicating unto him the most invaluable mercy, the most inestimable
   benefit, whereof in this life he can be made partaker? He who hath
   found a hidden treasure, although he should at once take away the whole
   of it, will yet esteem the place where he found it; but if it be of
   that nature that no more can be found or taken of it at once but what
   is sufficient for the present occasion, yet is so full and boundless as
   that whenever he comes again to seek for it he shall be sure to obtain
   present supply, he will always value it, and constantly apply himself
   unto it. And such is the treasure of grace and divine love that is in
   the ordinances of divine worship.

   If we are strangers unto these things, if we have never received
   efficacious intimations of divine love unto our souls in and by the
   duties of divine worship, we cannot love them and delight in them as we
   ought. What do men come to hear the word of God for? What do they pray
   for? What do they expect to receive from him? Do they come unto God as
   the eternal fountain of living waters, -- as the God of all grace,
   peace, and consolation? or do they come unto his worship without any
   design, as unto a dry and empty show? Do they fight uncertainly with
   these things, as men beating the air? or do they think they bring
   something unto God, but receive nothing from him? that the best of
   their business is to please him in doing what he commands, but to
   receive any thing from him they expect not, nor do ever examine
   themselves whether they have done so or no? It is not for persons who
   walk in such ways ever to attain a due delight in the ordinances of
   divine worship.

   Believers have other designs herein; and among the rest this in the
   first place, that they may be afresh made partakers of refreshing,
   comforting pledges of the love of God in Christ, and thereby of their
   adoption, of the pardon of their sins, and acceptance of their persons.
   According as they meet with these things in the duties of holy worship,
   public or private, so will they love, value, and adhere unto them. Some
   men are full of other thoughts and affections, so as that these things
   are not their principal design or desire, or are contented with that
   measure of them which they suppose themselves to have attained, or at
   least are not sensible of the need they stand in to have fresh
   communications of them made unto their souls, supposing that they can
   do well enough without a renewed sense of divine love every day. Some
   are so ignorant of what they ought to design, to look after, in the
   duties of gospel worship, as that it is impossible they should have any
   real design in them. Many of the better sort of professors are too
   negligent in this matter. They do not long and pant in the inward man
   after renewed pledges of the love of God; they do not consider how much
   need they have of them, that they may be encouraged and strengthened
   unto all other duties of obedience; they do not prepare their minds for
   the reception of them, nor come with expectation of their communication
   unto them; they do not rightly fix their faith on this truth, --
   namely, that these holy administrations and duties are appointed of God
   in the first place as the ways and means of conveying his love and a
   sense of it unto our souls. From hence spring all that lukewarmness,
   coldness, and indifferency in and unto the duties of holy worship, that
   are growing among us; for if men have lost the principal design of
   faith in them, and disesteem the chiefest benefit which is to be
   obtained by them, whence should zeal for them, delight in them, or
   diligence in attendance unto them, arise? Let not any please themselves
   under the power of such decays; they are indications of their inward
   frame, and those infallible! Such persons will grow cold, careless, and
   negligent, as unto the duties of public worship; they will put
   themselves neither to charge nor trouble about them; every occasion of
   life diverts them, and finds ready entertainment in their minds; and
   when they do attend upon them, it is with great indifference and
   unconcernedness. Yet would they have it thought that all is still as
   well within as ever it was; they have as good a respect unto religion
   as any! But these things openly discover an ulcerous disease in the
   very souls of men, as evidently as if it were written on their
   foreheads. Whatever they pretend unto the contrary, they are under the
   power of woful decays from all due regard unto spiritual and eternal
   things. And I would avoid the society of such persons as those who
   carry an infectious disease about them, unless it were to help on their
   cure.

   But herein it is that affections spiritually renewed do manifest
   themselves: When we do delight in and value the duties of God's
   worship, because we find by experience that they are and have been unto
   us means of communicating a sense and renewed pledges of the love of
   God in Christ, with all the benefits and privileges which depend
   thereon, then are our affections renewed in and by the Holy Ghost.

   (2.) They come for supplies of internal, sanctifying, strengthening
   grace. This is the second great design of believers in their approaches
   unto God in his worship. The want hereof, as unto measures and degrees,
   they find in themselves, and are sensible of it; yea, herein lies the
   great burden of the souls of believers in this world. All that we do in
   the life of God may be referred unto two heads:-- [1.] The observance
   of all duties of obedience; and, [2.] The conflict with and conquest
   over temptations.

   About these things are we continually exercised. Hence the great thing
   which we desire, labour for, and pant after, is spiritual strength and
   ability for the discharge of ourselves in a due manner with respect
   unto these things. This is that which every true believer groaneth
   after in the inward man, and which he preferreth infinitely above all
   earthly things. So he may have grace sufficient in any competent
   measure for these ends, let what will befall him, he desireth no more
   in this world. God in Christ is the only fountain of all this grace;
   there is not one drachm of it to be obtained but from him alone. And as
   he doth communicate it unto us of his own sovereign goodness and
   pleasure, so the ordinary way and means whereby he will do it are the
   duties of his worship: Isa. xl. 28-31, "Hast thou not known? hast thou
   not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends
   of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of
   his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have
   no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be
   weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon
   the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
   eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not
   faint."

   All grace and spiritual strength is originally seated in the nature of
   God, verse 28. But what relief can that afford unto us who are weak,
   feeble, fainting? He will act suitably unto his nature in the
   communication of this grace and power, verse 29. But how shall we have
   an interest in this grace, in these operations? Wait on him in the
   ordinances of his worship, verse 31. The word as preached is the food
   of our souls, whereby God administereth growth and strength unto them,
   John xvii. 17. "Desire," says he, "the sincere milk of the word, that
   ye may grow thereby." But what encouragement have we thereunto? "If so
   be," saith he, "ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious," 1 Pet. ii.
   2, 3. If, in and by the dispensation of this word, you have had
   experience of the grace, the goodness, the kindness of God unto your
   souls, you cannot but desire it and delight in it; and otherwise you
   will not do so. When men have sat some good while under the
   dispensation of the word and in the enjoyment of other ordinances,
   without tasting in them and by them that "the Lord is gracious," they
   will grow weary of it and them. Wherefore, prayer is the way of his
   appointment for the application of our souls unto him to obtain a
   participation of all needful grace; which, therefore, he has proposed
   unto us in the promises of the covenant, that we may know what to ask,
   and how to plead for it. In the sacraments the same promises are sealed
   unto us, and the grace represented in them effectually exhibited.
   Meditation confirms our souls in the exercise of faith about it, and is
   the especial opening of the heart unto the reception of it. By these
   means, I say, doth God communicate all supplies of renewing,
   strengthening, and sanctifying grace unto us, that we may live unto him
   in all holy obedience, and be able to get the victory over our
   temptations. Under this apprehension do believers approach unto God in
   the ordinances of his worship. They come unto them as the means of
   God's communication unto their souls. Hence they cleave unto them with
   delight, so far as their affections are renewed. So the spouse
   testifieth of herself, "I sat down under his shadow with great
   delight," Cant. ii. 3. In these ordinances is the protecting,
   refreshing presence of Christ. This she rested in with great delight.

   3. As they come unto them with these designs and expectations, so they
   have experience of the spiritual benefits and advantages which they
   receive by them, which more and more engageth them unto them in their
   affections with delight. All these things, those who have a change
   wrought in their affections, but not a spiritual renovation, are
   strangers unto. They neither have the design before mentioned in coming
   to them, nor the experience of this efficacy now proposed in their
   attendance on them. But these benefits are great: as, for instance,
   when men find the worth and effect of the word preached on their souls,
   in its enlightening, refreshing, strengthening, transforming power;
   when they find their hearts warmed, their graces excited and
   strengthened, the love of God improved, their desponding spirits under
   trials and temptations relieved, their whole souls gradually more and
   more conformed unto Christ; when they find themselves by it extricated
   out of snares, doubts, fears, temptations, and brought unto
   sanctification and rest, -- they cannot but delight in the dispensation
   of it, and rejoice in it as the food of their souls. And it is a great
   hinderance unto the increase of spiritual life, and obstruction unto
   fruitfulness, thankfulness, and consolation, when we are negligent in
   our meditation about the benefits that we receive by the word and the
   advantages which we have thereby; for whilst it is so with us, we can
   neither value the grace of God in granting this inestimable privilege
   nor perform any duty with respect unto it in a right manner. This
   renders it an especial object of our affections as spiritually renewed.
   That secret love unto, and heavenly delight in, the statutes and
   testimonies of God, which David expresseth Ps. cxix., arose from the
   spiritual benefit and advantage which he received by them, as he
   constantly declares. And the sole reason, on the other hand, why men
   grow so careless, negligent, and cold, in their attendance unto the
   preaching of the word, is because they have no experience of any
   spiritual benefit or advantage by it. They have been brought unto it by
   one means or another, -- mostly by conviction of their duty; their
   minds have been variously affected with it, unto a joy in the hearing
   of it and readiness unto sundry duties of obedience: but after a while,
   when a sense of those temporary impressions is worn off, finding no
   real spiritual benefit by it, they lose all delight in it, and become
   very indifferent as unto its enjoyment. The frame which such persons at
   length arrive unto is described, Mal. i. 13, iii. 14. None can give any
   greater evidence of the decay of all manner of grace in them, or of
   their being destitute of all saving grace, than when they apostatize
   from some degree of zeal for, and delight in, the dispensation of the
   word of God, into such a cursed indifferency as many are overtaken
   withal. It cannot be otherwise; for seeing this is a way and means of
   the exercise of all grace, it will not be neglected but where there is
   a decay of all grace, however men may please themselves with other
   pretences. And when they are thus ensnared, every foolish prejudice,
   every provocation, every wanton opinion and imagination, will confirm
   them in, and increase, their gradual backsliding.

   And as it is with believers as unto the hearing of the word in general,
   so it is as unto the degrees of advantage which they find by it. When
   men have enjoyed the dispensation of the word in a peculiar manner,
   spiritual and effectual, if they can be content to forego it for that
   which is more cold and lifeless, provided it possesseth the same time
   and outward form with the other, it is no great evidence that their
   souls do prosper. It is therefore those alone who have a sense of the
   efficacy of the word on their souls and consciences unto all the holy
   ends of it, who cleave unto it with spiritual love and delight. They
   continually remember what holy impressions it hath made on them, what
   engagements it hath brought their souls into, what encouragements unto
   faith and obedience it hath furnished them withal, and [they] long
   after [the] renewed sense of its enjoyment. When we do not find in
   ourselves this foundation of spiritual delight in the dispensation of
   the gospel, we can have no great evidence that our affections are
   renewed.

   So also it is in the duties of prayer and meditation. When the soul of
   a believer hath had experience of the communion which it hath had with
   God in them, or either of them; of the spiritual refreshment which it
   hath had from them; of the benefits and mercies which are obtained by
   them, in recovery from temptations, snares, despondencies, in victory
   over sin and Satan, in spiritual impressions, working it into a holy,
   watchful frame, which hath abode in it in other ways and occasions;
   with the like advantages wherewith fervent and effectual prayer and
   sincere heavenly meditation axe accompanied, -- it cannot but have love
   unto them and delight in them. But if indeed we have no experience of
   these things, if we find not these advantages in and by these duties,
   they cannot but be a burden unto us, nor do serve unto any other end
   but to satisfy convictions. He who had the benefit of a serene and
   wholesome air in a recovery from many diseases and distempers, with the
   preservation of his health so obtained, will love it and prize it; and
   so will he these duties who hath been partaker of any of those saving
   mercies and privileges wherewith they axe accompanied. Some have been
   delivered from the worst of temptations, and the nearest approach of
   their prevalency (as to destroy themselves), by a sudden remembrance of
   the frame of their souls and the intimations of God's love in such or
   such a prayer, at such a time. Some have had the same deliverance from
   temptations unto sin; when they have been carried away under the power
   of their corruptions, and all circumstances have concurred under the
   apprehensions of it, a sudden thought of such a prayer or meditation,
   with engagement they made of themselves therein unto God, hath caused
   all the weapons of sin to fall out of its hands, and all the beauties
   of its allurements to disappear. When others have been under the power
   of such despondencies and disconsolations as that no present tenders of
   relief can approach unto them, they have been suddenly raised and
   refreshed by the remembrance of the intimate love and kindness between
   Christ and their souls that hath evidenced itself in former duties.
   Multitudes, in fears, distresses, and temptations, have found relief
   unto their spirits and encouragement unto their faith in the
   remembrance of the returns they have had unto former supplications in
   the like distresses. These are grounds of spiritual delight in these
   duties.

   Heartless, lifeless, wordy prayers, the fruit of convictions and gifts,
   or of custom and outward occasions, however multiplied, and whatever
   devotion they seem to be accompanied withal, will never engage
   spiritual affections unto them. When these things are absent, when the
   soul hath not experience of them, prayer is but a lifeless form, a dead
   carcass, which it would be a torment unto a soul spiritually alive to
   be tied unto. There may be a season, indeed, when God will seem to hide
   himself from believers in their prayers, so as they shall neither find
   that life in themselves which they have done formerly, nor be sensible
   of any gracious communications from him; but this is done only for a
   time, and principally to stir them up unto that fervency and
   perseverance in prayer as may recover them into their former or a
   better estate than yet they have attained unto. The like may be said
   concerning all other duties of religion or ordinances of divine
   worship.

   4. Believers, whose affections are spiritually renewed, do delight
   greatly in the duties of divine worship, because they are the great
   instituted way whereby they may give glory unto God. This is the first
   and principal end of all duties of religion as they respect divine
   appointment, -- namely, to ascribe and give unto God the glory that is
   his due; for in them all acknowledgment is made of all the glorious
   excellencies of the divine nature, our dependence on him and relation
   unto him. And this is that which, in the first place, believers design
   in all the duties of divine worship. And the pattern set us by our
   blessed Saviour, in the prayer he taught his disciples, directs us
   thereunto. All the first requests of it concern immediately the glory
   of God, and the advancement thereof; for therein also all the
   blessedness and safety of the church are included. Those who fail in
   this design do err in all that they do; they never tend unto the mark
   proposed unto them. But this is that which principally animates the
   souls of them that believe, in all their duties; this their universal
   relation unto him, and love in that relation, makes necessary.
   Wherefore, that way and means whereby they may directly and solemnly
   ascribe and give glory unto God is precious and delightful unto them;
   and such are all the duties of divine worship. These are some of the
   things wherein the respect of affections spiritually renewed unto
   ordinances and duties of divine worship doth differ from the actings of
   affections toward the same object which are not so sanctified and
   renewed.

   There are yet other things, accompanied with the same evidence of the
   difference between affections spiritually renewed and those which have
   only a general change wrought in them by convictions and some outward
   occasions, which must in one or two instances more be insisted on, with
   the consideration of such cases as derive from them; for my design
   herein is not only to declare when our minds are spiritually renewed,
   but also what is the nature and operation of our affections whereby we
   are constituted and denominated "spiritually minded," which is the
   subject of our whole inquiry. Herein, then, we shall proceed.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter XVI.

   Assimilation unto things heavenly and spiritual in affections
   spiritually renewed -- This assimilation the work of faith; how, and
   whereby -- Reasons of the want of growth in our spiritual affections as
   unto this assimilation.

   When affections are spiritually renewed in their exercise, or fixing of
   themselves on spiritual things, there is an assimilation wrought in
   them, and in the whole soul, unto those spiritual and heavenly things,
   by faith. But when there is a change in them only from other causes and
   occasions, and not from renewing grace, there is an assimilation
   effected of spiritual and heavenly things themselves unto those
   affections, by imagination.

   This must somewhat at large be spoken unto, as that which gives the
   most eminent distinction between the frames of mind whose difference we
   inquire into. And to that end we shall cast our consideration of it
   into the ensuing observations:--

   1. Affections spiritually renewed are, in all their actings, in their
   whole exercise, under the guidance and conduct of faith. It is faith
   which, in its spiritual light, hath the leading of the soul in the
   whole life of God. We live here by faith, as we shall do hereafter by
   sight. If our affections deviate or decline in the least from the
   guidance of the faith, they degenerate from their spirituality, and
   give up themselves unto the service of superstition. Next unto corrupt
   secular interest in the management of crafty, selfish seducers, this
   hath been the great inlet of all superstition and false worship into
   the world. Blind affections groping in the dark after spiritual things,
   having not the saving light of faith to conduct them, have seduced the
   minds of men into all manner of superstitious imaginations and
   practices, continuing to do so at this day. And wherever they will lead
   the way, when faith goeth not before them to discover both way and end,
   they that lead and the mind that is led must fall into one snare and
   pit or another.

   Wherefore, affections that are spiritually renewed move not, act not,
   but as faith discovers their object and directs them unto it It is
   faith that works by love. We can love nothing sincerely with divine
   love but what we believe savingly with divine faith. Let our affections
   unto any spiritual thing be never so vehement, if they spring not from
   faith, if they are not guided by it, they are neither accepted with God
   nor will promote the interest of spirituality and holiness in our own
   souls, Heb. xi. 6; Matt. vi. 22, 23. And this is the reason whence we
   ofttimes see great and plausible appearances of spiritual affections,
   which yet endure only for a season: They have been awakened, excited,
   acted, by one means or another, outward or inward; but not having the
   light of faith to guide them unto their proper object, they either
   wither and die, as unto any appearing of spiritual motions, or else
   keep the mind tossed up and down in perpetual disquietment, without
   rest or peace. "The foolish man wearieth himself because he cannot find
   the way to the city." So was it with them who, on the account of their
   attendance unto the doctrine of Christ, are called his disciples, John
   vi.. Having preached unto them about the bread which came down from
   heaven and giveth life unto them that feed, they were greatly affected
   with it, and cried out, "Lord, evermore give us this bread," verse 34;
   but when he proceeded to declare the mystery of it, they having not
   faith to discern and apprehend it, their affections immediately
   decayed, and they forsook both him and his doctrine, verse 66.

   We may consider one especial instance of this nature. Persons every day
   fall under great and effectual convictions of sin, and of their danger
   or certain misery thereby. This stirs up and acts all their affections,
   especially their fears, hopes, desires, sorrow, self-revenge, according
   as their condition calls for them. Hence sometimes they grow restless
   in their complaints, and turn themselves every way for relief, like men
   that are out of the way and bewildered in the night. But in this state
   and condition, tell them of the only proper way and means of their
   relief, -- which, let the world say what it will, is Christ and his
   righteousness alone, with the grace of God in him, -- and they quickly
   discover that they are strange things unto them, such as they do not
   understand, nor indeed approve. They cannot see them, they cannot
   discern them, nor any beauty in them for which they should be desired.

   Wherefore, after their affections have been tossed up and down for a
   season under the power and torment of this conviction, they come unto
   one or other of these issues with them; for, either they utterly decay,
   and the mind loseth all sense of any impressions from them, so as that
   they wonder in themselves whence they were so foolish as to be tossed
   and troubled with such melancholy fancies, and so commonly prove as bad
   a sort of men as live upon the earth; or they take up in a formal,
   legal profession, whereto they never attain to be spiritually minded.
   This is the best end that our affections towards spiritual things, not
   guided by the light of faith, do come unto.

   2. Faith hath a clear prospect into and apprehension of spiritual
   things, as they are in themselves and in their own nature. It is true,
   the light of it cannot fully comprehend the nature of all those things
   which are the objects of its affections: for they are infinite and
   incomprehensible, such as are the nature of God and the person of
   Christ; and some of them, as future glory, are not yet clearly
   revealed. But it discerns them all in a due manner, so as that they may
   in themselves, and not in any corrupt representation or imagination of
   them, be the objects of our affections. They are, as the apostle
   speaks, "spiritually discerned," 1 Cor. ii. 14; which is the reason why
   the natural man cannot receive them, -- namely, because he hath not
   ability spiritually to discern them. And this is the principal end of
   the renovation of our minds, the principal work and effect of faith, --
   namely, the communication unto our minds and the acting in us of a
   spiritual, saving light, whereby we may see and discern spiritual
   things as they are in their own nature, kind, and proper use. See Eph.
   i. 17-19, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
   may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and re-relation in the knowledge
   of him: the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may
   know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory
   of his inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness
   of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his
   mighty power." 2 Cor. iv. 6, "God shineth in our hearts, to give the
   light of the knowledge of his glory in the face of Jesus Christ," The
   end God designs is, to draw our hearts and affections unto himself; and
   unto this end he gives unto us a glorious internal light, whereby we
   may be enabled to discern the true nature of the things that we are to
   cleave unto with love and delight. Without this we have nothing but
   false images of spiritual things in our minds; not always as unto the
   truth or doctrine concerning them, but as unto their reality, power,
   and efficacy. This is one of the principal effects of faith, as it is
   the principal part of the renovation of our minds, -- namely, to
   discover in the soul and represent unto the affections things spiritual
   and heavenly, in their nature, beauty, and genuine excellency. This
   attracts them if they be spiritually renewed, and causeth them to
   cleave with delight unto what is so proposed unto them. He that
   believes in Christ in a due manner, who thereon discovers the
   excellency of his person and the glory of his mediation, will beth love
   him, and, on his believing, "rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
   glory." So is it in all other instances. The more steady is our view by
   faith of spiritual things, the more firm and constant will our
   affections be in cleaving unto them; and wherever the mind is darkened
   about them, by temptation or seduction from the truth, there the
   affections will be quickly weakened and impaired. Wherefore, --

   3. Affections thus led unto and fixed on spiritual and heavenly things,
   under the light and conduct of faith, are more and more renewed, or
   made in themselves more spiritual and heavenly. They are, in their
   cleaving unto them and delight in them, continually changed and
   assimilated unto the things themselves, becoming more and more to be
   what they are, -- namely, spiritual and heavenly.

   This transformation is wrought by faith, and is one of its most
   excellent faculties and operations. See 2 Cor. iii. 18. And the means
   whereby it works herein are our affections. In them as we are carnal,
   we are conformed unto this world; and by them as we are sanctified are
   we "transformed by the renewing of our mind," Rom. xii. 2. And this
   transformation is the introduction of a new form or nature into our
   souls, diverse from that wherewith we were before endued. So is it
   described, Isa. xi. 6-9. A spiritual nature they were changed into. And
   it is twofold:-- First, Original and radical as to the substance or
   essence of it, which is the effect of the first act of divine grace
   upon our souls when we are made new creatures. Herein our affections
   are passive; they do not transform us, but are transformed. Secondly,
   Gradual as unto its increase; and therein faith works in and by the
   affections.

   Whenever the affections do cleave intensely unto any object they
   receive an impression from it, -- as the wax doth from the seal when
   applied unto it, -- which changeth them into its own likeness. So the
   apostle affirms of sensual, unclean persons, they "have eyes full of
   adultery," 2 Pet. ii. 14. Their affections are so wholly possessed and
   filled with their lustful objects as that they have brought forth their
   own likeness upon their imaginations. That blots out all others, and
   leaves them no inclinations but what they stir up in them. When men are
   filled with the "love of this world," which carries along with it all
   their other affections, their hopes, fears, and desires, unto a
   constant exercise about the same object, they become earthly minded.
   Their minds are so changed into the image of the things themselves, by
   the effectual working of the corrupt principles of sin, self-love and
   lust, as if they were made up of the earth; and therefore have no
   savour of any thing else.

   In like manner, when by faith men come to embrace heavenly things,
   through the effectual working of a principle of spiritual life and
   grace in them, they are every day made more and more heavenly: "The
   inward man is renewed day by day." Love is more sincere and ardent,
   delight is more ravishing and sensible, desires are more enlarged and
   intense, and by all a taste and relish of heavenly things is heightened
   into refreshing experience. See Rom. v. 2-5.

   This is the way whereby one grace is added unto another, 2 Pet. i. 5-7,
   in degrees. Great is the assimilation between renewed affections and
   their spiritual objects that by this means may be attained.

   The mind hereby becomes the temple of God, wherein he dwells by the
   Spirit; Christ also dwelleth in believers, and they in him: "God is
   love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him," 1
   John iv. 16.

   Love in its proper exercise gives a mutual inhabitation unto God and
   believers. In brief, he whose affections are set upon heavenly things
   in a due manner will be heavenly minded, and in the due exercise of
   them will that heavenly mindedness be increased. The transformation and
   assimilation that is wrought is not in the objects or spiritual things
   themselves; they are not changed, neither in themselves nor in the
   representation made of them unto our minds; but the change is in our
   affections, which are made like unto them.

   Two cases deriving from this principle and consideration may be here
   spoken unto, and shall be so, -- the first in this, and the other in
   the following chapter. The one is concerning the slowness and
   imperceptibility of the growth of our affections in their assimilation
   unto heavenly things, with the causes and reasons of it. The other is
   the decays that frequently befall men in their affections unto
   spiritual things, instead of growing and thriving in them, with the
   reasons and causes thereof.

   1. The progress and growth of our affections into spirituality and
   heavenliness, into conformity unto the things they are set upon, is
   oftentimes very slow, and sometimes imperceptible; yea, for the most
   part, it is a hard thing to find it satisfactorily in ourselves or
   others. Our affections stand like shrubs in the wilderness, which see
   not when good cometh, and are not like plants in a garden enclosed,
   which is watered every day. But it is not so without our folly and our
   sin.

   (1.) The folly that keeps many in this condition consists herein: The
   generality of Christians are contented with their present measures, and
   design little more than not to lose the ground they have gained. And a
   pernicious folly it is, that both ruins the glory of religion and
   deprives the souls of men of peace and consolation. But so it is. Men
   have some grounds of persuasion, or at least they hope and suppose they
   have such grounds, that they are "passed from death unto life," that
   they are in a state of grace and acceptance with God. This state they
   will endeavour to preserve by a diligent performance of the duties it
   requireth, and the avoidance of such sins as whereby they might make a
   forfeiture of it; but as for earnest, watchful endeavours and diligence
   to thrive in this state, to grow in grace, to be changed from glory to
   glory into the image of Christ, to press forward towards the mark of
   the high calling, and after perfection, to lay hold upon eternal life,
   to be more holy, more humble, more righteous, more spiritually minded,
   to have their affections more and more transformed into the likeness of
   things above, they am hut few that sincerely and diligently apply
   themselves unto it, or unto the means of these things. The measures
   which they have attained unto give satisfaction unto the church, and
   reputation in the world that they are professors; and some so speak
   peace unto their own souls. To be more holy and heavenly, to have their
   affections more taken up with the things above, they suppose somewhat
   inconsistent with their present occasions and affairs. By this means
   hath religion lost much of its glory, and the souls of men have been
   deprived of the principal advantages of it in this world.

   Such persons are like unto men who live in a country wherein they are
   not only pressed with poverty and all sorts of misery, but are also
   obnoxious unto grievous punishments, and death itself, if they are
   taken in it. In this condition, they are told and assured of another
   country, wherein, so soon as they are arrived, they shall be freed from
   all fear of danger of punishment; and if they pass farther into it,
   they shall meet with riches, plenty, and a fair inheritance provided
   for them. Hereon they betake themselves unto their voyage to obtain an
   entrance into it and possession of it; but no sooner do they come
   within the borders, and so are free from danger, or fear of punishment
   and death, but they sit down, and will go no farther to enjoy the good
   things of the country whereinto they are come. And it falls out with
   many of them, that, through their sloth, negligence, and ignorance,
   they take up short of the true bounds and limits of the country of
   liberty and peace which they aimed at, whereby danger and death
   surprise them unawares. This ruin could not have befallen them had they
   industriously endeavoured to enter into the heart of the country, and
   have possessed the good things thereof. At best, being only on the
   borders, they lead a poor life all their days, exposed to wants and
   danger.

   So it is in this ease. Men falling under the power of convictions, and
   those restless fears wherewith they are accompanied, will stir up
   themselves and inquire how they may "flee from the wrath to come," how
   they may be delivered from the state of sin, and the eternal misery
   which will ensue thereon.

   In the gospel, not only mercy and pardon are proposed unto them on
   their believing, which is the first entrance into the heavenly country;
   but peace, and joy, and spiritual strength, upon their admission into
   it, and a progress made in it by faith and obedience. But many, when
   they have attained so far as that they have some hopes of pardon and
   freedom from the curse, so as to deliver them from their tormenting
   fears, will endeavour to preserve those hopes and keep that state, but
   will not pass on to a full enjoyment of the precious things of the
   gospel, by growth in grace and spiritual affections. But how many of
   them fall under woful mistakes for supposing themselves to be in a
   gospel state, it proves in the issue that they never entered into it.
   They were not, it may be, far from the kingdom of heaven, in the same
   sense as it was spoken of him who never came thither. There is no way
   to secure an interest in the gospel, as to pardon and mercy, safety and
   deliverance, but by a growth in grace, holiness, and spirituality;
   which gives an entrance into the choicest mercies and privileges of it.

   This folly of men in taking up with their measures, endeavouring only
   to maintain that state and condition which they hope they have
   attained, is the great reason why their affections do not daily grow up
   into spirituality, through an assimilation unto heavenly things. And a
   folly it is attended with innumerable aggravations; as, for instance,
   --

   [1.] It is contrary and destructive unto the genuine and principal
   property of gospel grace; for it is everywhere compared by our Saviour
   unto things which, from small seeds and beginnings, do grow up by a
   continual increase unto large measures, -- as to a grain of mustard
   seed, a little leaven, and the like.

   That grace in whose nature it is not to thrive and grow may justly be
   suspected, and ought diligently to be examined by them who take care of
   their own souls, and would not be eternally deceived.

   [2.] It is contrary unto the most excellent or invaluable evangelical
   promises recorded in the Old Testament and the New, and which are
   amongst the principal supportments of the faith, hope, and comfort of
   believers. God hath given them unto us to encourage us unto an
   expectation of such supplies of grace as shall cause us to thrive and
   grow against all opposition, unto the utmost of our continuance in this
   world. And they are so multiplied as that there is no need to mention
   any of them in particular; God evidencing thereby how great is the
   grace, and how precious, which he so often promiseth, and of what
   consideration it is unto ourselves. See Ps. xcii. 13-15; Isa. xl.
   28-31. Wherefore, the folly of taking up with present measures of
   grace, holiness, and spirituality, is attended with two unspeakable
   evils:-- 1st, A signal contempt of the love, grace, faithfulness, and
   wisdom of God, in giving of us such promises of grace, to make us to
   increase, thrive, and grow. How can it be done more effectually than by
   such a neglect of his promised grace? 2dly, An evidence that such
   persons love not, care not for, grace and holiness for their own sake,
   but merely to serve their turn at present, as they suppose; nor do
   desire the least of grace or privilege by Christ without which they can
   have any hopes to get to heaven. This sufficiently discovers men to be
   wholly under the power of self-love, and to centre therein; for if they
   may have so much grace and mercy as may save them, they care for no
   more.

   [3.] It is repugnant unto the honour of gospel grace, as though it
   would carry us so far, and no farther, in the way to glory: for it must
   be known that this sort of persons, who sit down in their present
   measures and attainments, either really have no true grace at all, or
   that which is of the lowest, meanest, and most imperceptible size and
   degree; for if any one hath attained any considerable growth in faith
   and love, in the mortification of sin, in heavenly mindedness, it is
   utterly impossible but that ordinarily he will be pressing forward
   towards farther attainments and farther degrees of spiritual strength
   in the life of God. So the apostle declares it in his own example,
   Phil. iii. 12-14. What thoughts can these persons have concerning the
   glory, power, and efficacy of gospel grace, which they suppose they
   have received? If they measure them by the effects which they find in
   themselves, either as unto the mortification of sin, or strength unto
   and delight in duties of holiness, or as unto spiritual consolation,
   they can see no excellency nor beauty in them; for they do not manifest
   themselves but in their success, as they transform the soul daily into
   the image of Christ.

   [4.] It is that which hath lost the reputation and glory of religion in
   the world, and therein the honour of the gospel itself: for the most of
   professors do take up with such measures as put no lustre upon it, as
   give no commendation unto the religion they profess; for their measures
   allow them such a conformity unto the world, in their ways, words, and
   actions, in their gestures, apparel, and attire, as that they are no
   way visibly to be distinguished from it; yea, the ground and reason why
   the most do rest in their present measures is, because they will not be
   farther differenced from the world. This hath greatly lost the glory,
   honour, and reputation of religion amongst us. And, on the other side,
   if all visible professors would endeavour continually to grow and
   thrive in spirituality of mind and heavenliness of affections, with
   fruits suited thereunto, it would bring a conviction on the world that
   there is a secret invisible power accompanying the religion they
   profess, transforming them daily into the image and likeness of God.

   [5.] Whatever is pretended unto the contrary, it is inconsistent with
   all solid peace of conscience; for no such thing is promised unto any
   who live in such a contempt of divine promises, nor is it attainable
   but by the diligent exercise of all those graces which lie neglected
   under this frame. Few men are able to judge whether they have real,
   internal, abiding peace or no, unless it be in case of trials and
   temptations At other seasons, general hopes and confidences do or may
   supply the want of it in their minds; but when any fear, danger, trial,
   or word of conviction, befalls them, they cannot but inquire and
   examine how it is with them. And if they find their affections cold,
   dead, earthly, carnal, withering, not spiritual or heavenly, there will
   be an end of their supposed peace, and they will fall into woful
   disquietments; and they will then find that the root of all this evil
   lies in this frame and disposition: They have been so far satisfied
   with their present measures or attainments in religion, as that the
   utmost of their endeavours has been but to preserve their station, or
   not to forfeit it by open sins, -- to keep their souls alive from the
   severe reflections of the word, and their reputation fair in the church
   of God; spiritually to thrive, to prosper in their souls, to wax fat
   and flourishing in the inward man, to bring forth more fruit as age
   increaseth, to press towards perfection, are things they have not
   designed nor pursued.

   Hence it is that so many among us are visibly at an unthrifty stand in
   the world, -- that where they were one year, there they are another,
   like shrubs in the wilderness; not like plants in the "garden of God,"
   not as vines planted in "a very fruitful hill." Yea, though many are
   sensible themselves that they are cold, lifeless, and fruitless, yet
   will they not be convinced that there is a necessity of making a daily
   progress in spirituality and heavenly mindedness, whereby the inward
   man may be renewed day by day, and grace augmented with the increase of
   God. This is a work, as they suppose, for them who have nothing else to
   do; not consistent with their business, callings, and occasions; not
   necessary, as they hope, unto their salvation; nor, it may be, to be
   attained by them if they should set themselves about it. This
   apprehension or imagination, upon the beginning of the declension and
   decay of Christian religion in the many, cast off holiness and devotion
   unto a sort of men who undertook to retire themselves utterly out of
   the world; amongst whom also the substance of religion was quickly
   lost, and a cloud or meteor of superstition embraced in the room of it.
   But this folly is ominous unto the souls of men.

   Those who have made the greatest progress in the conformity of their
   affections unto things spiritual and heavenly know most of its
   necessity, excellency, and desirableness; yea, without some progress in
   it, these things will not be known. Such will testify that the more
   they attain herein, the more they see there is yet to to be attained,
   and the more they do desire to attain what is before. Forgetting those
   things which are behind, they reach forth unto the things that are yet
   before them, like men running in a race, whose prize and reward is yet
   before them, Phil. iii. 13, 14. It is a comely thing to see a Christian
   weaned from the world, minding heavenly things, green and flourishing
   in spiritual affections; and it is the more lovely because it is so
   rare. The generality of them take up with those measures which neither
   glorify God nor bring in durable peace unto their own souls.

   That which men pretend and complain of herein is, the difficulty of the
   work. They can, as they suppose, preserve their present station, but to
   press forward, to grow in grace, to thrive in their affections, this is
   too hard for them. But this complaint is unequal and unjust, and adds
   unto the guilt of their sloth. It reflects upon the words of our
   Saviour, that "his yoke is easy and his burden light," that "his
   commandments are not grievous." It expresseth unbelief in the promises
   of God tendering such supplies of grace as to render all the ways of
   Wisdom easy, yea, mercy and peace. It is contrary unto the experience
   of all who have with any sincerity and diligence engaged in the ways of
   gospel obedience. And the whole cause of the pretended difficulty lies
   in themselves alone, which may be reduced unto these two heads:--

   1st, A desire to retain some thing or things that is or are
   inconsistent with such a progress; for unless the heart be ready on all
   occasions to esteem every thing "as loss and dung, so as we may win
   Christ," the work will be accompanied with insuperable difficulties.
   This is the first principle of religion, of gospel obedience, that all
   things are to be despised for Christ But this difficulty ariseth not
   from the thing itself, but from our indisposition unto it and unfitness
   for it. That which is an easy, pleasant walk unto a sound and healthy
   man is a toilsome journey to him that is diseased and infirm. In
   particular, whilst men will retain an inordinate respect unto the
   world, the vanities, the pleasures, the profits, the contentments of
   it; whilst self-love, putting an undue valuation on our persons, our
   relations, our enjoyments, our reputations, doth cleave unto us, -- we
   shall labour in the fire when we engage in this duty, or rather, we
   shall not at all sincerely engage in it. Wherefore the apostle tells us
   that in this case we must cast off every weight, and the sin that doth
   so easily beset us, if we intend to run with joy the race that is set
   before us, Heb. xii. 1.

   2dly, It is because men dwell continually upon the entrances of
   religion, in the first and lowest exercise of grace. Some are always
   beginning at religion, and the beginning of things are always
   difficult. They design not to he complete in the whole will of God, nor
   to give all graces their perfect work. They do not with use habituate
   grace unto a readiness in all the actings of it, which the apostle
   commends in them that are "perfect" or complete, Heb. v. 14. Hence he
   calls such persons "babes and carnal," comparatively unto them that are
   "strong men and spiritual." Such persons do not oblige themselves unto
   the whole work and all the duties of religion, but only to what they
   judge necessary unto them in their present circumstances. In
   particular, they do not attempt a thorough work in the mortification of
   any sin, but are hewing and hacking at it, as their convictions are
   urgent or abate, the wounds whereof in the body of sin are quickly
   healed. They give not any grace its perfect work, but are always making
   essays, and so give over.

   Whilst it is thus with any, they shall always be deluded with the
   apprehensions of insuperable difficulties as to the growth of their
   affections in spirituality and heavenliness. Remove these things out of
   the way, as they ought to be removed, and we shall find all the paths
   wherein we are to walk towards God to be pleasantness and peace.

   This is the first cause whence it is that there may be affections truly
   spiritual and graciously renewed in some persons, who yet do not thrive
   in an assimilation and conformity unto heavenly things: Men take up
   with their present measures, and thereon pretend either necessary
   occasion or discouragements from difficulties in attempting spiritual
   growth in the inward man. But they may thank themselves if, as they
   bring no honour unto Christ, so they have no solid peace in their own
   souls.

   (2.) As the evil proceedeth from folly, so it is always the consequent
   of sin, of many sins, of various sorts. Let us not dwell on heartless
   complaints that we do not find our affections lively and heavenly, that
   we do not find the inward man to thrive or grow. Let us not hearken
   after this or that relief or comfort under this consideration, as many
   things are usually insisted on unto this purpose. They may be of use
   when persons are under temptations; and not able to make a right
   judgment of themselves; but in the course of our ordinary walking with
   God, they are not to be attended nor retired unto. The general reason
   of this evil state is our own sinful carelessness, negligence, and
   sloth, with perhaps an indulgence unto some known lust or corruption.
   And we do in vain seek after refreshing cordials, as though we were
   only spiritually faint, when we stand in need of lancings and burnings,
   as nigh unto a lethargy. It would be too long to give instances of
   those sins which fail not effectually to obstruct the thriving of
   spiritual affections: but, in general, when men are careless as unto
   that continual watch which they ought to keep over their hearts; whilst
   they are negligent in holy duties, either as unto the seasons of them
   or the manner of their performance; when they are strangers unto holy
   meditation and self-examination; whilst they inordinately pursue the
   things of the world, or are so tender and delicate as that they will
   not undergo the hardship of a heavenly life, either as unto the inward
   or outward man; much more when they are vain in their conversation,
   corrupt in their communication, especially if under the predominant
   influence of any particular lust, -- it is vain to think of thriving in
   spiritual affections. And yet thus it is with all who ordinarily and in
   their constant course are thriftless herein.

Chapter XVII.

   Decays in spiritual affections, with the causes and danger of them --
   Advice unto them who are sensible of the evil of spiritual decays.

   2. IT must be acknowledged that there is yet that which is worse than
   what we have yet insisted on, and more opposite unto the growth of
   affections in conformity unto heavenly things, which is the proper
   character of those that are spiritually renewed; and this is their
   spiritual decay, manifesting itself in sensible and visible effects.

   Some there are, yea many, who, upon the beginning of a profession of
   their conversion unto God, have made a great appearance of vigorous,
   active, spiritual affections; yea, it is so with most, it may be all,
   who are really so converted. God takes notice of the love of the youth
   in his people, of the love of their espousals.

   In some, this vigour of spiritual affections is from the real power of
   grace, exerting its efficacy on their hearts and in their minds. In
   others, it is from other causes; as, for instance, relief from
   conviction, by spiritual illumination, will produce this effect. And
   this falls out unto the advantage of such persons, that generally a
   change is wrought in their younger days; for then their affections in
   their natural powers are active, and bear great sway in the whole soul.
   Wherefore, the change that is made is most eminent in them, be it what
   it will. But as men increase in age, and thereon grow up in carnal
   wisdom and a great valuation of earthly things, with their care about
   them and converse in them, they abate and decay in their spiritual
   affections every day; they will abide in their profession, but have
   lost their first love.

   It is a shame and folly unutterable that it should be so with any who
   make profession of that religion, wherein there are so many
   incomparable excellencies to endear and engage them to it more and
   more. But why should we hide what experience makes manifest in the
   sight of the sun, and what multitudes proclaim concerning themselves?
   Wherefore, I look upon it as a great evidence, if not absolutely of the
   sincerity of grace, yet of the life and growth of it, when men as they
   grow up in age do grow in an undervaluation of present things, in
   contempt of the world, in duties of charity and bounty, and decay not
   in any of them. But I say it is usual that the entrances of men's
   profession of religion and conversion unto God are attended with
   vigorous, active affections towards spiritual things. Of them who
   really and sincerely believed, it is said that on their believing "they
   rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory;" and of those who only
   had a work of conviction on them, improved by temporary faith, that
   "they received the word with joy, and did many things gladly."

   In this state do many abide and thrive, until their affections be
   wholly transformed into the image and likeness of things above. But
   with many of all sorts it is not so. They fall into woful decays as
   unto their affections about spiritual things, and consequently, in
   their whole profession and conversation, their moisture becomes as the
   drought in summer. They have no experience of the life and actings of
   them in themselves, nor any comfort or refreshment from them; they
   honour not the gospel with any fruits of love, zeal, or delight, nor
   are useful any way unto others by their example. Some of them have had
   seeming recoveries, and are yet again taken into a lifeless frame.
   Warnings, afflictions, sicknesses, the word, have awakened them, but
   they are fallen again into a dead sleep, so as that they seem to be
   "trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by
   the roots."

   Some things must be spoken unto this woful condition in general, as
   that which is directly opposite unto the grace and duty of being
   spiritually minded, and contrary unto and obstructive of the growth of
   spiritual affections in an assimilation unto heavenly things. And what
   shall be spoken may be applied unto all the degrees of these decays,
   though all of them are not alike dangerous or perilous.

   (1.) There may be a time of temptation, wherein a soul may apprehend in
   itself not only a decay in, but an utter loss of, all spiritual
   affections, when yet it is not so. As believers may apprehend and judge
   that the Lord hath forsaken and forgotten them when he hath not done
   so, Isa. xlix. 14, 15; so they may, under their temptations, apprehend
   that they have forsaken God, when they have not done so; as a man in
   the night may apprehend he hath lost his way, and be in great distress,
   when he is in his proper road: for temptation brings darkness and
   amazement, and leads into mistakes and a false judgment in all things.
   They find not, it may be, grace working in love, joy, and delight, as
   formerly, nor that activity of heart and mind in holy duties which
   spiritual affections gave unto them; but yet, it may be, the same grace
   works in godly sorrow, by mourning, humiliation, and self-abasement, no
   less effectually, nor less acceptably unto God. Such as these I
   separate from the present consideration.

   (2.) There may be a decay in affections themselves as unto their
   actings towards any objects whatever, at least as unto the outward
   symptoms and effects of them; and on this ground their operations
   toward spiritual things may be less sensible. So men in their younger
   days may be more ready to express their sorrow by tears, and their joy
   by sensible exultation and motion of their spirits, than in riper
   years. And this may be so when there is no decay of grace in the
   affections as renewed. But, --

   [1.] When it is so, it is a burden unto them in whom it is. They cannot
   but mourn and have a godly jealousy over themselves, lest the decays
   they find should not be in the outward but the inward, not in the
   natural but the spiritual man; and they will labour that in all duties,
   and at all times, it may be with them as in days of old, although they
   cannot attain that strength in them, that vigour of spirit, that life,
   joy, peace, and comfort, which many have had experience of.

   [2.] There will be in such persons no decays in holiness of life, or as
   unto diligence in all religious duties. If the decay be really of grace
   in the affections, it will be accompanied with a proportionable decay
   in all other things wherein the life of God is concerned; but if it be
   only as unto the sensible actings of natural affections, no such decay
   will ensue.

   [3.] Grace will in this case more vigorously act itself in the other
   faculties and powers of the soul, as the judgment and the will, in
   their approbation of and firm adherence unto spiritual things. But, --
   When men find, or may find, their affections yet quick, active, and
   intent on other things, as the lawful enjoyments and comforts of this
   life, it is in vain for them to relieve themselves that the decays they
   find are in their affections as natural, and not, as they ought to be,
   gracious. If we see a man in his old age grow more in love with the
   things of this world, and less in love with the things of God, it is
   not through the weakness of nature, but through the strength of sin.

   On these, and, it may be, some other the like occasions, there may be
   an apprehension of a decay in spiritual affections when it may not be
   so, at least not unto the degree that is apprehended. But when it is so
   really, as it is evidently with many, I had almost said with the most
   in these days, it is a woful frame of heart, and never enough to be
   lamented. It is that which lies in direct contradiction unto that
   spiritual mindedness which is life and peace. It is a consumption of
   the soul, which threatens it with death every day.

   It belongs not unto my design to treat of it in particular, yet I
   cannot let it pass without some remarks upon it, it being an evil
   almost epidemical among professors, and prevalent in some unto such a
   degree as that they seem to be utterly forsaken of all powers of
   spiritual life.

   Now, besides all that folly and sin which we before discovered as the
   causes of the want of the growth of our affections in spirituality and
   heavenliness, which in this case of their decay are more abominable,
   there is a multiplication of evils wherewith this state of heart and
   mind is accompanied; for, --

   (1.) It is that which, of all things, the Lord Christ is most
   displeased with in churches or professors. He pities them in their
   temptations, he suffers with them in their persecutions, he intercedes
   for them on their surprisal, but threatens them under their spiritual
   decays, Rev. ii. 4, 5, iii. 1-3. This he cannot bear with, as that
   which both reflects dishonour upon himself, and which he knows to be
   ruinous unto those in whom it is, He will longer bear with them who are
   utterly dead than with those who abide under these decays, Rev. iii.
   15, 16. This is the only case wherein he threatens to reject and cast
   off a professing church, to take away his candlestick from it, unless
   it be that of false worship and idolatry. He that spake thus unto the
   churches of old speaks now the same unto us; for he lives forever, and
   is always the same, and his word is living and unchangeable. There is
   not one of us who are under this frame, but the Lord Christ by his word
   and Spirit testifieth his displeasure against us; and if he be against
   us, who shall plead for us? Consider what he says in this ease, Rev.
   ii. 5, iii. 3. Oh! who can stand before these dreadful intimations of
   his displeasure? The Lord help us to mind it, lest he in whom we
   profess to place our only trust be in our trim found our greatest
   enemy! Take heed of such sins as Christ himself, our only advocate,
   hath put a mark upon as those which he will not save us in.

   (2.) It is that wherewith, above all things, the Holy Spirit is
   grieved. His work it is to give grace an increase and progress in our
   souls; he begins it, and he carries it on. And there can be no greater
   grief unto a wise and gracious worker than to have his work decay and
   go backward under his hand. This is the occasion of those complaints of
   God which we find in the Scripture, of the unprofitableness and
   backsliding of men after the use of means and remedies for their
   fruitfulness and cure. "What," saith he, "could I have done more for my
   vineyard than I have done? Why, then, when I looked for grapes, did it
   bring forth wild grapes?" Can any thing be apprehended to be such a
   just matter of grief and complaint unto the Holy Spirit, as to see and
   find those whom he had once raised up unto holy and heavenly
   affections, so as that their delights were in, and their thoughts much
   upon, the things that are above, become earthly or sensual, to have no
   sensible actings of any of his graces in them? which is the state of
   them who are under the power of spiritual decays, And this is the only
   case wherein God speaks unto men in the way of complaint and
   expostulation, and useth all sorts of arguments to convince them of
   their folly herein.

   When a wise, tender, and careful parent, [who] hath been diligent in
   the use of all means for the education of his child, and he for some
   time hath given good hopes of himself, finds him to slacken in his
   diligence, to be careless in his calling, to delight in evil company,
   -- how solicitous is his heart about him! how much is he grieved and
   affected with his miscarriage! The heart of the Spirit of God is
   infinitely more tender towards us than that of the most affectionate
   parent can be towards an only child; and when he with cost and care
   hath nourished and brought us up unto some growth and progress in
   spiritual affections, wherein all his concerns in us do lie, for us to
   grow cold, dull, earthly minded, to cleave unto the pleasures or lusts
   of this world, -- how is he grieved! how is he provoked! It may be this
   consideration of grieving the Holy Spirit is of no great weight with
   some; they should have little concernment herein if they could well
   free themselves in other respects: but let such persons know it is
   impossible for them to give a greater evidence of a profligate hardness
   in sin.

   (3.) This is that which in an especial manner provoketh the judgments
   of God against any church, as was intimated before. When, in the order
   of profession and worship, any church hath a name to live, but as to
   the power of grace acting in the affections is dead; when it is not so
   cold as to forsake the external institutions of worship, nor so hot as
   to enliven their duties with spiritual affections, -- the Lord Christ
   will not long bear with them; yea, judgment will suddenly break out
   towards such a house of God.

   (4.) It is absolutely inconsistent with all comfortable assurance of
   the love of God. Whatever persons under the power of such a frame
   pretend unto of that kind, it is sinful security, not gracious
   assurance or peace. And constantly as professors grow cold and decay in
   their spiritual affections, stupidity of conscience and security of
   mind do grow also upon them. It is so, I say, unless they are sometimes
   surprised or overtaken with some greater sin, which reflects severely
   on their consciences, and casts them for a time under troubles and
   distresses. But that peace with God and a comfortable assurance of
   salvation should be consistent with an habitual decay in grace,
   especially in those graces which should act themselves in our
   affections, is contrary to the whole tenor and testimony of the
   Scripture; and the supposition of it would be the bane and poison of
   religion. I do not say that our assurance and peace with God do arise
   wholly from the actings of grace in us; there are other causes of them,
   where-into they are principally resolved; -- but this I say, under an
   habitual declension or decay of grace in the spirituality of our
   affections, no man can keep or maintain a gracious sense of the love of
   God, or of peace with him. And therefore there is no duty more severely
   to be pressed on all at this day than a diligent examination and trial
   of the grounds of their peace, lest it should be with any of them as it
   was with Laodicea, who was satisfied in her good state and condition,
   when it was most miserable and almost desperate. Yea, I must say that
   it is impossible that many professors whom we see and converse withal
   should have any solid peace with God. "Do men gather grapes of thorns,
   or figs of thistles?" it is a fruit that will not grow on a vain,
   earthly, selfish frame of mind and conversation. And therefore such
   persons, whatever they pretend, are either asleep in a sinful security,
   or live on most uncertain hopes, which probably may deceive them.
   Nothing can be so ruinous unto our profession as once to suppose it is
   an easy matter, a thing of course, to maintain our peace with God. God
   forbid but that our utmost diligence and continued endeavours to thrive
   in every grace should be required hereunto! The whole beauty and glory
   of our religion depends hereon. "To be spiritually minded is life and
   peace."

   (5.) Such a decay as that described is a dangerous symptom of an evil
   state and condition, and that those in whom it is will at last be found
   to be but hypocrites. I know such persons will or may have pretended
   evidences unto the contrary, and that they are well enough satisfied of
   and with their own sincerity in many things, so as that it is
   impossible to fix upon them the sense and conviction of being but
   hypocrites. But this apprehension ariseth from a false notion of
   hypocrisy. No man, they suppose, is a hypocrite, but he that generally
   or universally pretends himself in religion to be what he is not, and
   what he knows himself not to be, or at least might easily do so; and it
   is true that this is the broadest notion of pharisaical hypocrisy: but
   take a hypocrite for him who, under light, profession, gifts, duties,
   doth habitually and willingly fail in any point of sincerity, he is no
   less a perishing hypocrite than the former, and it may alter the case
   with them. I do not say that every one in whom there is this prevalent
   decay in spiritual affections is a hypocrite; God forbid! I only say
   that when it continues without remedy, it is such a symptom of
   hypocrisy as that he who is wise and hath a care of his soul will not
   rest until he hath searched it unto the bottom. For it seems as if it
   were thus with such persons: They have had a false or imperfect work in
   that conversion unto God which they have professed. Conviction of sin,
   communication of spiritual light and gifts, alteration upon the
   affections, change of society and conversation, have made it up. Now,
   it is the nature of such a work greatly to flourish for a season, in
   all the principal parts and duties of profession; but it is in its
   nature also gradually to decay, until it be quite withered away. In
   some it is lost by the power of some vigorous temptations, and
   particular lusts indulged unto, ending in worldliness and sensuality;
   but in the most it decays gradually, until it hath lost all its savour
   and sap. See John xv. 5. Wherefore, whilst men find this decay in
   themselves, unless they are fallen under the power of a destructive
   security, unless they are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,
   they cannot but think it their duty to examine how things stand with
   them, whether they ever effectually closed with Christ, and had the
   faith of God's elect, which works by love, seeing it is with them as
   though they had only a work of another nature: for a saving work, in
   its own nature and in the diligent use of means, thrives and groweth,
   as the whole Scripture testifieth; but it is this false and imperfect
   working that hath no root, and is thus subject to withering.

   (6.) Persons in such an estate are apt to deceive themselves with false
   hopes and notions, whereby the deceitfulness of sin doth put forth its
   power to harden them unto their ruin. Two ways there are whereby this
   pernicious effect is produced; -- the one by the prevalency of a
   particular lust or sin; the other by a neglect of spiritual duties, and
   a vain conversation in the world, under which the soul pines away and
   consumes.

   As unto the first of these, there are three false notions whereby the
   deceitfulness of sin deludes the souls of men:--

   [1.] The first is, that it is that one sin alone wherein they would be
   indulged. Let them be spared in this one thing, and in all others they
   will be exact enough. This is the composition that Naaman would have
   made in the matters of religion, 2 Kings v. 18, and it is that which
   many trust unto. Hence it hath, by the event, been made to appear that
   some persons have lived long in the practice of some gross sin, and yet
   all the while used a semblance of great diligence in other duties of
   religion. This is a false notion, whereby poor sinners delude their own
   souls; for suppose it possible that a man should give himself up unto
   any lust, or be under the power of it, and yet be observant of all
   other duties, yet this would give him no relief as unto the eternal
   condition of his soul. The rule is peremptory unto this purpose, James
   ii. 10, 11. One sin willingly lived in is as able to destroy a man's
   soul as a thousand. Besides, it is practically false. There is no man
   that lives in any one known sin but he really lives in more, though
   that only bears the chiefest sway. With some such persons these sins
   appear unto others, who observe their frame and spirit, though they
   appear not to themselves; in some they are manifest in themselves,
   although they are hidden from others, 1 Tim. v. 24. But let no man
   relieve himself with thoughts that it is but one sin, whilst that one
   sin keeps him in a constant neglect of God. Hence, --

   [2.] They deceive themselves hereby; for they judge that although they
   cannot as yet shake off their sin, yet they will continue still to love
   God and abound in the duties of his worship. They will not become
   haters of God and his ways and persecutors for all the world; and
   therefore hope that, notwithstanding this one Zoar, this lesser sin,
   which their constitution and their circumstances engage them in, it may
   be well with them at the last. This also is a false notion, a mere
   instrument in the hand of sin to act its deceit by; for no man that
   willingly liveth in any sin can love God at all, as is evident in that
   rule, 1 John ii. 15. It is but a false pretence of love to God that any
   man hath who liveth in any known sin. Where God is not loved above all,
   he is not loved at all; and he is not so where men will not part with
   one cursed lust for his sake. Let not your light deceive you, nor your
   gifts, nor your duties, nor your profession; if you live in sin, you
   love not God.

   [3.] They determine that at such or such a season or time, after such
   satisfaction given unto their lusts or pleasures, they will utterly
   give over, so as that iniquity shall not be their ruin. But this is a
   false notion also, an effectual instrument of the deceitfulness of sin.
   He that will not now give over, who will not immediately upon the
   discovery of the prevalency of any sin and warning about it endeavour
   sincerely and constantly its relinquishment, say what he will and
   pretend what he will, never intends to give over, nor is it probable,
   in an ordinary way, that ever he will do so. When men's decays are from
   the prevalency of particular sins, by these and the like false notions
   do they harden themselves unto ruin.

   For those who are pining away under hectical consumption, a general
   decay of the vital spirits of religion, they have also false notions
   whereby they deceive themselves; as, --

   [1.] That although they have some cause to mistrust themselves, yet
   indeed their condition is not so bad as some may apprehend it, or as
   they are warned it is. And this ariseth from hence, that they have not
   as yet been overtaken with any enormous sin which hath filled their
   consciences with terror and disquietment. But this is a false notion
   also; for every decay is dangerous, especially such as the mind is
   ready to plead for and to countenance itself in.

   [2.] They are prone to suppose that this decay doth not arise from
   themselves and the evil of their own hearts, but from their
   circumstances, businesses, present occasions, and state of life; which
   when they are freed from, they will at least return unto their former
   love and delight in spiritual things. But this is a false notion also,
   by virtue of that rule, Heb. iii. 12. Let men's circumstances and
   occasions of life be what they will, all their departures from God are
   from "an evil heart of unbelief."

   [3.] They judge it no hard matter to retrieve themselves out of this
   state, but that which they can easily do when there is an absolute
   necessity for it. But this is a false notion also. Recovery from
   backsliding is the hardest task in Christian religion, and which few
   make either comfortable or honourable work of.

   In this state, I say, men are apt by such false reasonings to deceive
   themselves unto their eternal ruin; which makes the consideration of it
   the more necessary.

   Wherefore, I say, lastly, upon the whole, that whoso find themselves
   under the power of this wretched frame, whoso are sensible in
   themselves, or at least make it evident unto others, that they are
   under a decay in their spiritual condition, if they rest in that state,
   without groaning, labouring, endeavouring for deliverance from it, they
   can have no well-grounded hopes in themselves of life and immortality;
   yea, they are in those "paths which go down unto the chambers of
   death."

   I cannot let this pass without something of advice unto them who find
   themselves under such decays, are sensible of them, and would be
   delivered from them, and I shall give it in a few words:--

   First, Remember former things; call to mind how it was with you in the
   spring and vigour of your affections, and compare your present state,
   enjoyment, peace, and quiet, with what they were then. This will be a
   great principle of return unto God, Hos. ii. 7. And to put a little
   weight upon it, we may consider, --

   First, God himself makes it on his part a ground and reason of his
   return unto us in a way of mercy, and of the continuance of his love,
   Jer. ii. 2. Even when a people are under manifold decays, whilst yet
   they are within the bounds of God's covenant and mercy, he will
   remember their first love, with the fruits and actings of it in trials
   and temptations; which moves his compassion towards them. And the way
   to have God thus remember it, is for us to remember it with delight,
   and longing of soul that it were with us as in those days of old, when
   we had the love of espousals for God in Christ, Jer. xxxi. 18-20.

   Secondly, It is the way whereby the saints of old have refreshed and
   encouraged themselves under their greatest despondencies. So doth the
   psalmist in many places; as, for instance, Ps. xlii. 6, "O my God, my
   soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the
   land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar." David in
   the time of his persecution by Saul, when he wandered up and down in
   deserts, wildernesses, and solitudes, had, under his fears, distresses,
   and exercises, great, holy, spiritual communion with God; as many of
   his psalms composed on such occasions do testify. And the greater his
   distresses were, the more fervent were his affections in all his
   addresses unto God; and he was never in greater than when he escaped
   out of the cave at Adullam, and went thence unto Mizpeh of Moab, to get
   shelter for his parents, 1 Sam. xxii. 3. Then was he in the land of the
   Hermonites, the hill Hermon being the boundary eastward of the
   Israelites' possession next to Moab, Deut. iii. 8, 9. There, no doubt,
   David had a blessed exercise of his faith and of all his affections
   towards God, wherein his soul found great refreshment. Being now in
   great distress and disconsolation of spirit, among other things under a
   sense that God had forgotten him, Ps. xlii. 9, he calls to mind the
   blessed experience he had of communion with God, in the land of the
   Hermonites, wherein he now found support and refreshment. So at other
   times he called to remembrance "the days of old," and in them his
   "songs in the night," or the sweet refreshment he had in spiritual
   converse with God in former times. I have known one in the depth of
   distress and darkness of mind, who, going through temptation to destroy
   himself, was relieved and delivered in the instant of ruin by a sudden
   remembrance that at such a time, and in such a place, he had prayed
   fervently with the engagement of all his affections unto God.

   Wherefore, you that are sensible of these decays, or ought so to be,
   take the advice of our Saviour, "Remember whence you are fallen." Call
   to mind the former days. Consider if it were not better with you [then]
   than now, when in your lying down and your rising up you had many
   thoughts of God and of the things of God, and they were sweet and
   precious unto your souls; when you rejoiced at the remembrance of his
   holiness; when you had zeal for his glory, delight in his worship, and
   were glad when they said, "Let us go to the house of God together;"
   when you poured forth your souls with freedom and enlarged affections
   before him, and were sensible of the visits and refreshments of his
   love. Remember what peace, what tranquility of mind, what joy you had
   whilst it was so with you; and consider what you have gotten since you
   have forsaken God, in any measure or degree. Dare to deal plainly with
   yourselves. Is not all wherein you have now to do with God either form,
   custom, and selfishness, or attended with trouble, disquietment, and
   fears? Do you truly know either how to live or how to diet Are you not
   sometimes a terror unto yourselves? It must be so, unless you are
   hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. What have all your lovers
   done for you, that you have entertained in the room of God in Christ
   and spiritual things? Speak plainly; have they not defiled you, wounded
   you, weakened you, and brought you into that condition that you know
   not what you are nor to whom you do belong? What are your thoughts when
   you are most awake, when you are most yourselves? Do you not sometimes
   pant within yourselves, and say, "O that it were with us as in former
   days."

   And if you can be no way affected with the remembrance of former
   things, then one of these two great evils you are certainly under; for
   either, 1. You never had a true and real work on your souls, whatever
   you professed, and so never had true and real communion with God in any
   duties. You had only a temporary work, which excited your affections
   for a season; which, now it is worn off, leaves no sweet remembrance of
   itself upon your minds. Had your faith and love been sincere in what
   you did, it were impossible but that the remembrance of their actings,
   in some especial instances, should be sweet and refreshing unto you. Or
   else, 2. You are hardened through the deceitfulness of sin, and there
   is no way left to give a sense or impression of spiritual things upon
   your minds. You have truly nothing left in religion but the fear of
   hell and trouble of duties. I speak not to such at present.

   As unto those unto whom this frame is a burden, there is no more
   effectual means to stir them up unto endeavours for deliverance than a
   continual remembrance of former things, and experiences they have had
   of holy intercourse and communion with God. This will revive, quicken,
   and strengthen the things that are ready to die, and beget a
   self-abhorrency in them in consideration of that woful frame and temper
   of mind which, by their sins and negligence, they have brought
   themselves into.

   Secondly, Consider that as there are many things dreadfully pronounced
   in the Scripture against backsliding and backsliders in heart, as it is
   with you, yet also there are especial calls and promises given and
   proposed unto those in your condition; and know assuredly that upon
   your compliance or non-compliance with them depends your everlasting
   blessedness or woe.

   Consider both call and promise in that word of God's grace, Jer. iii.
   12-14, "Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
   thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not cause mine
   anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will
   not keep anger forever. Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast
   transgressed against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to
   the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice,
   saith the Lord. Turn, O backsliding children, saith the Lord; for I am
   married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a
   family, and I will bring you to Zion." Add hereunto this blessed
   promise, Hos. xiv. 4, "I will heal their backsliding, I will love them
   freely: for mine anger is turned away from him." If you design to live
   and not die, it must be by yielding obedience unto this call, and
   pleading this promise before God, mixing it with faith. Your return
   must be by the word, Isa. lvii. 18, 19. Here lies your great
   encouragement and direction, herein lieth your only relief. As you
   value your souls, defer not the duty you are called unto one moment.
   You know not how soon you may be without the reach of calls and
   promises; and he that can hear them without stirring up himself in
   sincerity to comply with them hath made already a great progress
   towards that length.

   Thirdly, As unto those who on these and the like considerations do not
   only desire but will endeavour also to retrieve themselves from this
   condition, I shall give no advice at present but this, Be in good
   earnest. As the prophet speaks in another case, if you will return,
   "return and come," make thorough work of it. You must do so at one time
   or another, or you will perish. Why not now? Why, is not this the best
   season? Who knows but it may be the only time you will have for it? It
   were easy to multiply all sorts of arguments unto this purpose.
   Trifling endeavours, occasional resolutions and attempts, like the
   early cloud and morning dew, shifting with warnings and convictions, by
   renewed duties, until their impressions are worn out, will ruin your
   souls. Unless there be universal diligence and permanency in your
   endeavours, you are undone. "Then shall ye know the Lord, if ye follow
   on to know him."

   But now to return. These things, I say, through our sloth, negligence,
   and sin, may befall us as unto our spiritually-renewed affections:
   Their progress in conformity unto spiritual and heavenly things may be
   slow, imperceptible, yea, totally obstructed for a season; and not only
   so, but they may fall under decays, and the soul therein be guilty of
   backsliding from God; but this is that which they are capacitated for
   by their renovation, this is that which the grace wherewith they are
   renewed doth lead unto, this is that which, in the diligent use of
   means, they will grow up unto, whereon our comfort and peace do depend,
   -- namely, a holy assimilation unto those spiritual and heavenly things
   which they are set and fixed on, wherein they are renewed and made more
   spiritual and heavenly every day.

Chapter XVIII.

   [The state of spiritual affections.]

   It remains only, as unto this head now spoken unto, that we briefly
   consider what is the state of spiritual affections thus daily exercised
   and improved. And this we shall do by showing, -- first, What is their
   pattern; secondly, What is their rule; thirdly, What is their measure,
   or whereunto they may attain:--

   First, The pattern which we ought continually to bear in our eyes,
   whereunto our affections ought to be conformed, is Jesus Christ and the
   affections of his holy soul. The mind is the seat of all our
   affections; and this is that we ought continually to design and
   endeavour, namely, that the "same mind be in us that was in Christ
   Jesus," Phil. ii. 5. To have our minds so affected with spiritual
   things as was the mind of Christ is the principal part of our duty and
   grace; nor do I think that any man can attain any considerable degree
   in spiritual mindedness who is not much in the contemplation of the
   same mind in Christ, 2 Cor. iii. 18. To this purpose ought we to
   furnish our minds with instances of the holy affections that were in
   Christ, and their blessed exercise on all occasions. The Scripture
   makes a full representation of them unto us, and we ought to be
   conversant in our meditations on them. What glorious things are spoken
   of his love to God and his delight in him, whence also he "delighted to
   do his will, and his law was in the midst of his bowels," Ps. xl. 8, --
   seated in the throne of his affections! What pity and compassion had he
   for the souls of men, yea, for the whole human kind, in all their
   sufferings, pains, and distresses! How were all his affections always
   in perfection of order, under the conduct of the spirit of his mind!
   Hence was his self-denial, his contempt of the world, his readiness for
   the cross, to do or suffer according to the will of God. If this
   pattern be continually before us, it will put forth a transforming
   efficacy to change us into the same image. When we find our minds
   liable unto any disorders, cleaving inordinately unto the things of
   this world, moved with intemperate passions, vain and frothy in
   conversation, darkened or disturbed by the fumes of distempered lusts,
   let us call things to an account, and ask of ourselves whether this be
   the frame of mind that was in Christ Jesus. This, therefore, is an
   evidence that our affections are spiritually renewed, and that they
   have received some progress in an assimilation unto heavenly things, --
   namely, when the soul is delighted in making Christ their pattern in
   all things.

   Secondly, The rule of our affections in their utmost spiritual
   improvement is the Scripture. And two things are respected in them:--
   their internal actings; their exercise in outward ways and means,
   whereby they are expressed. Of them both the Scripture is the entire
   rule:--

   1. And with respect unto the former, it gives us one general law or
   rule, that is comprehensive of all others, -- namely, "That we love the
   Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength." The acting
   of all our affections towards God in the utmost degree of perfection is
   required of us; that in all instances we prefer and value him above all
   things; that we inseparably cleave unto him, and do nothing whatever at
   any time that is not influenced and directed by the love of God. This
   perfection, as we shall see immediately, is not attainable absolutely
   in this life; but it is proposed unto us as that which the excellency
   of God's nature requires, and which the faculties and powers of our
   nature were created for, and which we ought in all things to design and
   aim at. But the indispensable obligation of this rule is, that we
   should always be in a sincere endeavour to cleave unto God continually
   in all things, to prefer him above all, and delight in him as our
   chiefest good. When this frame and disposition is habitually fixed in
   our minds, it will declare and act itself in all instances of duties,
   on all occasions of trial, when other things put in for a predominant
   interest in our affections, as they do every day; and if it be not so
   with us, we shall be at a continual loss in all our ways. This is that
   which makes us lifeless and heartless in duties, careless in
   temptations or occasions of them, forgetful of God, when it is
   impossible we should be preserved from sin without a due remembrance of
   his holiness. In brief, the want of a predominant love unto God, kept
   in continual exercise, is the spring of all that unprofitable
   profession of religion that the world is filled withal.

   2. There are outward ways and duties whereby our spiritual affections
   are expressed. The rule of them also is the Scripture. The way marked
   out therein is the only channel wherein the stream of spiritual
   affections doth take its course unto God. The graces required therein
   are to act themselves by [them]; the duties it prescribes are those
   which they stir up and enliven; the religious worship it appoints is
   that wherein they have their exercise. Where this rule hath been
   neglected, men's religious affections have grown irregular, yea, wild
   and ungovernable. All the superstitions that the world is filled withal
   owe their original principally unto men's affections set at loose from
   the rule of the word. There is nothing so fond, absurd, and foolish,
   but they have imbondaged the souls of men unto, nothing so horrid and
   difficult but they have engaged them in. And having once taken unto
   themselves this liberty, the corrupt minds of men are a thousand times
   more satisfied than in the regular exercise of them according to the
   word of God. Hence they will rejoice in such penances as are not
   without their austerities; in such outward duties of devotion as are
   troublesome and chargeable; in every thing that hath a show of wisdom
   in will-worship, and humility, and neglect of the body. Hence will all
   their affections be more sensibly moved by images and pictures, and a
   melting devotion be more stirred up in them, than by all the motives
   and incentives which God proposeth unto them to draw their affections
   unto himself. Nothing is more extravagant than the affections of men,
   tinctured with some devotion, if they forsake the rule of the
   Scripture.

   Thirdly, There is considerable concerning them the measure of their
   attainments, or what, through due exercise and holy diligence, they may
   be raised unto. Now, this is not absolute perfection: "Not as though I
   had already attained, either were already perfect, but I follow after,"
   as the apostle speaks, Phil. iii. 12. But there is that attainable
   which those who pretend highly unto perfection seem to be strangers
   unto. And the state of our affections under a due exercise on heavenly
   things, and in their assimilation unto them, may be fixed on these
   three things:--

   1. An habitual suitableness unto spiritual things upon the proposal of
   them. The ways whereby spiritual things are proposed unto our minds are
   various. They are so directly in all ordinances of divine worship; --
   they are so indirectly and in just consequence by all the especial
   providences wherein we are concerned, by our own thoughts and stated
   meditations; -- they are so by the motions of the Holy Spirit, when he
   causeth us to "hear a word behind us saying, This is the way, walk ye
   in it;" by holy converse with others; by all sorts of occurrences. And
   as the ways of their proposal are various, so the times and seasons
   wherein a representation of them is made unto us are comprehensive of
   all, at least are not exclusive of any, times and seasons of our lives.
   Be the way of their proposal what it will, and whenever be the season
   of it, if our affections are duly improved by spiritual exercises, they
   are suited unto them and will be ready to give them entertainment.
   Hence, or for want hereof, on the other hand, are tergiversations and
   shiftings in duties, proneness to comply with diversions, all to keep
   off the mind from closing with and receiving of those spiritual things
   which it is not suited unto. Wherefore, as unto the solemn way of
   proposing spiritual things unto our minds which is in and by the
   ordinances of divine worship, when men have a prevalent loathness to
   engage in them, or when they are satisfied with an outward attendance
   on them, but not enabled unto a vigorous stirring up of the inward man
   unto a holy, affectionate converse with spiritual and heavenly things,
   it is because they are carnal. When men can receive the fiery darts of
   Satan in his temptations into their bosoms, and suffer them to abide
   there, yea, foster and cherish them in thoughts of the lusts that they
   kindle, but quickly quench the motions of the Spirit stirring them up
   unto the embracing of heavenly things, they are carnal, and carnally
   minded. When providences of concernment, in afflictions, trials,
   deliverances, do not engage the mind unto thoughts of spiritual things,
   and excite the affections unto the entertainment of them, men are
   carnal and earthly. When every lust, corruption, or passion, as anger,
   envy, displeasure, at this or that person or thing, can divert the mind
   from compliance with the proposal of spiritual things that is made unto
   it, we are carnal.

   It is otherwise when our affections are conformed unto things spiritual
   and heavenly. Upon every proposal of these, the mind finds a
   suitableness unto itself, like that which a well-disposed appetite
   finds unto savoury meat. As "the full soul loatheth an honey-comb," so
   a mind under the power of carnal affections hath an aversion unto all
   spiritual sweetness. But spiritualized affections desire them, have an
   appetite unto them, readily receive them on all occasions, as those
   which are natural unto them, as milk is unto new-born babes.

   2. Affections so disposed constantly find a gust, a pleasant taste, a
   relish, in spiritual things. They do in them "taste that the Lord is
   gracious," 1 Pet. ii. 3. To taste of God's goodness, is to have an
   experience of a savoury relish and sweetness in converse and communion
   with him. And persons whose affections are thus renewed and thus
   improved do taste a sweet savour in all spiritual things. Some of them,
   as a sense of the love of Christ, are sometimes as it were too hard for
   them, and overpower them, until they are "sick of love," and do
   "rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory." Neither is there any
   of them, however condited with afflictions or mortifications, but is
   sweet unto them, Prov. xxvii. 7. Every thing that is wholesome food,
   that is good nourishment, though it be but bitter herbs, is sweet to
   him that is hungry. And when by our affections we have raised up in us
   a spiritual appetite unto heavenly things, however any of them in their
   own nature or in their dispensation may be bitter to flesh and blood,
   -- as are all the doctrines of the cross, -- they are all sweet unto
   us, and we can taste how gracious the Lord is in them. When the soul is
   filled with earthly things, the love of this world, or when the
   appetite is lost by spiritual sickness, or vitiated and corrupted by
   any prevalent sin, heavenly things are unsavoury and sapless, or, as
   Job speaks, "like the white of an egg, wherein there is no taste."
   There may be in the dispensation of the word a taste or pleasing relish
   given unto the fancy, there may be so unto the notional understanding,
   when the affections find no complacency in the things themselves; but
   unto them who are spiritually minded unto the degree intended, they are
   all sweet, savoury, pleasant, -- the affections taste them immediately,
   as the palate doth meat.

   3. They are a just repository of all graces, and therein the treasury
   of the soul. There are graces of the Spirit whose formal direct
   residence is in the understanding and the will, as faith itself, and
   therein are all other graces radically comprised; they grow from that
   root. Howbeit, the most of them have their principal residence in the
   affections. In them are they preserved secure and ready for exercise on
   all occasions. And when they are duly spiritual, there is nothing that
   tends to their growth or improvement, to their cherishing or
   quickening, which they stand in need of continually, and which God hath
   made provision for in his word, but they readily receive it, lay it up,
   keep and preserve it. Hereby they come to be filled with grace, with
   all graces, -- for there is room in them for all the graces of the
   Spirit to inhabit, -- and do readily comply with the light and
   direction of faith unto their exercise. When faith discerns and
   determines that there is any thing to be done or suffered in a way of
   duty unto the glory of God, the affections thus disposed do not shut up
   or stifle the graces that are in them, but carefully offer them unto
   their proper exercise.

   These are some of those things which our affections, conformed unto
   heavenly things, will attain unto. And thus it is with affections
   spiritually renewed: by being fixed on things spiritual and heavenly,
   they are more and more conformed unto them, made like them, and become
   more spiritual and heavenly themselves.

   It is not thus with them whose affections have only an occasional
   change wrought upon them by the means before described, but are not
   spiritually renewed; yea, on the contrary, such persons do design to
   debase spiritual things, to bring down heavenly things into a
   conformity with their affections, which, however changed, are not
   spiritual, but carnal. To evince this we may observe, --

   1. Their affections are under the light and conduct of such notions in
   the mind and understanding as do not give a clear, distinct
   representation of them in their own nature unto them: for where they
   are not themselves spiritually renewed, there the mind itself is carnal
   and unrenewed; and such a mind "perceiveth not the things of God,
   neither can do so, because they are spiritually discerned." They cannot
   be discerned aright in their own beauty and glory, but in and by a
   spiritual, saving light, which the mind is devoid of. And where they
   are not thus represented, the affections cannot receive or cleave unto
   them as they ought, nor will ever be conformed unto them.

   2. Those notions in such persons are ofttimes variously influenced and
   corrupted by fancy and imagination. They are merely "puffed up by their
   fleshly minds;" that is, they are filled with vain, foolish, proud
   imaginations about spiritual things, as the apostle declares, Col. ii.
   18, 19. And the work of fancy, in a fleshly mind, is to raise up such
   images of spiritual things as may render them suitable unto natural,
   unrenewed affections.

   3. This, in the progress of it, produceth superstition, false worship,
   and idolatry; for they are all of them an attempt to represent
   spiritual things in a way suited unto carnal, unrenewed affections.
   Hence men suppose themselves to be excited by them unto love, joy,
   fear, delight in the things themselves, when they all respect that
   false representation of them whereby they are suited unto them as
   carnal. These have been the spring of all false worship and idolatry in
   the Christian world.

   1. The mind and affections have been changed and tinctured with
   devotion by some of the means we have before insisted on. Herein they
   will, one way or other, be exercised about spiritual things, and are
   ready to receive impressions from any thing that superstition can
   impose upon them.

   2. They are, by error and false information, set at liberty from the
   only rule of their actings and exercise; that is, the word of God. Men
   satisfied themselves, that so their affections were engaged about
   things spiritual and heavenly, it was no matter at all whether the way
   of their exercise was directed by the Scripture or no. Having thus lost
   their guide and their way, every "ignis fatuus," every wandering
   meteor, allures them to follow its conduct into foolish superstitions.
   Nothing almost is so ridiculous, nothing so horrid and difficult, that
   they will not embrace under the notion of things spiritual and
   heavenly.

   3. The carnal minds of men, having no proper, distinct apprehensions
   and notions of spiritual things in their own nature, do endeavour to
   represent them under such notions and images as may suit them unto
   their carnal, unrenewed affections; for it is implanted almost
   indelibly upon them, that the end of all knowledge of spiritual things
   is to propose them unto the embraces of the affections.

   It were easy to manifest that from these three corrupt springs arose
   that flood of idolatry and false worship which spread itself over the
   church of Rome, and with whose machinations the minds of men are yet
   too much replenished.

   4. Where it is not thus, yet carnal affections do variously debase
   spiritual things, to bring them into a conformity with themselves; and
   this may proceed so far, until men think wickedly that God is
   altogether like unto themselves. But I shall not insist on these things
   any farther.

   Lastly, Where affections are spiritually renewed, the person of Christ
   is the centre of them; but where they are changed only, they tend unto
   an end in self. Where the "new man" is put on, "Christ is all, and in
   all," Col. iii. 10, 11. He is the spring, by his Spirit, that gives
   them life, light, and being; and he is the ocean that receives all
   their streams. God, even the Father, presents not himself in his beauty
   and amiableness as the object of our affections, but as he is in
   Christ, acting his love in him, 1 John iv. 8, 9. And as unto all other
   spiritual things, renewed affections cleave unto them according as they
   derive from Christ and lead unto him; for he is unto them "all, and in
   all." It is he whom the souls of his saints do love for himself, for
   his own sake, and all other things of religion in and for him. The air
   is pleasant and useful, that without which we cannot live or breathe;
   but if the sun did not enlighten it and warm it with its beams, if it
   were always one perpetual night and cold, what refreshment could be
   received by it? Christ is the "Sun of Righteousness," and if his beams
   do not quicken, animate, and enlighten, the best, the most necessary
   duties of religion, nothing desirable would remain in them. This is the
   most certain character of affections spiritually renewed: They can rest
   in nothing but in Christ; they fix on nothing but what is amiable by a
   participation of his beauty; and in whatever he is, therein do they
   find complacency. It is otherwise with them whose affections may be
   changed but are not renewed. The truth is, -- and it may be made good
   by all sorts of instances, -- that Christ, in the mystery of his person
   and in the glory of his mediation, is the only thing that they dislike
   in religion. False representations of him by images and pictures they
   may embrace and delight in; false notions of his present glory,
   greatness, and power may affect them; a worship of their own devising
   they may give unto him, and please themselves in it; corrupt opinions
   concerning his office and grace may possess their minds, and they may
   contend for them: but those who are not spiritually renewed cannot love
   the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, yea, they have an inward, secret
   aversation from the mystery of his person and his grace. It is self
   which all their affections centre in, the ways whereof are too long
   here to be declared.

   This is the first thing that is required to render our affections in
   such a state and condition as that from and by them we may be
   spiritually minded, -- namely, that they themselves are spiritually and
   savingly renewed.

   The things that remain will admit of a speedy despatch, as I suppose.

Chapter XIX.

   [The true notion and consideration of spiritual and heavenly things.]

   II. The second thing required that we may be spiritually minded, as
   unto the interest of our affections therein, is, the object of them
   about which they are conversant and whereunto they do adhere. What this
   is materially, or what are the spiritual things which our affections
   are to be set upon, hath been declared already, under the consideration
   of the objects of our thoughts and meditations, for they are the same;
   yea, as hath been intimated, the fixing of our affections upon them is
   the spring and cause of our thoughts about them. But that which we
   shall now inquire into is, the true notion and consideration of
   spiritual and heavenly things, that which renders them the formal,
   proper object of spiritual affections, and is the reason of their
   adherence unto them; for, as was intimated before, men may have false
   notions of spiritual things, under which they may like them and embrace
   them with unrenewed affections. Wherefore we shall inquire into some of
   those considerations of heavenly things under which affections
   spiritually renewed do satisfactorily cleave unto them with delight and
   complacency.

   1. And the first is, that as they comprehend God in Christ, and all
   other things as deriving from him and tending unto him, they have an
   infinite beauty, goodness, and amiableness in them, which are
   powerfully attractive of spiritual affections, and which alone are able
   to fill them, to satisfy them, to give them rest and acquiescency. Love
   is the most ruling and prevalent affection in the whole soul; but it
   cannot be fixed on any object without an apprehension, true or false,
   of an amiableness and desirableness in it, from a goodness suitable
   unto all its desires.

   And our fear, so far as it is spiritual, hath divine goodness for its
   object, Hos. iii. 5. Unless this be that which draws our hearts unto
   God and the things of God, in all pretence of love unto him, men do but
   frame idols to themselves "according to their own understanding," as
   the prophet speaks, Hos. xiii. 2. Wherefore, that our affections may
   cleave unto spiritual things in a due manner, three things are
   required:--

   (1.) That we apprehend and do find a goodness, a beauty, and thence an
   amiableness and desirableness, in them, Zech. ix. 17. Many pretend to
   love God and spiritual things, but they know not why. Why they love
   other things they know well enough, but why they love God they cannot
   tell. Many are afraid of him, and suppose they ought to love him, and
   therefore pretend so to do, though indeed they know they do not; they
   do but flatter him with their lips, when their hearts are far from him.
   Some are much affected with the benefits and mercies they receive from
   him, and suppose that they love him on that account; but this love is
   no other but what the devil falsely charged Job withal, chap. i. 8-11.
   Some have delight in the outward modes and rites of divine worship,
   wherewith they satisfy themselves that they love God and spiritual
   things, when they only please their own imaginations and carnal minds
   Many have a traditional apprehension that they ought to love God, they
   know no reason why they should not, they know it will be ill for them
   if they do not; and these take it for granted that they do. How few are
   there who have that spiritual discerning and apprehension of the divine
   excellencies, that view of the excellency of the goodness and love of
   God in Christ, as thereby alone to be drawn after him, and to delight
   in him! yet is this the ground of all sincere, real love unto God. Two
   things are required that we may apprehend an amiable goodness in any
   thing, and cleave unto it with sincere affection:-- [1.] A real worth
   or excellency in itself; [2.] A suitableness therein unto our
   condition, state, and desires after rest and blessedness. The first of
   these is in God, from what he is in himself; the latter is from what he
   is unto us in Christ; -- from both he is the only suitable object unto
   our affections. Under this apprehension do we love God for himself, or
   for his own sake, but not exclusively unto our own advantage therein;
   for a desire of union and enjoyment, which is our only advantage, is
   inseparable from this love.

   It may be, some cannot say that a distinct apprehension of these things
   was the first foundation and cause of their love to God; yet are they
   satisfied that they do love him in sincerity, with all their souls. And
   I say it may be so. God sometimes casts the skirt of his own love over
   the heart of a poor sinner, and efficaciously draws it unto himself,
   without a distinct apprehension of these things, by a mere sense of the
   love it hath received. So Elijah passed by Elisha, and cast his mantle
   upon him, as a transient act; but there was such a communication of
   virtue thereby that he ran after him, and would not be deferred, though
   Elijah said, "Go back again; for what have I done to thee?" 1 Kings
   xix. 19, 20. When God hath so cast his love on any soul, it follows
   after him with all its affections. And whereas God may seem at some
   times to say, "Go back again; for what have I done unto thee?" its
   answer is, "Lord, whither shall I got I cannot leave thee; my heart is
   given up unto thee, and shall never be taken from thee."

   But I say unto such, and to all others, that if we would have
   refreshing evidences of our love unto God that it is sincere, if we
   would have it thrive and flourish, be fervent and constant, we are to
   exercise ourselves unto the contemplation of the divine goodness, and
   the suitableness of it unto our souls, in and by Jesus Christ. Nor can
   we cleave unto any spiritual thing whatever with sincere affection but
   under these notions of it:-- first, That it hath a real worth or
   excellency in itself; secondly, That it is suitable and desirable unto
   us. And it is to be bewailed to see how many walk at random in
   profession, that know neither what they do nor where they go.

   (2.) As we must see a goodness and profitableness in spiritual things
   absolutely, so as that we may fix our affections on them in a due
   manner, so we must see it comparatively, with respect unto all other
   things, which gives them a preference in our affections before and
   above them all. The trial of love lies in the prevailing degree, -- on
   more or less. If we love other things, father, mother, houses, lands,
   possessions, more than Christ, we do not love him at all. Nor is there
   any equality allowed in this matter, that we may equally love temporal
   and spiritual things. If we love not Christ more than all these things,
   we love him not at all. Wherefore, that our affections may cleave unto
   them in a due manner, we must see an excellency in things spiritual and
   heavenly, rendering them more desirable than all other things whatever.

   With what loving countenances do men look upon their temporal
   enjoyments! with what tenacious embraces do they cleave unto them! They
   see that in them which is amiable, which is desirable and suitable unto
   their affections. Let them pretend what they please, if they see not a
   greater goodness, that which is more amiable, more desirable, in
   spiritual things, they love them not in a due manner; it is temporal
   things that have the rule of their affections. One psalmist prefers
   "Jerusalem before his chief joy," Ps. cxxxvii. 6. Another affirms that
   "the law of God's mouth was better unto him than thousands of gold and
   silver," Ps. cxix. 72. "More to be desired are the statutes of the Lord
   than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the
   honeycomb," Ps. xix. 10. "For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the
   things that may be desired are not to be compared to it," Prov. viii.
   11. This is the only stable foundation of all divine affections. A
   spiritual view and judgment of a goodness, an excellency in them,
   incomparably above whatever is in the most desirable things of this
   world, are required thereunto. And if the affections of many pretending
   highly to them should come to be weighed in this balance, I fear they
   would be found light and wanting. However, it is the duty of them who
   would not be deceived in this matter, -- which is of eternal
   importance, -- to examine what is that goodness and excellency which is
   in spiritual things, which they desire in them, upon the account
   whereof they do sincerely value and esteem them above all things in
   this world whatever. And let not any deceive themselves with vain words
   and pretences. Whilst their esteem and valuation of present enjoyments
   doth evidently engage all their affections, their care, their
   diligence, their industry, so as that a man of a discerning spirit may
   even feel them turned into self; whilst they are cold, formal,
   negligent about spiritual things, -- we must say, "How dwelleth the
   love of God in them?" Much more when we see men not only giving up the
   whole of their time and strength, with the vigour of their spirits, but
   sacrificing their consciences also, unto the attaining of dignities,
   honours, preferments, wealth, and ease in the world, who know in their
   own hearts that they perform religious duties with respect unto
   temporal advantages, I cannot conceive how it is possible they should
   discern and approve of a goodness and excellency in spiritual things
   above all others.

   (3.) A due consideration is required hereunto, that all spiritual
   things do proceed from and are resolved into an infinite Fountain of
   goodness, so as that our affections may absolutely come unto rest and
   complacency, and find full assured satisfaction in them. It is
   otherwise as unto all temporal things. Men would very fain have them to
   be such as might give absolute rest and satisfaction unto all their
   affections; but they are every one of them so far from it that all of
   them together cannot compose their minds in rest and peace for one
   hour. They give sometimes a transport of affections, and seem for a
   season to have filled the whole soul, so as it hath no leisure to
   consider their emptiness and vanity: but a little composure of men's
   thoughts shows that they are but a diversion in a journey or labour;
   they are no rest. Hence are they called "broken cisterns, that can hold
   no water." Let a man prize them at the highest rate that it is possible
   for a rational creature to be seduced into the thoughts of, whereof
   there have been prodigious instances; let him possess them in
   abundance, beyond what ever any man enjoyed in this world or his own
   imagination could beforehand reach unto; let him be assured of the
   utmost peaceable continuance in the enjoyment of them that his and
   their natures are capable of, -- yet would he not dare to pretend that
   all his affections were filled and satisfied with them, that they
   afforded him perfect rest and peace. Should he do so, the working of
   his mind every day would convince him of his falsehood and his folly.

   But all spiritual things derive from and lead unto that which is
   infinite; which is therefore able to fill all our affections, and to
   give them full satisfaction with rest and peace. They all lead us to
   the Fountain of living waters, the eternal Spring of goodness and
   blessedness.

   I do not say that our affections do attain unto this full rest and
   satisfaction in this life; but what they come short of herein ariseth
   not from any defect in the things themselves to give this rest and
   satisfaction, as it is with the whole world, but from the weakness of
   our affections themselves, which are in part only renewed, and cannot
   take in the full measures of divine goodness, which in another world
   they will receive. But whilst we are here, the more we receive them in
   our minds and souls, the more firmly we adhere unto them, the nearer
   approaches we make unto our rest and centre.

   2. Spiritual things are to be considered as they are filled with divine
   wisdom. I speak not of God himself, whose essential wisdom is one of
   the most amiable excellencies of his holy nature, but of all the
   effects of his will and grace by Jesus Christ. All spiritual truths,
   all spiritual and heavenly things, whereby God reveals and communicates
   himself unto the souls of men, and all the ways and means of our
   approach unto him in faith and obedience through Christ Jesus, I now
   intend. All these are filled with divine wisdom. See 1 Cor. ii. 7; Eph.
   iii. 10, i. 8, 9. Now, wisdom in itself and in all the effects of it is
   attractive of rational affections. Most men are brutish in them and
   their actings, for the most part pouring them out on things fleshly,
   sensual, and carnal; but where they are at all reduced under the
   conduct of reason, nothing is so attractive of them, so suited unto
   them, which they delight in, as that which hath at least an appearance
   of wisdom. A wise and good man doth command the affections of others;
   unless it be their interest to hate and oppose him, as commonly it is.
   And where there is true wisdom in the conduct of civil affairs, sober
   men cannot but approve of it, like it, delight in it; and men of
   understanding do bewail the loss of it, since craft, falsehood,
   treachery, and all sorts of villany, have driven it out of the world.
   So is divine wisdom attractive of divine, gracious affections. The
   psalmist declares his admiration of and delight in the works of God,
   because he hath "made them all in wisdom," Ps. civ. 24. Those
   characters of divine wisdom which are upon them, which they are filled
   with, draw the souls of men into a delightful contemplation of them.
   But all the treasures, all the glory of this wisdom are laid up and
   laid forth in the great spiritual things of the gospel, in the mystery
   of God in Christ, and the dispensation of his grace and goodness unto
   us by him. The consideration hereof fills the souls of believers with
   holy admiration and delight, and thereon they cleave unto them with all
   their affections. When we see there is light in them, and all other
   things are in darkness, that wisdom is in them, in them alone, and all
   other things are filled with vanity and folly, then are our souls truly
   affected with them, and do rejoice in them with joy unspeakable and
   full of glory.

   Unto the most this wisdom of God is foolishness. It was so of old, as
   the apostle testifieth, 1 Cor. i. 23, 24; and so it continues yet to
   be. And therefore is the mystery of the gospel despised by them; they
   can see neither form nor comeliness in it for which it should be
   desired. Nor will ever any man have sincere spiritual affections unto
   spiritual things who hath not a spiritual view of the wisdom of God in
   them.

   This is that which attracts our souls by holy admiration unto
   unspeakable delight. And the reason why men do so generally decline
   from any love unto the gospel, and lose all satisfaction in the mystery
   of it, is because they are not able to discern that infinite wisdom
   which is the spring, life, and soul of it. When our minds are raised
   unto the admiration of this wisdom in divine revelations, then will our
   affections cleave unto the things that are revealed.

   3. The acting of our affections in their adherence unto spiritual
   things is perfective of our present state and condition. That which of
   all other things doth most debase the nature of man, wherein it makes
   the nearest approaches unto brutality, yea, whereby it becomes in some
   respects more vile than the nature of beasts, is the giving up of the
   affections unto things sensual, unclean, base, and unworthy of its more
   noble principles. Hence are men said to "debase themselves unto hell,"
   Isa. lvii. 9. And their affections do become vile, so as that their
   being under the power of them is an effect of revenging justice,
   punishing men for the worst of sins, Rom. i. 26. There is nothing more
   vile, nothing more contemptible, nothing more like to beasts in
   baseness and to hell in punishment, than is the condition of them who
   have enslaved their nature unto brutish, sensual affections. I say,
   vile affections, fixed on and cleaving unto sensual objects, do debase
   the nature of man, and do both corrupt and enslave all the more noble
   faculties of it; the very consciences and minds of men are defiled by
   them. If you see a man whose affections are set inordinately on any
   thing here below, it is easy to discern how he goes off from his native
   worth, and debaseth himself therein.

   But the fixing of spiritual affections on spiritual objects is
   perfective of our present state and condition; not that we can attain
   perfection by it, but that therein our souls are in a progress towards
   perfection. This may be granted. Look, how much vile affections, fixed
   on and furiously pursuing things carnal and sensual, do debase our
   nature beneath its rational constitution, and make it degenerate into
   bestiality; so much spiritual affections, fixed on and cleaving unto
   things spiritual and heavenly, do exalt our nature above its mere
   natural capacity, making an approach unto the state of angels and of
   just men made perfect. And as brutish affections, when they have the
   reins, as they say, on their necks, and are pursued with delight and
   greediness, do darken the mind, and disturb all the rational powers of
   the soul (for "whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart," as
   the prophet speaks, and wickedness altereth the understanding): so holy
   affections fixed on spiritual things do elevate, raise, and enlighten
   the mind with true wisdom and understanding; for the "fear of the Lord,
   that is wisdom, and to depart from iniquity, that is understanding.''
   And again, as the power of vile affections fills the soul and
   conscience with tumult, disorder, fear, and shame, where men are not
   utterly profligate, so as that the minds, thoughts, and consciences of
   persons under their power is a very hell for confusion and troubles: so
   spiritual affections, duly exercised on their proper objects, do
   preserve all things in order in the whole soul; they are life and
   peace. All things are quiet and secure in the mind; there is order and
   peace in the whole soul, in all its faculties and all their operations,
   whilst the affections are in a due prevailing manner fixed upon the
   things that are above. Hence many persons, after great turmoilings in
   the world, after they have endeavoured by all means to come to rest and
   satisfaction therein, have utterly renounced all concernment in earthly
   things, and betaken themselves unto the contemplation of things above,
   and that only. Many of them, I confess, were mistaken as to the
   practical part of their devotions, having various superstitions imposed
   on their minds by the craft of others; but they missed it not in the
   principle that tranquility of mind was attainable only in setting our
   affections on things above. James iv. 1, "From whence come wars and
   fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war
   in your members?" -- "Whence are all the disorders in your minds, your
   vexations and disquietments, your passions, breaking forth sometimes
   into unseemly brawlings? are they not from hence," (the question is put
   unto yourselves and your own consciences,) "namely, from your lusts, --
   that is, the disorderly affections that tumultuate in you? Do but
   search yourselves, and you will quickly see whence all your troubles
   and disquietments do arise. Your lusts, or corrupt and inordinate
   affections, do war in you, continually inclining you to things earthly
   or sensual." Hence many are best and most at quiet when they are in the
   world, worst when at home in their families; but never are they in such
   confusion as when they are forced to retire into themselves.

   The due exercise of our affections on heavenly things hath quite
   another tendency and effect. It so unites the mind unto them, it so
   bringeth them unto it, and gives them such a subsistence in it, as that
   all the powers and faculties of it are in a progress towards their
   perfection. See 2 Cor. vii. 1. True wisdom and understanding, with
   soundness of judgment in eternal things in the mind, holiness in the
   affections themselves, liberty in the will, power in the heart, and
   peace in the conscience, do in their measures all ensue hereon.
   Whatever tastes we may have of these things, whatever temporary
   experience we have of them, they will not flourish in us, they will not
   abide with us in any constancy, unless we are thus spiritually minded.

   4. In the future enjoyment of the present objects of our spiritual
   affections doth our eternal blessedness consist. All men who are
   convinced of a future eternal condition do desire, when they depart
   hence, to enter into blessedness and glory. Howbeit, what that
   blessedness is, even as unto the general nature of it, they know
   nothing at all; and if they did, they would not know how to desire it:
   for heaven or blessedness is nothing but the full enjoyment of what we
   are here to love and delight in above all, of that which is the object
   of our affections as spiritually renewed Herein have they neither
   interest nor concern. But this is that which giveth life unto the
   affections of believers; they know that in the enjoyment of God in
   Christ their eternal blessedness doth consist. How this is their
   happiness and glory, how it will give them an everlasting, overflowing
   satisfaction and rest, they understand in the first-fruits of it which
   they here receive. And this is the ultimate object of their affections
   in this world, and they go forth unto all other spiritual things in
   order hereunto. The more, therefore, their affections are fixed on
   them, the more they are kept up unto that due exercise, the nearer
   approaches they make unto this blessed state. When their minds are
   possessed with this persuasion, when it is confirmed in them by daily
   experience of that sweetness, rest, and satisfaction, which they find
   in cleaving unto God with fervent love and delight, in vain shall any
   other objects rise up in competition to draw them off unto themselves.
   The more we love God, the more like we are unto him, and the more near
   the enjoyment of him.

Chapter XX.

   [The application of the soul unto spiritual objects.]

   III. Having considered the nature of spiritual affections as renewed by
   grace, and those notions of their objects under which they cleave unto
   them, it remains only that we inquire into the way of the soul's
   application of itself unto those objects by its affections, which
   belongs also unto our being spiritually minded; and I shall give an
   account hereof in some few particulars, with brief observations on
   them:--

   1. It is required that our adherence unto all spiritual things with
   love and delight be firm and stable. The affections are the powers and
   instruments of the soul, whereby it makes application unto any thing
   without itself, and cleaves unto it. This is their nature and use with
   reference unto things spiritual. Transient thoughts of spiritual
   things, with vanishing desires, may rise out of present convictions, as
   they did with them who cried out unto our Saviour, "Lord, evermore give
   us this bread," and immediately left him. Such occasional thoughts and
   desires axe common unto all sorts of men, yea, the worst of them: "Let
   me die the death of the righteous, and let my end be like his!" Fading
   satisfaction, with joy and delight, do often befall men in their
   attendance on the word, who yet never come to have it rooted in their
   hearts.

   There are sundry things wanting unto the sincerity of these
   affections:--

   (1.) Those in whom they are never had a clear spiritual view of the
   things themselves in their own nature which they pretend to be affected
   withal.

   (2.) They have not a sincere love unto them and delight in them for
   their own sakes, but are only affected with some outward circumstances
   and concernments of them.

   (3.) They find not a suitableness in them unto the ruling principles of
   their minds. They do not practically, they cannot truly say, "The yoke
   of Christ is easy, and his burden is light; his commandments are not
   grievous;" or, with the psalmist, "O how love I thy law!"

   (4.) Their affections are transient, unstable, vanishing, as unto their
   exercise and operations. They are on and off; now pleased and anon
   displeased; earnest for a little while, and then cold and indifferent.
   Hence the things which they seem to affect have no transforming
   efficacy upon their souls; they dwell not in them in their power.

   But where our affections unto spiritual things are sincere, where they
   are the true, genuine application of the soul and adherence unto them,
   they are firm and stable; love and delight are kept up unto such a
   constant exercise as renders them immovable. This is that which we are
   exhorted unto, 1 Cor. xv. 58, "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
   steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
   forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
   Transient affections, with their occasional operations, deceive
   multitudes; ofttimes they are as pregnant in their actions as those
   that are most sincere; and many effects, in joys, in mournings, in
   complaints, they will produce, especially when excited by any outward
   affliction, sickness, and the like; -- but their goodness is like the
   early cloud or morning dew. Let none, therefore, please themselves with
   the operations of transient affections with respect unto spiritual
   things, be they never so urgent, or so pleasant, or so frequent in
   their returns; those that are sincere are at all times firm and stable.

   2. That the soul do find a spiritual relish and savour in the things
   which it so adheres unto. The affections are the palate of the soul,
   whereby it tastes of all things which it receiveth or refuseth, and it
   will not long cleave unto any thing which they find not a savour and
   relish in. Something was spoken before of that sweetness which is in
   spiritual things, and the taste of them consists in a gracious sense of
   their suitableness unto the affections, inclinations, and dispositions
   of the mind. Hence they have no relish unto men of carnal minds.
   Whoever, therefore, would know whether his affections do sincerely
   adhere unto spiritual things, let him examine what relish, what
   sweetness, what savour he findeth in them. When he is pleased with
   them, as the palate with suitable and proper food, when he finds that
   he receives nourishment by them in the inward man, then doth he adhere
   unto them in a due manner.

   This spiritual taste is the ground of all experience. It is not what we
   have heard or understood only, but what we have tried and tasted,
   whereof we have experience. This makes us long for what we have
   formerly enjoyed, and strengthens faith as unto what we pray for and
   expect.

   In every darkness, in every damp of spirit, under every apprehension of
   deadness, or the withdrawing of the sense of divine love, the soul
   knoweth what it wants and what it doth desire. "Oh!" saith such an one,
   "that it were now with me as in former days. I know he who then gave me
   such refreshing tastes of his own goodness, who made every thing of
   himself sweet and pleasant unto me, can renew this work of his grace
   towards me; he can give me a new spiritual appetite and relish, he can
   make all spiritual things savoury unto me again."

   As a man under a languishing sickness, or when he is chastened with
   strong pain, so as that his soul abhorreth bread and his daily meat,
   can remember what appetite he had, with what gust and relish he was
   wont to take in his food in the days of his health, which makes him to
   know that there is such a condition, and to desire a return unto it; so
   is it with a sin-sick soul. It can find no relish, no gust, no
   sweetness, in spiritual things; he finds no savour in the bread of the
   word, nor any refreshment in the ordinances of the gospel, which yet in
   themselves are daily meat, "a feast of fat things, and of wine well
   refined:" yet doth it remember former days, when all these things were
   sweet unto him; and if he have any spark of spiritual life yet
   remaining, it will stir him up to seek with all diligence after a
   recovery. How is it with you who are now under spiritual decays, who
   find no taste or relish in spiritual things, unto whom the word is not
   savoury, nor other ordinances powerful? Call to mind how it hath been
   with you in former days, and what ye found in these things: "If so be,"
   saith the apostle, "that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious." If
   you have not, it is to be feared that you have never yet had the least
   sincere love unto spiritual things; for where that is, it will give a
   spiritual relish of them. If you have, how is it you can give
   yourselves rest one moment without an endeavour after the healing of
   your backsliding?

   3. It is required that our affections be so set on spiritual things as
   to be a continual spring of spiritual thoughts and meditations. No man
   can be so forsaken of reason as to suppose that he hath any sincere
   affection for what he thinks little on or not at all, or that he can
   have a true affection for any thing which will not stir up and
   ingenerate in him continual thoughts about it. Let men try themselves
   as unto their relations, or their enjoyments, or the objects of their
   predominant lusts, and they will find how things are stated in their
   own minds. And, therefore, whereas all men pretend to love God, and
   Christ, and the ways of God, and yet know in their own hearts that they
   little think of them or meditate upon them, both their pretence and
   religion is vain. Where our affections are duly placed on heavenly
   things, so as that we are indeed spiritually minded, they will be a
   constant spring of spiritual thoughts and meditations. But this also
   hath been before spoken unto.

   4. When our affections are thus applied unto spiritual things, they
   will be prevalent and victorious against solicitations unto the
   contrary, or allurements to draw them off unto any other objects. The
   work of all our spiritual adversaries is to solicit and tempt our
   affections, to divert them from their proper object. There are some
   temptations of Satan that make an immediate impression on the mind and
   conscience. Such are his injection of diabolical, blasphemous thoughts
   concerning God, his being, nature, and will; and the distresses which
   he reduceth men unto in their consciences through darkness and
   misrepresentations of God and his goodness. But the high road and
   constant practice of all our spiritual adversaries, is by the
   solicitation of our affections unto objects that are in themselves, or
   in the degree of our affection towards them, evil and sinful. Of the
   first are all sensual pleasures of the flesh, as drunkenness,
   uncleanness, gluttony, chambering and wantonness, with all sorts of
   sensual pleasures. Of the latter is all our inordinate love unto self,
   our families, and the whole world, or the things of it. Unto this end
   every thing in the whole world that may make provision for lust is made
   use of. Herein consists the nature and efficacy of most of those
   temptations which we have to conflict withal. Solicitations they are of
   our affections, to draw them off from things spiritual and heavenly and
   to divert them unto other things. Hereby do our enemies endeavour to
   beguile us, as the serpent beguiled Eve, with fair and false
   representations of other beloveds, that our hearts be not preserved as
   a chaste virgin in all their affections for Christ.

   And it is almost incredible how apt we are to be beguiled by the
   specious pretences wherewith we are solicited.

   That our affections, in the degree treated about, -- suppose of love
   unto the world and the things of it, -- are lawful and allowable, is
   one of the sophisms and artifices wherewith many are deluded. Hereon,
   provided they run not out into scandalous excesses, they approve of
   themselves in such a worldly frame of mind, and acting according unto
   it, as renders them fruitless, useless, senseless, and is inconsistent
   with that prevailing adherence of affections unto spiritual things that
   ought to be in us. Others are deluded by a pretence that it is in one
   instance only they would be spared; it is but this or that object they
   would give out the embraces of the affections unto, in all other things
   they will be entire for God: the vanity of which pretence we have
   spoken unto before. Others are ruined by giving place unto their
   solicitations with respect unto any one affection whatever; as suppose
   it be that of fear. In times of danger for profession, multitudes have
   lost all their affection unto spiritual things through a fear of losing
   that which is temporal, as their lives, their liberties, their goods,
   and the like. When once Satan and the world have gotten, as it were,
   the mastery of this affection, or a prevalent interest in it, they will
   not fail to draw all others into a defection from Christ and the
   gospel. "He that loveth his life shall lose it."

   Wherefore, it is no ordinary nor easy thing to preserve our affections
   pure, entire, and steady, in their vigorous adherence unto spiritual
   things, against all these solicitations. Watchfulness, prayer, faith in
   exercise, and a daily examination of ourselves, are required hereunto.
   For want of a due attendance unto these things, and that with respect
   unto this end, -- namely, the preservation of our spiritual affections
   in their integrity, -- many, even before they are aware, die away as to
   all power and vigour of spiritual life.

   5. Affections thus fixed upon things spiritual and heavenly will give
   great relief against the remainders of that vanity of mind which
   believers themselves are ofttimes perplexed withal; yea, I do not know
   any thing that is a greater burden unto them, nor which they more groan
   for deliverance from. The instability of the mind, its readiness to
   receive impressions from things vain and useless, the irregularity of
   their thoughts, are a continual burden unto many. Nothing can give the
   soul any relief herein, nothing can give bounds unto the endless
   variety of foolish imaginations, nothing can dry up the springs from
   whence they arise, or render the soil wherein they grow barren as unto
   their production and maintenance, but only the growth of spiritual
   affections, with their continual vigorous actings on heavenly things;
   for hereby the heart and mind will be so united unto them (that which
   the psalmist prays for, Ps. lxxxvi. 11), as that they will not be ready
   to depart from them, and give entertainment unto vain, empty, foolish
   imaginations. Thoughts of other things, greater and better than what
   this world can contain, will be continually arising in the mind, not to
   be laid aside by any solicitations of vanity: for he that is wise
   cannot but know and consider that the spiritual things which it
   exerciseth its thoughts about have substance in them, are durable,
   profitable, always the same; that the advantage, peace, rest, riches,
   and reward of the soul, lieth in them; but other imaginations, which
   the foolish mind is apt to give entertainment unto, are vain, empty,
   fruitless, and such as end in shame and trouble.

   Again; the vanity of the mind in an indulgence unto foolish
   imaginations ariseth from, or is animated and increased by, that gust
   and relish which it finds in earthly things and enjoyment of them,
   whether lawful or unlawful. Hence on all occasions, yea, in holy
   duties, it will be ready to turn aside and take a taste of them, and
   sometimes to take up with them: like a tippling traveller, who, though
   he be engaged in a journey on the most earnest occasion, yet he cannot
   but be bibbing here and there as he passes by, and it may be, at
   length, before he comes to his journey's end, lodgeth himself in a
   nasty ale-house. When men are engaged in important duties, yet if they
   always carry about them a strong gust and relish of earthly things,
   they will ever and anon in their thoughts divert unto them, either as
   unto such real objects as they are accustomed unto, or as unto what
   present circumstances do administer unto corrupt affections, or as to
   what they fancy and create in their own minds; and sometimes, it may
   be, after they have made them a few short visits, they take up with
   them, and lose wholly the work they were engaged in. Nothing, as was
   said, will give relief herein but the vigorous and constant exercise of
   our affections on heavenly things; for this will insensibly take off
   that gust and relish which the mind hath found in things present,
   earthly, and sensual, and make them as a sapless thing unto the whole
   soul They will so place the cross of Christ, in particular, on the
   heart as that the world shall be crucified unto it, losing all that
   brightness, beauty, and savour, which it made use of to solicit our
   minds unto thoughts and desires about it.

   Moreover, this frame of spirit alone will keep us on our watch against
   all those ways and means whereby the vanity of the mind is excited and
   maintained. Such are the wandering and roving of the outward senses.
   The senses, especially that of the eye, are ready to become purveyors
   to make provision for the vanity and lusts of the mind. Hence the
   psalmist prays, "Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity." If the
   eyes rove after vain objects the mind will ruminate upon them. And
   another affirms that he had "made a covenant with his eyes," to
   preserve them from fixing on such objects as might solicit lust or
   corrupt affections. And it were a useful labour, would this place admit
   of it, to discover the ready serviceableness of the outward senses and
   members of the body unto sin and folly, if not watched against, Rom.
   vi. 13, 19. Of the same nature is the incessant working of the fancy
   and imagination, which of itself is evil continually and all the day
   long. This is the food of a vain mind, and the vehicle or means of
   conveyance for all temptations from Satan and the world. Besides,
   sundry occasions of life and conversation are usually turned or abused
   unto the same end, exciting and exercising of the vanity of the mind.

   Wherever our affections are fixed on spiritual things, our mind will
   constantly be under a warning or charge to keep diligent watch against
   all those things whereby that vanity which it so abhorreth, which it is
   so burdened withal, is maintained and excited. Nor without this
   prevalency in the mind will ever a work of mortification be carried on
   in the soul, Col. iii. 2, 4, 5.

Chapter XXI.

   [Spiritual mindedness life and peace.]

   Having declared wherein this duty of being "spiritually minded" doth
   consist, that which remains, in compliance with the text from whence
   the whole is educed, is to manifest how it is "life and peace," which
   is affirmed by the apostle. This shall be done with all brevity, as
   having passed through that which was principally designed.

   And two things are we to inquire into:-- I. What is meant by "life and
   peace." II. In what sense to be "spiritually minded" is both of them.

   I. 1. That spiritual life whereof we are made partakers in this world
   is threefold, or there are three gospel privileges or graces so
   expressed:--

   (1.) There is the life of justification. Therein the just by faith do
   live, as freed from the condemnatory sentence of the law. So "the
   righteousness of one cometh" on all that believe "unto justification of
   life," Rom. v. 18. It gives unto believers a right and title to life;
   for "they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of
   righteousness shall reign in life by one, Christ Jesus," verse 17. This
   is not the life here intended, for this life depends solely on the
   sovereign grace of God by Jesus Christ, and the imputation of his
   righteousness unto us, unto pardon, the right to life and salvation.

   (2.) There is a life of sanctification. As life in the foregoing sense
   is opposed unto death spiritual as unto the guilt of it and the
   condemnatory sentence of death wherewith it was accompanied, so in this
   it is opposed unto it as unto its internal power on and efficacy in the
   soul, to keep it under an impotency unto all acts of spiritual life,
   yea, an enmity against them. This is that life wherewith we are
   "quickened" with Christ Jesus, when before we were "dead in trespasses
   and sins," Eph. ii. 1-5. Of this life the apostle treats directly in
   this place [Rom. viii.]; for having in the first four verses of the
   chapter declared the life of justification in the nature and causes of
   it, in the following he treats of death spiritual in sin, with the life
   of sanctification, whereby we are freed from it.

   And to be spiritually minded is this life in a double sense:--

   [1.] In that it is the principal effect and fruit of that life. The
   life itself consists in the infusion and communication of a principle
   of life, -- that is, of faith and obedience, -- into all the faculties
   and powers of our soul, enabling us to live unto God. To be spiritually
   minded, which is a grace whereunto many duties do concur, and that not
   only as to the actings of all grace in them, but as unto the degree of
   their exercise, cannot be this life formally; but it is that wherein
   the power of this principle of life doth in the first and chiefest
   place put forth itself. All actings of grace, all duties of obedience,
   internal and external, do proceed from this spring and fountain.
   Nothing of that kind is acceptable unto God but what is influenced by
   it and is an effect of it. But it principally puts forth its virtue and
   efficacy in rendering our minds spiritual; which if it effect not, it
   works not at all, -- that is, we are utterly destitute of it. The next
   and immediate work of the principle of life in our sanctification is to
   renew the mind, to make it spiritual, and thereon gradually to carry it
   on unto that degree which is here called being spiritually minded.

   [2.] It is the proper adjunct and evidence of it. Would any one know
   whether he be spiritually alive unto God with the life of
   sanctification and holiness? The communication of it unto him being by
   an almighty act of creating power, Eph. ii. 10, it is not easily
   discernible, so as to help us to make a right judgment of it from its
   essence or form; but where things are themselves indiscernible, we may
   know them from their proper and inseparable adjuncts, which are
   therefore called by the names of the essence or the form itself. Such
   is this being spiritually minded with respect unto the life of
   sanctification; it is an inseparable property and adjunct of it,
   whereby it infallibly evidenceth itself unto them in whom it is, In
   these two respects it is the life of sanctification.

   (3.) "Life" is taken for the comforts and refreshments of life. So
   speaks the apostle, 1 Thess. iii. 8, "Now we live, if ye stand fast in
   the Lord;" -- " Now our life will do us good; we have the comforts, the
   refreshments, and the joys of it." "Non est vivere, sed valere vita."
   The comforts and satisfactions of life are more life than life itself.
   It is "life;" that is, that which makes life to be so, bringing in that
   satisfaction, those refreshments unto it, which make it pleasant and
   desirable. And I do suppose this is that which is principally intended
   in the words of the apostle. It is "life," a cheerful joyous life, a
   life worth the living. In explication and confirmation whereof it is
   added that it is "peace" also.

   2. "Peace" is twofold:-- (1.) General and absolute; that is, peace with
   God through Jesus Christ, which is celebrated in the Scripture, and
   which is the only original spring and fountain of all consolation unto
   believers, -- that which virtually contains in it every thing that is
   good, useful, or desirable unto them. But it is not here precisely
   intended. It is not so as to the immediate ground and cause of it,
   which is our justification, not our sanctification: Rom. v. 1, "Being
   justified by faith, we have peace with God." So Christ alone is "our
   peace," as he who hath "made peace through the blood of his cross,"
   Eph. ii. 14, 15, Col. i. 20. Hereof our being spiritually minded is no
   way the cause or reason; only it is an evidence and pledge of it, as we
   shall see. [Nor is it so] as unto the formal nature of it. Peace with
   God through the blood of Christ is one thing, and peace in our minds
   through a holy frame in them is another. The former is communicated
   unto us by an immediate act of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, Rom. v.
   5; the latter is an effect on our minds, begun and gradually carried on
   by the duties we have before at large declared. The immediate actings
   of the Holy Spirit, in sealing us, witnessing unto our adoption, and
   being an earnest of glory, are required unto the former; our own
   sedulity and diligence in duties, and in the exercise of all grace, are
   required unto the latter.

   (2.) "Peace" is taken for a peculiar fruit of the Spirit, consisting in
   a gracious quietness and composure of mind in the midst of
   difficulties, temptations, troubles, and such other things as are apt
   to fill us with fears, despondencies, and disquietments. This is that
   which keeps the soul in its own power, free from transports by fears or
   passions, on all the abiding grounds of gospel consolation; for
   although this be a peculiar especial grace, yet it is that which is
   influenced and kept alive by the consideration of all the love of God
   in Christ, and all the fruits of it.

   And whereas "peace" includes, in the first notion of it, an inward
   freedom from oppositions and troubles, which those in whom it is are
   outwardly exposed unto, there are two things from which we are secured
   by this peace, which is an effect of being spiritually minded:--

   [1.] The first is offences. There is nothing of whose danger we are
   more warned in the gospel than of offences. "Woe to the world," saith
   the Saviour, "because of offences!" All ages, all times and seasons,
   are filled with them, and they prove pernicious and destructive to the
   souls of many. Such are the scandalous divisions that are among
   Christians. The endless differences of opinions and diversity of
   practices in religion and the worship of God; the falls and sins of
   professors, the fearful end of some of them; the reproaches that are
   cast on all that engage into any peculiar way of holiness and
   strictness of life; with other things of the like nature, -- whereby
   the souls of innumerable persons are disquieted, subverted, or
   infected, -- are to be reckoned unto this head. Against any hurtful or
   noxious influence on our minds from these things, against
   disquietments, dejections of spirit, and disconsolations, are we
   secured by this peace. So the psalmist assures us: Ps. cxix. 165,
   "Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend
   them." The law, or the word of God, is the only way of the revelation
   of God and his will unto us, and the only outward way and rule of our
   converse and communion with him. Wherefore, to love the law is the
   principal part of our being heavenly minded, yea, virtually that which
   comprehends the whole. To such as do so, nothing, none of those things
   before mentioned, nor any other of the like nature, shall be an
   offence, a stumbling-block, or cause of falling into sin. And the
   reason is, because they have such an experience in themselves of the
   truth, power, efficacy, and holiness, of the gospel, as that the
   miscarriages of men under a profession of it shall never be unto them
   an occasion of falling, or being offended at Christ. And I look upon it
   as a sign of a very evil frame of heart, when men are concerned in the
   miscarriages of some that have made profession, whereby they are, it
   may be, damaged in their outward concerns, so as that they are
   surprised into reflections on that religion which they profess,
   professing the same themselves.

   [2.] The second is afflictions, persecutions, and sufferings of all
   sorts. It is known by all (it were well if it were not so well known)
   what disquietments, dejections, and disconsolations, these things are
   apt to fill the minds of men withal; what fears, troubles, sorrows,
   they reflect upon them. Against all these effects of them, this peace
   intended gives us security. It makes us to preserve a peaceable, yea, a
   joyous life in our conflict with them. See John xvi. 33.

   Both these, as here joined together, "life and peace," do comprise a
   holy frame of heart and mind, wherein the souls of believers do find
   rest, quietness, refreshment, and satisfaction in God, in the midst of
   temptations, afflictions, offences, and sufferings. It is the soul's
   composure of itself in God, in his love in Christ Jesus, so as not
   greatly to be put out of order, or to be cast down with any thing that
   may befall it, but affords men cheerfulness and satisfaction in
   themselves, though they walk sometimes in the valley of the shadow of
   death. Such persons have that in them, abiding with them, which will
   give them life and peace under all occurrences.

   II. Our next inquiry is, how this "spiritual mindedness" is "life and
   peace," or what it contributes unto them, how it produceth the frame of
   heart and mind so expressed. And this it doth several ways:--

   1. It is the only means on our part of retaining a sense of divine
   love. The love of God, in a gracious sense of it, as shed abroad in our
   hearts by the Holy Ghost, is the first and only foundation of all
   durable comforts, such as will support and refresh us under all
   oppositions and distresses, -- that is, of life and peace in our souls,
   in any condition. This God communicates by an act of sovereign grace,
   for the most part without any preparation for it in ourselves: "He
   createth the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace." But although divine love
   be in itself unchangeable and always the same, yet this sense of it may
   be lost, as it was in David, when he prayed that God would "restore
   unto him the joy of his salvation," Ps. li. 12; and so many others have
   found it by woful experience. To insist upon all that is required on
   our part that we may retain a gracious, refreshing sense of divine
   love, after it is once granted unto us, belongs not unto my present
   purpose; but this I say, there is not any thing wherein we are more
   concerned to be careful and diligent in than as unto what belongs to
   that end. For men who, by a mere act of sovereign grace, have tasted
   herein of the goodness of God, who have had the consolation and joys of
   it, to be negligent in the keeping and preserving it in their souls, is
   a provocation that they will at one time or other be sensible of. There
   is nothing doth more grieve the Holy Spirit than to have his especial
   work, whereby he seals us unto the day of redemption, neglected or
   despised; and it argues a mighty prevalency of some corruption or
   temptation that shall cause men willingly and by their own sloth to
   forfeit so inestimable a grace, mercy, and privilege; and it is that
   which there are but few of us who have not reason to bewail our folly
   in. Every intimation of divine love is an inestimable jewel, which, if
   safely treasured up in our hearts, adds unto our spiritual riches; and
   being lost will at one time or another affect us with sorrow.

   And I am afraid that many of us are very negligent herein, unto the
   great prejudice of our souls and spiritual state. Many of such
   intimations are given us by the Holy Ghost through the word, which we
   take little notice of. Either we know not the voice of Christ in them,
   or do not hearken unto him in a due manner, or refuse a compliance with
   him, when we cannot but know that he speaks unto us. See Cant. v. 2, 3.
   Or if we receive any impressions of a gracious sense of divine love in
   them, we quickly lose them, not knowing how much the life of our souls
   is concerned therein, and what use of them we may have in our following
   temptations, trials, and duties.

   Now, the great means of retaining a sense of the love of God, which is
   the only spring of life and peace unto our souls, is this grace and
   duty of being spiritually minded. This is evident from the very nature
   of the duty; for, --

   (1.) It is the soul's preserving of itself in a frame meet to receive
   and retain this sense of God's love. What other way can there be on our
   part, but that our minds, which are so to receive it and retain it, be
   spiritual and heavenly, always prepared for that holy converse and
   communion with himself which he is pleased to grant us through Jesus
   Christ. And, --

   (2.) It will fix our thoughts and affections upon the grace and love of
   God, in communicating such an inestimable mercy unto us as is a sense
   of his love; which is the only means for the preservation of a relish
   of it in our hearts. He who is in this frame of mind will remember,
   call over, and ruminate upon, all such gracious pledges of divine
   favour, as David is often remembering and calling over what he received
   in such places as in the "land of the Hermonites and at the hill
   Mizar," Ps. xlii.. This is the great way whereby this treasure may be
   preserved.

   (3.) A person so minded, and he alone, will have a due valuation of
   such intimations and pledges of divine love. Those who are full of
   other things, whose affections cleave unto them, do never esteem
   heavenly mercies and privileges as they ought. "The full soul loatheth
   an honey-comb." And God is well pleased when a high valuation is put
   upon his kindness, as he is greatly provoked by the contrary frame;
   which, indeed, nothing but infinite patience could bear withal. It is a
   high provocation of God, when men are regardless of and unthankful for
   outward, temporal mercies, -- when they receive them and use them as if
   they were their own, that they were lords of them, at least that they
   are due unto them. Much more is he provoked with our regardlessness of
   the least of those mercies which are the peculiar purchase of the blood
   of his Son, and the effects of his eternal love and grace. He alone who
   is spiritually minded valueth, prizeth, and lays up these inestimable
   jewels in a due manner.

   (4.) Such persons only know how to use and improve all communications
   of a sense of divine love. These things are not granted unto us to lie
   by us without any use of them. They are gracious provisions wherewith
   we are furnished to enable us unto all other duties, conflicts, and
   trials. On all occasions are they to be called over for our spiritual
   relief and encouragement. Hereby are they safely retained: for in the
   due improvement of them they grow more bright in our minds every day,
   and are ready for use; in which posture they are safely preserved. But
   these things will yet be farther manifest in the instances that ensue.

   2. This frame of mind casts out all principles and causes of trouble
   and disquietment, which are inconsistent with life and peace. There are
   in us by nature principles of contrariety and opposition unto spiritual
   life and peace, with sundry things whose abode and prevalency in us is
   inconsistent with them. I shall give only one or two instances
   hereof:--

   (1.) It will cast out all "filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness"
   from our minds. Without this we can receive no benefit by the means of
   grace, nor perform any duty in a right manner, James i. 27. This is
   that which stands in direct, immediate opposition and contrariety unto
   our being spiritually minded, so as they can have no consistency in the
   same person; and they expel one another like heat and cold. And where
   there is this "filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness," there is
   neither life nor peace. Unclean lusts of the flesh or of the spirit,
   working, tumultuating, acting themselves in the minds of men, will not
   suffer either the life of holiness to flourish in them or any solid
   peace to abide with them. The soul is weakened by them as unto all
   spiritual actings, and made like "the troubled sea, that cannot rest,
   whose waters cast up mire and dirt." Where they are absolutely
   predominant, there is a hell within of darkness, confusion, and enmity
   against God, preparing men for a hell of punishment without unto
   eternity. And according as they remain or have any prevalency in us, so
   are spiritual life and peace impaired and obstructed by them. Now, the
   very nature of this grace and its universal exercise is suited to the
   casting out of all the relics of this "filthiness and superfluity of
   naughtiness." It brings in a principle into the mind directly contrary
   unto that from whence they do proceed. All the actings of it which we
   have described lie in direct tendency unto the extirpation of these
   causes of filthiness which ruin life and peace; nor will they by any
   other way be cast out. If the mind be not spiritual, it will be carnal;
   if it mind not things above, it will fix itself inordinately on things
   below.

   (2.) That disorder which is by nature in the affections and passions of
   the mind, which is directly opposite unto spiritual life and peace, is
   cast out or cured hereby. It is a blessed promise of the times of the
   new testament, of the kingdom and rule of Christ, that, through the
   efficacy of gospel grace, "the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the
   leopard shall lie down with the kid," Isa. xi. 6. Persons of the most
   intemperate and outrageous passions shall be made meek and lowly. Where
   this is not in some measure effected, according unto the degrees of the
   prevalency of such passions in us, we have not been made partakers of
   evangelical grace. It were an easy task to demonstrate how the disorder
   of our affections and passions is destructive of spiritual life and
   peace. The contrariety that is in them, and contradiction unto one
   another, their violence, impetuousness, and restlessness, their
   readiness to receive and take in provocations on all occasions, and
   frequently on none at all but what imagination presents unto them, are
   sufficient evidences hereof. Can we think that life and peace do
   inhabit that soul wherein anger, wrath, envy, excess in love unto
   earthly things, do dwell, and on all occasions exert themselves? there
   where there is a continual tumult, fighting, and rebellion, as there is
   where the passions of the mind are not under the conduct of reason or
   of grace?

   The nature and principal effect of this spiritual mindedness is, to
   bring all the affections and passions of our minds into that holy order
   wherein they were created. This was that uprightness wherein God made
   us, -- namely, the whole blessed order of all the powers, faculties,
   and affections of our souls, in all their operations, in order unto our
   living unto God. And this is restored unto us by this grace, this duty
   of being spiritually minded. And wherein it falls short of that
   perfection which we had originally (for the remainders of that disorder
   which befell us by sin will still in part continue), it is recompensed
   by the actings of that new principle of gospel grace which is exercised
   in it; for every act of our affections towards God in the power of
   grace exceeds, and is of another nature, above that we could do or
   attain unto in the state of nature uncorrupted. Hereby are life and
   peace brought into our souls, and preserved in them.

   3. It is that whereby our hearts and minds are taken off from the
   world, and all inordinate love thereunto. Where this is in a prevalent
   degree, there is neither life nor peace; and every excess in it both
   weakens spiritual life and disturbs, yea, destroys, all solid spiritual
   peace. I have occasionally spoken unto it before, as also of the way
   whereby our minding of the things that are above in a due manner doth
   deliver and preserve our souls from the snares of it. And if we
   diligently examine ourselves, we shall find that, in our inordinate
   affections and cleaving unto these things, the principal causes why we
   thrive no more in the power of spiritual life, and whence we meet with
   so many disquietments and dejections of spirit, unto the disturbance of
   our peace and rest in God, are from hence; for there is no grace which
   is not impaired by it in its nature, or not obstructed by it in its
   exercise. Wherefore, "to be spiritually minded is life and peace,"
   because it subdues and expels that inordinate love unto present things
   which is destructive of them both and inconsistent with them.

   4. It preserves the mind in a due and holy frame in the performance of
   all other duties. This also is indispensably required unto the
   preservation of life and peace, especially unto the improvement of
   them. They will not abide, much less thrive and flourish, in any
   persons who are negligent in holy duties, or do not perform them in a
   due manner. And there are four things which impede or hinder us from
   such an attendance unto holy duties as may be advantageous unto our
   souls, against all which we have relief by being spiritually minded:--
   Distractions; Despondencies; Weariness; Unreadiness of grace for
   exercise.

   (1.) Distraction of mind and thoughts hath this evil effect, which many
   complain of, but few take the right way of deliverance from; for this
   evil will not be cured by attendance unto any particular directions,
   without a change of the whole frame of our minds. Nothing can give us
   relief herein but a prevalent delight in being exercised about things
   spiritual and heavenly. For hence arise all our distractions; the want
   of fixing our minds on spiritual things with delight makes them
   obnoxious to be diverted from them on all occasions, yea, to seek
   occasions for such diversions, It is this frame alone, -- namely, of
   spiritual mindedness, -- that will give us this delight; for hereby the
   soul is transformed into the likeness of spiritual thing, so as that
   they are suited unto it and pleasant unto our affections. The mind and
   the things themselves are thereby so fitted unto each other that on
   every occasion they are ready for mutual embraces, and not easily drawn
   off by any cause or means of the distractions so complained of; yea,
   they will all be prevented hereby.

   (2.) Despondencies in duties arise from the frequent incursions of the
   guilt of sin. The remembrance hereof frequently solicits the minds of
   persons in their first entrances into duty, unless they are under
   especial actings of grace, stirring them up unto earnestness and
   fervency in what they undertake. At other seasons it renders men
   lifeless and heartless, so as that they know not whether they had best
   pray or no, when duty and opportunity call them thereunto. To be
   spiritually minded, we have manifested in many instances, is the great
   preservative against these disheartening incursions of sin. It is the
   soul's watch and guard against them, whencesoever they arise or
   proceed. No lust or corruption can be prevalent in a spiritual mind;
   and this is the principal cause of such incursions of sin as affect the
   soul with a disheartening sense of guilt. No affections can abide in
   any sinful disorder where the mind is so affected; this also gives sin
   an entrance unto a distracting sense of guilt. But the sole cure hereof
   lies in this grace and duty. The like may be said of all other ways,
   means, and occasions of such incursions of sin.

   (3.) Weariness in, and of, spiritual duties abates their tendency unto
   the improvement of life and peace in us. This evil ariseth from the
   same cause with that of distraction before mentioned; and it is
   ofttimes increased by the weakness and indispositions of the flesh, or
   of the outward man. Sometimes the spirit is willing, but through the
   weakness of the flesh it is disappointed. The principal cure hereof
   lies in that delight which spiritual mindedness gives unto the soul in
   spiritual things; for where there is a constant delight in any thing,
   there will be no weariness, at least not such as shall hinder any one
   from cleaving firmly unto the things wherein he doth delight. Whilst,
   therefore, we are exercised in a delight in spiritual things, weariness
   cannot prevalently assault the mind. And it is the only relief against
   that weariness which proceeds from the indispositions of the outward
   man; for as it will preserve the mind from attending too much unto
   their solicitations, crying, "Spare thyself," by filling and possessing
   the thoughts with other things, so it will offer a holy violence unto
   the complaints of the flesh, silencing them with a sense of and delight
   in holy duties.

   (4.) The unreadiness of grace for its due and proper exercise is
   another thing which defeats us of the benefit of holy duties. The
   seasons of them are come, sense of duty carries men unto an attendance
   unto them and the performance of them; but when they should enter upon
   them, those graces of faith, love, fear, and delight, wherein the soul
   and being of them do consist, are out of the way, unready for a due
   exercise, so as that men take up and satisfy themselves with the mere
   outward performance of them. The heart and mind have been taken up with
   other things; due preparation hath been wanting; men come unto them
   with reeking thoughts of earthly occasions; and it is no easy matter
   in, or immediately out of, such a frame, to stir up grace unto a due
   exercise. But herein lieth the very life of being spiritually minded:
   The nature of it consists in the keeping and preserving all grace in a
   readiness for its exercise as our occasions require. And this is an
   effectual way whereby this grace comes to be "life and peace;" for they
   cannot be attained, they cannot be preserved, without such a constancy
   and spirituality in all holy duties as we shall never arrive at unless
   we are spiritually minded.

   Lastly, This frame of mind brings the soul unto and keeps it at its
   nearest approaches unto heaven and blessedness, wherein lie the eternal
   springs of life and peace. According unto the degrees of this grace in
   us, such are those of our approaches unto God. Nearness unto him gives
   us our initial conformity unto him, by the renovation of his image in
   us, as our presence with him will give us perfection therein; for when
   we see him, we shall be like unto him. He therefore alone, as he is in
   Christ, being the fountain of life and peace, by our drawing nigh unto
   him and by our likeness of him will they thrive and flourish in our
   souls.
